I was working as a cashier in a big company when I was in Saudi Arabia for three
 years and a half. However, it was very good experience to work in that job. You should to do a lot of things and follow the instruction and rules that the company follow it . For example, they didn't accept the checks for the soling parts and it should be certified checks from the bank or cash only. Also you have to be their on time every day because some customers were coming early. In the other hand you should take care of your money and keep it always in save box also you shouldn't leave your place with out telling them where are going to. You should count your money as mach as you can when you are free to check if there is any money missing. You shouldn't use that money for your personal at all. All in all every day you may to do the final daily final repot for your boss and show him how much daily the company had soling. You should to mention and explain how much you receive as checks and how much as cash.
