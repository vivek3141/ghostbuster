Descriptive paragraph 



 Today, I am going to describe one of my classmates in ELI, named Emily ANON_NAME_0. The reason I choose her to be this topical because she is the nosiest student in ELI and has special physiology appearance. Let me give you a sample to help you know who Emily is. As you need a break before you are going to next class; suddenly you will hear a clearly and rasping voice from the end of the hill to calling your name. Don't confuse. That must be Emily. Her baby is well-rounded, her eyes is always smiling also she has full-lipped. Because of her special, she becomes the one of my best friend in ELI.
