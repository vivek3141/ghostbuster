My favorite restaurant is RURU. RURU have Chinese, Japanese, Koran foods. I like Chinese food because I usually eat sweet and sour chicken. It's delicious to me because I like sweet food. And I like lamen, too. This is Japanese noodles, but RURU's lamen look like Chinese noodles. Also, Korean food seem Chinese food. Because I think RURU's order is Chinese. Also, Korean food seems Chinese food.
