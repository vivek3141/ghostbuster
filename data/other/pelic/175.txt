Hi, I'm ANON_NAME_0. I've written this page to introduce myself. I grew up in Qatif, Saudi Arabia. I've studied in King ANON_NAME_1 University of Petroleum and Minerals for three years. Lately, I've moved to the United States to complete my bachelor degree. I've been in Pittsburgh since April 2006. I've been studying in the ELI for five months. Last semester, I got good grades in my classes. I've not been contact with my girlfriend since last May. I've always been playing table tines. I hope that I gave good introduction about myself. Thank you!
