Every one like a special kind of food. For me I like to eat Arabic food specially Kabsah and I will explain how to make it. First, put onions, tomatoes and oil in bowl and wait for about 3 to 5 minutes. Next, put a chicken or meet (as you wish) for 15 to 20 minutes. Then, take out the chicken or meet and put rice in the bowl for 10 to 15 minutes. Finally take out a rice out the bowl and enjoy your Kabsah.
