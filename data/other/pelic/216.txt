I would like to write about how I feel in my home. There are many things make me happy. One of them is that when I come back to my home I feel comfortable. Another, when I try to figure out problems with my family and I try to work out the problems. However, I feel bad when I set down in my bedroom for all the day. Another bad thing is the old furnuture. I would like to take away all the old furnutur and pick out new furnuture.
