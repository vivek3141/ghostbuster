There have been lots of debates on the issue that which learning source is more important, classroom instruction or personal experience. I hold the opinion that learning from the classroom instruction is more important than that from personal experience. There are several advantages of learning from classroom instruction.
Firstly, nowadays, a variety of tools or facilities are necessary to accomplish learning task effectively and efficiently. Individuals, however, are not capable of possessing all the learning tools they need in their study. Schools have all kind of facilities and media for learning and education such as libraries, learning instruments, media facilities.
Secondly, most of the knowledge teaching in classroom is based on the research done by other scholars and personal experience from other people. It is impossible for each individual to work on every research he or she wants to know and to have the same personal experience as others have. Learning from classrooms is an efficient way to obtain the knowledge in a relatively short period.
 Thirdly, people's learning from classroom setting will get appropriate direction from the professors. Teach will always give you good advice or suggestion when you work on some research topic. They are knowledgeable and experienced, especially in the area you study in. They provide students with shortcut for searching materials or choosing topic to work on.
 In conclusion, from my personal perspective, I prefer to gain knowledge from classroom instruction which provides students with excellent learning environments.
