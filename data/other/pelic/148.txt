Hi. I am from Sudia Arabia. I

 lived in Dammam Until I get married. Then, I 

moved to Riyadh. I graduated in 2004. I have 

studied Computer science. I have been living in 

Pittsburgh since April, 2006. My favorite novel 

is "Gone with the wind". I have read that novel 

three times. But in this time I have been 

reading another novel. I have been studying 

English in the ELI for four months. In this 

morning, I have drunk two cups of coffee, also I 

have been using new software in my computer.
