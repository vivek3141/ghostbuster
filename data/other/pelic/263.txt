My Favorite Restaurant

 Rose Tea is my favorite restaurant. It is a chinese food restaurant. In the United States, there have a lot of chinese food restaurant. I used to eating in others restaurant,but some of their cuisum is not very delicious. In my opinion, the boss of Rose Tea is a Taiwanese, so their meals taste good and similar in my country food.
