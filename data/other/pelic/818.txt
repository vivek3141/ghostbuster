When I first came here I had difficulty understanding English speakers on the phone. Once I had a telemarketer over the phone. He was asking me to sign up for a new phone plan .he went on describing the benefits .I didn't figure out the topic ,I told him to talk slower but he kept on the same speed . I found out that he is no listening to me. I came up with a new suggestion ,I said: "Please call me back in the evening my husband will be here". I hung up the phone , and I give up listening to telemarketer again because he turn me down several times . I end up with a new plan ,when a telemarketer call , I say "I am not interested" .and when I want to buy something I do my reaserch and I pick up the best plan for me.
