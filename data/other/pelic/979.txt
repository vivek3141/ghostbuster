Years ago I knew that I must follow my intuition when I want to attend a soccer match in the stadium. In that day I have attended soccer match between ANON_NAME_0 which is a Saudi's soccer team and another team rather than attend my friend's party. Although I had the intuition $that ANON_NAME_0 would not win the match. ANON_NAME_0 lost the match. If I followed my intuition I would not missed the party. I wish ANON_NAME_0 had won the match then I would not regret about missing the party. If only I had watched the match in my friend's house.
