The quality and quantity of stores, the buildings'outside looking and the streets' shape can discover and comprehend apparently the downtown area of Decasia is rapidly decaying. One of citizen of Decasia recorded and detected the chronicle and report of Decasia of 2005. The first change and alteration we know in his chronicle that some famous and popular stores such as Pose's Giant Boutique mall, Heartland Department Store, Chandler Theater, and Chez Pierre restaurant have closed or moved out to others city. Instead of those stores are some low level stores like pawnshop, "adult" movie theater and pornographic bookstore. After that, the quantities of destroyed and dilapidated buildings are increasing in there. Some of them have been painted "the killers" on their walls, or destroyed by fire. Furthermore the windows of the old buildings were shattered by stones. Finally, the shape of the main streets can present that the city government hasn't done good policies for their citizens. In the case of Decasia, there are forty potholes more on the Main Street and the bus service has been discontinued. Both examples indicate that the city government has had some problems and obstructions in promoting the city's policies, and they can't solve them.
