I'm gonna start writing about my week. It was a different week because I spent four days on Erie taking marketing classes in Penn State with my cousin. I had been waking up like 3 pm and getting back to home at 6 pm. I took hours of different classes with a complicated English language, so I didn't understand all the things that the teacher was saying. I also went to work with my cousin (3:30 pm to 6 pm); she works as a assistant in a church that helps foreign children to do they homework.
I ate on Mc Donald's everyday because we didn't have time to lunch in home, and Mc Donald's were the only place, so now I'm not feeling very good, this week I have to eat healthy food!
By the way, for me it was a very cool experience because I was excited to knew those big campus and big universities with a lot of students.
