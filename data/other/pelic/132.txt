"Not all learning takes place in the classroom" I totally agree with this. You can't learn everything you need in your life just from the classroom. Life need more than what you just learn from this class, these class just give you the keys to start in your life. Although the classrooms are important in your education, but it worth nothing without the personal experience. 
 Life need more than what you got from the classroom. You need to learn many other things outside the class, and you will not be successful without these important things. You need it in your social life and your profession life. For example the class doesn't teach how to make friends, doesn't teach you how to get involved in a deep relationship with person who going to share the rest of your life with. This in the social life, but what about in your work, you need to learn what it call experience this is one of the most important part when get in an interview job. I can see it in every advertisement about job opportunity in the newspapers. I think if you got something from the class, it's won't be useful without the exercises. 
 Classrooms are not the most essential part in your education life in my opinion. We can see many different examples in our life of people become successful without classrooms. Those people are role model for me because they got passion which you can't get it from the classrooms. Such as Newton he kicked out from his school, but now he is one of the persons who make our civilization. Another living example, Bill Gates he didn't finished his university. 
 Finally, you need to get more then what you learn from the classes in order to be an extraordinary person in the life, and successful in your work.
