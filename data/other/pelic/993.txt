Jacques Delille, who was a French poet, said: "Friendship is a plant witch we must often water." Almost everyone knows that any plants all require water. In fact, they might need different water's amount. I think that friendship is a relationship that emphasizes sharing your innermost feeling. It usually needs to take care a feeling which happy or sad between you and your friend. Friendship likes a fresh plant need to look after everyday. 

 How do you develop your friendship? I review that my experiences about cultivating friendship. I have a best friend, who is a woman, is a good teacher in my country. Six years ago, I met her in my office. By the time, she had been joining our team for starting day. Soon, we became good friend. We maybe had most same personality that I preferred to talk someone whether who is a male or a female, sometimes I could get a friend; she could walk into a room that is full of strangers in a party or in a meeting room, then she got some friends quickly. We often shared our feeling that exciting or worry. For example, I had healthy trouble when I felt down. She spent a lot of times to see a doctor with me. During I stayed a hospital, she always saw me at the hospital in her free time, and I really thanked her. I remember, one day, I showed her very worry; I asked her why was sad? She told me that her son had sick at her home alone, nobody took care him. I knew she had whole day' classes, and couldn't stay home. I quickly checked my schedule: just one class, then told her that "don't worry!" After my class, I went her home with her son. Toady, we often phone call each other.
