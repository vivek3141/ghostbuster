We had been learned how to do better on the test. But I want let you know how to fail a test. If you take test, you should know to study section (part) which part. It is important. If you know wrong section, you should fail a test. For my experience, when I was 10years old, I had to have math test. My classmates studied hard. It was important this math test that the whole country. Also I was studied hard. One day, we gad been having test, I was surprised, because I couldn't work out about question. I was study another part. When I took test, I was upset. It is important that you know to study part.
