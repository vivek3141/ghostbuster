I'm living in the Shadyside. My apartment is fairly big in size. It's two bedrooms, and has a kitchen, a living room and a bathroom. It is bright and sunny because of the large windows. This CHEERS me UP and makes me active. When I moved to the apartment first day, it was very dark. But I FIGURED OUT what to do. I bought some lamps to LIGHT UP the apartment. In my bedroom I usually TURN the bed AROUND, so I feel comfortable. This is every month. Now I'm SETTLING ON buying new study desk. This will makes me STAY UP while studying.
