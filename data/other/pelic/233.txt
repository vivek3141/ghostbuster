I like Japanese restaurant TOKYOU because

there are many Japanese foods and drinks.

In America there are a few Japanese foods and 

there aren't many fishes. So, I often go to 

TOKYOU to eat Japanese foods and tasty fishes.

In addition to eat, I can also buy Japanese 

foods at there. I always buy To-fu, soy sause, 

fishes, and nattou. I think Japanese foods are 

more healthy than American foods.SO my favorite 

restaurant is TOKYOU.
