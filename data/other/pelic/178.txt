Hi, I'm Hyungwoo ANON_NAME_0. I've been living in Seoul Since I was born. However, I'm here in America to study English. I have my personal website to remember my trip. There are many photos that I took. As I like traveling, most of photos are about my traveling. In America, I've ever been to Chicago. Chicago was the most large city that I've ever seen. That city was wonderful. Most of the buildings in the downtown were taller than the buildings in Pittsburgh. In that trip, I've seen most of famous buildings, streets, and museums. I haven't been traveling that much, but I want to travel a lot in America and also all over the world. There are many kinds of traveling pictures in my website. Just drop by my website.
