My niece is 3 years old who is my younger brother's daughter. She has more hairs since she born. Her face is very small. Her eyes always look smiling even though she fell uncomfortable or sad. Her eyebrows are as arched. She always looks smirk and vivacity on her facial expressions. She has a thin-lipped mouth. Then when the voice come out from her mouth just like melodious for me when she talk when me or sing a song. Moreover she was thin and little but she a very beautiful and cute kid for me.
