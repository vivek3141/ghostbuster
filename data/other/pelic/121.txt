My Friend

 Five years ago I met one of my best friends in my country; I have not forgotten him even after I came to the US six months ago. We had met each other first time in the university when we start our major. He is a white man with 6 feet of tall and skinny body. His face is angular with a set mouth, and he has flashing eye that covered with an arched eyebrows. These entire things about his face allow me to describe his face as peaceful and lively. If you hear his voice you will now that he was talking, because his booming and melodious voice is highly recognizable. The attitude and quietness that found on his character make him a lovely person. I really miss him and I am looking to meet him soon.
