Choosing a university might be difficult for some students. For these students to choose a university you have to pay attention to the following things: tuition and the performance of the university. The student should be interested in that university. And then, you start the process, by selecting what is comfortable for you.
 Asking people for information about the university is one of the most important things to see if it is the perfect university that you have expected. It is even possible to do your own research, by asking a person who has lived where the university is. Sometimes a student can make a huge mistake by picking quickly. For example, when I was picking a university last year I made mistakes. First of all, when I passed my baccalaurean; I called my friend's father in Washington, I asked him if he could send me a form from a university; then sent it to me. After I finished filling the form out I gave it to my big brother so that he could sign the form, but that day there was my brother's friend who has two brothers in Pittsburgh and brother told him that I was looking for a university. My brother's friend did not let me choose immediately. He said "do not choose a university quickly, try to take more time to make a decision". Therefore, I checked out two universities, university of Pittsburgh and George Mason. I finally realized that university of Pittsburgh was better than George Mason.
 Finally, the most important things is to contact the university personally because the university can give more details like expense of tuition, housing and other expenses, that would make you sure about what the university needs from you; and also help you to make a decision easily.
 Choosing a university is often complicated because sometimes it might be a boring situation that you expected; however, if you have to choose a university; do not relay on one only information; also you should start the process early in order to gather as much information as possible.
