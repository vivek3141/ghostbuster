Best guardian for children

 In my opinion, Lydia will be the best guardian. Lydia doesn't have experience raising children. Also she is not a blood relative. There are some reasons why I choose Lydia. First, in the letter from Caroline to Lydia, Victor and Caroline Crowley hoped Lydia would be a guardian. Second, their children know Lydia very well, and Meredith adores her. I think the relationship between a guardian and children is most important thing to choose a guardian. Lastly, Lydia's value is similar to Caroline because Lydia loves music and Caroline loved music, too. 
 I think Michael and ANON_NAME_0 Wang will be good guardians. There are two positive points. First, they spend a lot of time with young children for their jobs. Second, they have a large house enough for the children. However, they have two negative points. First, they are not rich. Second, Caroline didn't hope ANON_NAME_0 would be a guardian because they never got along with.
 I think Revert Crowley will be a bad guardian. There are three negative points. First, he was divorced and he is a bachelor now. So I don't think he will be able to take care the children by himself. Second, he is irresponsible to everything he does. Finally, he has serious money problem.
