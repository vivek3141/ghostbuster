I have two best friends Kosuke and Tomohiro in Japan, they are my coworker. We got together when we entered our company. Somebody of them put together us to go to bar and we enjoyed drinking weekend. We have belonged to soccer club since we entered the company, and we practiced playing soccer every Thursday to pick up our skill. When we had a soccer game, we got on someone's car and go to a paying field. Four years age I dislocated my shoulder when we played soccer. When I couldn't do myself in dormitory, I called in them and I could work out by their help. I have watched out not to be injured since then when I play soccer.
Now I belong to ELI soccer team and I keep on soccer practice. I will start over our company soccer club practice with my friends when I go back to Japan.
