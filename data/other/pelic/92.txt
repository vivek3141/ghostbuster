I'll introduce the super-simple sandwich recipe. First, prepare 3 pieces of white bread, two eggs, 2 chicken hams, two slices of white American cheese, some lettuce, a little salt, ketchup and yellow mustard. Toast white bread in the oven for 30-60 seconds. Put an egg and salt in a bowl, and stir with spoon. Put the mixed egg in the pan. Do the same thing again.
