Very dificult to say which sport is the most popular in the Unites States. Most people watch baseball game than any another sport; but it is because there are so many professional baseball game (each team plays 162 games per year).The average attendance figures for professional football is higher; however,there are not so many games(only 16 for each team per year).Basketball also is popular, especially in big cities. In adition, there are several other sports that have millions of fans; these include ice hockey,soccer, golf and tennis but these is no a single sport that dominate whole country.
