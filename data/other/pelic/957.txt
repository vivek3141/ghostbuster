About one year ago, I made a big decision. I got married and I came to the United States because my husband was working here. In my country I used to have three jobs and my salary was really good but here I can not work and i can not save money, if I hadn't quit my jobs in Venezuela, I would have saved money and my financial situation could be better also if I were in Venezuela, I would be a rich person.Another thing is that I want to have a baby soon but I live here and I do not have any relatives to help me with the baby and for this reason I can not have baby for this moment.If I go back to my country in December, I will have a beby soon and it is the most important thing for me in this moment.
