My apartment is bright and near by school. This cheers me up and I can get up an hour before my class begin. At night, it is noisy because it is near a gas station, but the windows can keep it out. I have to close the windows when I want to sleep or read books. In some day, it is too bright and sunny for me. I have the curtain but it is not good. When I pull it down, I cannot put it up or it's difficult to do that. I want to take it down and buy new one.
