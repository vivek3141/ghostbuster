 I feel safe at home. My house has many windows in all the rooms and that builds my energy up. The sunshine gives light to my room so being at home never brings me down. I have dark curtains in my room that cover the window up, they block the sunshine out so that I don't wake up as early as the sun rises. I usually wake up feeling happy. I sometimes fix my room up when I need change. I just change the direction of the furniture. I don't like mess so I always tide my stuff. I straighten my bed up every morning. 
 I always switch the music player on when I enter my working room. I can't work without music. Music helps me concentrate more on my work. I watch out for turning the volume down when I work late at night. I always take the mess away my desk when I give breaks. I need to have my coffee before I take my work up. When I'm working on a translation I first write the unknown words down on a piece of paper. After I work on the translation I finally write it up. After I take a short break I come back to my room and go on with the translation. When I get bored at home, which is not very often, I eat out. I ask my friends which I get along well over when I feel lonely.
