Neighbors
Neighbor is the people who live near us. Neighbor is important to me. If you want to move from my apartment to other you must ask about your neighbor for many reasons. How do you know about your neighbors, there is more than one way to know about them? 

When you start thinking about moving to other apartment or house most of the people start thinking about how much will they bay for the rent and how far is it from work they don't think about the neighbors at all and the are wrong for many reasons. Lets say that you find the perfect apartment for you and your family you pay less than before also it is the nearest place to your work but your neighbors are so bad in many whys for example, you always sleep at 10 o'clock but your neighbor does not sleep until 2 o'clock in the morning while you are sleeping the are watching TV turning the volume up and you can't sleep because of this and if you try to talk to them next morning they are going to say (DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WE DON'T CARE) .


Also as you know drugs and bad things are also dingrus so choosing your neighbors will help you to raise your children away from these bad things? If you travel a lot and you have nobody to take care of your family you can ask your neighbor to take care of your family in a dangers satiation for example, your son is ill and your wife is working and he called his mother to come and get him to the hospital but she works far away from home so you can call your neighbor to help your son going to the hospital.

As I wrote choosing your neighbors more important than anything. You need some help as they do so you so you need to be careful when you choose your neighbors. To live a comfortable and save live.
