Best friend
My best friend's name is ANON_NAME_0. At first, we GOT TOGETHER in the high school. He SAT DOWN at the end of classroom. Sometimes, I CALLED IN him do my homework such as science because he was good at it. If we were supposed to FIGURE difficult problem OUT, always he TRY it OUT with me in my home. One day, I FOUND OUT the reason he studied well; he always LOOKED UP the problem concerning science in the library. He often PICKED a science exercise book UP in a library and showed me it. Finally, he SETTLED ON his major; it was science. I think that he never GIVE it UP until he will die.
