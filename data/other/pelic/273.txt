I will nominate my cousin Vivian to be a legal guardian for my child, if I died. She has married and has a baby. So she has an experience about raising child. She and her husband are teachers in elementary school. I think that they have a lot of professional ideas to take care of children, and can give children stable surroundings. We understand each other habit, belief and values. So I believe if I died, she will know how to take care of my child in my mind.
