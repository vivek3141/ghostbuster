My room in my apartment is bright and sunny. Sun lights from the windows show the furniture off. It makes me feel good, because it is beautiful. And, the winds sometimes go through my room from windows to windows. Since the winds bring the fresh air, it makes me feel good. So, I like to lie down by windows to feel the winds in my room.
 In contrast, the landlord is terrible. When I made the contract to rent the room, I asked them to set the curtain up by the beginning date. However, when I entered the room at the beginning date, I realized that they had not taken care of that. After that, I called the landlord office a few times, but they never showed up on my room. So, finally I gave it up, and I installed the curtain on the windows by myself.
