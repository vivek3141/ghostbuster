Subcutures

 United States have many international students. I think that is one of the subcuture in the United States. Like the ELI students or the others are in the university. Most of students want to improve they English and go in to the university so came here for learning language. Some of students are emigrant with they parents. I think the both are very good for us because it doesn't just learn English. It also can meet friends from another countries,learn about many cultures from friends. I very like to meet international friends. I think all the things i learn in here will very helpful for me in the future.
