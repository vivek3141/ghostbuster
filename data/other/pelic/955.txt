About a friend

 Those who consider entering into college the key to success might think that only to study is important. However, I believe that making a friend is also crucial. This is because we can learn social skill like human relationships by making a friend who could teach us something great.
 A friend of mine who is now in Korea is a soldier. We met in Wongok High school which is located in An-san city. We get used to going together to library where a lot of students usually go when the period examination. As well, we had same hobbies; it is easy for us to get close. One day, I borrowed a music CD (which is) named SEO TAIJI; I lent it to another friend who want to listen to the CD. Sometimes later, I forgot the fact that I borrowed it. Therefore, my friend who lent me it is angry. However, he didn't be angry to me; he just said about it very silently. "Hey, my dear, this CD is for you." He received the CD from the other friend. I couldn't say anything. He took the consideration for me. I cannot forget the event which made me apprehend friendship. After that we got closer than before. As well, until now, he is still my best friends.
