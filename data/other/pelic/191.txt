For example, I have a brother who succeed in his job; his name is Madou. Selling phone card is his occupation. One day we were together in his office, I asked him what does he think about definition of word success. "Work hard and get what you want, "he said. That is he gave explanation of word success. I support his idea because working hard is reward successful.
