I have lived in an apartment with my husband. Our apartment is big and sunny. We always feel cozy at home. We THREW AWAY the old furniture in the apartment. We LAID OUT our apartment with some furniture these we PICKED OUT from yardsell. We MOVED AROUND the bed, made our bedroom to look bigger. We HUNG UP light green curtains. It let us feel vivid at home.
