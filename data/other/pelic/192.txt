I grew up in Seoul, Korea. I've been living in Pittsburgh since 2006. I've been studying English in ELI. Since I met my Japanese friend, I've been interested learn language (other country language) and other country culture. So I've learned Japanese and Chinese culture. In face, last year I visited to Japanese. I am going to visit other country maybe next year.
