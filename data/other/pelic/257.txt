My favorite restaurant
 My favorite restaurant is Cheesecake Factory, I love most food there, expecially cheesecake and I love the original favor best.
Last Sunday, I had brunch with my friends.
I ordered a Mexico food and I think it's good.
Even though the food is delicious there, it's not a good idea to eat often because I believe the price there is too expensive for students.
Besides cheesecake, I also like to eat pasta, especially spicy noodles. Every time I go there, I'll order one. If you think this restaurant is too expensive, maybe you can bring your friends together and share the price.
