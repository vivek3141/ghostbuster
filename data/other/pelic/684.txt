My room is bright and sunny in the morning. When I wake up, I sit down my bed. And I am thinking about what I do today. I look to hang photograph up. Photograph does my room up. Also photograph cheers me up. When I get back at school, I change cloths and I put casual on. Before I sleep, I look sky by my room's window. I like my room.
