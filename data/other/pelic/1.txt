I thought, she was so beautiful, and one thing as important she wear uniform similar me. When she took off the train,she said good bye with me. I feel better for first day of school. I was sitting until the last train stop it was near my school.I was finding the class when I met the women agin in that room. I saw the number of the room that was same me. While I was introducing my self to the women,, the teacher came in. Since we were the best friends until finished university.
