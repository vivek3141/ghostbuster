A year of a destroy the downtown in the Decasia
The downtown of Decasia is the big city, it had many places to shop.Beginning of the year; Rose's Giant Boutique and Heartland and Department moved to shop there. It was the center to shop. A lot of companies and restaurants wanted to open. February, it began to occur a bad situation. For example,some restaurants were an arson and some building painted with a pornographic.So many companies must move to the suburbs because they worried their life and business.Many businesses,the windows were shattered by a stone.Furthermore,the Main Street had more thanforty potholes, s the downtown has less businesses and population live.It looks like an abandoned city.
