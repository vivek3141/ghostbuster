I rent an apartment this room is very old and dirty.Iwant to set up erey things in my room.I began clean up bathroombetween i were working, I turn on radio,it made me happy.Then I throw away some trash on the floor. I straigten up the bed near thewindow. I took down the curtains and then I hang up anew one that I picked out last week.I did not like the color of the wall, I just touch it up.It is beautiful,I love it.After my room cover up,I miss my parents,I put up their pictures and posters from my country on the wall.Afer day this room alwayscheers me up when I come back from school or go out.
