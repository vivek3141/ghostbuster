WHO IS THE BEST GUARIANN 

 In my opinion, Lydia is the best guardian for Crowley's children for three reasons. First of all, Lydia has letter from Mrs. Caroline Crowley. Mrs. Caroline Crowley and her husband vector were wondering if Lydia would be willing to be Meredith and Andrew's guardian. And also Mrs. Crowley's says we will talk when you come to visit in September. That's mean they wont suasion her to be guardian for their children. Because they says "think about it. Don't decide now". Second, the relationship between Lydia and Crowley's family is very good. Because Mrs. Crowley says "We both love you like sister" also "Meredith adores you too. She always asking when aunt Lydia is coming to visit again and she have started violin lessons. Her dream is to be just like her aunt Lydia" that's mean Meredith is love Lydia. Finally, Lydia's work is a violin lesson. That's mean her financial situation is vary good. So that she doesn't need children money to her self.

WHO IS THE LAST CHOICE TO BE GUARDIAN


 I think, ANON_NAME_0 is the last of choose to be guardian for Crowley's children for three reasons. First, Mrs. Caroline Crowley was never very happy with that decision ANON_NAME_0 but victor insisted, so she finally agreed to sign the document. Second, ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 are divorced. Finally, he was forced to file for bankruptcy when Communicom failed last year. Even his father refused to help him in this time. That's mean he is a bachelor and, by himself, he is just too irresponsible to take care of children.
