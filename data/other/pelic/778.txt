The Long week end
This is the first long week end in the ELI. It seems to me awful, because you'll enjoy this week end for shopping to our nice gust "The Winter seasons" into all Pittsburgh big centers if we can to discover it. I've had an idea to our friend who will come with us.
First of all, be sure you wear a heavy clothes because the weather is became cold and cold and this is the first time of mine and yours life I think so? to face this kind of weather. Then bring you money with you and accept a lot of purchases to the special gust, for example, coat- the heavy deity isolate the body Temperate-, gloves, weal capâ€¦etc. However, make sour you haven't any kind of an appointments during the weekend because, you may visit more than on center per day and it needs you full attention to select a boatful staff . On the other hand, you may go to run into an accepting friend in this shopping. This is the time for all people and student like us to shop and catch the time of special offer and promotions. The most important thing I did not mention up is your university ID if you don't have an own car you don't have another choice just to use the populace Buses. If you forget the buses schedule to bring it with you it might be bad because the movements in the weekend are less than the business day- Monday to Friday-. Finally, I believe that you will not forget this kind of long weekend.
