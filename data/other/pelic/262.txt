My favorite restaurant is nothing in the United States because I don't like american foods. Therefore, I can't write about american restaurants. I like Japanese food especially sushi. I often go to the Miyaki that is Japanese restaurant with my parents. I can eat fresh fish at the Miyaki. I like to eat sliced fishes there. My parents also like to eat sliced fish there.
