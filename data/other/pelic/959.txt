I want to choose one person and one couple for good guardian. The best guardian is Lydia and another good guardian is ANON_NAME_0 and Michael Wang. I have several reasons for each one. First, I think Lydia will be the best guardian because she is very close with Crowley's family so Victor and Caroline believed her so much and Meredith adores her. Second, she has a good talent of violin. I think it's good for children's education and I believe she can get a job about the violin anytime. Third, if she retired her job now, it doesn't matter because children will be millionaires. I think ANON_NAME_0 and Michael Wang will be good guardian. Because, first, they are couple, they love children and they have many experiences to take care of children. Second, they can provide a good home for children. Third, they also don't have to worry about money problem because they both are teacher right now and children will be millionaires. So in my opinion, Lydia is the best and ANON_NAME_0 and Michael Wang are good guardian as alternate.


 I think ANON_NAME_1 Crowley, Henry and Violet Crowley won't be good guardian. Because, first, ANON_NAME_1 Crowley has serious money problems and he is divorced with ANON_NAME_2 so he is too irresponsible to be a guardian. Second, Henry and Violet Crowley are too old to take care of children. Although now they have good relationship with their grandchildren, they may not take care of their grandchildren several years later. So I think ANON_NAME_1 Crowley, Henry and Violet Crowley are not suitable to be a guardian.
