Friendship is a plant which we often must water.
-Hindustan proverb

I think it means that we must be connected with my friends physically if we keep our relationship with our friends. We often have to make chance that we meet them, we call to them or we play with them to keep friendship with them. Having been keeping relationship with my friends is very troublesome, if this proverb is true. I don't agree with this writer.
When I was high school and college student I made some good friends who own fun and have similar values with me. We often enjoyed traveling, drinking and talking at that time. After we graduated school we have been living far away each other. Though we can't often meet, our friendship has been lasting since we graduated. Wherever I are, whenever I meet my friends we are friends. We have been keeping good friendship by connecting each other in our heart.
