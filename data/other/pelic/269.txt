I would like to choose my sister llike a guardian, because I can't imagine someone else. My parents have enough work and they need time to take care of themselves. Even if my sister is not all the time serious, I know generally she loves chidren and she loves to take care of them. In this case she is responsible. She hasn't a job now, she is always a student, but I know she could has one if it necessary. She has enough different experiences with the cildren and she is like me, so I needn't to ask me about her religion or her way of life. 
We have both the same education and I trust in her. If one day she has any money problem I know that the rest of my family could help her to support my children.
