My bed room is bright and sunny. The room always cheers me up when I get back from a long day from school. It has a big wonderful window and also it have a good view. The only thing was missing in my room was the curtains and I bought it yesterday and I put them up. Also, in my bed room I have my own desk but the problem is that's always messy. So my bedroom is the only privet place for me and the rest of the apartment sheared between me and my roommate.
