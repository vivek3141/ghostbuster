We have many candidates for a guardian of Crowley's children. But I think the best guardian for children is Lydia. I can say three reasons for this thinking. First, Lydia was Caroline's very closing friend. They know each other pretty long time and also children know Lydia. Before Caroline died, she send a letter to Lydia and asked that Lyida can be a guardian. It means she believed Lydia very much. In the letter, Caroline also said that children like Lydia. If Lydia'll be a guardian, children would like Lydia very much. Second, Lydia has a stable job. She is a violinist. Although she isn't in U.S now, she'll come back to U.S because of children. In many documents, we can know that she is very good at her job. She is a good violinist and many people admitted her ability. If she should reduce her work because of children, money is not problem. Because children already have enough money so she don't need to worry about it. Finally, she is alone now. Unfortunately, she ended with her boyfriend but may be this will be good for children. If she has boyfriend or husband, it'll be hard to her to take care both of them. Of course, she can get a marriage few years later. But in that time, she already accustom to taking care of children so she won't forget the children. In these reasons, I think Lydia is the best guardian for children. 

I think Keren isn't good guardian for children. In the court, Keren said that the one reason of she like to take care of children is to try to make up to Caroline for all the problems between them. If Caroline and Keren didn't have a good relationship before Caroline died, then at that time, children also didn't have a good relationship with Keren. It's sorry to Keren but I think it's too late to recover their relationship. Furthermore, I can't believe Keren's saying. Saying of her is too devote to children. On the contrary, it makes me that I can't trust her.
