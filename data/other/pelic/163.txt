Hi, i'm ANON_NAME_0. I'v been building this site for a 2 mounths, and I'm almost finished. I'v written this page to introduce myself. 

I love somthing called soccer. I usually play soccer twice in the week. I grew up in Riyadh, KSA, and I was living with my family in the same house. I graduated from PSU in Riyadh in 2006 in Scince in Information System.
 
Know I'm in Pittsburhg, USA. I've been here in Pittsburgh for five mounths. I've been studying in the ELI for 5 mounths.

In the future I will do the TOEFL. After that I will do the GRE exam to get an admission from graduate studies. I'm planing to study in the college of Information Scince in the Universtiy of Pittsburgh next fall. 

I've included some pictures frome my choice.
