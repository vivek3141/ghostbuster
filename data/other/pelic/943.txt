Unreal condition 
My major was in the food science and nutrition in junior college. If I hadn't continued my studying, I would have taken a test for dietician certificate. If I had passed the test, I could have had the dietician license. If I had become a dietician, I would have worked in a hospital. If I had worked in the hospital, I could have given people advice about the kind of food they should eat.
 In the other hand, if I hadn't changed my major to the information science and learning technology, I would have continued to study in the food science and nutrition. If I had continued to study in the food science and nutrition, I could have done more research in the food and nutrition. If I had done more research in the food and nutrition, I could have developed more healthy food. If I had developed more healthy food, I could have been an expert in the food and nutrition. If I had become an expert in this filed, I would have gained a lot of money.
