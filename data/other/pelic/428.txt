The downtown area of Decasia is rapidly decaying. Many of the stones are moving out such as Rose's Giant Boutique, Shank's Men's clothing store. Some of the buildings are unsightly. There are many "The Killers" painting on buildings and Heartland Department store's windows were shattered by stores. Also, the street is in bad shape. There are forty pothdes on main street and pawnshop opened on December. In addition, several sleazy places have opened up. The elegant Chandler Theater closed down on April and an adult movie theater opened at the old Chandler Theater.
