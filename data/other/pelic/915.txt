Before I came to the United States, I had studied at King ANON_NAME_0 University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM). I had studied the freshmen in mechanical engineering. Last year, I applied to get a scholarship in the ministry of higher education to complete my studies in the USA. I got the scholar ship last December. If I hadn't gotten the scholarship, I would have been in my country to complete my studies at KFUPM. As you know, the certificate here is more efficient than my country. At first, I was confused to come here but my dad encouraged me to come here to get me studies from one of the best universities in the USA. I decided to come here after a long thinking because you know taking a decision like that would change my life. The most important things I had thought before I came here were leaving my parents, friends and my best car I had ever had. Two months before I came here, I said, if hadn't come here, I would have tuned up my car just for street racing. Furthermore, I would also finish the junior if I were in my country. Now, if I get a good score for the TOEFL, I will complete my studies at PITT as transfer student.
