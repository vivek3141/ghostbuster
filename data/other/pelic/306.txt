The Downtown area of Decasia is rapidly decaying. There are four main changes happened to the area. First, many of the stores moved out of the area. Second, some of the buildings are unsightly. Third, the streets are in a bad shape. Final but not finally, several sleazy places have opened up. Let's discuss each change and see some examples of them.

There are many stores moved from the area to The Town Mall such as Rose's Giant Boutique, Heartland Department Store and Shank's Men's Clothing Store. Those places moved to the town area between January 3rd and August 15th.


Another change happed to the area is some of the building are unsightly. That caused by the pervious reason and some more. For example, in February 15th, fire destroyed Boolies Restaurant. In addition, in Match 3rd, during the night someone paints "The Killer" on four buildings. Lastly, In November 3rd, all of the windows of the old Heartland Department Store are shattered by stones. 

One more change happened to the area happened to the main street. It is in a bad shape. Two terrible things happened to the main street. First, there are about 46 potholes in the main street only. Second, the bus service does not exist any more. The bus service was disconnected to that area. 
 
The Last change is several sleazy places have opened up. In September 2nd, An "Adult" movie theater opened at the old Chandler Theater. Furthermore, In December 1st, a pawnshop opened where Chez Pierre used to be. 

Since all of these things happened to the area, we can just feel sorry for the area. It is really decaying.
