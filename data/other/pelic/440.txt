Hospitality in Saudi Arabia

 The hospitality in Saudi Arabia is very different between provinces. Some of these have traditional hospitality, but others have modern hospitality. Some people like to eat on the floor and use their hands for eating, but many people like to eat on the table and use spoons, knives, and forks. In my province (Eastern Province) we like to serve food that our guest likes or serve different kinds of delicious foods. In the Central Province when they invite someone they usually serve a big plate of sheep on rice and they eat on the floor, but in the capital (in Central Province) many people serve western food such as Italian and French food in addition they serve a big plate of sheep on rice. In the Western Province they have traditional and modern hospitality too. However, they don't serve sheep on rice. And they eat on the table and use spoons, knives, and forks. In Southern and Northern Province they have over limit of hospitality. For instance, they invite the gust for three days if the gust is coming from other province. In addition, they serve the traditional hospitality meal (sheep on rice) they like to eat on the floor and use their hands for eating. About stranger invitation, in the Eastern, Central, and Western they don't invite someone strange to their homes. On the other hand, in the Northern and Southern Province, they usually invite stranger to cup of coffee if he rings the bill to ask about someone.
