I think that my favorite restaurant is cheese factory.Last week, we were waiting 30minute when we went to there. It is famous cheese cake and steak in pittsburgh. So,we ate cheese cake and steak. And then we walked round and we shopped. So I bought my sweather. Ibelieve it is nice place because we can eat delicous foods and we could buy anything.
