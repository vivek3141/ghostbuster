My room was very mess two months ago. I decided to clean up everything in my living-room and rest of the room. After, I got through with arranging everything; the room became more beautiful, that it never was before. Seeing my room clean cheer me up; I will keep on doing on clean. Now every time I come in my room, I feel so good because I succeed in doing my room up.
