I really like my home. When i CAME BACK from school, it always SHOW UP ON that everything is beatiful and new, especially when everything is CLEAN UP. I am always KEEP ON trying to make the ANON_NAME_0 se TURN UP clean and harmonic. In the Classroom, sometimes i feel that i cant wait to GET THROUGH the class, but i THINK OVER and i know that i am in the class to learn.
