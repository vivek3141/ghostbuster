I've been living in the U.S. for ten menthes. I used to live in my country for 18 years. I got a scholarship from my country. I didn't come back to my country for 10 months which a long time. I used to play soccer when I was in my country but not any more. Therefore, I've not played for 10 months this game. However, I'm getting used to play volley ball. I thing it is a nice game.
