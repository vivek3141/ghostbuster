When I was a middle school student, I gained a lot of weight. Almost every night, I ate a lot of foods. My intuition said not to eat any more. But I really wanted to eat, so I ignored my intuition. If I had thought about gaining weight, I would have stopped eating. If I had had a concept of being obese, I wouldn't have eaten a lot. At that time, I wished I had lost weight that I had gained every day. If I had stopped eating a lot, I wouldn't have had to try to lose weight. I wish I didn't eat a lot like that, now.
