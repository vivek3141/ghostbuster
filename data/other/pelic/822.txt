 Generally speaking, people think that studying is the most important thing to a student. I agree with this opinion, but I have another idea of student's assignment. Students have more free time than workers. It means that students can do many things more than workers. As a student, study is very important but not only study. These two things can be really important as well as study : new experiences and hobbies.
 Study is a basic activity of students. How to study more effectively is big problem to each student. Each person needs to find themselves way to study.
 Outside activities are also important to students. When people have a job, they won't have enough time to spend outside activities. However, students have their time. They can spend the time to do everything. For instance, they can travel on vacation, but many workers don't have time to travel. Travel can help to know other culture and to learn other language. These experiences will help their future.
 Finally, students can find their hobbies easier than workers. They have time and confidence, because they are still young. Hobbies are very important when they have free time. If they don't have hobbies, but they have free time, maybe they'll just stay in home and watch TV. In this case, if they have hobbies, they can spend the time more interestingly. 
 As a student, study is really the most important thing, but don't forget other things. It'll help you a lot.
