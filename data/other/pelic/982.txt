The most important decision I had made that I joined an architecture school. However, I could've been a game designer if I hadn't joined an architecture school. If I had joined a game design school, I might've become a character designer. By the way, I could've chosen to join a game design school but I couldn't because in Saudi Arabia we don't have a game design school. By the end of the day, I enjoyed the architecture school and I like my major.
