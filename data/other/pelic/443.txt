Subcultures
In Taiwan, there is a group of people, called Taiwan aboriginals who are just like Indians in American. Generally speaking, Taiwan aboriginals believe in pantheism, it means that they believe everything has a spirit. For example, mountains have spirits, so they would worship mountain spirits if they want to have a successful hunting. In addition, they also worship their ancestors because they are grateful ancestors' contributions. This faith is like Chinese tradition because Chinese also worship their ancestors. In their ceremony, there is an important character called "oracle" who would lead the ceremony. And the oracle has other functions, such as: curing sick people, making a prediction and analyzing dreams. These are their interesting customs in religious respect.
In addition to religious respect, I'd like to introduce their typical lifestyle. Most Taiwan aboriginals have good voice, so they usually communicate by singing a song. By the way, there is a famous singer in Taiwan, A-Mai, who is an aboriginal. When the ceremony begins, they will sing many songs, dance, and drink alcoholic. This is their well-known custom. They will make alcoholic and some beautiful drinking cups by themselves. Alcoholic plays an important role in their daily life. For instance, they always drink in all kinds of ceremonies, such as: wedding, worshiping ancestors, funeral, and hunting.
Different people would have different opinions about their lifestyle, some people think they are lazy and drink all day long, but others think they are romantic and expansive. In my opinion, they insist their lifestyle and enjoy a simple life. They may think that they don't need a lot of money to buy a beautiful house because they live in beautiful mountains and forest. However, some Taiwan aboriginals have already adjusted their life to modern life, so we may not tell them from Taiwanese. To sum up, I think everyone can choose their own lifestyle whether most people like it or not.
