There are many stone on the grass. When I was freshman, I heard about stonehenge from my friend who lived in the U.K. I thought it would be great experience if I saw the stonehenge. It might be very famous in the world. People who lived in this area might have believed solar god. So they might have had religious ritual on this area. It might have built in BC 1800~BC 1400 because stone's colors are very different.Also it must have been registerd world heritage by Unesco. Many people might have made efforts to keep this heritage.
