I think there are many definitions about what it success. But in a general ideia, success it's a goal, a goal that you have done with proud of yourself and makes you happy.
 In the dictionary, you can find definitions like something that has the result or effect that you intended, or the act of achieving this.
 In my country, most people think that if you have a car, a tv, a big family and your own house, you are a man of success.
 They think also that if you have a lot of money, you are a man of success. I think that this is an ignorant thought, or a thought without fundaments or personal experience of what is success.
 In contrast, I think that depends on the situation, these alternatives can be a definition of success, but I think that the most important thing is that you have to be a happy person! Like if you have a big family and a great job, you only will be a successful person if you love your family and really likes your job. What's the advantage of being rich person with mountains of money but without friends and people to share the energy of the love feeling that have inside the humans? Maybe money doesn't mean success!
 With harmony, peace and conscience that is not only the material things that will make you happy, you can be a man of success, and learn that there's a lot of better things then a big tv and a great car.
