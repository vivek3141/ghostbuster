I have belonged to ELI soccer team and took part in soccer league of university of Pittsburgh. I had been playing soccer in my company before I came to Pittsburgh. I'm glad to continue to play soccer in Pittsburgh. We have a game every Tuesday. We had two games already, but we lost both of games. One of opponent was Saudi Arabian team, other was American team. They looked that they practice soccer well. We have never practiced together, we have to practice. But it's difficult to practice with all members. Because Saudi Arabia student of our team have been taking a ram don till end of the October and it's hard for them to play soccer in weekend noon or evening. Though we can't practice enough, our team work will get better as playing games.
