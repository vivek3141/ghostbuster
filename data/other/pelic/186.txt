Topic: doing a job
 
 Those who just consider job the method to making money might think that it is not only important to their life but also unrelated to success, especially in the past.. However, as far as I am concerned, it was the job that I think the key of success. This is because happy comes from their job.
 To have a job that people want is one of the important elements. Some people might think that making a lot of money is just crucial in someone's life because money has huge power. For instance, we can buy very expensive car we want, get a valuable gem like a diamond, take trips to wherever we want and also live in beautiful castle if we have enough money to do that. However, you may not deny that you cannot buy happiness even if you have too much money. In the contrary, those who have a job they want could feel much more happiness even though they don't have a lot of money. For example, son of CEO of Hyundai, very rich company in Korea killed himself for a few years ago.
