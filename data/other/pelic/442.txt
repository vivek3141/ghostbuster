My best friend is who always tried to FIGURE OUT a lot of my problem and helps me. He is always with me and he LOOKS OUT of me. He graduated from the Institute of Public Administration in Riyadh. He is an accountant and he is GIVE UP man. He is trying to found a job and he FILL OUT a lot of companies forms but not yet nobody CALL BACK till now. He doesn't have even a chance to try him self and also there are no choice to PICK OUT a job and he is BRING DOWN. He will CHEER UP when he get a job and start new live. My advice to him to KEEP ON going and trying and do what ever he ca do it and GO ON to you goal till reach it. You get you chance once.
