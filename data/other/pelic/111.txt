The accident didn't stop my brother in low zaki to reach his goal and success to get a higher education. His dream is to be a doctor but he didn't reach his dream because of the accident that happens to him when he was ten years old.
 Ten years ago he lose one of his eyes . his father moved to another city because of his work and he was living with his wife and children in apartment. In the same building he lived there the one who is responsible about the accident in the first floor. Once zaki mother was asking one of her children to throw out the trash but nobody listen to her except one of them. Zaki was the one who listen to her only and he took the trash to throw it. While he is going to throw that somebody called shout and called him Zaki and he turn back to see who was calling him. However, from that time till now he can't see from one of his eye's. Somebody throw stick which was like knives throw his eye direct. His father had try with him and traveled with him but he can't see anymore from one of his eye's .
 He didn't stop because of that accident and said my life is lost as my eye's. In the other hand, he graduated from high school by the best grades. His dream was possible to be which was to be a doctor. Only one reason stopped him to reach it that sad accident when he was ten years old. Also, he didn't stop him there but he joined in to the best university in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia which is called King ANON_NAME_0 university of Petroleum and mineral. He majored in mathematics and he graduated from there as a teacher. Right now, he is a mathematics teacher and he got married. He is 34 years old and a very generous man. Every body likes him and respect him in his village also, he is doing his master degree in the same major. 
 Finally, I want to say for everybody not to stop at one point in there life or accident because nothing is impossible in this life.
