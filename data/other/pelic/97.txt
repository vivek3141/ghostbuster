Before I start in instructions my favorite cook is Kabsa, the first you should have bowl, oval oil, meet or chicken, rice, onion and tomato sauce. I put the onion with oil for three minutes and I put the tomato sauce. Then I put the chicken or meet on it and it lets for 45 minutes. Next I put rice on the bowl with chicken and after 15 minutes. Finally the kabsa is ready for eating.
