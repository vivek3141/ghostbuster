I believe that people in the past like to camp in deserts. Therefore, I think they should have gone their have interesting time or for camping. I think people could have used Stonehenge to clime. Some people use trees to protect them form the windy weather. Therefore, I think people might have been used Stonehenge to protect them from the windy weather. They could use these when they want to fit to hide themselves too because these are very large and big and no one is going to see you when you hide behind them. People may have written some words on Stonehenge to let them know directions. They might have been used them to take a rest beside them when they travel. They can sleep beside them or sit on their shadow.
