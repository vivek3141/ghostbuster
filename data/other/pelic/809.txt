It's funny to call friends' cell phone in order to trick him or her. I was a victim of it last summer. The phone rang, and I picked it up. The caller said "Congratulation! You won the car as a prize. You are the 1000th answer. If you want the car, you need to sign up the documents which we offer because of tax, and youâ€¦" Being surprised, I wanted her to stop talking, but she kept on talking. At that time, she weren't turned out my friend. I needed to think over before signing it up. Thus, she talked that she called back later, and I hung up the phone. Unfortunately, I decided to give up the car because it was like that tax is much more expensive than the car. A few minutes later, she called back and said to me, "You are deluded! Hahaha".
