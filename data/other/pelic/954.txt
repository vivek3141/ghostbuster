My best friend PUY is the girl, who lives a different city with mine.She is the women,who was very beautiful in my class when I studied in University.She was the women,wose the big house and sport car in the neighborhood.I had alway gone to her house,where played the badminton together at the garden,which had many flower.Last year I used her house,where was her born was my birthday party.I invited only myfriends, who studied in the same class.Her familly love me like their daughter.In the party, that was a small made us was happy. Her mother,who cooked the food and dance with us. We were very happy in my birthday .I am very love her and her familly because they are the person, who are very kind and understand mine similar my parent.Although my parent've never met them but they often talk together by the phone.I love them although I know them two months only.
