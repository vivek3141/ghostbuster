It's difficult to succeed in getting a higher education, if he were the first person in the family. Of course the first person has some chance to succeed, but it's difficult to have a chance to succeed.
Recently in Japan a highly educated person tends to have a highly educated family. The person who wants to succeed must study hard, but his status affects his success. If his father or mother is a highly educated person and earns much money, he can accept an advanced education to succeed. And his parents would make him succeed in getting a high education. As he lives in that status, he would think it's natural to succeed and study more and more. For example, his parents are not highly educated persons, it's difficult for him to accept enough education to succeed. And they don't know how to make their child succeed in getting a higher education well. On the other hand, in his school teachers might lead person who doesn't have highly educated parents to succeed. But he would not realize that it's the chance to succeed. Because he doesn't think it's natural for him to have a success in getting a higher education.
