The name of my best friend is Iman. We have been friends for 5 years. I met her when we were FILLING OUT the university's form. She always CHEERS me UP. We usually, GET TOGETHER after school. In our free time we usually TURN T.V ON to see our favorite show, and we FIX OUT our room. Sometimes, we TAKE OUT a book from the library to read it. Of course, we PLAY AROUND. She always HELPS me OUT with my homework. I hope in the next time I meet her; we will do a lot of things. For example, FOLLOW THROUGH WITH our project. When I COME BACK to Saudi Arabia, I hope to see her.
