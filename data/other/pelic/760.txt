There are some important guidelines for failing your tests. First, you do not study event one letter in your book. Studying before a test is fatal to success failing tests. If you really want to study or read, you study other chapters which are not included on the test. Second, you become an obvious cheater during your test. Then, your teacher will pick you out, and you never excuse and say 'sorry'. You won't be qualified with the tests. The last but the easiest way to fail tests is not to take them. My friend had several chances to get a driver license, but he didn't take any tests. He doesn't have one now although he has prepared for his driver license since 2004. If you do these things, you can get an F on your tests successfully.
