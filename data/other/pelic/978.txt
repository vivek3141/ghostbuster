According to me, the best guardian for Meredith and Andrew Crowley is Lydia Montgomery. First, she is the best friend of Caroline, almost a sister (reading 3). She is close to the family and Crawley's daughter loves her. But the most important thing is that Caroline asked her to be the guardian of the children and it seems Lydia has accepted this job (reading 4). Next, she has a successful life, she has a very good job, so money is not a problem and we can suppose that she doesn't want to be the guardian for the children's money. Moreover, I'm sure she can retire from touring and find a very good position in a philharmonic in the United States in order to give a stable, secure and loving home to the children. Finally, even if she is a single woman, she is young and very intelligent. She is used to working hard because of her career, and she is also used to travelling and meeting different kinds of people. So, I think she may have the best ability to teach a lot of different things to the children and to find the best way to raise them in the same spirit as Victor and Caroline. 
 On the other hand, ANON_NAME_0 Crowley, ANON_NAME_1 Wang and Victor's parents don't seem to me a good choice because the first one is irresponsible. He isn't able to correctly manage his finances and it would be dangerous to give him the children's money. The second one would seem to me a very odd choice, because the children don't know ANON_NAME_1 and her husband and I'm sure it would be more difficult for them to live with people they have never seen before. And to conclude, even if Henry and Violet Crowley love the children very much, they are old and it would be very sad for the children if one of them were to die during their childhood.
