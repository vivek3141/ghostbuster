I feel good when I at my home especially when I set in my room because I did some thing nice on my room. I put on a lot of flowers on a dresser and night table. Also, I moved around my bed. Last week, my wife and I went to furniture store, and we bought some pictures for our room. I hung up these even a wall looks very cool. Then I take away a sofa to anther room. After that I straightened up the room and put on in garbage. I began to straighten my room from 7:00 a.m then I kept on until 2:00 p.m. My wife cheered up when she saw our room like that.
