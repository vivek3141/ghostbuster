Welcome to read and share your experience. I am ANON_NAME_0-Long Lin. I have been building my blog to provide my personal experience and exchange the information with birdwatchers about birdwatching.
Birdwatching has been my favorate hobby. Whenever I have free time, I am fond of bringing a pair of binoculars at lawn and going to mountains to watch the variety of birds. I have watched wild birds for 10 years. Why it becomes my interest is because I went to climb a mountain some day. Fortunately, there is a birdwatching expert in our team. He has been birdwatching since he was a college student. He has been going to many countries only to be eager to know more birds in the world.
In the course of our climbing, he introduced me every kind of bird we saw and told me the stories related to the birds. I was attracted, at that time, not only by their appearances but also by their beautiful voices.
The expert also told me the relationship between the birds and nature, moreover, which affects our life. He lets me know the importance of conserving the environment. Since then, watching birds has appealed to me. I can not stop doing it.
Furthermore, because I have been gone birdwatching with my wife, now my wife is intersted in watching bird too. She is even thrilled by birds more than me. I am glad about seeing the situation rising. Because more birdwatchers ther are, the stronger the power of the environmental conservation has.
I hope that by exchanging individual experiences on my blog, we could learn more about birds and the Earth.
