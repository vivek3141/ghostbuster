We just moved in a new apartment last weekend. I like it and so my wife does. It was unfurnished. Before we moved in, we had planed to fix it up. Because furniture contributes a lot of part of our budget, we look for the garage sell or moving sell from the local advertisments in order to get more furniture in limited money. Last weekend I drove a borrowed van around several communities. Finally, we bought a used table and chairs but can not find an appropriate sofa, so we have planed the next shopping trip. My wife is really eager to possess one.
In addition, we bought 2 new floor lamps to light up the dining area and living room. In the process of furnishing the apartment, I confuse two things why in the bedroom there is no lamp and why the bulbs are small in most of areas except the kitchen and the bathroom because in Taiwan we have the same lumen. Maybe it just means cultural difference.
After straightening our stuff up, we let the originally empty apartment become a lovely home. We have settled ourselves in our own place well and have a comfortable home to go on our American plan.
