Thank you for your visiting to my blog.

Hello, I am glad to meet you through this web log. I have been studying PHP for several days to make this site. I made this by using a Photoshop, Dream weaver and PHP. Maybe there are some errors in this site. This is because I didn't have enough time to make this and this is the first time, for me, to make a website. However, you don't need to worry about it because I've been correcting those and I've almost done. I worked in a game company, NCsoft in Korea and my part was graphic design of on-line games. So, I have been create a lot game characters, buildings and levels of the game. However, now, I am studying English because I believe that I need to study my part of the game more in U.S.
