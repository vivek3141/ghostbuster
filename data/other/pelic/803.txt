A: Hi, Lisa, Good morning! Do you go to the library today?
B: Yes, I have already ordered a DVD movie in the library. What do you have a plan?
A: Uh, could you pick me up to a Honda dealer near the library?

B: No problem! When are you going to go to the Honda dealer? Are you going to go on to talk about buying new car?

A: Well, I'll have an appointment at 10:00 A.M. I'm going to keep on talking new car's price with a chef of the dealer. If I would talk it into a fair price, I'll think over to check some documents such as car's insurance. Then I'll sign up on the documents, so I'll end up probably driving a new car to come back my home.

B: Very exciting! My god! It's at 9:00A.M. I must wake up quickly!
A: Sorry. Let you awaken early. I'm witting for you .See you later.
B: See you!

B: Hello! Li, I am Lisa, I come up your apartment. Are you ready?
A: Oh!Lisa, can you hold on a second? Let me check my key, I find it out. all right.
