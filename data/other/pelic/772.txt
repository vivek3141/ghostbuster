I have a praise tournament at next Friday. We have singing part and body worship part. My part is body worship part. I like dance so I participate it. When I stand in front of audience I'll be very nervous. Also it's my first time in front of people to dance. I need to practice that. And I also need to practice much when I forgot I can do automatic. I'll practice in this weekend. It's very exciting and I like to practice with my friend group activity is one of interesting things. Maybe I spend all most time in church from morning to evening. When I was a Korea I never thought that. But now I want to try many things. I am trying get rid of my worry. I try to change my mind and America system helps me. For example, in my drawing class, someone's drawing is very bad. But they always keep going. Also they didn't afraid their picture. When I was in Korea I always consider other person's view. So when I did mistake I was very embarrass so I tried nothing. That was very stupid. Now I notice it's very stupid. So I became my character.
