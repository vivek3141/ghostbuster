Subculture

 In the United States, there are many international students from different countries. They have their own culture. I think it is a kind of subculture in America. International students usually have different purposes for coming to America. Some of them came here with their partner. Some of them want to improve their English skill. Others want to go to college or get a masters degree, so they must study hard. Most of international students try to know the American life style. For example, American social activities, behaviors, and beliefs. International students use many methods to improve their English skills. They join many activities to be a volunteer, have part-time jobs, and find a language exchange partner. They make on effort to know more and more about Americans.
