When I was a middle school student, I had mid term. I felt that I was going to get very bad grades. But I ignored my feeling. I got really terrible grades. If I had studied hard, I would have gotten better grades. I wished I had gotten good grades. And I wished I had studied harder. My parents promised that if I had gotten good grades, they would have bought me CD player. If I had really thought about the CD player, I would have studied really hard.
