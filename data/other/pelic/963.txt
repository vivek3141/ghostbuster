I had an experience before two years that taught me the advisability of going with my intuition. I wish I had paid attention to what my inner voice was telling me. I had saved up some money to buy a laptop. My first plan was to have a new one. My friend offered to sell me his like new laptop. Something told me it was defected. Unfortunately, I did not listen to that, and had to suffer the consequences of second-hand laptop.
