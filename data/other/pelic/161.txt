The Stonehenge located on the Plain of Salisbury in southern England is famous. According to archaeological data, the Stonehenge was built in Neolithic times, about 3000 B.C. There are many point of views come up with different version of the Stonehenge. There are many different points of views on the Stonehenge. For example, it might have been used for religious ceremonies; it may have employed the Holy Land to bury hero or noble; or it could have been a calculating machine of an astronomical yearbook. However, I think according to its architecture, it must have been accurately calculated before its construction. And then the people who designed or built it had to have highest wisdom. So the Stonehenge can still exist on the Plain of Salisbury in southern England year after year.
