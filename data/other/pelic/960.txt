"A friend in need is a friend indeed"
A friend is someone who support you when you need support .a friend is someone who give you advises and someone who is always honest with you, someone who try to tell you the truth without fed back.
 Actually, I have a true friend that has all the characteristics above, her name is Amani, she supported me when I needed support, and when I was confused which major fits my interest. She is the one who was with me when I left to U.S. I never met any other friend who makes me feel very close to him. That is the reason why I consider Amani as my best friend.
