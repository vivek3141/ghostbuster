My bedroom is to big, but I can't SETTLE ON a good arrangement to show it by nice view. Alto of furniture I have to PUT THEM UP to get space to move in to the room. There are some tables have to MOVE THEM AROUND. There a lot of paper I should TAKE THEM AWAY to THROW THEM AWAY to keep it CLEAN UP. My picture have to HANGING UP. I TEAM UP with my sister to clean my bedroom to CHEER UP my mother when she come to my bedroom and also, it will keep me and help me to LOOK INTO my things easily.
