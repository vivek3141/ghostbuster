Gaining knowledge comes from every where. You increase your information from your day life experience or from studying at school. Through your life you know a lot of things that you never expect to know. Every incident you go through will allow you to learn something which will help you through out your life. On the other hand, the lessons that you learn in the classroom are the basics of learning which will help you understand life more. I believe that traveling is the essential of learning. I traveled a lot with my parent and I did not realize the benefits that I have I gotten from traveling. However when I got married my husband was not the person who thinks that traveling is important , but when we were traveling together he saw the different between us , and how much knowledge I had from going abroad and connecting with other people from other countries . At that point he recognized that learning dose not come only from studying at school. Personal experience is important to grow your knowledge, but you cannot achieve what you aim to without studying in school. Therefore both personal experience and classroom instruction are important for learning.
