If you are a student, you know that it's not easy to use and manage your time effectively. Even if it's difficult, managing time is a important to success as a student. To make your student life successfully, it's essential for you to spend your time to keep you healthy as well as to study. I'll remind you how to keep your body healthy, because most of students know that this is important, but don't do that.
 At first, you should expend your time to do exercise regularly. Health is the most important thing to achieve what you ant to do. I know that many students are too busy to do exercise. Even though you have no time, you should allot your time for your body even a few hours. If you don't keep your body healthy and lose your health, it would be some problems in your body. Then you couldn't accomplish anything though you really want to do. Thus before you study, you should consider about your health. 
 In addition to do exercise, eating good foods and essential nutrition is also important to students. Many students usually eat their meals lightly or skip their foods, because they think there is no time to eat. In my opinion, that is just a pretense. It's because they don't care about their body. As I told you before, to fulfill what you want, health is important. Eating good foods is as much important as doing exercise for your body. Therefore, you should spend your time to eat meals regularly. 
 I know that most of students are very busy to study. However, all of students should be aware of that not only to study, but also to be healthy is necessary as a student. Even if you have a hectic life, you shouldn't save your time to do exercise and eat meals. After you keep your body healthy, you would success as a student.
