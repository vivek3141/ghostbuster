 Japanese Subculture
 ANON_NAME_0

 In Japan, many people have the chance to go to high school, but in the West of Japan, in Kyoto, some young women who wish to become Geisha often begin their training after completing junior high school. Geisha are female Japanese entertainers whose profession includes music, dancing, communication, and entertainment. For instance, Geisha still study traditional instruments like the shamisen, shakuhachi, as well as traditional songs, Japanese traditional dance, tea ceremony, literature and poetry. Although many Japanese go to college schools or work after they graduated the high school, Geisha are often hired to attend parties and gatherings, traditionally at the tea houses or at traditional Japanese restaurants. However recently, some young Japanese who don't live in Kyoto often visit Kyoto, and pretend to be Geisha. In brief, these visitors wear kimonos and put on the traditional make-up like Geisha. It is one of the problems as those behaviors compromise the Japanese traditional cultures.
