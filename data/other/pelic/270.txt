I would nominate who is the best for my children, and who have experianc, for example: did he rise child befor , what is his/her relagien, did he have stable and secuere home for my children?, and what s/he can provide for them, fainally the most emportant thing is the educational level. 
 then there is sensitive resones like s/he age and health because i need somebody take care of my child not to take care of him/her selfe .
 the guardian relationship sometime affect his/her life with positive or nigative ways so if its stable that mean s/he good for the children.
