When I was elementary school student, I liked sports and music. I could have played baseball or I could have played piano because my coach also wanted me to play baseball and my piano teacher wanted me to play piano too. Actually, I really wanted to play baseball. In Korea, we have to choose playing sports or studying before middle school. If I had decided to play baseball, I might have become a pro ball player. If I had decided to play piano, I might have become a pianist. However, my parents didn't want me to play baseball and I gave up playing baseball.
