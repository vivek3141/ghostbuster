I met my friend Yeongjung while I was attending high school. She and I were attending to the same school. We usually went to school together every morning, and we got along easily. Thus, we have countless memories. When it was her birthday, I was upset because of my mom. I lost my temper. I forgot to say "happy birthday" when we met in the morning. While she was expecting me to say "happy birthday ", I got angry to her unconsciously. When I realized that it was her birthday, she was crying. However, I apologized to her, and she forgave me. After that event, we got closer friends. We are best friends now.
