I like having meals at restaurants. However, some do not. I think having a meal at a restaurant brings good feelings to people.
 First, eating food at home may be comfortable for people who like the style because that is your home that you know well about it and can have everything you need. There must be a lot of things you love there. Therefore, having food at home can make you feel relaxed and comfortable. However, to eat food, you have to cook. If you like cooking, it will not be a big problem. If you do not, it will kind of troublesome to you. One of the reasons I do not like eating at home is this cooking. If you are starving, you cannot eat food soon because you have to prepare it. It might be quite long time to get food. It might make you feel disappointed. In this point of view, eating out has good advantage.
 Next, eating out is really good way to have meals for people because we can have dishes that professional cooks make. You can expect more tasty food that meal you cook. In addition, many restaurants really care about their atomosphere, so it may make you feel euphoric and luxury. If you are down about you job or life, it could bring you some energy to live tomorrow. Furthermore, if you are really busy, it is so convenient because you can save your time. In my opinion, eating out has a lot of advantage for you.
 In conclusion, both eating in and out have both advantage and disadvantage. However, I prefer eating out, and I believe it is a good way for people in this hectic society.
