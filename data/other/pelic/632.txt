Whenever I arrive in my home, it doesn't make me cheer up. There are some kinds of reasons. I live myself in my home, so there are a lot of works to do in home. I have to do the dish, to clean my room, to straighten up all stuffs and to do my homework. Because there is not enough time to do all of my homework, I have no time to do something like housework that I said. So, my room is not always clean. After finish a class, I always think about my home. However, it always makes me crazy because there are a lot to do in my home. Sometimes, I invite some of my friends. Before I let them in my room, I have to clean up my room. If I don't do this , there is no pace to seat. I have been doing housework since I lived alone. I have to go on this kind of work at the end of this semester.
