HI, I'm ANON_NAME_0 . I've been living in america since 2006. I've been building this website for 

a while. And I almost done. I've written this page to introduce my self. I've often been work 

hard. I grew up in al ahssa, saudi arabia. And my family did adventure sports like diving. I've been 

working on bachelor's dgree since 2006 in pitt. since I moved to pitt. I've learned how to dive. 

this month, I've already completed two dives. And, I have a social life, too. actually, last month I 

got engaged to fantastic woman. I've been thinking to bring her here to live together. she 

hasn't been sea diving. but she wanted to try it once.

thankyou,
