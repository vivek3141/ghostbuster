I think that my best friend is my brother. We always get togheter all the time because we live in the same house. Sometimes we let down each other, but we make up the things and our friendship always go on. We really like to play music togheter all the time, so when I settle on to take off to the USA he became sad, but he fugire out that its a great opportunity for me. In a few months I'll come back to my country so we are planning to find out the best way to record some new songs and light up the music feeling.
