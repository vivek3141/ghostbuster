The quality and quantity of stores, the buildings' poor exterior appearance and the streets' shape can make me show the downtown area of Decasia is apparently rapidly decaying. The first alteration we know in his chronicle is that some famous and popular stores such as Pose's Giant Boutique mall, Heartland Department Store, Chandler Theater, and Chez Pierre restaurant have closed or moved out to other cities. Instead of those stores are some low level stores like a pawnshop, an "adult" movie theater and a pornographic bookstore. Also, the quantities of destroyed and dilapidated buildings are increasing in there. Some of them have graffiti such as "the killers" painted on their walls, or have been destroyed by fire. Furthermore, the windows of the old buildings were shattered by stones. Finally, the shape of the main streets can present that the city government hasn't established good policies for their citizens. In the case of Decasia, there are more than forty potholes on the Main Street and the bus service has been discontinued. Both examples indicate that the city government has had some problems and obstructions in promoting the city's policies, and they can't solve them.
