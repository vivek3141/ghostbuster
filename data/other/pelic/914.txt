I think ANON_NAME_0 Wang will be the best guardian. There are some reasons. First, ANON_NAME_0 is Caloine's sister, thus, the children and ANON_NAME_0's relation is a family. Therefore, I think ANON_NAME_0 will provide a loving environment for the children. Second, ANON_NAME_0 is a teacher, so I think she can provide a good education environment to the children. Education is one of the most important thing to raise the children. Finally, ANON_NAME_0 is enough young to take care of the children. She can take care of the children until they become adults. Therefore, I think ANON_NAME_0 will be a good guardian.
 
 I don't think ANON_NAME_1 Crowley will be a good guardian. There are several reasons why I think like that. First, he is divorced, so it will be difficult to take care of the children by himself. Second, he can't provide a stable, secure environment for the children because he has some money problems. Finally, he is too irresponsible to take care of the children. I think his irresponsibility causes his divorce and money problems. Therefore, I think he is the worst nominee.
