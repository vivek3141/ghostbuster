Welcome to my website, everyone!

My name is Nat. I came from Thailand. I've been living in Pittsburgh since August 2006. I'm studying at ELI so I created this website for sharing my experience with you. I've posted a lot of photos and written my diaries.

First of all, I like to take photos ever since I bought a digital camera before I departed from my home country. I have been collecting photos for 7 years so there are tons of photos in my laptop. When I traveled to an interesting place, my friends and I have been taking a lot of photos. Then I sent photos from my camera to my friends and I also got some photos from my friends' camera.

In addition, I have been playing sports since I was child. I've gotten many friends from playing sports. At first I just played sports for staying healthy and having fun. After a while, I had many friends. I also have been watching soccer match, but I have never watched soccer match since I came to Pittsburgh because soccer is not popular sport in this country.

Finally, I just created a personal website so you can share your opinions and comments via this website. I hope you enjoy them.
