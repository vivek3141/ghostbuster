A year of a destroy the downtown in the Decasia
 The down town of Decasia is the big city it had many the places to shop, beginning of the year, Rose's Giant Boutique and Heartland and Department moved to stop there. It had the place to shopping. A lot of company and restaurant wanted to open. On February, it began to have the bad situation. Fore example, some restaurant fired and painted a pornographic picture into the building. So many companies must move to the suburbs because they had worried their life and business. Many business, people demolished the windows from the stone. A furthermore the main stress had more than forty potholes so the downtown just had a less the business and people stay. It looks like the abandoned city.
