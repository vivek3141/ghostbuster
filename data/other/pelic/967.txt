How to get the most out of your computer

 Everything around us needs some care to 

be in good status. For example, every parent 

takes care of their children by feeding them and 

get them a good education to help them in the 

future. If you have a computer and you're care 

of it like what every parent do for their 

children, then you can get the most out of your 

computer. You can do this by support computer's 

system with new programs and updates.

 Programs help computer users to use heir 

computer better. A program is a tool to ransport 

commands from users to a computer, so if your 

computer has excellent programs, then your 

computer will give you an advantage over the 

other computers. There are a lot of programs, 

but some of them are illegal so you should be careful and remember to get your programs from 

manufacturer like Microsoft. For example: there 

are some programs can help you to do your office 

work like Microsoft Office. Sometimes 

these programs after the period become old and 

that isn't useful so you should update your 

programs to be like new, but if your programs 

aren't original and form the manufacturer like 

Microsoft, then you can't update it. Updating 

supports programs with new tools that make users 

use computers with more options and more easy 

than it was. For example, Anti-various programs 

are need to update all the time because 

theses programs have list of various name but 

every day there are new various your Anti-

various doesn't know it, so by update these 

programs you will protect your computer and your 

program got the name of new various. so you 

should search for new programs and the new 

updates.

 I think you have to be well-versed in 

these things and to know what your computer need 

to develop it. Your computer needs good programs 

and care like a child, so you have to do these 

things all the time to get the most out from 

your computer.
