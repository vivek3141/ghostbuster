I want my children's guardian to be my younger brother. Because, nowadays, we are all nuclear family so I don't have many relatives. Of course, I can ask to my friend but I want to ask to my blood relatives. If I need to choose someone who must be a guardian, I'll choose my brother. I am too young to select my future children's guardian now so I don't know what future will be. I don't know he'll get a job or he'll be stable or not. But I choose my brother because just he is my blood relative.
