 General Opinions and Details
 
In my opinion, most teenagers have a bad relationship with their parents, especially with the father. Many teenagers have several fights with their father's everyday. For example, the father wants his son to cut his hair but the boy does not want to. Usually teenagers want to be independent. For instance, they do not like their parents to ask them about their friends. When I was a teenager, I wanted to be independent too. When I became a father, I was surprised that I treated my children the same way my father used to treat me. For example, I get upset with them when they say bad words to older people. Therefore, this made me understand that most parents, especially the father, care.
