My room in Korea is very bright during the day, and I don't need to turn on the light. However, I used to get back home at midnight, I feel that my room is dark. My room is very comfortable and clean. When my house was renovated, I picked out white wallpaper, and I hung up Japanese pictures and 'ARASHI', Japanese singers. All stuff in my room cheers me up when I'm in my room. Before changing my wallpaper, I had posted some post cards about London on the ceiling. When I lay down on the bed, I saw them. Sometimes it made me get scared, because they were gloomy. Then, I took the pictures down from the ceiling. Now It's better.
