Hello! I'm Katsuya. 
I've been making this site to introduce myself.

 I've lived in Pittsburgh for one and three months. Before I came here, I had lived in California for eight months. Before I lived in California, I had lived in Japan. So, I have been in US totally one and eleven months. It will reach two years at next month.

 Now, I have been working in University of Pittsburgh as Post-doc. And, I've also been studying English in ELI to improve my English. When I was working in the lab, I was always working hard. Because it have been difficult for principal investigators (PI) to get the grant to continue their research recently, they have been encouraged post-doc to work hard to get the interesting data for the grant writing. However, if I worked in our lab for whole day and whole week, I thought that it was boring. And, I have been thinking that I should improve my drawbacks, so, I started to study English in ELI. I think that the class is helpful for me, because the teacher's explanation is clear and he emphasizes the important points.

 Recently, sometimes, I was thinking about the differences between US and Japan to know which country is better to live. The living expenses in US are lower than that of Japan. However, the cost of insurance in US is more expensive than that of Japan. 
I like spending the time to think of this, because I felt that my understanding of both countries is getting more and more. 

 If you have the idea regarding which country is better to live, please write down your opinions on the bulletin board (CLICK HERE).
