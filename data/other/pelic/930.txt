I could not study my major in my country because of my scores. I think if I had studied in my country, I would not have been studying my major. I always tell myself if I were in my country, I would live by my family but I would not get what I want. If my parents had refused my scholarship, I would not be in the USA. However, I think my English is not good enough to get my major, so I am studying in the ELI. I would have many problems in the English if I were studying my major. If I got my major, I would say "If I were in an English course, it could be easier to understand".
