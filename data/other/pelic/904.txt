I think the best guardians are Michael Wang and ANON_NAME_0 Wang.

Reasons

1. ANON_NAME_0 and Caroline are sisters. They flesh and blood, even if they are not friendly. Besides ANON_NAME_0 regret about relationship with her sister.
2. Mr. and Mrs. Wang like children, and they don't have children. So, I think they will lover only their nephew and niece.
3. They have stability jobs, but Mrs. Wang told that will resign her job for take care of children. However, it doesn't have problem because Mr. Wang won't resign his job. I think they will enough money for support children. Also, his job is good for children. I think this is ideal household.
