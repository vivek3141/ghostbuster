Topic: My opinion that I have on someone 

 There are several standards can be considered when evaluating a teacher. I thought that teaching English language was required that the teacher spoke clearly and slowly. In the class, (x) is the teacher of English as a second language, but I was surprised that he/she spoke very fast like he was speaking to native students. In addition, I could understand only the main idea from him/ her, so I tried to infer the remaining. At the beginning, I felt that was a wrong way to teach English. However, I changed my mind after a few weeks had passed from the study in order of my personal experience. For instance, after three weeks I could understand many of details, and I heard a lot of words more clearly. In my opinion, it may be better to learn English language in the same way that happens in the street and daily life because that may help student to learn more efficiently.
