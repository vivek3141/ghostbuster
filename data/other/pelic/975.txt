''A good man finds all the world friendly". This is true for me because this person is someone who sees every thing around him positively. One of my friends who lives in my village has the same kindness, whose mentality is to be gentle with everyone; who else is the older than all my friends. He always thinks that a man must be honest to himself first and then to others; although there are some people who are a little bit complicated, or difficult to make relationships with them.
In my village which I grew up, almost all villagers believe, and think that my friend is marvelous person in my village than all of his generation. I remember one day he told me a story which he has had in another country when he was in adventure. According to, his experience which he brought from Senegal. Senegal is country, which is bordered to Mali, he has lived four years there. He said that he had met someone in Senegal. The person he met was a rich and famous man in his country; whose personality was compatible to everyone's personality. In fact, the guy's behavior was the best character he had never met before.
