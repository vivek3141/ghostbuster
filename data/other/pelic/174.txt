Welcome! I'm Hong.
I was in Korea a month ago, but I moved to Pittsburgh in the US.
I have been graduated from University, and I'm 22years old. I've been attending University of Pittsburgh to study English. This website about me was built 3 years ago. It is about me, my interests, and my friends. In 'PHOTOS' section, you can find 'to you' folder. This folder is for you. You may post your pictures and whatever you want. Some friends have already posted their pictures with messages. I have some events for visitors. For example, if you were the 2000th visitor, you could get online-cash from me. The events have been growing more and more. Please check my website and leave you message in 'VISITORS' section. Enjoy my website and thank you!
