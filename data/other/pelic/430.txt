I hate going to the dentist. Every time I have an appointment, I wish to CALL IT OFF. When I go there, I feel afraid and when I LIE DOWN on the chair and the doctor SHOW UP, I almost die. One day while I was HOLDING ON for my turn I saw a girl, she noticed that I looked terrible, she asked me why don't you COME AMONG with anyone you love and feel warm with. I told her if that will help. She said "TRY OUT". Next time, I PICKED my husband UP then I felt better. When I was GOING OUT, I saw that girl again I thanked her. Later, she became my best friend. When we remember how we GOT TOGETHER, we laugh.
