My room is bright, and the sunlight always wakes me up every morning. I like the sunny bedroom. I still remember the first time I saw my bedroom, it was empty. In order to have a good quality of living, I went to IKEA and pick up a lot of furniture to decorate my room. For example, I bought the mirror and hang it on my wall; I bought the desk and put it away behind the windows. Besides decorating my room, I also needed to clean the carpet up. I have lived this bedroom for two months, I am satisfied with it. Although the bedroom is comfortable, I hate the noise which was made up by the train. Because there is a rail near my apartment, when the train passes through, it always brings noise about. I like the quite environment, but it seems impossible. Thus the only think I can do is close my windows down when I sleep. That is the only way to avoid the noise disturbing me.
