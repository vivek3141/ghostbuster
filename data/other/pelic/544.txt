I like my classmates. They are strange and interesting to me. Sometimes I cannot FIGURE them OUT. For instance, some guys SIT DOWN stretching their legs. Teacher might feel uncomfortable. Some classrooms CHEER me UP but some others BRING me DOWN because of its smell.
I love my apartment because it's big and modern. Actually this house was my Korean friend's apartment. She should have LEFT FOR Australia to GO UP her major. Therefore I PICKED this house UP last summer very easily. I think it was very lucky because it is difficult for me to SETTLE ON new environment without house.
