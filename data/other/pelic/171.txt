I met my closed friend while we were eating lunch in the cafeteria. We sit up an appointment on the weekend to see other. We went to the starbucks coffee shop.
When I was talking, he asked me to stop to give the order. After we drank the coffee, we went to the restaurant for eating dinner. When we entered the restaurant, we can't found a table because the restaurant was very crowded and we didn't make reservation.
