Topic sentence: The downtown area of Decasia is rapidly decaying after the businesses outward migrating.

Before the area of Decasia was a heartland and a mythical town in Illinois, but now it has changed. Because a new Town Mall shopping center has built, there are many of the stores are moving out to the Town Mall or around it. For example, the Rose's Gaint Boutique and Heartland Department are move to the Town Mall; and Shank's Men's Clothing Stores moves to the Town Mall in the suburbs. So some of the stores lack of business, they have to close down, such as the elegant Chandler Theater and famous Chez Pierre restaurant. Furthermore, some of the buildings are painted unsightly by drawing the bad pictures or words, when the Decasia is gradually degenerating. After that, people are unwilling to come over there. Then the government won't spend money to recover its' streets. The streets are gradually in bad shape by the potholes that make bus service is discontinued. After all of the elegant stories move out or close down, several sleazy places have opened up. For instance, an "adult"(pornographic) bookstore, an "adult" movie theater and a pawnshop have opened. Finally the downtown area of Decasia is rapidly decaying after the businesses outward migrating.
