Dear zhong:
 I recently want to buy a new laptop. I looked over a lot of information about laptop on computer. I think there are two kinds of laptops are suitable. They are "toshiba" and "dell". Lastly, I decided to purchase "toshiba". First, the display of "toshiba" is 14"play screen. On the other hand, the display of "dell" is 17" play screen. so, the "toshiba" is smaller and lighter than tne "dell". Second, the driver of "toshiba" is "VCD/DVD/burn". In contrast, the driver of "dell" is "DVD/CD/burn". I think the "VCD driver" is more useful to me because the movies that I brought from china were all VCDs. Last, the most important reason, if I purchase "toshiba", I can receive a rebate aboout $150. It let the price of "toshiba" was lower than the price of "dell". I only spend $650 on it.
 Do you think my choice is right?
 Miss you!
 
 love
