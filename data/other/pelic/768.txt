I am planning to get married next may 2007 in my home country with my family and friends. My plan is start from here Pittsburgh because I have to add my wife to my 
I-20 and reserve an appointment in the embassy of the United State of America in Riyadh. It will take time to get the visa which will be the problem I'll face it and it let my fianc√© come with me to the U.S.A. I just receive her paper yesterday afternoon and today I will send them to embassy of Saudi Arabia to translate them to add her with me in the same I-20. However, my father will help me into the expenses that I need it to complete my married party which is cost a lot of many. Some time it cost you up to $ 27,000 in my city and some other cities cost more than this amount I mention. I will be with my family in the same house they live on for temporary then; I will come back to the U.S.A. with my wife and complete our knowledge and studying hard to be success family in the future as we plan together. She doesn't diced yet what she is planning to study computer since or computer programming. I am going to study at the engineering college in the mechanical department and I hope to pass the interview and joined them there at that college.
 After all I hope to every body happy life with their families and I hope to finish my wife visa as soon as possible to join me and both of us joined the happy families with our own life.
