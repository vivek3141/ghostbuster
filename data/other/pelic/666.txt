My home has a very beautiful view. Every day, when I get up ,i turn around the bed and I turn off the A.C, I throw away all the mess . I straighten the dining room up and I clean up the bath room. I keep on cleaning and when I finish ,I go to school .when I came back I hang up my cloth and look over the organization .I gave up doing laundry in weekdays and I post pone it until weekends because it is much easier. In the evening , i call back some friends if i missed their call during the day.
