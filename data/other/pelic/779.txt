San Ya is one of the best places for a tourist to visit in China. This city is in the south of China and near the coast, so the weather is very comfortable in the four seasons: it's not hot in the summer and not cold in the winter; there are various sorts of fresh seafood and the price is reasonable. Therefore, you will be sure to choose this place to visit if you'd like to have a rest and enjoy yourself. You can go there by plane, and it will take you four hours from Beijing. You should buy the plane tickets as early as you can when they are sold, because the price will be much cheaper. You can stay in the hotel which is along the beach. Even the prices of these hotels are more expensive than those is far from the sea, but it's quite convenient for you to have fun on the beach, swimming in the sea, enjoying the sunshine and playing the games. If you're tired, it only takes you a few minutes to go back to the hotel to have a deep sleep. Don't have meals on the hotel, it's very expensive and not taste well. You should go to the small restaurant near the sea, the places aren't luxurious, but the seafood are very fresh and delicious with reasonable prices. If you'd like to go shopping, you should go to DongHai, there're a variety of characteristic foods, teas and clothes. But this place is probably far from the place you stay, so you should go there by tax. I advice you should go with your friends, because they will share the taxi fee with you, and what's more, the more people you go with, the more foods you will buy and the cheaper prices you will get. In the end, welcome to have a trip in Sa Ya, you'll be sure to have a good time.
