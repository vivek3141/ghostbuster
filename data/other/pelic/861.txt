Since starting fall semester, I have had so many parties every weekend, even though it was not a weekend. Because of those parties, I have drunk much beer. Unfortunately, in my case, gaining weight is effected by drinking. Actually, I already knew that. Since 2 weeks after starting new semester, my intuition has been telling me stopping drinking, but I ignored that. Instead of considering my intuition, I just thought that if I had not eaten breakfast and lunch during the day after a party, I would not have gained weight. However, even though I sometimes did not eat anything during the day after a party, I started to gain weight after 2 weeks. I checked weight several days ago. At that time, I wish I had not gained weight, but I could check that I gained 3kg more. When I checked it, I wish I could have lost gained weight in a few days. It is difficult to lose weight. Anyway, I hope I will lose more than 5 kg before I go back to Korea. Now I am trying not to go to parties, instead of that, to study English hard weekends.
