Yesterday, I did a lot of things to FIX my home UP. For example, I THROW AWAY my old dining table. Then, I went to the furniture store to PICK a new one OUT. After that, I TURNED the sofa AROUND, because it was uncomfortable. Then, I HANGED UP my son's pictures. And, I COVERED the dining table UP by a new tablecloth. Redecorating my home CHEERED me UP.
