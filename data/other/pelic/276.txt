I would like to nominate my brother and his wife legal guardian for my daughter. Because they are very nice and they like my daughter and my daughter like them very much. My daughter and their son and daughter have very good relationship, and they are very familiar each other. On the other hand, my brother and his wife have good pay and they are in a good shape. I trust them and they must give my daughter a stable, secure, and happy home.
