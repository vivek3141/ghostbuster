My apartment is nice and big. this apartment cheers up because it let me feels comfortable when I get back from the school. There're three rooms in my apartment. each room has two person. My roommate and I settle on talking the room with bath room. We hang up some posters on the walls in our apartment to do the room up. We always straighten our room up. And we always take the trash away. We usually thinks talking English over between each other. My apartment is really big. So, we have to work out for it. We put schedule up every week. But some people in our apartment bring me down because they didn't follow through with their duty in the apartment. I've been trying to talk them into this. and I try it out.
