Last week I planned to go paintball match' but I lived a healthy problem. I had hard lumbago last days. Therfore I asked my brother could you go instead of me? He accepted my order and he went paintball area yesterday, but yesterday was rainy and cold. On the other hand the other players who all of arabic spoked between native language. My brother didn't understand nothing what they spoked. Even if he played this game, he hadn't a good time. He came to home with funny statue. All wears was coloured and wet. He slept very well last night.
