Some people prefer eat out and some like doing it in home. The restaurant food has a variety of the menu and good prices; also, it is good to go to a restaurant and socialize with your friend. However for everyday evenings I rather a family dinner, because it is healthy good quality food, I can have family conversation with my children and husband during dinner, and it seems for me very traditional.
Because of I like to cook and in my family we use traditional and national food, it is very difficult to find same in a restaurant. The restaurants politics is a food should be testy and looks beautiful, so people will buy it. I believe that in a restaurant you cannot meet good quality food because they do it for a sale, so they do not care about how healthy their food is. In the other hand, when I cook dinner I always think what will be good for my husband and my children.
The next aspect of my preference the family dinner is family conversation. Dinner time is the time to talk. During whole day the parents and the children do not see each other because of work and school, homework, TV, etc. The dinner is the place and time to talk, to ask how they doing, to learn something, and that important to teach children. For example, if you with family in big and fancy restaurant you not able to teach your children manners, how to behave. It is take lots of time to teach children.
The last point is traditions. Neither in my family, nor in my husband family is not traditional to eat in the restaurants.
In conclusion, I would like to headlight, that traditional family dinner is very important for me.
