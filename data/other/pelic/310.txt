The downtown area of Decasia is rapidly decaying

 
 The downtown area of Decasia is rapidly decaying and the reason 

why is because many of the stores are moving out. Also, some of the 

buildings are unsightly. In addition, the street is in bad shape and 

finally there are several sleazy places have opened up.


 Many of the stores are moving out and especially some elegant places 

such as the Heartland Department Store moved in January 23rd. in 

addition, the Chandler Theater closes down in April 5.


 Some if the buildings are unsightly because of the people who wrote 

words on buildings wholes. Like what happened in the building when 

someone wrote "The Killers" in March 3rd.


 The streets are in bad shape like what had been discoverer in June 

15th there were forty potholes are counted in the main street. And also 

in June 3rd the bus service is discontinued.


 There are several sleazy places have open up after the downtown had 

been decaying such as the "Adult" movie theater which opened at the 

old Chandler Theater in September 2nd.


 As a conclusion, these events happened after the downtown had been 

decaying.
