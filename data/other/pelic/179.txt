Hi, I'm Jotard. I've been living in Pittsburgh for a month, and I've built this web site to introduce to you my hobbies.
 I've been playing basketball for more than 10 years, and I really loved it. I've been watching the NBA games since I was a high school student. I've been a captain of my department's basketball team when I studied in college, and I've led my team to win several games. Now in Pittsburgh I still have been playing basketball. I also liked reading comic books, and I will buy it if I liked a comic book very much. I've collected comic books since I was sixteen, and I've had a big library of comic books. I liked painting, and I took drawing class while I was studying in college. Now I've learned about sketching and water-coloring. I've been drawing comics for more than 10 years when I was free, and I loved doing it very much.
 Those three things are my favorite hobbies. If you have the same hobbies with mine, I'm very glad to know you and to share my experience with you. I will continously enjoy them, and I hope all of you can enjoy them forever, too.
