To make tea, nothing is easier, even if sometimes it could be dangerous. First, you need to have hot water. I let you choose the way that you make it. next, you need to buy a box of tea in wallmart or giant eagle. And finally you must use a beautiful cup to put the water and a small pack of tea in. You could also add sugar or/and milk. Don't forget to wait a few minutes before drinking, the tea could be too much warm.
