The Downtown area of Decasia is rapidly decaying. There are four main changes happened to the area. First, many of the stores moved out of the area. For example, In January 3rd, Rose's Giant Boutique moved to The Town Mall. Second, some of the buildings are unsightly. For instance, in February 15th, fire destroyed Boolies Restaurant. Third, the streets are in a bad shape such as potholes. There are 46 potholes in the main street. Final but not finally, several sleazy places have opened up. For example, In September 2nd, An "Adult" movie theater opened at the old Chandler Theater. Since all of these things happened to the area, we can just feel sorry for the area. It is really decaying.
