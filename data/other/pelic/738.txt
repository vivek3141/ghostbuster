Topic Sentence: The downtown area of Decasia is rapidly decaying

 The downtown area of Decasia has been rapidly decaying. Many of the stores have been moving out. For instance, Rose's Giant Boutique moved to the Town Mall shopping center, and so did Heartland Department Store. In stead of losing shops there, unpleasant shops are moving to the downtown. For instance, an "adult"(pornographic) bookstore is moving into the building formerly occupied by Rose's Giant Boutique. In addition, it also lost a entertainment place when the elegant Chandler Theater closed down. Also, an "adult" movie theater is opening at the old Chandler Theater instead. The downtown area of Decasia will be decayed completely in near the future.
