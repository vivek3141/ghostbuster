My Father
 In our lives, the meaning of success is different from one to another. An excellent career is the accomplishment for someone. Having a good family is the achievement for somebody else. For others, all the previous things and more is the meaning of success. In this paper I will write about my father's success, and what contributed most to his success: fate, hard work and intelligence. 
 The first factor that contributed most to his success is fate. When he was fifteen years old he saw his father needed help in his work. I don't know exactly what the work is, but I think it was a gas station. Consequently, he started functioning with him while he was in high school. In that time his family was very poor, this caused him to work hard. After his graduation from high school, he started to employment in many different jobs, for example painter, woodworker and mason. Moreover, when he was seventeen years old he got permission to drive a car, and a truck, also. From the above you can see that he is a hard worker, too.
 The other factor is his intelligence. When any problem happened with our family the first person they call is him, even if there are other people older than him. Also, he volunteered in many community organizations, such as the charitable committee. Now he is a member of the municipality, which is the place where they can share there ideas with the government for there city.
 Finally, I brag about my father and all his accomplishments. I pray to God to fill his life with health, luck and blessings.
