I met my friend Hyunsuk while I was studying to go to a university after I graduated a high school. I failed to enter a university at the first time. So, I registered one institute to study to go to a university that I wanted. My friend Hyunsuk was studying in the same class with me. He wanted to go to a medical college. However, he failed at the first time as me. While we were attending the institute, we helped each other about what I didn't know and my friend didn't. It was not easy to study one more year. Depending on each other, we had a hard and great time. I won't success at the second time without him.
