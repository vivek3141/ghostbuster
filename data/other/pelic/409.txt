The Elders in Taiwan
In Taiwan, many elders believe wedding customs meanings, but young people don't believe them. Traditional customs of marriage are very complex, but some customs have interesting meanings. For instance, most brides eat a longan before they marry a man, a newly wedded couple eats stick rice balls when they arrive at their new house and when they exchange a wedding ring they usually bend their fingers. Elders believe that a bride eating a longan before marrying a man means that she eats her husband's eyes, so her husband can't see other women after they marry. Elders feel when a newly wedded couple moves into their new house means they will start a whole new life, so the eating stick rice balls means their life will come to perfection. Elders think when a newly wedded couple exchanges a wedding band in a wedding ceremony, they usually bend their fingers. A wedding ring means binding. If she or he let their partner put a ring quickly and directly in their wedding finger means 'You can control me easy'. Elders always ask a newly wedded couple to obey all tradition wedding customs. However, young people always think that they love each other, and love makes everything are perfect.
