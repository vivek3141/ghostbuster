When I find our classroom out, I notice that there are windows and it does not block sunshine out into the room. The size of our room is small. It's difficult to turn our desk around but easy to talk question over each other. And Nancy can see all students so that we have to stay up in her class. We don't have any ornament like statue, vessel, or picture in our classroom. It will get better that hanging a picture of flower up.
