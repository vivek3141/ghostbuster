There are different ways to be successful when you raise a child. In that reason, my way in this time to raise my son is different from my mother's way when she raised me. But, in my opinion, all these ways might work .For example, when I was a child, my mother didn't let me help her in the kitchen to cook or to clean, because she was afraid from a gas, electricity and other tools in the kitchen. So, she thought I will hurt myself if I helped her. In this way, I grow up without any knowledge about cooking. But in different way, she helped me with my homework, and she taught and taught me many things about the real life and to an excellent student. For example, how I can take care of my child, who I can solve many problem in my life. So, she was a successful person as a parent. On other hand, I have different way to raise my son. For example, I want him to help me in the house. For instance, helping me wash the car or helping me do the laundry. So, they will have experience about these things when he lives alone. Finally, I think all the parents should do a lot of thing to raise their children in a good day even in different ways.
