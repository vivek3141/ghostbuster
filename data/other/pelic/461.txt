My friend and I
My friend and I GOT TOGETHER ten years ago. He is my sun of mother's friend. Actually, he is older than me 3 years so we hadn't attended any school together. Usually we CALL each other IN if there was a problem. Some times I LET him OFF when he GETS TO me. Also we FIGURE OUT some solutions for our problems. When I was in the university he CLEARS some academic information UP for me. When we call each other after us GETS OFF the phone we tell very stupid things. Lately, he got married. He is a banker now and he CARRIES ON his career. He GOT THOUGH WITH his master degree. Before I come to here I had WORKING OUT with him in the GYM.
