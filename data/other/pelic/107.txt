One of my favorite recipe is Curry Chicken Rice. Start to boil 4 cups of water in a pan, and cook a certain mount of rice. When the water boils, drop your chicken, potato and other vegetables whatever you like into the pan, and 1 or 2 pieces of curry spice solid into boiling water. Rice and curry chicken sauce will be ready at almost the same time. Finally, add your curry chicken sauce on rice, then you can start haveing a delicious meal!
