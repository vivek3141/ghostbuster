My favorite recipe is how to make brownie. First, combining with half cup of butter, two eggs, and ¾ cup of sugar. Secondly, put ½ cup of flour, 1/3cup of cocoa flour, and ¼ tea spoon of breaking powder in another container, and mix them well. Thirdly, putting the materials of step 2 into the first one, and mix they well. Then put them into a container and put it in stove for 275F, 25 minutes.
