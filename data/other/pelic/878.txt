After working three years in Dammam College as a student affair coordinator, I felt that it is better for me to change the college I'm working in. I went to Girls Educational College and I spent nine months working there. I whish that I had not changed the place I'm working at. If I had asked more about the Educational College, I would not have changed my college. I would have had a better position if I had stayed in Dammam College. I hope that I will work at Dammam College when I go back to Saudi.
