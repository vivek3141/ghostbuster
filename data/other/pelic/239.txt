Writing in English

Here are few instructions for typing in English. English sentences begin with a capital latter, and they usually end with a period. Hold the shift key down and type a letter to make a capital letter. Use the space bar to put one space between words. Also, put one space after a comma and two spaces after a period. Don't put a space between a word and comma or period. Don't hit the enter key at end of a line.
Use the enter key when you come to the end of a paragraph. Then, you can start the new paragraph on a new line.
