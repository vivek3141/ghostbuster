This weekend 
 I am planning on doing many different things because this weekend will be long for me. First of all, I will go to the California of Pennsylvania to visit my friends because we have not seen each other for long time; their name are Alou and Fah. Alou is coming to pick me up at 8p.m tonight. When I will get there, I will cook a delicious food for them, but I really do not have idea about what I am going to fix. Then, on Saturday's afternoon we will go to the movies to watch a new movie; the name of this movie is "The Protector". Next, on Sunday I will back in Pittsburg maybe around 5p.m; then I will do all my homework in order to be relaxed on Monday.
