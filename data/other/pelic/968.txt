CHOOSEN A GUARDIAN

 My notice for the persons that will be the best guardian of the minors Meredith and Andrew Crowley are ANON_NAME_0 and Michael Wang .First ANON_NAME_0 there antis and she can quiet jab to spend a full time with the children. Second the parent also young, healthy and they have a house it's large enough for the children .lastly they don't have children they wants too but they can't. 
 I think ANON_NAME_1 Crowley is the person that will not be a good guardian because he is a bachelor, irresponsible to take care of children and himself. Also he has money problems.
