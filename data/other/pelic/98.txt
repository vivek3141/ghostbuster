I will talk about something related to cocking. and will talk about my favorite recipe which is how to make barbeque. First, you have to cut the meat and chicken in small pieces to easy or very quick cocking. Then, you have to put the meat and chicken in spicy with lemon and salt for at least 45 minutes. This mixture will make the food very delicious. After that, the meats are ready to put up on fire for 45 minuets. After 45 minutes the food is ready to eat.
