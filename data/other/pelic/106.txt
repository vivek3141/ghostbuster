I met my girl friend, Ann, while I was studying in college. While I was studying in the second year, she was beginning studying in her freshmen year. Because we were both interested in playing basketball, we were both participating in our department's basketball club. One day when we were talking, she told me that she was studying English in LTTC (Language Training and Testing Center) every night. I started to take her home by bicycle when she finished her class at p.m.9:30 every weekday. Our relationship was closer day by day, and finally we fell into love.
