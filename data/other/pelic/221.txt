Today my friends think of me as a serious student, but they don't know my "stupid" phase. Until two years ago, I hade thought mostly about clothes and makeup, and I usually hade judged people by their appearance and possessions. In that period of my life, my friends and I always spoke in stereotyped phrases. We said "Hel-LO?" when something seemed obvious, and "Whatever" when we didn't care about something. I never wanted anyone to realize that I was interested in school. Sometimes I read the newspaper secretly and pretended to be unprepared for tests. One say, my older brother came into my room while I was reading a serious novel. No one had ever seen me do that before even though I was an avid reader for years. He thought I was pretending to be interested in the book in order to impress a new boyfriend. I got angry when he laughed at me, so I made a decision. I stopped hiding my real interests. Since that day, I have carried my news magazines proudly and have expressed opinion in class. For the last two years I have been preparing for tests openly. Now I am applying for college, and I feel proud of being a good student.
