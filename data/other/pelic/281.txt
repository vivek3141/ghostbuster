If I will nominate a legal guardian, I will choose ANON_NAME_0 Crowley. In my opinion, I think ANON_NAME_0 Crowley is the best guardian. He has a relationship with the children. They are his nephews. That's why, I chose him. Doesn't matter, if he and her wife are divorced. I think he has to be the guardian to take care of the children. As I told you, they are his nephews, so he cannot let them live with strange person.
