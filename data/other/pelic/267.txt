Yesterday, I went to a hospital that severs for unability people. Some old people can only sit on the wheelchair. Some people can stand with nurse help. Some people can walk but very slow. They all need help. And their life in the hospital is ok. There are some people teach them drawing, do handwork, and they can watch TV, talk with other people, go out breath fresh air and feel sunshine if they want. Tamao told us this is the U.S. culture. If the people is old, their relation well help them find a good place like the hospital and send them to live in there instead let old people live with them.
