Some people said, "Not all learning takes place in the classroom." Also some people don't agree with this. In my opinion, I can't agree with it more. Definitely, going to classroom and learning knowledge is necessary for everyone. It helps us to create general ideas of this world. However, the world changes every second. Thus, I believe there are some reasons to say that learning from real experience is more important than from classrooms.
First of all, we can only get rudimentary information in the classroom, but we should go outside to practice how to do more. For instance, in the English speaking class, we study some polite way or formal way to communicate with native speaker. But in the real world, people sometimes change their talking style a lot. As in Pittsburgh, usually people use "what's up" or "how's going" to replace "how are you." In fact, we have never learned "how's going" in the classroom. However, it makes people closer.
Another importance is that even though we learn some ideal information from books, it's not always fit the true world. For example, many people learn how to cook from books, television, or cooking class. We have lots of instructions for cooking. Actually, there are too many variables which may affect your food such as personal taste, temperature, different brand of flavor etc. Thus, follow books not always refers to making a delicious food. Instead, it depends more on experience. 
In my opinion, because we need to learn more from the real world, and to adjust our knowledge to fit the reality, we should not only depend on studying in the classroom. In the contrast, going outside to get more experience will be a better choice.
