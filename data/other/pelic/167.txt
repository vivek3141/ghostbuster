Younghun is my best friend. His facial appearance is very sharp. He usually remains his hair short like a soldier. His facial shape is oval. He has dark black eyebrows over his black eyes, which are small and thin eyelashes. Sometime when he looks angry, I'm scared to talk to him. He has a small mouth, with lips which are always pink. When he smiles, white the upper brighten up his whole face. His nose is straight, but not high. Even though his first impression looks sharp a little bit, you should recognize him to be placid.
