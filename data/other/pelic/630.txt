The downtown area of Decasia is rapidly decaying. It has been suffering from a lot of problems lately. For instance, it used to be known for its many high class boutiques and stores. Many of the stores are moving out. For example, on last January 3rd,Rose's giant boutique moved to the town mall shopping center. A Few days later the Heartland department store also moved to the town mall. Furthermore, other famous stores moved such as Shank's men's clothing store which also moved to the town mall in the suburbs. In fact, many of those stores have been replaced by sleazy places, like the "adult" bookstore which moved to the building previously occupied by Rose's Giant Boutique. Such incidents have really affected the downtown area negatively, which caused to its decay.
