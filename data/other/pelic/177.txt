Hi. I've been living in Pittsburgh since 2006. I've called Esther in America. I enjoy playing several sports. When I lived dorm I used to play squash, badminton. I also like outdoor sports. For example, rafting, golf, skiing. When I was in Korea I wanted to go to whistler. It was my dream. I have been drawing for 10 years. I've been learning new drawing skill, so I'm as interested in it. But I've never been swim. It's very nervous. It is my hobbies. I was reading a book while I was used to drinking. It's one of my habbit.
