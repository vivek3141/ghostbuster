I'll tell you raising a child. When we were a child we need several things. It can be help us to be successful life. First of all, child develops an original idea. I think child should see many things for example, go museum; library, stadium, music hall, and something like that. In my country generally parents didn't bring there. I know children need knowledge, but also they need develop an original idea. Second, preschool education is important. Children learn very quickly, and they remember a long time. In my case when I had taught a child I can remember, for example, song, playing piano, and riding bicycle. Now in my country, children learn English, even though they start 4years old. Third, parents don't let them have unbalanced diet. They try to overcome your likes and dislikes. Their physical strength based on when they was children. Finally, when we were children we based on various experience. We can decide our aptitude easily. Then we can be successful life.
