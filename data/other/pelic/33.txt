How to fail a test

 There are several ways for how to fail a test and I am of the best students in the ELI who knows how to fail a test. First of all, in my opinion you have to absent in most classes and if you came to the class you should provoke your teacher because that makes your teacher to be dislike you and this is the first thing to fail a test. For example, I have repeated reading class because I provoke that teacher and then let me fail a test. Second, if the first one doesn't work with you then, I recommend you to cheat in the test so, that you put your teacher in no other choice after that, he or she will give you 'f ' grade in the test. Finally, if you don't want to make trouble with your teacher by simply way don't answer to any question in the test and then you will make as heroes have done before.
