About a month ago, I waked up in the morning as usual. While I was preparing to go to a school, my mother called me suddenly. At that time, I was washing my teeth, so I said I would call her back. Until that day, my mother had never called. I usually had called to her. Before I called her back, I thought over what was going on in my home. I thought there had been some big problem. I picked up a phone with worry. After I talked with my mother, I figured out the big problem was that a charge of cell phone was too expensive. She said not to use a cell phone a lot. After I hanged up, I felt easy that there was any problem in my home. However, I was disappointed with my mother, because a charge of cell phone was the only reason makes her call to me.
