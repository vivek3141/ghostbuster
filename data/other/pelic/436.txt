I would like today to talk about my best friend; his name is Soul; who I lived with for a long time. By1993, I had gotten with him because we both grew up in the village. We also used to go out together. In 2002 he dropped out of school to go to the market in order to win money. He helped his father out in their store. He worked for a few months on that. Then, he finally checked Mali's business out; Mali's business was not good for him as America's do. When he picked up this idea; he looked for an American's visa. After getting the visa he organized a party in his house, and invited all of his friends to the party. I really played around that day. After that time I missed his accompany and advice. Now we are both living in America. We keep on our friendship; and everyday I call him up.
