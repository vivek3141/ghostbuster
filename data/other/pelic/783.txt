When I was ANON_NAME_0, once I went to south Taiwan with my father, and my mother was at home, she didn't go with us. I missed my mother so much, thus one day night, I picked up the phone, and dialed the telephone number of my home. I supposed that it must be my mother picked up the phone, therefore I said "Mother" in stead of hearing the voice was my mother or not. At that time, there came a confused voice from the other side, and told me that she is not my mother, and hanged up politely. That made me confused. I thought I remembered the telephone number of my home, maybe I had a mistake and dialed the wrong number. I didn't give up, and kept on dialed the number. It also came the same voice and told me she is not my mother again. I hanged up the phone again, and also confused. Fortunately, my father came to me at that time, and asked me what I was doing. I told my father that I wanted to call my mother, I dialed the correct number, but that woman said that she is not my mother. My father laughed and told me that if I am in different city, I need to dialed area code in front of the telephone number, and that's why I still can't contact with my mother. Although it happened 20 years ago, now I still remember how happy I am when I finally heard my mother's voice form the phone.
