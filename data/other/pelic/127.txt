"Not all learning takes place in the classroom"

 Gaining knowledge is a major feature of human revolution. Human societies develop by time through knowledge transition of one generation to another. Knowledge gaining can be achieved in many different ways. One typical way is gaining knowledge in the classroom. Although, it has been said, "Not all learning takes place in the classroom," there are other approaches to gain knowledge.

 Moreover, knowledge can be gained from personal experience. I think that the knowledge gained in the classroom instruction is not more than 10% of ones knowledge. That because the knowledge delivered in classroom is very limited in quantity and time.

 On the other hand, knowledge gained form personal experience is much richer. This includes the knowledge created from classroom instruction after critical thinking and extra personal study. Furthermore, the real life interactions within society is a great mine of knowledge too, including all kinds of human interactions such as in work, home, school, market and so on. 

 As conclusion, knowledge gained from real life is much significant than the knowledge gained from classroom instruction. Consequently remember that "Not all learning takes place in the classroom."
