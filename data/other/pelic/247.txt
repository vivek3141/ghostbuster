My favorite restaurant is Sushi Too. It is on Walnut Street. It is Japaness restaurant. Menu is sushi, noodle etc. When I visited to Japan. I ate sushi. It was very delicese. So I still love it. This restaurant's shusi is very good and fresh, so I like it. And this restaurant is very quite. I don't like loud sound music, so I like this restaurant. Finally this restarant is close my house. I live in Shady Ave. I can walk to go Walnet Street. So I ofen go to restaurant. I went to go there yesterday.
