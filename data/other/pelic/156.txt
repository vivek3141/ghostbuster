 Welcome! I'm ANON_NAME_0. I'm from Turkey. I built this website to introduce myself to you. I am an English-Turkish translator. I've just graduated from university on 2005. Since I am a freelance translator I enjoy my job a lot. The best part of being a freelancer is that I don't have a boss. I just accept the translations which I want to do and I refuse to accept others. I can translate everywhere as long as I have a computer to work on.

 Now I'm in Pittsburgh to improve my English. It's my forth time in Pittsburgh. My sister has been doing her residency in internal medicine in UPMC for more than 2 years. I usually come to visit her, almost twice a year. She has adopted two cats which are brothers and I enjoy being with them when she is in hospital. Actually I have 2 dogs in my country. I love animals a lot. I've always had pets at home since my childhood. Just the sight of them makes me very happy!

 Swimming is my favorite sport. I always go to swimming including winter. When I swim I get rid of my problems more easily just like I'm leaving my worries in the water. There is nothing in the word that makes me more comfortable. I also enjoy walking by listening music. It makes me relax.

 I like listening music everywhere. I think music is the only food for the soul.
Reading a book takes me to a different world. It helps me to leave the reality.
 
 The other things I'd like to sometime in the future are sky diving and underwater diving.
 
 It's all about me for now. I will add more information and photos to my website as soon as possible.
