Unit 3

 Hi, I am ANON_NAME_0, this is my website. I welcome everyone to enjoy it. I have been getting a lot of experience for my life in the United States for three years. I designed this website to share my interested stories; it included sad or happy, successful or failing, stupid or wishful. I really expect to help your life. 

I have got a drive's license since more than two years. In fact, this experience to me was very difficult. In 2004, I just hoped to drive a car to go to anyplace maybe that was my one of American dreams. I practiced driving skills very hard, but first the road test failed. When I was tearing, I practiced again. In my birthday, I received a special valuable present from myself that I passed the road test, and then I took a drive's license. Lately, I have been driving less than 5'000 miles.
