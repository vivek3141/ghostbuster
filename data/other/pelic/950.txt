It is very difficult to say that sport is the most popular one in the United States. More people watch a baseball than any other sport. Because there are so many professional baseball games (each team plays 162 games per year). But the average attendance figures for professional football is higher although there are not so many games (only 16 games for each team per year). In addition a basketball is also popular. Especially in the big city, there are several other sports which have milions of fans. These include ice hockey, soccer, golf and tennis. But there is no single sport that dominates the whole country.
