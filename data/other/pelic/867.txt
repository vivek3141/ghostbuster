A few years ago I had bought a brand-new car. 
One day morning, I didn't feel like driving it all of sudden.
Looking back on the situation now, I wish I had paid attention to my intuition.
However, I ignored what my inner voice was telling me.
In the evening of the day, my brand-new car got hit by a taxi.
If I had not drive it, I shouldn't have paid a lot of money for fixing my car. 
If I had believed in my tuition, I might not have been so sad.
If only I hadn't drived it.
I wish I wouldn't have a trying experience again.
