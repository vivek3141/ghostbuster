For example, the Rose's Gaint Boutique and Heartland Department moved to the Town Mall, also Shank's Men's Clothing Stores moved to the Town Mall in the suburbs. So some of the stores lack of business, they had to close down, such as the elegant Chandler Theater and famous Chez Pierre restaurant. Furthermore, some of the buildings were unsightly because drawing the bad pictures or words. After that, people are unwilling to come over there.
