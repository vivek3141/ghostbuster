The Champions

 Do not forget this you have to feel it before you do it. Right now I am studying in the ELI in Pittsburgh PA. ELI is the English Language Institute where I am looking for some ability in academic English. Pittsburgh is where the Pittsburgh Steelers are. While I am here I am learning how to be a Pittsburgh Steelers Fan. Actually, I am a Steeler's fan right now from the deep of my heart. To be a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers you must do few things. These things are:

1. First, you always must always buy the t-shirt of the quarter-back Ben Rotheslberger.

2. Then it needs you have a "terrible towel". This is a gold towel that the people waves each time when they wants a touchdown. 

3.The third thing that you need is to have black and gold paints. These paints you have to put on your face and this means that you are a very big Steelers fan. 

4.Finally, the most important is that you need the hair of Polamalu. Polamalu is the one of the players that has the crazy hair. This is the hair that I have and so I am a very good fan.

If you have all of the things then you are really a good Pittsburgh Steelers Fan. The Steelers are one of the most important parts of Pittsburgh and that is why it is important to know how to be a good Pittsburgh Steelers fan.
