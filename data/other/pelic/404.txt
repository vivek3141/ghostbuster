Yesterday, I called back my best friend zhong. I cheered up when I hung up the call. Zhong told me that she had been pregnant. Look over our friendship, it has a long history. We got together at our middle school. We had been living a same laborhood. So, we picked out each other as best friends soon. At that time, we always played games, went back together after school. She liked to straighten her room up, but I was lazy, so she always helped me clean my bedroom. Later, I took off to the U.S. with my husband, but we has kept on touch by phone.
