When I arrived to Pittsburgh I found some difficulty in using the phone. One day, I wanted to set up a dental appointment. She asked me to sign up on line and fill out my information but I can't figure out what she said because my English was bad.
So, I told her ok and I hung up. Then, I asked my friend to call her back to figure out what she wants.
