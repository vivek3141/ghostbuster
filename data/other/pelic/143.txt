Welcome! I'm hot4. I have been living in pitt

 since 2005 with my husband. I built this website

 to introduce myself and make some friends who 

have the same interests and hobbies with me. I was

 a biology teacher at middle school in China. I 

enjoyed my job and loved my students. I have been

 enjoying reading and shopping. I have saved many 

nice essays in my website since 2003. We could 

talk about them on web if you like them too. I 

have collected many wonderful trinkets. Such as 

beautiful necklaces, strange bracelet. I have 

included more pictures about them. Just click on

 the link to see them.
