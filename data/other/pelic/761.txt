We are always thinking about how to pass a test, because sometimes it's hard to pass a test. However, it's not hard at all to fail a test. If you want to fail a test, the easiest way is not to study any more, and that might let you fail a test tomorrow. Besides don't study, sleeping when you have a test is also a good approach to fail a test. Because you don't write any answer on the exam, you can easily fail in the test. Another way to fail a test is you can absent that day. If you really want to fail in the test, having an absent is the most convenient approach to achieve that goal, and you can use that time to do whatever you want. It seems perfect! See, it's not hard at all to think about many ways to fail a test. Maybe there are much more ways to fail a test than to pass it!
