Subcultures in Japan

In my opinion, Geisha and Maiko are famous in Kyoto, especially in Miyagawa-cho and Gion. They dress in kimono and entertainment people by singing, dancing and talking in drinking party. Maiko are young girl of fifteen to twenty, and Geisha are woman of twenty and over. This job seems to be gorgeous on the surface, but I believe it's a really difficult job. There are some reasons why I think it's a difficult job. First, they work at the old Japanese traditional teahouse, and live in there. In one teahouse, there are about five to ten people. Second, they work from 6:00p.m. until after midnight every day. Last, they must learn the way of speech, song, dance, and convention. So contrary to all appearance, this job is hard.
