Two months ago, I traveled to New York, San Francisco, and Vancouver. When I was in San Francisco, my friend took me to the most famous sight, the Golden Gate Bridge. It was a cloudy and windy day. I wish I had not ignored my intuition that I should have asked someone to take pictures for us. However, I used a tripod to set up my camera. Suddenly, a violent wind blew and by camera with the tripod was fallen down. Unfortunately, the lens hit the ground directly. Thus, my camera was broken. If I have not neglected my inner voice, I would not have needed to spend money to buy a new camera. But thinking positively, in Chinese saying, if the old one is not gone, the new one will not come. Therefore, if my old camera hasn't been broken, I wouldn't have had a new one. Also if I have a chance to visit San Francisco again, I will go to the Golden Gate Bridge one more time, with my new camera.
