Doing a specific Job

 Doing a job for a specific purpose is so wonderful in this life. For example, helping people in the most pauper Islamic occasion AL-Ha'aj "The pilgrimage". Pilgrimage is the Islamic occasion comes every year in the Maca city. In this time around 3~4 million of the pilgrimage form all the world, different nationality and different culture came to this city. Maca is a small city located in the western regain of The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It is difficult to find your place in this city unless you know this place very well. So a lot of those people "pilgrimages" could not find their place easily and they lose. By helping those people I feel success, because they are coming for specific purpose and once I helped them to find and finish their purpose I really feel good and success. I helped them by describe them the Maca city, Mena, Mosdalefh and Arefat places easy direction and the short cut to reached the place. On the other hand, handle some their problem is really great because you see them feel better once you help them.
