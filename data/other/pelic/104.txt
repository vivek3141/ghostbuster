Some might think that many cultural differences about the expectation of success for males and females still exist. As far as I am concerned, however, the difference has almost disappeared. Whether people succeed or not depends on their skills using time and their professionalism.
 In a dog-eat-dog society, it is more necessary to have the ability to compete with others in many areas such as studying, taking a job and marketing. In other words, the people of the modern society do need to have a skill to process their works faster than others do. As society is getting more intricate, people are getting busier. Therefore, the time is more important than before. In the past, people recognized time is just lapse or natural phenomenon, but now time is not only opportunity but also money; money is money. For example, in the automobile business, what is important is how many cars are sold in a certain time.
 Today, our society requires professional persons with particular skills like doctors, professors, and computer engineers. Thus, a person who has professional and outstanding skills such as fixing, studying and analyzing will be successful in a modern society; it does not depend on whether the person is a woman or man, or his/her nationality. What is important is not whether the person is male or female but whether the one has superior skills than other irrespective of their culture. For example, in former days, it was common sense that women should stick indoors and do housework the whole day in Korea. However, nowadays, opportunities regarding studying and having a job are granted for women equally with men. It is also true in Europe, in America and even in the Middle East. Now, women are able to enjoy success irrespective of culture. Therefore, I think no more different expectations of success for male and female exist.
