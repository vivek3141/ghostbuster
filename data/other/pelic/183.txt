Raising a Child

Childhood world is really interesting. I have tow kids and everyday I see some thing deferent and new such as talking, walking and strange acts. Step by step, raising children is the most default mission and that makes the successful at it more beautiful. I believe that a child is like dough I can shape it any way I want but it might be smashed. The first time I feel the successful after I saw my daughter can hold the spoon and feed herself.
I saw it again when my son respects his old sister not just like I tough him but better. Actually, sometime I feel disappointed and blame myself for any misbehavior they did like bad words or hitting a friend but I said that the childhood world and I do my best.
