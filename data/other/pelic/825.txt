Writing Habits 

 I do many things before I start to write. For example, I take showier, I eat something,

 then I make my favorite tea, I turn on the music or the TV, because I like a relaxing 

environment for study , after I do this activity, I make outline to support my subject .then 

I organize my idea, and write it down.
