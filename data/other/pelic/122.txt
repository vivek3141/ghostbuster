 The person I want to describe is the most important person in my life. His eyes are smiling you can see the faith in his eyes when you look at it. When you look at his moon shape face you can feel his kindness. You can feel his wisdom when you hear his deep voice. You can smile his aroma perfume when he enters any place. This guy is my father the most important man in my life.
