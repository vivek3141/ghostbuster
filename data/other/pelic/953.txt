A writer one said a true friend is somebody who can make us do what we can do. I think he meant the good friend always encourage and persuade you to do the right thing to become better, and I agree with this writer.
When I was in high school, my best friend was someone who was encourages me to study to take high grade. Actually, I have a lot of friends. One of them, who was in primary school, talked to me in order to discuss our homework. Another one, who is older than me, often gives me advice when I have problems. My best friend, who is my sister, keeps my secrets. And, my activity's friends are people who play with them football game. I need all my friends to better than I am.
