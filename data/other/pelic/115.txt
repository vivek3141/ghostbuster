When I was in Germany, I met a friend who was from America. His name was Devon. He was very funny guy. when I met him first, his voice was very deep. He had brown hair color, and brave and blue eyes. Also he was very tall and looked very strong. In addition, he looked pained because he had a big bruiseon his left eye. So I scared.
 However, after we knew well each other, his voice changed melodious and his eyes changed smiling. he always smiled and he always wanted to know about my country. I realized I was wrong when I met him first. so now I'm very happy to know him and after this semester, I'm going to Oragon to meet him, my friend Bulldog!!
