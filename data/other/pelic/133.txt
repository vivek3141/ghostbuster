There are many qualities of a good neighbor in the world. I think we have different opinions about the qualities depending on what a person value. I would like to mention two qualities in my experience, such as a neighbor who is not very noisy, and who is able to clean their environment by themselves.
 Fist of all, one of the qualities of a good neighbor is not to make a lot of noise, particularly at night. When I was a freshman, I moved to new house near my school because my school was very far from my family's house. During first year in my college, I was living on first floor in my new house with one neighbor who was living on second floor in the same house. My neighbor liked listening music, dancing as well. One of her hobbies was dancing with loud music. Every day after finishing school, she almost always practiced dancing with loud music. Otherwise, I like reading book, so I was very tired of it. One day, I complained about that, but she pretended to accept my opinion. And she continued dancing. 
 The other quality is cleanness. Unfortunately, she was not used to cleaning her house. She always piled up her trash in her garbage. She didn't care the smell, and some insects from the trash. Sometimes, I tried to clean some of them when I threw my trash. After a while, I thought that it was better to move to the other house. Hopefully, my contract of the house was almost finishing.
Although I have lived with a bad neighbor once, I realized a big instruction from the experience which is that I have to consider of neighbors more carefully than appearance of houses when I look for new house.
