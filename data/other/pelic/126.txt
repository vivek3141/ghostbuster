1. It has been said, "Not all learning takes place in the classroom." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from personal experience with knowledge gained from classroom instruction. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?

 It has been said, "Not all learning takes place in the classroom." It means knowledge gained from personal experience could be more important than knowledge gained from classroom instruction. I totally agree with it.
 Painting is one good example. Many great painters created their own masterpieces without formal education. Of course, one could learn a lot of important knowledge in the classroom. For example, there are introduction on famous painters and their masterpieces, the history of painting, the way to enjoy paintings, and so on. But, there is no better instructor than nature in painting. Think Gogh's sunflower. If he were a good and normal student, he must not create that intensive and gorgeous color. 
 Business is the other good example. People have learned a lot of knowledge and skills on how not to fail. They have red a lot of cases, have discussed those cases, and have thought they have got enough. They might become good analysists or good consultants. But, they hardly could become owners of successes because most remarkable successes have come from experiences of failure. The most powerful lesson comes from trials and errors that people have experienced in person.
 knowledge gained from classroom does an important role to set up basic frame on how to see and how to think about the world. But, knowledge gained from personal experience can add more value and more powerful inspiration to the people.
