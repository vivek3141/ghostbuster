How to choose a college or university

 There are many students who want to enter a college or university. They have to consider at least these three things: entrance exam scores which they got tests, location of the college or university, and the tuition of the college or university.
 First, they have to choose a college or university which fits with their scores. If the college is higher than their scores, they would not enter the college. For example, when one person got scores half of the whole scores, one wants to enter Harvard University, it is almost impossible to enter that. Therefore, they must select some colleges or universities which they are able to enter with their scores.
 Second, not only their grades but also the location of the college is important. The environment also influences students and their studies. If the college is located next to factories or work areas, they would not concentrate on their studies and could get stress. There might be some people who like noisy environment, but quiet environment may be good at their study. Therefore, they have to choose a college or university which is located in more convenient or quiet place.
 Third, this is important. If the college's tuition is very expensive, and the students can't pay, they can't go to that college. They have to choose a college which they can afford. If the tuition is expensive, they should have part-time jobs. Especially they have to work almost a day, they couldn't concentrate on their studies perfectly. That would prevent them from studying. Part time jobs which are adequate to them may be good to them, but if the part time jobs are beyond their ability, the part time jobs would be burden to them.
 If they choose a college or university which satisfies the three categories, they choose one perfectly. There are other things that they have to think about, but it is enough to choose a college. These three are the most important things they have to consider.
