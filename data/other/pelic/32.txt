Base on the different situation I ususally use the different organization to suit it. For example, when I wrote a list of cooking, I might choose a organization by time. But if I did a essay which decribed how to be a good student, something like that, I might like organizing it by importance. So, I might choose one or two instructions to finish my work. Just use the best way to do it.
