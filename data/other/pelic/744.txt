Yesterday I wanted to SIGN Amazon site UP but I failed. So today I tried to DO it OVER. It worked then I bought a squash racket. When I stay at home I don't like to disturb my time. I usually do surfing internet, reading a book, doing homework, and I usually don't PICK the phone UP. So I always CALL them BACK. Then I CLEAN them UP. Then I CARRY ON my work. One of my hobbies is to LOOK AFTER plants. When I see plants I feel comfortable and refresh my mind. But I'm lazy so before my friend come to my home I CLEAN UP my room and wash my cloth. I usually don't do that. It's my life pattern.
