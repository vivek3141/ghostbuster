The downtown area of Decasia is rapidly decaying. Many of the stores are moving out. For example, in January, Rose's Giant Boutique and Heartland Department Store moved to the Town Mall shopping center. In August, Shank's Men's Clothing Store moved there too. Several sleazy places which make the downtown decay have opened up. For instance, an "adult"(pornographic) bookstore moved into the building formerly occupied by Rose's Giant Boutique at March 19. In September, an "adult" movie theater opened at the old Chandler Theater which was elegant and closed down in April. A pawnshop opened where Chez Pierre which was a famous restaurant and closed down for lack of business in May used to be at December 1. As time goes by, the street is getting worse in bad shape. Thirty-six potholes were counted on Main Street in February, forty potholes were counted after about 4 months. To make the downtown more miserable, bus service was discontinued. Some of the buildings have become unsightly. The remains of Boolies's Restaurant which was destroyed by fire in February were condemned at August 1. In November, all of the windows of the old Heartland Department Store were shattered by stones.
