My favorite restaurant is a small restaurant in my hometown. I go to this restaurant about 3 times each week because the food that was cooked by chef in this restaurant are very delicious. This restaurant is not very large and only have eight tables, so there has no more people in there. I like eating my dinner in a quiet place. This restaurant offer to simple chinese food. They are simple food that are common food in chinese family.But the taste is diffenert from common family.My favorite food in this restaurant is "pepper frill meat".
