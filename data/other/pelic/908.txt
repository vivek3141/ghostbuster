It is very difficult to say which sport is the most popular in the United States. For example, more people watches baseball than any other sport, but that is because there are so many professional baseball games (each team play 162 games per year). The average attendance figures for professional football are higher although there are not so many games (only 16 for each team per year). Basketball is also popular especially in the big cities. In addition, there are several other sports that have millions of fans. These include ice hockey, soccer, golf and tennis there is no single sport that dominates the whole country.
