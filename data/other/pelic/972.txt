From elementary school to university, I met a lot of good friends who still have good contacts right now. Some friends we chat with each other by internet once a week; others may only meet each other once a year. Although the frequency of meeting my friends is not the same, we still keep good friendship between each other, no matter where we are or what we are doing.
 Many people may say that "A friend in need is a friend indeed." I agree with it. Take myself for example. When I was in the university, I met a classmate whose name is Peter. We are not good friends at that time. One day, I got an invitation which comes from a boy. That boy invited me to see a movie. I thought it must be a group of friends to see this movie, thus I promise I will go. But after few days, that boy told me that only we two go to see the movie. I was surprised, and I didn't want to go to see a movie just two people, even I didn't know that boy well. Therefore, I got a bad mood that day. After class, Peter saw me, and asked me what happened. I told him the reason and asked him to help me think about an excuse which I can give to that boy. Peter told me that if I really didn't want to go to see a movie with that boy, I should tell him and did not go with him. Peter also told me that if it's hard for me to tell that boy, he can find some friends accompany with me to see that movie. I thought Peter's opinion was right, finally I told that boy I didn't want to see that movie. From that time, Peter and I become good friends, because I think he really try his best to help me overcome the problem which disturb me a lot. I really appreciate him, because he not only solve the problem for me, he also taught how to reject others. I think our friendship will be maintained forever.
