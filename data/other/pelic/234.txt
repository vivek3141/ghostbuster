My favorite restaurant is The Rose Tea, it is in Shaydeside. I like to go there, becasue they have delicious food and drinks. Their food and drink are all Chinese food or Taiwan food. I like to drink a bubble milk tea in Taiwan. Although a bubble milk tea is very expensive here, I still like to drink a cup of bubble milk tea every week. I just find three restaurants to sell this drink in Pittsburgh, and The Rose Tea sell bubble milk tea is more delicious than others. So I like to go there and drink my favorit drinks. Their food also is delicious, especially drumstick rice. You can choose what kind of method you want to cook it. I recommand you choose fry in oil.
