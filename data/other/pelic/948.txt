A writer once said that a good man finds all the world friendly, I agree with this hindustan proverb because you only will have a lot of friends when you are a people thats smiling all the time. My best friend Dario who is my brother, is a person whose personality is very similiar then mine, we grow up together so we know very much about each other. We spend a lot of time doing music, which is one of my favorite hobbies.
 He is my best friend beacuse is a person who i talk every day, and always trust.In a general ideia, I think that a friend is someone who you can keep your secrets, share your feelings, care about me and understand my feelings.
