Choose a guardian for the Crowley children

ANON_NAME_0

(1) I think that ANON_NAME_1 and Michael Wang will be a good guardian for the children. First of all, they're both teachers so they can spend a lot of time with young kids. Also, ANON_NAME_1 wants to try to make up to Carolone. Although they're not rich, but they may spend money for the children

 

(2) I think other people are not suitable for the children. First, Lydia wasn't married. Also, she may not forget her job, because it is very sacrifice for an accomplished musician like her. Henry and Violet Crowley are rich, but their problem is their age. Violet Crowley has religion, but Meredich and Andrew are not regular churchgoers, so maybe they don't want to go religious school. ANON_NAME_2 and ANON_NAME_3 are divorced. ANON_NAME_3 is a bachelor, but he is just too irresponsible to take care of children and he has also serious money problem.
