In 2001, I met my good friend Bingbing while she was only coming back to the University of Qinghua from UK. When I showed her, she was wearing a pink sport dress. She had straight black hair. She was about 5 feet 5 and was gorgeous. She and I were in an office and her desk next to my. We quickly became good friend each other because we had many same things. For example, we were same age. She liked running and I liked too. She pretty enjoyed drinking Chinese tea and I drank tea very day. That time, we were always running slowly while we were talking something at the park in the early morning. Then we chose a bar, drank a cup of our favorite tea, and ate a few small Fence cakes. When she knew I would go to the United States, she gave me two boxes tea. Today, I am drinking tea when I often remember her.
