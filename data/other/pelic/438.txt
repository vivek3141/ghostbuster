My best friend his name ANON_NAME_0. I knew this guy since I worked at company in my 

Country. so, my team up with weal in that job. I worked with him until I moved to 

America. Since that time I was with him about three years. So, he became my best 

Friend. He always call me in when he has a problem, and vice versa. He's a funny 

Guy. He always cheers me up when I saw him. We always look after each other. ANON_NAME_0

Down to our boss. But now I give this job up because I traveled to America to 

Complete studying. I haven't seen ANON_NAME_0 since I drop out of my job but he always call 

Me up. I hope he's fine and his family
