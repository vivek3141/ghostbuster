In this weekend we will have a special ceremony. It is a religious day where we celebrate of imam alhasan alzaki. He is one of the prophet's sons. This is held on the 15th of Ramadan. In my country we celebrate with some interest activities. After the breakfast the children goes out with their mothers and visited their neighbors, where they get from them some cookies and chocolates. In front of the door, the children songs some interesting songs before entering their neighbor's homes. Also, many people go to the mosque where others celebrate in their homes. My father always makes a diner for his friends and neighbors in this day. Actually, this year he will miss me because I helped him in this day. It is a very important day for me and I am missing it too much this year.
