Is the best mirror an old fiend? I think that sometimes is, but sometimes is not. Undoubtedly, old friends are the persons who have got along with you for a quite long time. On the other word, they know you very well. But in my opinion, the best mirror which will actually reflect your personality is not only the friend who knows you well, also the friend who really cares about you.
 Take Milly, who is my best friend in Taiwan, for example, she has been my best friend since we knew each other in our junior high school. She was a girl who lived in the countryside. We were both interested in painting, and we liked to chat. We were both cared about each other. For instance, when I played in class instead of paying attention to class, she wound blame me and ask me to return to class. I also reminded her not to think about things which was useless to studying. Therefore, I think this quotation might be modified to "The best mirror is a friend who really cares about you".
