Each person has a dream; so when he realizes his dream, he is a successful person.
 And what contributes to his (her) success? In my opinion, intelligence, hard work, luck, talent and fate are all necessary, but the most important thing is hard work. For instance, Xiang ,ANON_NAME_0 , the champion of the Olympic Games. He was an athlete of high jump; he was a freshman in this field because he only had been going in for this sport for two years before he won the medal. In fact, the Chinese aren't good at this sport; nobody had got a medal before. But he was self-confident, and believed that he could win through his effort. In those two years, most of his life were on the sports ground. He faced many difficulties: pain, hardship, frustration and failure, yet, he still persevered and applied himself. He got a great deal of experiences and improved step by step through training hard and attending various kinds of matches. In the end, he got the highest achievement, winning the Olympic gold.
 All in all, you can't succeed without hard work. Just like a song says: without going through the rain, how can you see the rainbow?"
