Friendship is a plant which we must often water. It means if you want to mention or improve your friendship, you need keep in touch with you friends. I agree. 
I had a good friend WHOES name is ANON_NAME_0. She was my middle school classmate WHO always played with me. She was my confidant WHO listened to my private feeling and thoughts. Then we went to different high school ,WHICH were in the same city. We also played with each other and reminded the time THAT spend in our middle school. Latterly, I moved to other city with my parents. We kept in touch with each other, but the letters that came from her were less and less. Last, I lost the touch with my good friend WHO had 4 years friendship with me.
