May be I'll nominate my brother for guardian because he is my relative. And I think my brother will have a good job and then I can believe he is a good guardian. He is just three years older than I so his age is suitable for guardian. He can teach student for studying well also he is very health and he like to exercise. So he will help my children to study and exercise. In my opinion he is a good guardian for my children.
