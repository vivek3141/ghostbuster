Hello, welcome to a magnificent website.

 My website has been waiting for you for a

 while, and I hope you will never regret seeing

 it. Before saying anything I would like to 

introduce myself. I am KD, from a country which

 is known for its marvelous weather and its

 beautiful tourism sites. I came to Pittsburgh

 last May. Since then I have been going to

 E.L.I. Now as I am talking about my interests 

and hobbies; I remember wonderful moments I have

 had in the past. I was interested in going to

my brothers' office in order to know how they do 

business; since then, I have not been interested

 in anything other than my study. And lately, I

 have been going to moves and shopping for

 things.
