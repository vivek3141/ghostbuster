I usually spend spare time in my home. First, when I enter my room I always TURN ON the radio. The reasons are I don't have TV, and I want to improve my listening skill. Sometimes my feeling BRING me DOWN I used to TURN it UP the radio volume. Second I like to ASK my friend OVER so I usually GET TOGETHER with them in my home. Then we PICK food OUT. What will we eat sometimes we FIND recipe OUT at internet because I usually meet international friend so we have many kind of choice it's on of my pleasure in Pittsburgh
