Here are a few instructions for typing in English. English sentences begin with a capital letter, and they usually end with a period. Use the shift key to make a capital letter. Put one space between words. Also, put one space after a comma and two spaces after a period. Do not put a space between a word and a comma or period. Do not hit the enter key at the end of a line.
 Use the tab key to indent a paragraph. Double-space your writing
