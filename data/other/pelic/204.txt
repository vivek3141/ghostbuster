I have been studying English in university of Pittsburgh for three weeks. I was working as a chemical engineer in Japan. I am living with home stay family Roy in Morningside. He cooks me breakfast and dinner everyday, so it is comfortable for me to stay at his house. While I was working in Japan, I played soccer every Wednesday with my coworker. When I entered my company, I started playing soccer. I belong to ELI soccer team, and our team has a game every Tuesday. I am glad to play soccer here.
