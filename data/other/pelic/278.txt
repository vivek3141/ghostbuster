In fact, i prefer victor's parents to take care of children becaue i have many reasons that let them take custod of the children. First of all, even they are old that doesn't matter becaue the only one can control about the death is the god so let's imagin someday lydia or another gaurdian took the custody and he has accident after that what will happen about he children. I recommand victor's parents taking the custody becaue first, they are relative for the children, they have time for them, they have experienced about raising and the important thing the children don't have problem with them. Recently, in my opnion that i don't think victor's brother or lydia's friend could take care of the children becaue all of them have personal problems and life's problems so imagin someone has problem for himself and he can't solve his problems so it is difficult to solve anothers problems that means if you can't take care of your self don't care about another people situation. Therefore, i nominate victor's father becaue they don't have any problem as we have heard about them so far.
