My favorite restaurant is Chinese Buffet. I go there often because it is close by my home and it is not expansive. I like a lot of food there, for example, roast chop, fruit, lamp and some of sea food. It usually spend $35 every time for my family. I especially like soup, it is taste very well. sometime, I invite some friends to go there, and they always say that is a very good restaurant. If you are instrest in the buffet, I would like to take you there and I'll pay for you. Is it a good idea?
