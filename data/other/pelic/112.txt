I would like to describe my wife. She is the most important person in my life after my mother. She is 19 years old. She looks very beautiful. The most beautiful thing in her is her heart. In another word, she is very lovely. In addition, she really cares about me and I care about her as well. She always feels that she can't make me happy; however, I am the happiest person in the world. She tries her best to make me happy. I also like her cocking. Her food is very delicious. I will never find someone better than her.
