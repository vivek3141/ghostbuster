Some people prefer to eat at food stands or restaurants. Other people prefer to prepare and eat food at home. There are some advantages for eating out and there are some disadvantages. But I prefer eating at home that what my family tough me with it . eating at home might take more time than eating out, but the advantages for eating at home are healthy food you can not find them with eating out and eating together with family and spending time with them.

Firstly, eating at home is taking more time for preparing and eating more than eating out because most restaurants prepare food before it will been ordered. They do that to encourage people to come and eat. However, most mothers who usually prepare the food at home, start cooking before two or more hours for eating their meals. This mean the time will be kept if you eat out. For example , before you finish your work, you can order your lunch and when you are the way to home or any way you can take it and eat it.

Secondly, I think most food in the restaurants are not healthy because most restaurants prepare the food before they will be ordered to save the costumers' time. In addition they use some materials for preparing food more than their useful life like oil. That may be the effects for a lot of poison in the world.

In addition, spending with family for eating is the only way to enjoy the time with family in this nowadays. Because most members of family are busy , and they can not see each others for long time.

In conculation , eating at home is the only way to be healthy and enjoy with family but it take times.
