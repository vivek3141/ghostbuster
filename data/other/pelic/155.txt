I'm a new student in the ELI. I've been living in Pittsburgh since May 2006. I traveled from Saudi Arabia to Pittsburgh to continue my school. I finished my B.sc In 2004. I had award from the university for my B.sc project. I've been working in international organization as HVAC Engineer since 2004. I've been working in my own project since 2005. It names "How to build yourself within the business". I've built own live within the obstacles. I've been writing a story of my grand father.
