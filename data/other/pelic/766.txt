Happy Eid

Eid alfitr will be after two weeks. Fitr means not fasting. I feel happy. We usually prepare ourselves by buying new clothes and some chocolate to serve them during the eid's days. We also distribute money for kids. That makes me sad because I don't expect any gests:( ,not my parents, my lovely sisters or even my in-low members. I will do my best to let my kids see the Eid just they used to see. I will buy new clothes and toys for them. I will buy chocolate, I love chocolate but eat them alone. And the most important thing is that I am going to take that day off ;) if it is on Monday.
