Activision Bring Gun, CoD Titles To Steam
Representatives from major publisher and developer Activision announced a new partnership with Half-Life 2 creator and Source game engine maker Valve Software to make available four of Activision's PC games via Steam.
The titles identified to be released over the PC digital distribution service set up by the Half-Life creator include Call of Duty 2, Gun, Call of Duty and Call of Duty United Offensive - the titles will apparently be available later this month.
The new partnership follows other recent expansions to the Steam service, including the addition of North American publisher Majesco and casual game publisher PopCap's back catalog, and sees the platform moving even further away from its original role as a hardcore gamer channel into a more all-encompassing download service.
"Our agreement with Steam enhances our current online distribution model by allowing us to bring our games to the broadest possible audience," said Dave Anderson, Activision's Senior Director of Business Development. "As broadband penetration continues to grow worldwide, offering our titles digitally to the millions of gamers connected through Steam makes sense to us."
