My friend went back to Japan on Monday 9th. He said he wished he had believed his intuition….One of his friends asked him to play last golf in Pittsburgh on Sunday 8th. He hesitated to do that because it was the day before his departure. Also, he was pretty busy and tired because of preparing to go back to Japan and attending a lot of farewell events. However, he decided to go play golf. He should have followed his first feeling. When he was heading to a golf course, he had a flat tire. He changed the tire and started to drive again. He was quite upset, so he missed a stop sign. Unfortunately, the police was there, and worse, he left his international driver's license that he just got this month instead of the expired Pennsylvania driver's license. He got a ticket and a $180 fine. He regretted a lot of things. If he hadn't had a flat tire, he wouldn't have gotten upset and missed the stop sign. If he had stopped at the stop sign, he wouldn't have been caught by the police. If he had carried his international driver's license, he would have gotten less fine. Only if he hadn't gone to play golf….
