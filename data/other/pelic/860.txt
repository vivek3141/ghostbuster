2 years ago, I was traveling to the capital city in my country by my car for an interview I had for a job. In that trip, I should have taken 4 hours but I took 9 hours instead. I stopped in an exit that something inside me was telling me: this is your way. I ignored my intuition following a direction sheet my brother gave me before. I looked at the sheet and thought about it and then I continued following my sheet. When I noticed that I should have arrived I called my brother and he told me that I had the wrong directions. I wish I had paid attention to my intuition. I could have gotten that job if I did.
