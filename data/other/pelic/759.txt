You should decide you're major since you graduated a high school. There are many kind of major. For example, geography, economics, physics, theater, art photography, engineering, mechanical, literature, English literature, etc. we should consider several things when we decide them. First of all, you should have aptitude for your major. We had several times to check aptitude test. In my case, we test it every year while I was studying a high school, and we could know what we were interested in something. Second you have to enjoy your major. If you're interested in it you're very efficient. Most people think work and play are the opposite of each other, but if you enjoy your major it'll be to play. Third you must consider your job. If you're major in an engineering, business, administration you could get a good job easily than art, music and literature. In my case, I was major in fine art. I should get a job, but my salary was bad. So I decided to study a minor major. When you choose your major you should deep in thought. Don't be regret that you never went to past and it'll be your future.
