I definitely think that it is TV that influences me most among the three. First, from the news broadcasting in the television, we can know what is happening in the outside world even without stepping out our living room with television in it. I just want to keep myself informed of what's going on in the world. And second, watching television with family members after supper is a good way to relax after a hard day's work. What's more, its visual effect makes me feel less stressed and has a great influence on the way I think and talk. So that's why I think it influences me most.
