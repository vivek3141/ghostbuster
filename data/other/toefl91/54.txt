Novels is no doubt my favorite form of literature. I've always loved reading since I was a little kid, and like most of the kids, novels are the first books I started to read. They are fun, they are relatively easy to understand, and most importantly, I loved to adventure with the heroes in the novels. When I grow up, I start to seek the wisdom in those novels, to find out what the authors really want to say behind the words. I grow so emotional attached to the people in the stories. I began to share their joy and sorrow. And I've learned so much from them.
