In my opinion, schools should still allow sports that carry that risk despite the risk of serious physical injury. First of all, it is not the responsibility of schools to completely eliminate all risk from the lives of students. Otherwise, they would have to abolish any science labs that used chemicals or sharp objects because they pose a potential threat to safety. Furthermore, students and their families should be allowed to make personal decisions about what kind of activities they are participating in despite risk as long as they are not simultaneously endangering unknowing bystanders. Therefore, I firmly believe that schools should allow students to make decisions about what sports they will play, even when those sports contain some serious risks.
