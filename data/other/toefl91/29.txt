An enjoyable event that took place in my childhood was when I got my first dog--- Little. I was ten and had been pestering my parents for a dog for years. One day I came home from school, my parents said they had a surprise for me and it was waiting for me in my room. I ran up to my room and threw open the door. I found a tiny puppy with a red bow around his neck and sleeping at the foot of my bed. We became good friends forever. And for the rest of his life, he slept on the exact same spot at the end of my bed every night. That was a great happy event in my childhood.
