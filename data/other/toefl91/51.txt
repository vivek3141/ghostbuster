In my opinion, a good leader should have the following qualities: confident and kind. The leader should be confident both of himself and his fellow members. Every time he walks in the working group, he should bring a strong feeling of authority, and makes his students feel a definite sense of trust. And the leader should be kind to his fellow members. If a leader is too strict, his fellow members would be afraid to ask questions, and that will decrease the efficiency of their work.
