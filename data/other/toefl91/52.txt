In my point of view, government should provide fund to build museums and theaters because they serve as exhibition centers for people to know about the history and culture of the country. The range of museums is fantasticâ€”there are museums of ancient history and archaeology, of natural history and even museums for such things as transportation and crime! And because the museums often hold new exhibitions, there is always something different to see. Theaters offer people a big place to enjoy a variety of operas and plays of different regions. Meanwhile, the building of the museums and theaters will enhance the cultural exchange between countries. They are also one of the contributing factors that promote the national economy. That's why I think it's a good idea for government to help with the building of museums and theaters.
