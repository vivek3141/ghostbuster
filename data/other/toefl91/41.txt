I believe that being open-minded is what it takes to make a good leader. Many of us were brought up with a set of believes and values, so sometimes it's hard to accept new things. But leader with an open mind will offer you other respects of thinking, rather than getting you trapped by dogma. And also there's an honesty that comes with an open mind, you admit that there are still tons of things to be discovered, and that attitude will always urge you to learn more from others which is definitely great for teamwork.
