For one thing it is what I've always wanted to do since I was a little kid and I've spend each hour of mine getting prepared to be one. I've learned to communicate with my team members and find out what they are best at, I've learn to cherish my mistakes and try to do better in the next time. I think I really like it. And plus, I am a sociable person, I've found myself quite good at dealing with all kinds of relationships, which clearly is a good quality for being a leader.
