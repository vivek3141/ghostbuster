To me, I prefer eating at restaurants over eating at food stands for two main reasons (or I prefer to eat at restaurants for two main reasons). The first reason is I grew up dinning in restaurants, so I am accustomed to eating in them. Actually, I cannot remember the last time I ate at a food stand. Plus, eating in a nice building is much more comfortable compared to eating outside. The second reason is there is a better food selection. I can have more choices and my food is cooked better, because they have a proper cooking system. Therefore, these reasons are why I prefer to eat at a restaurant rather than a food stand.
