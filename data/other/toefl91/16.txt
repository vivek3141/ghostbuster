Years ago on my journey to Australia, I lived in a house right on the edge of a forest. At night when the heat starts to go away, I loved to light a lamp, sit in a cane chair in the balcony and read a book. It was so peaceful at that time that the cool breeze is the only thing to remind you that time is still running. I love it when moonlight slanted through be branches down the floor, all birds stopped tweeting and the only sound you can hear is occasional chirping from some crickets. Everything was so perfect.
