I read a lot in my spare time, and the book I just read recently called A Thousand Splendid suns is very useful for me. Simple and plain, the book tells a great story. Two Afghan women from completely different background were brought together by cruel fate, but they never stopped fighting for freedom and love. The book tells me that in spite of all the sufferings the nation has beared for decades, people there still remain the most precious things in the world. I was under a lot of pressure from family and school then, but the book taught me never to lose hope.
