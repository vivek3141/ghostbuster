When I was in college, I loved to study until midnight and then go back to my dorm to sleep. The campus was so peaceful at that time, no one was on the street, and all lights were off, it felt that the whole campus belonged to me alone. I always go through a park in the middle of the campus, moonlight slanted through the branches down to the ground, birds stopped tweeting and the occasional chirping of crickets was the only thing you could hear. You would doubt if time had stopped running if not for the cool breeze caressing every inch of your skin. (There were always faint fragrance from flowers you can't name, but it could certainly remind you of the sweetest peaches in summer. Oh how I love the school.)
