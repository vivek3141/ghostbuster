My experiences in an internship was rather challenging. My major job was to work with some Nigerian students. My English was poor at that time, and you know Nigerian English is a lot different from American English. In the first two weeks I can hardly understand what they are talking about let alone working with them. So I walked with them every day after work, asking about their culture, and introducing China to them. And I was grateful that they are really nice people, they helped me a lot. At the end of the summer, we've become good friends and kept contact ever since.
