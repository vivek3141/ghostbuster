I think I will go with the latter one. I'm not saying that studying a subject for job opportunities is wrong, it's just that I'm not that kind of person. Me myself want to be a scientist in the future, and following my own interests are rather important, because doing research can be tedious or frustrating in many situations, and my interests may be the only thing to keep me going on and on. If you are only driven by profit, it's likely that you will abandon your current subject once it seems not so profitable, and that's clearly not good for the development of science.
