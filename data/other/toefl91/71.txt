The answer would be TV. I grew up in a very small town, and my family wasn't exactly rich, so we didn't have much chance to travel around. And thus, the only connection between me and the outside world is the TV. By watching TV, I learned about the big cities full of skyscrapers, about the splendid history of my country and about the exotic culture from all over the world. Now traveling has become an important part of my life, and I know it's all because of that little screen from my childhood.
