I believe being open-minded is what it takes to make a good friend. Most of us are brought up with a set of believes and values, so sometimes it can be tough to accept new things. But a friend with an open mind will introduce countless possibilities into your life and he or she can offer you the chance to change how you view the world. And also, there's an honesty that comes with an open mind, being open-minded means admitting that you do not know everything. It's always comfortable to be around friends like that, and they will help you explore more about the world.
