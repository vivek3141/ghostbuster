Between team sports and exercising alone, I’d rather exercise alone, personally. If you ask me, it’s better because you can do it any time, for one. For example, if I wanted to get some exercise, but I only played team sports, I’d, uhh, I’d have to call friends or, I don’t know—or find a group of people who played regularly. But on the other hand, if I want to go running, I can just go any time. Also, I can listen to music while running or hiking. You need to talk to communicate when playing a team sport, so you can’t do that... you can’t wear headphones at all. In general, I guess I just like exercising alone better, because I have more control of when and what I do.
