I definitely prefer to watch the news only occasionally. There are two reasons for this. First of all, too much time spent watching the nightly news makes me feel really anxious.  For instance, if I hear about some new war or disaster every day of the week I get really depressed and this make it a lot harder to function in my daily life. Secondly, I think watching the news every day can be a waste of time. Like, if I spend an hour every day watching a news broadcast I just don't have enough time for more important things. For example, this month I stopped watching the nightly news and suddenly it became a lot easier to get all of my homework assignments done.
