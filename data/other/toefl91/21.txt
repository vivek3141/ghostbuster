Allen Iverson, the NBA superstar, is definitely one of the people for whom I have a huge admiration. I admire him a lot because he is such a hard-working guy that you would feel like there’s nothing he cannot do. Once I watched an interview of his coach in high school on NBC. He said that Allen was just super diligent. He was always the first person that arrived for the training, and always the last one to leave. He usually stayed for another 2 hours after all his teammates left for dinner. So it’s definitely his hard work that made him one of the most phenomenal players in the league.
