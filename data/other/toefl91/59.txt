I prefer working in offices. We know that for most of situations, working is all about cooperation and communication, which can be seriously affected if you are working alone at home. And when you have problems, it's obviously more efficient to discuss with other people, they may provide another respect of thinking. Studies also show that people are likely to lose focus when working alone. And besides, working in offices can help make friends, which can make you love more about your job. People are social animals, spending too much time alone is not healthy for our minds.
