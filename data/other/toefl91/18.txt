in my opinion, it is my family members and friends who influence me most. The information provided by newspaper, TV, radio or other formats of media can just let us know what has happened and only equip us with knowledge, they are incapable of giving me spiritual satisfaction. Speaking of some issues, we need more specific suggestions. Family members and friends can offer us this kind of information and can give us adequate help to meet the issues.
