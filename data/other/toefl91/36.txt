There is no doubt that my favorite sport is swimming. It is scientific fact that swimming is the best exercise you can do. It requires both upper and lower strength, and it's all about endurance and stamina, which is essential in building up your body. When you swim for competition you are going to burn more calories in 20 minutes than you would in an hour in most other sports. Not to mention the indirect effects of swimming. Swimming in a pool rather than sitting there staring at the computer screen will certainly benefit both your physical and mental condition.
