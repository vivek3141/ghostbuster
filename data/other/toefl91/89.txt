Well, I think there are several ways to keep myself healthy. As for physical health, I'll do some exercise regularly. For example, I'll work out in a gym or play ball games with my friends, such as basketball or volleyball and I will try to keep a healthy diet which means to avoid eating fast food that are high in oil, sugar and salt. And I will try to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables. And as for my mental health, I think I will try to listen to some light music before going to bed. It will help improve the quality of sleep. And when I run into some bad things I'll complain to my close friends or parents rather than keep all the pressure to myself.
