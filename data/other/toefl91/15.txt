I definitely prefer to study in a big city. The most common reason for us to study is to find a good job, and there are much more job opportunities in big cities than the small town. If I study in the big cities, I can do a part time job while studying, and seize the opportunity to work there after I graduate from university. In addition, the big city can provide us a plenty of internship opportunities to me. Moreover, jobs in big cities can offer more decent salary. So that's why I think big city is more attractive for me to study.
