When I was young, I lived in a suburban area. And there was a corn field right beside our community. One day me and some other kids decided to do something exciting, so we sneaked into the field. They made me stand watch for I was the slow one. After grabbing some corns we ran back home as fast as we could, not wanting to be caught. And then we found some bricks to build up a little stove, collected lots of dry leaves to make fire, and roasted the corns on fire. I have to say that that roast corn was the best that I've ever had.
