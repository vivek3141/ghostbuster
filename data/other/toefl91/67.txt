I believe that being open-minded is what it takes to makes a good teacher. Many of us were brought up with a set of believes and values, so sometimes it's hard to accept new things. But teachers with an open mind will offer you the chance to change how you view the world, and they will introduce countless of possibilities into your life. And also there's an honesty that comes with an open mind, you admit that there are still tons of things to be discovered, and that attitude will help you explore more about the world.
