In my opinion a good friend should have the following qualities: supportive and caring. It is a well known saying that a friend in need is a friend indeed. Therefore, a friend should stand by you in the hour of any sort of need. They can be my friends in sunshine and in shade. They can make me feel a definite sense of trust. Then he/she should be very caring. When I am suffering hard times, or confronting difficulties, he/she can give me a hand and help me overcome the troubles. Also, I'd love to spend more time with someone who can make me laugh and is fun to be around.
