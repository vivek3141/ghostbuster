If I only have a small amount of money left, I will spend it for two main reasons. First of all, I will spend my money on taking a class because my knowledge and skill can help me earn a lot of money. Therefore, the money that I spend on a class is a very good investment in myself. In addition, I will spend my money because I want to take good care of myself and make sure that I don’t get sick. With only a small amount of money left, I know that I won’t have the money to pay for medical bills if I get really sick and have to go to the hospital. Therefore, by taking care of myself first, I can reduce my chances of getting sick later on. For these reasons, I will spend money now.
