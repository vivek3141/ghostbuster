There's no doubt that my favorite type of movie is drama. I've always loved movies since I was a little kid, but unlike most of the kids, I've never found action movies attractive. Exciting as they are, they are usually empty in the inside. It's likely that you'll remember nothing about them after a month. While I like to seek the wisdom in those dramas, to find out what the movies really want to say behind the scene. I grow so emotional attached to the people in the stories. I began to share their joy and sorrow. And I've learned so much from them.
