If I am choosing between doing homework alone and doing it with others, I will choose to do homework with others for two main reasons. The first reason is that it is more fun to do homework with others. For example, when you do homework with your friends, you can chat with them when you get tired or feel bored, and this will help you relax and become more focused on your work later. As another reason, I prefer doing homework with others because we can engage in discussions. For instance, homework is very difficult sometimes. If you get stuck on a question, you can ask your friends who are doing the same homework, and these homework discussions will help you understand the concept and answer questions on your homework. For these reasons, I prefer to do homework with others.
