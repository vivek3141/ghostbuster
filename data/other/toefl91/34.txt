I prefer to live with roommates. First of all, I will not feel lonely when I live with my roommates. I prefer to chat with my roommates before some important tests. It makes me feel relaxed and always helps me get a good grade on exams. Second, we can help each other when someone runs into something bad. For example, I got a bad cold last week and I had to stay in dormitory. Thanks to my roommate, Ben, he helped me take notes on class and brought some medicine for me. I was really appreciated.
