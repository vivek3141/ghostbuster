Living in a big city can provide people with a range of benefits. Now, I am studying in Guangzhou, a big and modern city in my country. My life is totally different from the past. Now I can receive better education, experience new things, get more job opportunities and so on. I feel energetic and motivated everyday!Besides, the basic infrastructure in big city is perfect, because there are some museums, hospitals, schools, libraries and so on
