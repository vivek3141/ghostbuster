If I am choosing among computer science, business, and photography classes, I will choose computer science for two main reasons. First of all, I prefer computer science because programming is a skill that is applicable to all industries. For example, even if I want to work in the fashion industry one day, I can still use my programming skills to help my company build a beautiful website, write a useful app for its customers, and so on. I addition, I prefer computer science because computer science classes can teach me how to solve problems. For instance, I can learn how to analyze problems and solve them systematically through logic. This problem-solving ability helps me become a smarter candidate, so I have a higher chance of finding a job. Therefore, I prefer computer science.
