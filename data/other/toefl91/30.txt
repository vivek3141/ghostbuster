If I had a small amount of money, I would save it. The first reason is I grew up in a family that prided themselves on having money in the bank, so it is easy for me to save money. The second reason is if there was an emergency and you would need some money. If you saved it, you would be ok. However, if you did not save it, you could be in trouble. In addition, it is more important to save money and pay off your debts, rather than waste your money on something useless. So for these two reasons, I would save a small amount of money.
