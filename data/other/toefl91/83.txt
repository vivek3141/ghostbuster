Studying in big cities definitely works with me. I went to college in Beijing, which is one of the biggest cities of China. To be honest I didn't care for this city in the beginning, but its charm grows on me. We know that going to college is not all about gaining knowledge from textbooks, getting prepared for entering the society and meeting people are also important. Beijing is an excellent city for these things. It's full of opportunities and passionate people. Plus, most of the best universities are in big cities, so studying here is good for your academic life as well.
