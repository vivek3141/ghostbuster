I think its a really fantastic idea to get surgery to change your appearance.  I feel this way for two reasons. First of all, it can make us feel a lot more self-confident.  If we really like our appearance we can feel a lot less shy when talking to people.  And it will be easier to interact and therefore we'll achieve more success in our personal and professional lives. Secondly, if we don't like the result of our surgery we can always change it back.  I mean, plastic surgery is really affordable these days, so if you get some surgery and it looks bad... you can just get another procedure done.  For instance, I've changed my nose about six times already, and the expense to me has been pretty minimal.
