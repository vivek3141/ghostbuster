If I had to choose between team sports and exercising alone, I’d definitely play a team sport, like volleyball, my favorite. It’s more enjoyable to spend time with people. There are a couple of reasons I say that. When you’re, uh, with people, you can share the experience, for one. I mean, you can talk, or maybe joke, like, if you’re playing volleyball, say, and you make a mistake—you drop the ball, for instance—your friends can reassure you. But besides that, friends can help motivate you. When you’re exercising alone, on the other hand, you need to motivate yourself. So, my main point is that exercising with people makes the time spent more fun.
