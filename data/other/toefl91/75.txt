I'm afraid that I disagree. It's not like that I don't like a relaxing life style, it's just that there are so many goals to fulfill in my life. There are tons of books I plan to read, I want to buy a fancy RV for my parents, I want to travel around the world, to learn several new languages, but none of them will happen unless financial issues are no longer a problem for me. So I have to study and work hard to earn enough money for those things. I just can't afford a relaxing life.
