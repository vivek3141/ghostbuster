That would be the moment when I got the result of my college entrance test. We were under huge pressure that day. Finally the phone finally rang and it turned out that I actually did a good job, when my mind was still all blank, my dad said something that brought me back to reality:” Son, I'm so proud of you.” Suddenly I realized that all my hard work had paid off, I didn't let myself and anyone who loves me down, that's the moment I knew it is a brand new start of my life, and that I'll always cherish.
