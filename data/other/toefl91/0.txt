I prefer to cook at home. First of all, it is cheaper and safer than the restaurant. Because I can buy the things needed for cooking, and I can make sure that they are clean and fresh. Second, making a good dinner helps me obtain a sense of achievement. On every Spring festival, I always make dinner for my whole family, they always think that the meal is delicious and we can chat freely around the table. I am really proud of it and I think it can improve the relationship between my family and me.
