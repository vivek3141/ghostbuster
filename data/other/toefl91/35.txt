I disagree with the idea that people should always be truthful. First of all, telling a white lie is better in many situations. For example, when parents lie to their kids that Santa Claus exists, their children will behave well for the whole year because they want to receive good presents from Santa. In addition, the other person may not really want to hear your honest answer anyway. For instance, when an overweight girl asks a guy if she is fat, she may want to hear the other person say “No, you are skinny.” In situations like this, it is better to lie. Therefore, people should not always be truthful.
