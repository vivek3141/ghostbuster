Personally, I would like to say that the school which is very impressive to me is Beijing University. It is one of the most famous universities in China. There are a couple of reasons to name. The first reason I wanna say is it’s beautiful, when I’m free, I can walk in the woods, smell the grass and flowers, listen to the birds singing, all of these make me feel relaxed. The second reason is there are a lot of foreigners, so I can make friends with them, we can have a get together, we discuss, we talk, we laugh, all of these make my life funny. So that’s why Beijing University is very impressive to me.
