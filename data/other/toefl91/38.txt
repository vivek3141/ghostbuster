When choosing a restaurant, the thing I consider the most important is its hygiene condition. First of all the restaurant should be clean, so that you can have your dinner in a good mood. And more importantly the food have to be safe because you don't want to get sick after dinner. And of course, the taste of food is very important too. Now there are excellent website where you can look up the restaurants and see other people's comment on them, they may even recommend some good food that you should try. Those are two features I care about most.
