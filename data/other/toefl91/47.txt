I believe that it takes a long time to know a person. I'm not denying that the first impression plays an important role in how you feel about a person. But you must admit that time has the power to change it. People can be a lot different once you get to know them well. I didn't like my current girlfriend when we first met. It was at a party and she was sitting in a corner minding her own business, I saw someone trying to talk to her, she replied briefly and walked away. But now I know she's just not comfortable around strangers.
