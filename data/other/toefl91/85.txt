I agree with the idea of giving children homework on a daily basis.  I feel this way for two reasons. First of all, I think that it will help children to retain what they learn for a much longer period of time.  The only real way for kids to absorb a lesson is to actually go home and repeat it as much as they possibly can.  And in the long run this kind of thing will lead to a lot more academic success. Secondly, I believe that homework can actually give children an opportunity to bond with their parents.  For example, I got a lot of daily homework when I was in elementary school. And I'd go home and do it with my mom and dad, and I'd ask them questions whenever I was having trouble. And in time we actually became really close.
