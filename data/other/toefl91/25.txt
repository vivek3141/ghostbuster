Definitely by phone calls. First of all, letter and emails takes too much of time. You have to organize your thoughts and write them down, and it's likely that you will miss something while writing, and it would be days before people can get your letter. Plus, writing a letter is like telling your feelings to a piece of paper, it doesn't feel real. But using phone calls is totally different, the distance doesn't seem to matter anymore when you hear the voice of your loved ones. And you can do it any time you want, it's much more convenient.
