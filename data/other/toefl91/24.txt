I'm afraid that I disagree. I can understand why college students want to take a one year break after graduation, but I believe that it's totally unnecessary for high school students to do so. Because before actually entering the society, college students may need to figure out what they really want to do in their lives. But most of high school graduates know few things, what they really need is to study, to gain knowledge for their future. I believe that after a gap year, they will find it difficult to catch up with the courses provided by college.
