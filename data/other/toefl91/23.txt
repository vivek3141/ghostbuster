I prefer to take several short vacations in a year. For one thing, the beauty of vacation rests on our excitement, the excitement to plan trips, to spend time with loved ones or so on. But too long a vacation will only gradually consume the excitement. And finally you will be boring, so the rest of the vacation will be totally wasted. And also, people need to release their stresses once in a while, you can't expect them to do that once a year, it's likely that they will snap at some point. So I don't think taking a long vacation once a year is a good choice.
