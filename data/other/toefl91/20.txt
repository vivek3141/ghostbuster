Being honest is always a principal part in any relationships, it's the only way to make people feel comfortable around each other. When things go wrong, even with good reasons, I'd like to hear about the truth of it no matter how frustrating it might be. Because if someone lies to me and I find out somehow, how can I trust him anymore? How can I not be wondering if he's tell the truth every time he talks to me? There's no way I can keep a healthy relationship with this guy.
