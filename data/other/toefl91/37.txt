I totally agree. First of all, classes are for everybody, you learn common things that everyone need to know in class, but they might not suit your special situation. And more importantly, the things taught in class are really limited, the teachers only give you a head start, they teach you how to learn by yourself. But the wisdom of the universe rests in our daily life. You can learn from books, from museums, from work, from the communication with other people. Those are the thing you actually need in your real life, and there's no way you can find them in textbooks.
