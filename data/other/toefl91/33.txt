I believe that it is beneficial to evaluate professors at the end of the semester, but there can also be some disadvantages. First, since superior staff can’t sit it on every class, they should take input from the students on how the class went. Students are likely to be honest in their reviews, so the professor can also learn from their mistakes. However, I believe that there are disadvantages as well. If a student knows that they will receive a failing grade, they may be dishonest in their review just to spite the professor. They may say that the professor wasn’t fair, even if that isn’t true. This can be hurtful to the professor and detrimental to their career. So, I believe that there are advantages and disadvantages to asking students to evaluate their professors at the end of the semester.
