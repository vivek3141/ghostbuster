The Spring Festival celebrates the coming of Chinese New Year. And there's no doubt that it's my favorite festival. After one year of hard work, people always come back home to celebrate Spring Festival with their family. In this fast-paced world, you might find it hard to spend some quality time with them. But the Spring Festival gives you the chance to be with your loved ones. And also, Jiaozi, which is my favorite food, is served on this festival. Besides, it's a lot of fun making Jiaozi together with your family. That's another reason why I love about Spring Festival.
