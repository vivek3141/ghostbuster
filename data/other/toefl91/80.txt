I prefer studying in traditional classroom. We know that for many situations, studying is about cooperation and communication, which can be seriously affected if you are studying alone at home. And when you have problems, it's obviously more efficient to discuss with other people, they may provide another respect of thinking. Studies also show that people are likely to lose focus when working alone. And besides, studying in classroom can help make friends, which can make you love more about your work. People are social animals, spending too much time alone is not healthy for our minds.
