I prefer to work at office for two reasons. First, it will be more efficient for me to work at office. Last week, I had a bad cough and I had to work at home. I found I couldn't concentrate on work because the environment was so comfortable that all I wanted to do was sleeping. Second, it will be helpful to work at office because I can discuss some problems with my colleagues directly. There is no doubt that in this way can I figure out the problem and finish the work more quickly.
