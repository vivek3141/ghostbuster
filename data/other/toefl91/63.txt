First, the most common purpose for us to study is to find a good job and there are much more opportunities in big cities than the small town. If I study in the big cities, I can do a part time job and seize the chance to work there after I graduate from university. In addition, a big city means more museums and theaters, which is attractive to me. I was taken to theater with my grandpa when I was four years old and since then I fell in love with operas and history.
