There is a notebook that means a lot to me. I've always loved reading and I started writing my own stories years ago. One day a friend of mine found the pile of paper I kept my stories on and asked me to let him read them. I was kind of reluctant but still a little glad that he found them, so I agreed. After few days he handed me my stories along with this notebook, telling me to keep writing and one day I may become a good writer. For that I was really grateful, and that notebook encouraged me to keep on writing ever since.
