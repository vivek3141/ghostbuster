I think it's better for students to have young teachers even if they're a little bit inexperienced. First of all, young teachers can relate more to their students.  They simply have a lot more in common with them in terms of personal interests and pop culture awareness.  As a result, it's easier for them to connect the classroom material to the real lives of the students.  This can encourage kids to stay motivated and keep on task for their whole school day. Secondly, younger teachers have a lot more energy.  Class sizes are huge now.  In fact, they're probably bigger than ever before.  This can create trouble for older teachers who might run out of energy and not be able to finish their lessons if they have a huge group of students.
