I think the government has responsibility to help to build the museums and theaters. First, there is no doubt that these places can reflect the unique culture of the city and help tourists learn about the city quickly. Therefore, more tourists will be attracted to the city. Second, this measure is the protection of the culture and it can encourage people to learn about the culture. I was taken to theater when I was 4 years old with my grandpa. Since then, I became a fans of Beijing Opera and it is also a valuable memory between me and my grandpa.
