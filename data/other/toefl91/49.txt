I think that governmental regulations have the biggest impact on environmental protection. Compared to individual efforts, governmental regulations make citizens follow the law, rather than make good choices. For example, in Korea, if you donâ€™t recycle properly, you can receive a fine. They provide all the bins and resources to make it easy for the public to make the right choice to recycle. Second, when the government steps in to make regulations, it also educates the public, which can lead to individuals going above and beyond for the environment. When the government introduces a new regulation, it will explain why they are doing it, which may have people think twice about before they throw garbage out the window of the car. For these two reasons, I believe that governmental regulations have the biggest impact on environmental protection.
