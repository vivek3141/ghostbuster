On my journey to Paris, I got the chance to see one of the finest work of DaVinci's, Mona Lisa, which I love very much. Mona Lisa's reputation rests on the mysterious half smile. We know that many paintings are to capture the motion, so when we are watching the lady, we can see a full smile blooming in front of our eyes. But sometimes we can get very confused too. We don't know if her face is beaming in the next moment or will it lose all traces of smile. It certainly builds a complicated connection between us and Mona Lisa.
