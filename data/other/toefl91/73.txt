I love to stop and look around when travelling. What I love about travelling is not some certain place I previously planned to visit, it is the travelling itself, and the surprises it gives me that I truly enjoy. Before setting off, the only things you know about your destination are from other people's experiences, they may not suit you very well. All places are different from time to time, let alone the fact that people have different preference. I always love to meet local people or other tourists, ask them for advice and adjust my route. Sometimes I even don't get to the place where I planned to visit.
