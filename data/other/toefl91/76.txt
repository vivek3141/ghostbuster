My goal is to become an engineer someday. Being an engineer is something I've always been looking forward to since I was a little kid. It will allow me to bring out my creativity in my daily work, that's just like dreams coming true. And I'd like it if I can build something that would last much longer even after I am gone, and seeing people benefit from my design will definitely give me great satisfaction. So going to engineering school really is a brand new start of my life. That's why it's so important to me.
