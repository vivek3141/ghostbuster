I definitely believe that TV programs are bringing negative influences on our society, here are some of the reasons. First, families used to get together after dinner and talk about their day, to share their joy and sorrow, to play games and have fun. But now, the only thing they do now is sitting in the couch, watching TV for entertainment. And second, working out is a much better choice than watching TV. Obesity and heart attack are now very serious problems in this country, a major cause of it is that people like to sit in front of TV all day and eat junk food.
