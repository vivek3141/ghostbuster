The place I would like to visit most is the outer space,the place where most of the physical laws on the earth do not apply. It is interesting to see everything floating in the air. And the term “in the air” should also be modified simply because there is no air anyway. It is interesting to walk the distance in a whole new style. And it is interesting to see the mother planet from a whole new angle. This big blue crystal sphere,from the pictures taken by those astronauts, the sight is marvelous. And I am dying to see this big blue ball in this style.
