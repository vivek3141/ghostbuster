This coursework is aimed at the use of binary trees. Binary trees are similar to linked lists such as stacks but rather than having just one "next" pointer they have two, left and right, so each node has two children. The coursework requires a postfix expression, where the operator comes after the operands, to be read from an edit box and stored into a tree. This in turn can be traversed in several different ways to get the postfix, prefix and infix expressions. As a bonus it is required for the expression to be evaluated using post order traversal.
