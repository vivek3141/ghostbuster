The mail order bride industry is a global commodity chain, and the product is the mail order bride, marketed through a variety of media, but principally now through the internet. The consumer is (generally) Western men who are seeking an international marriage for a variety of reasons. The marketer/distributor is International Marriage Agencies. It can also be argued that a secondary actor in the distribution of mail order brides is States themselves, through their domestic policies. This paper will focus one specific mail order bride commodity chain: Filipina women as the product, with Japanese, American and Canadian men as buyers. The first section of this paper will examine all elements of the commodity chain. The second section will discuss some of the gendered social and economic effects of the mail order bride industry.
At every level of the chain, from the Mail Order Brides as the product, to Western men as consumers, to the direction of State policies regarding MOB, gendered relations and effects are present. Whether the actors in the chain act under duress or choice, the ramifications remain the same: gendered structures are affected the world over. The global sex chain of Filipina mail order brides and Western consumers is much like any other commodity chain - it creates both bridges of opportunity and vises of exploitation.
