The 13 th century house of Hulton Abbey, north Staffordshire (fig 1), was that of a Cistercian monastery (Wise 1985). Following frequent structural alteration, the abbey was abandoned as a religious house, a consequence of the dissolution in the 14 th century, and was "integrated into secular society" (Wise 1985: vii). First excavated in 1884, the site has been investigated sporadically over the last 100 years and has produced a wealth of skeletal evidence (fig 2).
Following skeletal analysis of two osteological collections representative of two individuals recovered from Hulton Abbey (fig 2), this report will identify evidence of pathology including dental disease, trauma and joint disease. In addition, where possible, age and sex determination and height estimation will be proposed.
