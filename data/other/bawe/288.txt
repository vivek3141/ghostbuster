After solving the problem using Microsoft Excel and analysing possible future changes the following recommendations can be made.
At current costs and internal capacities, the cost of supplying the customer with 500m of cloth is 8580.00, or 17.16 per metre.
Introducing a new product requiring only 700 hours of vat time a week would not require an increase in production capacity.
When the cost of producing yarn is cheaper that buying yarn in, 80 extra hours of carding and combing capacity should be purchased at a price according to other costs and amounts of bought in yarn purchased.
If the cost of buying in yarn becomes less costly than producing yarn internally, it may be prudent to relax the constraint on supplying cloth made from a minimum of 50% internally produced yarn.
The department should look to negotiate a 20% discount with the current external suppliers of yarn as this will help reduce overall costs. The department should be cautious of an unreliable supplier, and weigh up a 30% discount with the possibility of delays in supplying customers and the financial implications this may have.
The amount of cloth supplied to the customer can be increased to a maximum of 680m, but profit margins per metre are decreased
A-Z Cloth UK has agreed to supply a customer at least 500 metres of cloth per week using yarn produced internally and bought in. The minimum cost of supplying this contract is required.
The problem has been simulated as a linear programming problem and solved using Solver, with Microsoft Excel. Details are contained within the appendix.
