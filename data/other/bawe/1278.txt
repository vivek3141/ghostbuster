The farm we visited is situated at Christmas Common, near Nettlebed, Oxon. The farm is approximately 300ha and is split into two main enterprises, Christmas trees and broadleaf woodland. The Christmas tree enterprise is the main business on the farm, with the farm now having significantly moved away from conventional agriculture. This is a move being taken by many farms in the UK given the current agricultural climate, as it is becoming increasingly more difficult to make a living from conventional farming alone. Farm diversification can take many different forms as the following table indicates:
The need for farm diversification is becoming more apparent with the smaller family run farms, as these are the farms which are more likely to need to make an income from other means. This is because it is no longer economical for smaller farms to operate as efficiently as previously and therefore additional income is likely to be necessary.
It is useful for businesses to conduct a SWOT analysis to look at the business strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The strengths and weaknesses of the business are those factors internal to the business and can also be more immediate. The opportunities and threats are external factors which may have an effect on the business and could be more long term factors. A SWOT analysis is an important management tool for a business and so will be useful for the farm to access how to manage the Christmas tree business and to look at the future prospects for the business.
