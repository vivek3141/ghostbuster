In this coursework the problem to be solved is based on the analogy of a rat navigating a maze, trying to get from the entrance to the exit. Essentially, the aim is to develop a solution to the maze- i.e. find the path from the entrance to exit:
A LIFO stack can be used to store the path taken. It will model the movements of the rat and allow retracing of steps in the case that a wall or "dead end" is encountered.
On the assignment handout sheets, the maze is depicted in a form such that it appears that grid references are given in (Y, X) form rather than the conventional (X, Y). Also, the grid references are zero-based, i.e. the first cell is (0,0). Both these features indicate that the maze should be modelled using a two-dimensional array (as in C programming) because such an array has exactly the same properties.
