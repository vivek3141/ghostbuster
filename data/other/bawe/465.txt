While the two regimes of Pern's Argentina and Allende's Chile are decades apart, disparate in provenance, nature, trajectory and, if the accusation of Pern as a fascist is even to be loosely accredited, the width of the political spectrum in between, there are familiar themes in these defining times of the two most southernmost South American countries. Both men were elected democratically, both were ousted by illegitimate army coups, both died in office (although in radically different circumstances) and both were carried into rule and supported during government by the workers, as the power of the people asserted itself in Latin America against the oligarchs, the capitalists, the 'imperialist' foreign companies and the conservative forces of politics and the military. It was the overwhelming support of the working class that defined the two governments; Pern and Allende, beloved by their descamisados and compaeros respectively, were two different animals completely, one a Marxist Socialist, the other an authoritarian army Corporatist, and the explanation for how that happened has to be something more satisfactory than the assumption that all working class naturally support socialism and therefore Pern, who has been simplistically categorised as a Fascist, must have fooled the immature Argentine working class with cheap promises and controlled them with repression as his supposed role model did in Germany two decades earlier. For there is more to working class allegiance than 'natural' tendencies or alternatively submission, what needs to be addressed is how these leaders gained the devotion of the working class that they undoubtedly held, but also how there is room for agency of the working classes themselves, not simply following whatever shining light is held before them or hating the capitalist phantoms that are presented to scare them but deciding for themselves what is the problem and diagnosing the solution to it.
While traditionally it might be expected of the labouring classes to orientate towards Marxist parties, that unhelpful dogma is obviously proven wrong by the Peronist working class and many worker-supported non-socialist parties through time, and therefore a more analytical explanation of the strength of the Chilean working-class left is needed first in order to prove and account for any 'deviance' from the socio-political norm that the Argentines may be. Marxists are fond of dialectics and the establishment of a strong working class identity with a left-wing ideology in Chile has the hallmarks of a dialectical development, with the 'two parallel traditions of almost uninterrupted parliamentarism and of violence, repression and militant mass struggle' the shaping forces. While on the one hand, the bitter struggle of Chilean workers against the establishment with the miners rebellion, the repression of Ib
ez and Alessandri's Mobile Guard had proved time and again that no worker's action would be tolerated by the government unless the government was controlled by the workers, on the other the admired stability and constitutionalism of the country that could be traced back all the way to Portales' constitution and the parliamentary values that ensured that 'the National Congresses' powers of criticism and censure were upheld' formed a determination among the left that power could and must be gained through popular elections.
The Chilean experience then, with its parallel tradition, is the formative factor in explaining the strength and the trajectory of the working class left. The experience had not been good for the poorer people of this relatively resource-rich country, and the usual suspects in all Latin American countries reared their head: dependence, inflation and repatriation of profits overseas, a scourge that led to a typical 'enemies home and abroad' rhetoric from their leaders such as Allende, who was not straying from the general current of opinion when he diagnosed the problems as being because 'Chile is a capitalist country, dependent upon imperialism and dominated by sectors of the bourgeoisie allied to foreign capital'. The material hardships and perception of inequity and exploitation of the poor Chileans fostered resentment, but the outraged determination necessary for revolutionary action was kindled by the enforced impotence of workers and labour in the face of successive demonstrations and strikes that were 'cruelly repressed'.
Taking a specific focus on the Yarur cotton mill, significant as the first overthrowing of factory rule in an acceleration of revolution after Allende was elected, the evidence of Chilean factors in radicalising the labourers is apparent. As with workers all over the country, labour laws enacted by the Christian Democrats and previous centre-left governments had not helped enough, the employer always finding a way to circumvent the protection laws to fire a 'disloyal' employee, or control the obviously docile company union, and getting institutionalised informers to snitch on any hint of subversive activity or thought. This system of repression had been enough to tame the 'Old-timers' who had been freshly incorporated from the countryside and were deferential, but with the arrival of the 'youngsters' came a destabilising force of militancy, a new generation of educated, motivated workers who were most importantly urban, 'where the nature of neighbouring and social interactions transmitted, reinforced and consolidated a strong sense of working-class identity and social solidarity'. That close-knit identity from a shared existence mirrors the experience of the whole country's working class, where 70% of the population by 1970 were in cities, urbanisation being a classic instigator of working class solidarity. This was an example of oligarchic capitalism's repression coming into contact with a burgeoning working class identity that demonstrates the dialectical process in bringing about militant revolutionary activity. However the old-fashioned dialectic explained through hardship is not sufficient as a contrasting explanation with the working class' actions in Argentina, first of all because there were hardly prosperous conditions for them either and although their sporadic efforts at activity were repressed also, there was no flourishing of revolutionary rhetoric, despite having similarly urbanised labourers with shared experiences. The interpretation of urban identity compared to rural values from Argentina, in which the recently urbanised country workers with rural criollo values supported Pern in the absence of the older European immigrants with continental ideas about labour, could have been proved conversely by the experience of the Yarur mill, with its deferential older rural workers being out-radicalised by the urbanised generation that perhaps had more European ideas about labour activism. However, that 'hypothetical dichotomy' has been largely discounted considering Pern had a much wider support base than just those rural workers, 'far from being divided the working class was remarkably homogenous' and the notion that the previous working classes would have been more traditionally militant is incongruous with the experience pre-Pern. Therefore a reason for the differing methods of the people in the two countries has to be sought, for although there does not need to be strict correlation for economic circumstances to be a motivation in each country, there must be analysis of how they took such diverging lines of action and support.
While in Chile, working class activists had always been pushing to unionise the labourers and agitate for collective action, making one of the strongest trade union movements on the continent, in Argentina they had never held a grip in politics nor asserted much power in the sphere of industry. Before 1946 only about 20% of the urban labour force which are the vital constituency for any working class movement were organised, and the main organisation of the CGT underwent a division between Communists and Socialists that weakened its ability to confront the authorities at all. Whether the unions were therefore invitingly weak or whether Pern simply overcame them is not of the greatest importance to the question of why the only manifestation of working class politicisation lined up behind him because it was the manner in which he did come to control them that demonstrates the weaker class consciousness of the Argentines in resisting the governments attempts to co-opt the labourer's representatives, who were so fiercely independent even from the socialists in Chile. There is always the possibility of the deceptively (for historians unsatisfactorily?) simple answer, that the material improvements offered by Pern to his descamisados: higher wages, workers rights, fringe benefits, were just too attractive, if this was a bourgeois trick then probably most working classes in the world would be happy to be fooled in such a manner. The revisionist analysis would state that this is not a case of advantage being taken of the working classes, but rather the working classes taking advantage of a good offer, pursuing the most logical course for their self-advancement with ideological purity being not too high of a price to pay, the hopes of other more radical agitators for working class support pre-empted as a British ambassador noted "[The] immediately tangible [labour and social] benefits with which Pern is identified seems to have taken the wind out of socialist sails". However, the benefits gained by Pern when he was minister of labour did not translate to consistent generosity in power, as his regime 'showed little more than rhetorical enthusiasm for the pursuit of strictly working-class interests' and the emphasis was on controlling the unions rather than granting their members more perks, as Pern reassured the stock exchange in August 1944 "what I want to do is organise the workers through the state, so that the state shows them the way forward".
Pern demonstrated what he meant by 'organising' the workers with his application of the divide-and-conquer tactic of granting legal standing (personera gremial) only to the unions he wanted to deal with, and only one for each area of the economy, diminishing the ability for unions of different trades to bargain for themselves. While it may be seen as submissiveness and that 'almost all the unions cheerfully sacrificed autonomy for material self-advancement' it was more a case of unions being absorbed by way of Pern's tactics of assimilation through tying the union leaders' fate to his, and "intervention" by means of placing loyal Peronists in the positions of power. Pern was not above old-fashioned unsubtle repression either, declaring strikes illegal and then cracking down on the outlawed railroad strikes of the transport labourers, the only area of industry that really had some independence, with the alleged outcome of 25,000 dismissals, 3,000 imprisonments and three former CGT officials being tortured by Police for their involvement. Because of these sticks, and the memory, or perhaps the illusion of a carrot from the benefits he claimed for them, the working classes only effective organisation was co-opted by Pern and their allegiance went with it, although their support for Peronism and their leader was not simply through or because of labour unions, it was the way he got his foot in the door with them and it was the way these unions, which were so radical and mobilising in Chile, became 'conduits of government policy among the workers' in Argentina.
While Pern had been absorbing and controlling labourers' ambitions, in Chile the workers were much more influenced by left-wing ideology, and Marxism in particular, the grass roots of labour being the chief radicalising force in Allende's revolution, certainly not moderated or incorporated in the governments structure. There had long been a radical tendency among the Chileans, even in 1941 the Marxist parties had got over 30% of the vote, and Marxists had been involved in five out of eight government cabinets from 1932 to 1973, that may have been the result of the formative struggle against oligarchy, the economic situation or the shared experiences of the urban working class, but however it came about it signified a tradition of socialism running through the workers and an activism that brought results in the political sphere. It was the Christian Democrats with their outreach programs in the poblaciones squatter settlements and similarly deprived areas that spread the political awakening of the people to the lowest groups and in doing so, spurred on their own demise as these newly mobilised organisations of the pobladores radicalised even beyond the CDP, who were pretty left-wing by any western standard. Any political analysis of working class allegiance in Chile however has to temper the impression of a massive surge to the socialist left with the reminder that Allende only won with a plurality of 36.3 percent of the vote, an incredibly narrow victory over Allesandri and Tomic's 34.9 and 27.8 percent respectively. That election shows that the majority of the country did not vote for Allende's program, a substantial part of even the working class wary as 'the [CDP] government [had] enjoyed widespread popularity and support among workers in urban centres and in the countryside' in the previous election and maintained some of that backing, so it is inaccurate to portray the working class' support as being overwhelmingly behind Popular Unity, which in itself is a coalition of many disparate groups.
Despite the exceptions and disclaimers to the idea of a universal working class allegiance however, it is clear that Allende did appeal to the workers of Chile and there was vast support for 'Chile's Road to Socialism' among the unions, neighbourhood associations, peasant leagues and youth and womens groups that sprouted in the surge of working class participation. While union membership in Chile more than doubled from 271,000 in 1964 to 551,000 in 1970, quantity of unionised labourers cannot alone be a explanation, demonstration or consequence of the Chilean radical tradition, for under the first few years of Pern's regime, when supposedly unions were being increasingly institutionalised and neutered, the membership rose a more impressive 449% from 1946-1951. It must be accounted for with a political and social explanation, with shared urban experience, as demonstrated with the Yarur mill seizing, being a formative process, but the reason for divergence from Argentina is because the Chileans diagnosed political solutions to their socio-political repression and economic austerity, and with a considerable class consciousness applied their weight to building and supporting strong political parties that worked in their interests.
The working class of Chile may not have been instilled with left-wing tendencies from above, but they were hugely influenced by the politicians that led them along the Chilean road to socialism, and as much as any social or economic reasons they supported the Socialists because they promised brotherhood and solidarity for the working class and a society free of exploitation, because they were told that 'Chilean workers must understand that they are part of this government, that they are the government' and this movement even more than the already left-wing Christian Democrats was what was desired to represent the workers in politics, the rhetoric of a popular crusade for the working class ensuring that they mobilised enthusiastically in the direction of the Socialist revolution, although their ideological predilection already pointed that way. Pern's task would seem the more difficult one, convincing the working class that they should be shown "the way forward" in a corporatist state, but he emphatically pulled it off, possibly made easier because of their underdeveloped class consciousness or his thorough subversion of the unions which were their only other sphere of influence, but nonetheless he captured the emotional current and reined it into his favour.
The great success of Pern's method of populism was in reaching out over the heads of the unionists and other potential working class activists and communicating to the working class as a mass, because when the population is addressed as a single entity it becomes an easier object to control, a reason why his doctrine promoted class harmony. With the symbolic integration of the working class with the rest of society it created one people, one nation that devotedly followed its head, nationalism playing the part of unifier and fostering cultural pride in the "New Argentina". Part of this success was due to the great skills of Pern himself, a skilful user of the techniques of 'propaganda, theatricality, display and charismatic authority' who cultivated a cult of personality where, like all Latin American populists, 'charisma bestowed on the new leader the right to exercise power on behalf of the people', a typical function that directed the working class towards a national goal rather than to work for their own means. Allende, while appealing in his own bespectacled way to his supporters and not a bad orator himself, was arguably more ideological and less inspirational, therefore he was more divisive (as the women of the saucepan march could attest) and did not tap into mass nationalist feeling the same way as Pern, he relied on political mobilisation and shared ideology from his working class supporters.
A method which the two demagogues similarly exploited was the populist appeal of a brotherhood, where the working class felt like they were sharing a common identity and the perception that they were all valued collectively by their leaders shaped their allegiance to them both. While the working class could obviously have self-improving motives for supporting Allende, Pern appealed to the workers without the promise of a socialist redistribution of income, but with something that his liberal democratic opponents were missing: a voice for the working class. The General argued for democracy to represent the workers as a collective, not just atomised individuals in a liberal capitalist market place exploited by 'imperialists'. That may be dismissed as simply a voice through Pern's rhetoric, but even that was a significant positive for the Argentine descamisados, that term had been a haughty middle-class insult, but 'the Perns...were quick to seize the epithet and turn it against their opposition' and they transformed it into a badge of defiance. Pern used a radical language that talked of social justice, workers rights, inhuman exploitation by capitalism that was 'appreciated by the workers because it was their own' and despite his committed policy of corporate nationalism that actually encouraged that exploitive capitalism as long as the nation profited from it, he managed to place himself as the scourge of the oligarchy. In the same way that Allende defiantly stated 'I am not the President of the dealers and the speculators', Pern ran a campaign of 'political and social opposition, as a denial of the dominant elite's power, symbols and values' a show of solidarity with the working class and a method of negative integration that convinced them that he was their defender through shared resistance against the exploiting capitalists. With this combination of nationalism, oppositioning and solidarity with the working class against the elite, Pern's presentation gained working class allegiance just as much as any political scheming inside the unions did.
That inside job came to a close when he moved on from labour to the Presidency, and as executive necessity distanced Juan Pern from his laboristas, his second wife stepped in to further cement the family's name in control of the CGT, with a phenomenal work rate and political acumen that belied her previous career as a radio actress. With 'Evita', personality fuelled her political popularity, and she realised through the CGT that she could make the politics of aid and support her personal domain, quickly establishing herself as the main point of contact for the organisation's function of welfare and relief, as 'workers were quick to realise that in order to get what they wanted, it was to their advantage to channel their requests through her' she gained the important power of patronage. It didn't hurt her personal popularity either, which was driven by her Madonna-like looks and emotionally manipulative speeches, which with 'explosions of passion and fury' managed to rally, congratulate, or plead with the people when necessary to urge them in whatever direction General Pern and most of all the country, the patria in her own image as the mother of a nation, needed. She positioned herself as 'only one more descamisada' and it was this humble national appeal of an obviously extraordinary, missionary benefactress that connected emotionally with the masses, a long-lasting devotion to this day that was supplemented at the time by her political domination of the CGT and the influence that that lent her to aid her husband's cause. It is another case where appealing to the populace with a discourse of national solidarity for workers, backed up by benevolent but circumscribed welfare convinces the people of their identity and loyalty, very much the General's technique but with her own emotional touch.
Economic circumstances and political mobilisation may be the obvious forces that shape the allegiance of the working class, but cultural movements also defined the mood of the masses, with a growing appetite for culture matching the working classes' participation in politics, and the two were linked as the main consumer of the precious spare time the working class had. While some world-renowned literary figures held disdainful views of Pern such as Jorge Luis Borges ('Dictatorships foster oppression, dictatorships foster servitude, dictatorships foster cruelty; more abominable is the fact that they foster idiocy.') and Julio Cortzar (who emigrated to France in opposition to Pern in 1951), Pern was an enthusiastic promoter of the Tango as a symbol of nation pride and was known to flavour his speeches with Tango-style rhetoric, a clear demonstration of his populist outreach in contrast to his constant positioning against the 'elites'. In keeping with the more earthy drive of the Chilean working class was the 'New Song' of the 60's, involving protest songs, a rejection of popular commercial music (inevitably inferior imitations of the Anglo-American pop music that dominated that decade) that had a folk connection and a romantic solidarity with the humble as best sang by Violeta Parra.
The working class were not just passive receivers of protest songs along with the Marxist dialogue of their parties in Chile, nor were the Argentines taken advantage of by a leader they had blind rapturous devotion for, there was plenty of room for working class agency in the times of Pern and Allende, and history from above would be a limited perspective in not acknowledging the activism from below and the independence of the working class as a social group from their representing political parties. The view of Argentine unions as a submissive labour movement that allowed Pern to incorporate them overlooks the reasons that allowed him to dominate them, namely the infighting of the labour movement prior to Peronism and the harsh repression of any struggle against the incorporation of the unions, those were their failings, not a lack of vigour. Also, it may be questioned as to whether the labourers were taken advantage of at all, since they had gained considerable wage increases and benefits that they were in no position to demand before Pern came into power, and if one of the objects of any working class movement is to achieve concrete material gains for the people, then there is no need for them to actively resist Peronism or fight for more, because they had been given better than they could have realistically achieved without him. However, unfortunately for the reputation perhaps of the Argentine working class as a movement, unfairly or not they are judged by their determination to achieve a fairer redistribution of income and an improvement of their standing in society, and in that test undoubtedly they did not apply themselves, whether that be because of the working class' formative process or their organisation's experience and reaction under Pern, its material gains were modest, and movement weak.
Also pursuing material gains were the Chilean workers, but they were not shy of taking matters into their own hands even though their government (literally, according to Allende) was actually promising a redistribution of wealth, it just was not fast enough for them. The seizure of the Yarur mill was a move perhaps emboldened by the election of Allende but it was certainly not sanctioned by him, and it served to kick-start the revolution into a gear that Popular Unity was perhaps not ready for. Similarly the sprouting of cordones industriales everywhere, so that by late 1973 they included almost half of all manufacturing workers, was at first an independent action by the cordn Cerrillos in protest at the governments non-intervention in a factory conflict. Although these militant industrial belts eventually rallied around the government in the face of the reactionaries, along with the activities of MIR it demonstrates how there was no tight grip on the working class' organisations in the same way that Pern had, they ended up radicalising far beyond the scope of the political parties they had elected and it can be doubted whether there was an allegiance to Popular Unity or simply co-operation and support while it was beneficial to them. In fact, even with the enforced docility of the Argentine working class activists, the literally correct diagnosis would be that the working class never has any allegiance except to itself, it may throw its weight behind a political force like Peronism or Popular Unity, and once under that regime it may fall sway to the inspiring yet unrewarding populism, or it may endeavour to fulfil the ideology in spite of the regime that shares it with them, but those are all means to an end rather than a binding loyalty.
Determining the appeal of Allende's socialist agenda to a working class is not mystifying, the only question that needs to be explained is how such a road was taken so openly and how the proletariat had such a strong class consciousness that they zealously pursued it, even to the point of taking it beyond Allende's wishes. The unique tradition of Chile in part answers both those questions, as it enabled Marxist ideas to be propagated, discussed and elected into office in a democratic fashion, and it also focused the worker's ambitions on the political sphere that drove them to participate in a way that created such a strong movement. The analysis of Argentina's working class however, has always had the feeling of a post-mortem, the American Federation of Labour's quandary about the cause of death being that 'it is not certain whether the apparent popularity of President Juan D. Pern is due to the satisfaction of the working masses or...to the various techniques of psychological intimidation or coercion to which Mr. Pern has resorted' being a typical fault line of questioning. However a judgement on that issue is futile because in a tactic of carrot and stick, both elements are equally vital, a more pertinent factor to be analysed is the reason behind the relative weakness of the Argentine working class' political movement, and their unions in particular, the answers being a tradition of divided but unfocused leftists in a working class that was anaemically unionised, a stark contrast to Chile's brimming left-wing scene. Both peoples were in need of a figurehead that inspired and connected with them, although Allende depended less on populist displays for his support; both were the product of an exploitative society that wanted to be counted as a collective, although the Chileans wanted to take matters into their own hands more than the Argentines who were satisfied by oppositionist rhetoric, and both were hoping to improve their own lot independently if possible, although for the Argentines it was not. The differing allegiances of the descamisados and the compaeros are explained by the dual processes of the formative experience that determined the character of their movement, and the imposing forces (ideology or personality) that shaped that movement and determined its outcome.
