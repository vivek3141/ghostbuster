Palladium when in its +2 oxidation state is electrophilic and so can attack aromatic rings to form aryl-palladium complexes. For this process to occur with high regioselectivity it has to be directed using a donor group previously placed on the ring. This group coordinates to the palladium and forces palladation to occur orthro to the donor group, this is referred to as orthro-metallation.
