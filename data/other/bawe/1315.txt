The tree data model is used in computer science for things like file systems and search algorithms. Trees are also used in modelling chemical structures and biological systems.
This coursework will investigate tree models as applied to binary search and also look at the procedure for inserting data into such a tree. This coursework will result in a better understanding of how to model a problem based on the tree model.
The degree of the tree that will be used is the maximum number of child nodes that any particular node can have. In this case, where a binary tree will be used, the degree is 2.
An algorithm is to be devised to insert data into a binary tree and thus construct trees for the data. The following datasets will be involved:
