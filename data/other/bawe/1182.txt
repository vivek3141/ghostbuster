The purpose of the experiment was to synthesis manganese (II) phthalocyanine, and to use pyridine to investigate its oxygen binding properties. Manganese (II) phthalocyanine is a metal derivative belonging to the phthalocyanines, which are themselves a naturally occurring subgroup of the porphyrins.
Manganese is an important element in nature, for animals as it utilises the vitamin B 1, plus is an essential trace element required by plants. A shortage of manganese in a plant becomes evident relatively early as a lack of chlorophyll the photosynethetic pigment present in plants, which results in yellow or grey streaks appearing on its leaves. Manganese is vital for photosynethesis as it activates some of the enzymes involved in the oxidation of carbohydrates e.g. oxalosuccinic decarboxylase
Manganese (II) phthalocyanine consists of manganese in a planar environment of four nitrogen atoms in a square planar arrangement. It can be easily prepared and as such has been used as a model compound in studies to investigate manganese's role in photosynthesis, oxygen transport and activation.
Metalloporphyrins are important naturally occurring compounds, two such compounds are Chlorophyll, the green colouring photosynthetic pigment containing magnesium found in plants, and heme the red coloured pigment containing iron vital for the uptake and transport of oxygen around animals.
This could be regarded as a relatively high-risk experiment as caution should be taken when using a variety of the chemicals being used, the risks associated with them are as follows: - Corrosive- Pyridine, Toxic- Phthalonitrile, and the following should take place in a fume cupboard- Soxhlet extraction, and handling pyridine where extreme caution should be taken and protective gloves worn.
