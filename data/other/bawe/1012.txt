To examine the procedures involved for the production of canned fruits and vegetables, particularly those factors affecting the quality and safety of the product. To achieve this by producing canned apples, baked beans and peas to various specifications, and to carry out sensory evaluation on the products produced.
The basic idea behind all forms of food preservation is either to slow down the activity of pathogenic bacteria, to kill the bacteria altogether, or in certain cases, to destroy enzymes naturally found in a food that cause it to spoil or discolour quickly. Canning is the process of heating food in a hermetically sealed (airtight) container. Since the 1820's, canning has provided a way for people to store foods for extremely long periods of time. We generally think of 'cans' as being metal, but any sealable container can serve as a can. One problem with canning, and the reason why refrigeration or freezing is more preferable, is that the heat treatment of the cans generally changes its taste, texture and its nutritional content. The main differences between canning fruit and vegetables are in the preparation of raw materials, the use of brines /syrups, and the conditions for sterilisation. These will be discussed further below.
