Yahoo is an internet communications and media company that offers online navigational directories. It is a market leader in generating branded advertising from traditional marketers, which contributed 88% of total revenues in 2004. This advertising appears on a range of its internet and mobile services, of which the major ones will be discussed in the context of the essay.
The market for internet products and services is characterised by rapid change, converging technologies, and constant competition. In such a competitive environment, an understanding and continuous scanning and analysis of the macro and micro marketing environment for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT analysis), and the lookout for strategic windows, are essential for the company's survival and success. The analysis of the marketing environment should result in the formation of a marketing mix programme to implement the marketing strategy. The macro and micro marketing environment forces affecting the company and consumers will be analysed in turn, and the likeliness of their influence on the development of a suitable marketing mix will be considered. The marketing mix will be considered in terms of the influence of these environment forces on the "5 P's" of the marketing mix (Product, Place/Distribution, Promotion, Price, and People).
