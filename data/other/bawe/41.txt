In Assignment 1, Part A was demonstrated the material selection for the fresh-water heat exchanger tubes. In Part B, material and process were selected for column spacers under a varying compressive load. Finally, the structural section was selected for a beam in Assignment 2. Cambridge Engineering Selector was mainly used in those cases to select the best suitable results. In conclusion, "Higher Conductivity Copper" was chosen for fresh-water heat exchanger tubes in Assignment 1 Part A. Secondly, "Silicon" was selected for column spacers and "Fine Grinding (Automated)" and "Polishing (Automated)" processes were selected to use in manufacturing in Assignment 1 Part B. Finally, "Hot Fin. Steel (Y.S.355MPa) Circular Hollow-(1945.0)" was chosen for the optimum structural section.
