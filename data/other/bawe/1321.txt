The reading value of the diluted sample (100 ml) is 92. According the formula y=41.291x, the concentration of iron in solution of diluted beverage is 2.23g/ml, so when we calculated back to the original drink the concentration of iron is 4.46g/ml.
Due to the concentration of iron in sample is 4.46g/ml by first method, in 50 ml sample should content 223g iron. So X=223g/ 25g/ml=8.9 ml. so added 0, X, 2X, 3X ml of stock iron solution into A, B, C, D labeled flask respectively.
Using the ratio is constant to calculate the concentration of iron in drink
The calculation formula: 95.55/Z= (184-94)/223, where Z is the iron concentration in beverage;
Z=236.8 g which means there is 236.8g iron in 50 ml drink sample, so using the standard addition method, the iron concentration in beverage is 236.8g/ 50ml = 4.73g/ml.
Comparing the two methods, the standard addition method is better than calibration plot. Due to the fact that in the first method, we used standard iron contented solution to draw the calibration curve, and separately determine the sample reading of atomic absorption spectrophotometry which contents the matrix interference can affect result. But when using the second method, standard addition method, in each flask contented same volume of sample (50 ml), so this method can minimum or very often eliminated the interference and get more reasonable answer.
On the label showing the concentration of Ammonium ferric citrate is 0.002% (0.002 g/100ml). And the structure of Ammonium ferric citrate is C 6H 11FeNO 7. The molecule weight of Ammonium ferric citrate is 265 and Fe molecule
Molecule weight is 56, so in sample the concentration of iron is 4.23g/ml.
Pomeranz (1987) stated the heat energy from flame can raise an electron in some atoms group jump to an excited state, if the excited electron drops down back to ground state from its original excited level in one jump, the radiation given off is called resonance line. Low flame temperatures (900-1200 oC) are used so that only easily excited elements such the alkali and alkaline earth metals produce emissions. This results in a simpler spectrum and reduces interference from other elements that may be present (Nielsen, 2003).
The definition of transition elements are the elements in the 'd-block' of the periodic table (Hill, 2000). When determining transition metal need more energy provided for exciting electron from ground state to excited level. In atomic absorption spectroscopy, the most commonly used fuel/ oxidant system is air-acetylene and over 30 elements can usefully be measured using this combination of gases, and this temperature of this flame is of the order of 2300 oC which is great higher than flame photometry (King, 1978), so the atomic absorption methods can excited the transition metals due to the wavelength from an extend source and can provide higher energy.
