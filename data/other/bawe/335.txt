The aim of this experiment was to determine the HA titre of a virus stock and the HI titre of an antibody stock. This was done by setting up HA and HI assays using an unknown virus. The results show that the HA titre of the virus was 3200HA per ml, which gives 1.44x10 10 virions. Also, the HI titre of antibody was 1600HI per ml, and the virus was identified to be Influenza A subtype H1.
In order to replicate and produce progeny, a virus needs to gain entry into a host cell. This is because they cannot generate ATP on their own and need to acquire ATP from the host cell for reproduction. In the early events of the replication cycle, the virus particle (virion) adsorbs 1 onto the host cell and attaches to receptors on the cell surface. This is known as attachment. Commonly, the receptors on the host cell surface are glycoproteins or glycolipids, and the virus has evolved to bind to these molecules. The virus does not bind to the whole molecule, but rather domains within the molecule.
Some viruses have a property called haemagglutination, where cell surface binding structures on the virion can bind to the surface of red blood cells due to the viral protein called haemagglutinin (HA). This is a laboratory phenomenon, where the red blood cells create a lattice. Usually, only viruses which bind to simple carbohydrate motifs on the cell surface have this property. This phenomenon can be used to determine the HA titre.
The HA of the virus can be a primary target of the immune system, so specific antibodies can be raised against it. This property can be used in the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, where an unknown virus can be identified and the HI titre can be defined.
