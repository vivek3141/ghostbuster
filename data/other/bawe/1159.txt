Trypsin inhibitors (TI) are proteins commonly found in beans and legumes such as soyabeans, kidney beans and egg white, which inhibit  trypsin activity. Trypsin is a major protease or proteolytic enzyme - endopeptidase in the duodenum of the human alimentary canal. It catalyses protein digestion and results in peptides.
Does not function when TI presents no p-nitroaniline released.
In this practical, TI is extracted from defatted soyabean meal and incubated under standard conditions (standard - without TI, heated and unheated TI) therefore used to determine Trypsin Inhibitor Activity (TIA)
TIA shows the amount (mg) of pure trypsin inhibited per gram of sample. The higher the absorbance (higher the yellow intensity), the more the BAPNA is broken down, normal protein digestion takes place, because of the less TI presents, thus lower inhibition percentage and TIA, vice versa.
The anomalous inhibition percentage of heated samples is due to high anomalous HSaB absorbance value = 0.095). However, TIAs are more reliable in this case to show that heated samples have a lower TIA value than unheated ones. Despite it is expected to be much lower than 49.3mg/g sample because of the denatured and inactivated TI, thus no inhibition, unless, there is another protein inhibitor: "there are two types of these (protein) inhibitors (Kunitz trypsin inhibitor and bowman-birk inhibitor)" in soyabeans
