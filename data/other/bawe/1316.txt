Translate the following pseudo-code into a 'C' program and test the program by executing it for the following inputs: n = 3, 21, 25, 27. Check if there is an input for which the program doesn't halt.
Output values for each of the inputs for the above program:
The problem with this particular implementation is that it does not check validity of input and so does NOT halt when input other than integers are used.
As long as input is an INTEGER, the program will halt.
