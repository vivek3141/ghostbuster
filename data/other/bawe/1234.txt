Therefore, temperature change for 1g of benzoic acid;
In order to work out kcal/g/C, the thermal capacity for the bomb calorimeter must be defined.
The Bomb calorimeter has thus been calibrated, allowing the necessary means to work out the gross energy (GE) content from a sample of biscuit. According to the manufacturers estimate, the GE should be 4.7kcal/g.
The aim of this exercise was to assess food intake over a period of five days, estimate the intake of nutrients and relate this to the subjects' energy needs and expenditure.
