Initially the plan for the second part of the project was to complete the design totally then begin implementation, iterating the analysis, design and implementation as required. Having completed an initial analysis for part one of the project, we felt it would be preferable to do a rough design then to begin the basic implementation, effectively running design and implementation in parallel but with design a few steps ahead. The critical path analysis can be seen below. The analyses, designs and implementations are constantly iterated in parallel throughout the project, but both paths (GUI and non-GUI) are equal in length.
We felt that our initial staff estimates would have given us a very large design team for the size of task, possibly over-complicating the design process, and we were keen to begin the implementation as quickly as possible as we were aware it was the largest task which was likely to take the most time. This meant that we had to redistribute effort and people accordingly. The initial staff plan was given in part one of the project and the final revised version can be seen below.
We iterated the analysis and design as implementation progressed, with team members swapping between roles as they became free. For example, Brian McWilliams had been heavily involved with analysis in part one of the project so was allocated tasks in the first stages of implementation then, when these were completed, was able to swap to iterating the analysis documents. We aimed to make the work distribution as fair as possible, while aiming for optimal use of each team member's time - this included making use of their existing skills, such as using those who had been most involved with analysis in part one to iterate the analysis in part two. The initial effort and schedule estimates were included in part one of the project and the final revised version can be seen below, split between weeks and activities.
