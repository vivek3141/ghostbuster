Currently, Barclays Bank PLC hold almost 271m shares, 3.48% of the company. It is also worth noting that employees and directors hold significant shares and share options - although not enough to warrant disclosure as the total amount does not come to more than 3% of the company
Total net debt decreased by 248m (6.5%) between the 2004 (restated) accounts and the 2005 accounts
The implication is that the balance sheet is prepared conservatively, in line with accounting conventions. It also implies that the actual balance sheet is stronger than the reported balance sheet. Had the company needed to strengthen the balance sheet it could have revalued the properties and included their current market values, however given the financial strength of the company this does not seem to be necessary - and means that should the company need to strengthen the accounts at a later stage this could be a way to do it
