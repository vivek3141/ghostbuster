This report details the specification, design, implementation and testing of software written to control a buggy and allow it to follow an optically marked track. The software was written in the C programming language and three variants were produced: one to allow the buggy to follow a square track - alternately clockwise and anticlockwise - one to allow it to follow a maze track and one to allow it to follow any other suitably marked track. The system performed excellently in all cases, following the track accurately and searching efficiently when the track was lost.
