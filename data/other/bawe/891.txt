In stage 1 I identified and critically analysed the personal characteristics of lack of self-confidence and low self-esteem using the description, feelings, evaluation and analysis phases of the Gibbs reflective cycle (Gibbs, 1988 cited in: Palmer et al, 1994 p39); stage 2 will focus on the action planning phase. The following table is an annotated action plan for my future development of these key characteristics with the identified current issues being confidence, self-esteem, self-consciousness and difficulty in 'saying no'. I have chosen to focus on these 4 areas as I feel they are inextricably linked to my confidence and therefore need to be addressed together. The action plan identifies how I feel I can improve and develop these areas, integrates relevant literature and includes a schedule for review. I believe the goals I have set are SMART as they are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely. I also feel my objectives are achievable within the remainder of this academic year and hope that by focusing on these areas I will be able to enhance my personal and professional development.
