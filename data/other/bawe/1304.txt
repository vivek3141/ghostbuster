Overall bio-diesel performed very well compared to mineral diesel. Positives for bio-diesel were its lower friction power due to its superior lubricating properties and its higher levels of mechanical efficiency. On the down side it could not perform at high levels of load and it had a lower indicated thermal efficiency. However indicated thermal efficiency is not a very useful gauge of performance as it ignores mechanical losses. Where brake thermal efficiency was concerned it performed to just about an equal level as mineral diesel. With all the above points in mind and the environmental benefits of bio-diesel it could substitute for mineral diesel as a transport fuel very well.
