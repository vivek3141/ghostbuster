When designing the site's layout, our primary concern was usability and navigation. Interface is made as simple and intuitive as possible, so that users can perform tasks quickly and effectively without having to deal with complex controls or navigation.
The quality and amount of information the site provides has linked directly to the information looked by used during a typical purchase (or digital window shopping). Site provide end users with all the information necessary to purchase our company's products, as well as company background information, and thus satisfy the requirement of providing customers with all the information they need without ever leaving the site, and without having to contact the company directly, via phone or otherwise.
Extensive debugging was done the during codeing process. Printf statements were used extensively to observe the contents of the variables and during database updation tables were monitored at the mysql prompt using SELECT statements. Therfore only the functional requiremets were documented in the test report.
After evaluating the site against the coursework specification, we found that the end product satisfies the requirements set out in the specification. All the facilities identified in the requirements have been implemented, and behave as expected.
However there are limitation to the site and the operations currently done can be further improved.
