The Human body is an unimaginably complex organization and integration of complex sub-systems ranging from the cells to the organ systems. The more complex the organization gets, the tougher it is to control and co-ordinate the various activities that they perform. The Neurological system has been designed in the human body for the function of control and coordination by electrical and chemical signals. The importance of Neurological sciences has also widened with the advent of Biological psychology that holds the Nervous system and Endocrine system responsible for the behaviour of the organism including emotion, cognition, motivation, etc.
In this paper, we analyse the various components of the Neurological system, their anatomy and functioning in a fairly detailed manner. The components of the neurological system i.e. the central nervous system comprising of the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system are explained along with an account of their sections by virtue of location, function, etc. We then look at the various techniques that are employed for scanning the brain. In this section regarding the various brain scanning techniques, there is a comprehensive account of the basic principle on which they work, their uses, applications and limitations. We also discuss future applications of brain scanning and other discoveries relating to the neurological system.
There are 2 major subdivisions of the neurological system
The Central Nervous System comprising of the brain protected by the cranium or the enclosing part of the skull and spinal cord protected by the vertebral column or the back bone.
The Peripheral Nervous System comprises of bundles of nerve cells combined to form nervous tissues. The run from the central nervous system to the various organs carrying signals across them. These nerve cells or neurons form knot like concentrated areas called Ganglions.
