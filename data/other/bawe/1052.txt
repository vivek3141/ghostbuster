Learning a foreign language is a complex process affected by an infinite number of variables and conditions. Consequently, a number of theories and methods have emerged in order to account for this multifaceted nature of foreign language learning. The aim of this essay is to illustrate how theories of second language learning and teaching applied or not in my short experience of learning Persian. As far as I am concerned, the lack of motivation, comprehensible input and negotiated output were the most crucial factors that impeded my progress in learning Persian. Thus, through a brief analysis of the learning strategies that I employed in order to approach this daunting task, the errors that I made and the theories behind them I will present how the lack of these three factors affected my progress in the learning process.
In conclusion, learning Persian was a difficult but at the same time interesting experience, because it was the first time that I tried to learn a foreign language not by means of my mother tongue (Greek) but through a language (English) that I have not achieved yet a native-like mastery. Through this experience I realised that as far as language learning is concerned, exposure to comprehensible input, either in the form of classroom instructions and teaching or in the form of modified teacher talk, along with target language production from the part of the learner and interaction with other speakers are of great significance. However, the prerequisite, in order for these three factors to facilitate the learning process, is learner's internal drive and enthusiasm for the language. Lastly, the amount of studying that the learner devotes is quite crucial. Personally, I have to admit that, because of the fact that I lacked the practice that input and output offers to a learner, I should have invested more time and effort to the learning process.
