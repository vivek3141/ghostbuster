As seen above stand-alone operation is quite unstable. One way to stablise the operation is to use a ballast controller. With varying load, instead of letting the generator respond to the load, the ballast controller responds. The generator operates at constant output (current, voltage, power), the load draws what it requires and the excess power is 'dumped'. This is all managed by the ballast controller. The table below shows how the ballast controller reacted under varying load (set of lights).
Graph 6 overleaf shows the efficiency of the system as a function of the load. It is perfectly linear as the load drew what ever power it needed and the ballast controller reacted accordingly. Quite obviously at zero load the efficiency was zero as all the power was being dumped into a resistor bank. As the load increased the efficiency increased in hand. So if a load of 350W was activated the efficiency of the system would be 100%.
The ballast control system regulated the voltage very effectively as it was held at 220V regardless of the load. Whereas during the stand-alone operation in section 3 the voltage 'jumped' around as load varied. It took some time for the voltage to stabilise upon load adjustment.
With a ballast control system, an induction machine micro-hydro scheme would be very effective as a stand alone single-phase system. This is because of the ease of voltage regulation. An induction machine micro-hydro scheme would also be effective when ran as a three-phase grid connected system.
When running as a stand-alone single-phase ballast controlled system it would be valuable to use the excess power instead of just dumping it. There are a number of possible uses for this excess power, for example using the energy from a resistor bank to heat water for district heating or storage in a heat sink. In the future, when and if the hydrogen economy takes off, the excess power could be used to generate hydrogen.
