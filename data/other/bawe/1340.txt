As this brief analysis shows, literacy practices in the primary school are various and complex. It is evident that literacy is far more than just learning how to read and write. The different activities are expressly conceived to engage children in active reading and writing, encouraging discussions and sharing of ideas and experiences for the development of independent thoughts and judgements. This is a critical approach to literacy, which aims at "a joint interactive construction of knowledge through critical enquiry" (Baker and Jones, 1998: 598). Literacy is thus considered as a mean to develop consciousness and critical thinking habits; an instrument that helps children to learn how to explain and analyse the world and the society.
The teacher is not only the main mediator of literacy, but she also has an important role in integrating the school, the families and the community. Teaching is not perceived as an independent and distinct activity, but it is embedded in a continuous dialogue and exchange of information among the school and the outside reality.
