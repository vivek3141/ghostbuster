This essay is the assessment of module 3184 where we are expected to evaluate and ponder our work experience, and identify the learning we accomplished in relation to hospitality management and our own personal development. It consists of two parts, the first of which is based on the eleven qualities of successful managers, by Pedler et al (2001); it identifies two managerial skills I gained during my work experiences and also reflects upon two other which I did not acquire, or was not possible for me to improve. It is an introspective section, where I relate to industry examples I experienced, analyse them through Kolb (1996) Learning Cycle model and consider different author's approaches to interpersonal skills, their improvement, and impact on building a managerial attitude and methodology.
The second part the essay, relates to how the Meridien Dona Filipa, Algarve, in Portugal, dealt with customer satisfaction and meeting their expectations. I analyse the attempts made by the enterprise to meet such needs and demands, and evaluate their procedures in order to do so, and shape the levels of achievement.
