Ikea's philosophy is to provide "low price, value for money furnishings with a wide range of choice". This philosophy, along with Ikea's associated competitive strategy, influences the operations performance objectives of the company. The company's overall competitive strategy influences the operation's competitive role within the company which in turn influences the performance objectives. It will be shown that the resulting main performance objectives of Ikea's operations are Cost (influenced by the philosophy and overall strategy of offering "prices so low the majority of people can afford to buy them") and Flexibility (most specifically Mix Flexibility, influenced by the overall strategy of providing a "wide range of home furnishings"). In contrast it will be demonstrated that Ikea's traditional competitors would probably place more importance on the Quality objective than perhaps Ikea would, whereas the Cost objective would be a less important objective. In the following paragraphs, the five performance objectives (Slack et al p.44) of Ikea and traditional competitors will be compared and contrasted.
Using table 3.3 in Slack et al (p.81) as a framework, the following are the key structural and infrastructural operations decisions that Ikea has made in order to achieve the appropriate levels of performance:
One possible source of tension between marking and operations is the objective of marketing to have a "Scandinavian Feel" to the designs of the furniture. The differences in taste between the different countries results in slow-moving items in some countries. The operations objective to source products from many different sources and countries, is limited to those products having a "Scandinavian feel" and hence there is a tension between marketing and operations.
