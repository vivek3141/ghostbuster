Analysing Toyota's operations strategy would require entire books and summarising it would make this essay too superficial. Therefore, we have chosen to focus on two key areas, mainly in the US: the capacity dynamics and the supply network. We will examine how these resources are contributing to Toyota's incredible sales growth in ten years, in the biggest market in the world: North America (see Operations matrix in Annex A6).
Thirty years ago, Toyota was operating from Japan and exporting its cars worldwide, limited by the quota of imports in the US. Eventually, when Toyota started to build production facilities in the US in 1986, few experts would bet on their capability to compete with the then-called Big-Three (GM, Ford, DaimlerChrysler). Now, while Toyota is gaining market share, raking in profits, building new plants, maintaining harmonious supplier relations, GM and Ford continue on a downward financial spiral despite their use of some of Toyota's techniques like TPS (Toyota Production System) at many plants. Between 1995 and 2005, Toyota's market share has increased by 82% whereas GM or Ford lost more than 20% in the same period (see annex A1).
In the capital intensive automotive industry, all carmakers share the dilemma of meeting the uncertain demand. Considering inventories costs, cars price elasticity, we understand even more that building and managing appropriate capacity to meet market requirements is a critical and difficult task.
Below, we will analyse some key elements in the capacity dynamics that improve Toyota's performance objectives to fit with market requirements (fig. 1). In the US, Toyota's overall corporate goal is to serve the North American market with product designed, made and sold by North Americans (industryweek.com, Feb. 2006). So far, Toyota has invested $16.8 billion in North America operations (toyota.com). Yet, Toyota's expansion is still ongoing.
Supply network management is embedded in the know-how or capabilities of Toyota. While operating only in Japan, Toyota understood, from the outset, that its own success depended on its suppliers' operations strategies. Despite increasing capacity, Toyota would not keep up with demand without the support of its suppliers. Although this principle is shared by all carmakers, we will analyse how Toyota is remaining the best in supply network relationship.
We have analysed 2 key aspects of Toyota's operations strategy. They explain how and why Toyota is and will remain ahead of competition for years to come. However, no matter how Toyota is efficient and prudent in its strategy, it faces three main threats in the future:
- Toyota is likely to overcome GM as the 1 st carmaker in the next 2 years. How will US government react? Also, how will Toyota handle the trade-off between quality and volumes required (dependability)? How about customers' perception of the Japanese carmaker? There may be strong reactions to Toyota leadership in the US market. Toyota will only overcome the impacts of those reactions by cooperating with all stakeholders and adding value to them, directly or indirectly. By doing so, we believe Toyota would be less criticised due to its involvement in the entire community. This is a strategy Toyota has already started to follow.
- Toyota, unlike counterparts, is not aggressively present in China, one of the biggest markets. This seems truly to be a strategic mistake but Toyota certainly assessed it during a long time. Deliberately focusing more on North America and Europe against the BRIC zone (Brazil, Russia, India and China) will have its costs. Would the benefit of North America outweigh the costs of not being present in these areas? We do not believe so and we share the view of many automobile industry analysts.
- Increasing the capacity and managing the supply chain as Toyota does it, is costly. As long as the market is requiring Toyota's products, there will be little risk. However, when Toyota will have high fixed costs (plants, wages) and face a lower demand, it might struggle to find enough cash to maintain the supply network relationship, the labour, the plants. The challenge will be to avoid the negative spiral that GM and Ford are facing now.
The threats are strong but Toyota does its best when confronted by challenges. The oil price spikes in the 1970s and the expensive yen of the late 1980s slowed its growth only temporarily. In their never-ending efforts to do things better, "Toyota  executives seem almost infinitely adaptable" (Donald N. Smith, a manufacturing expert at the University of Michigan's engineering school). The worst mistake global automakers can make is to not assume that Toyota will be markedly better five years from now, as it has shown in its recent history.
