To determine if the results of my project are representative of planned speech as a whole, I decided to compare my findings to a larger corpus. As, the size of this project is limited, I decided to limit my investigation to a small, but representative sample.
As the speech used in my project is planned speech I felt it would be best to compare my data to other planned speech. To do this, I used a sub-corprus of the BNC corpus titled "written to be spoken" compiled of planned speech. I used the internet tool Sketch Engine to search for the 'I' and 'we' pronouns and took a random sample of 15 concordances from each pronoun for evaluation.
In this project, I have successfully constructed a corpus for the task of determining specific patterns in the use of the 'I' and 'we' pronouns in Tony Blair's speeches relating to membership of various social groups. I have also related these findings to a larger corpus of planned language and evaluated the similarities and differences found between the two.
In conclusion, I have shown there are very specific ways in which these pronouns are used in Tony Blair's speeches. This shows the speaker's awareness of his audience, as well as their attitudes towards him and the social groups he belongs to. Some features are shared by planned speech in general, although there are some features that appear only in the context of the political speeches made by Blair. If I were to perform a follow up study, it would be interesting to compare Blair's speeches to the speeches of other politicians to determine if the features identified relate to political speeches in general or are specific to the speeches of Tony Blair.
