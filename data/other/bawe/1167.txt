a) ATP has a relative atomic mass of 350. If the machine is able to detect 1000 fg (fg = fentogram = 10 -15g) which, a sensitive machine should be able to. In terms of ATP mol it should be able to detect 2.910 -13 mol.
b) In terms of biological cells a sensitive machine can detect around 100 bacterial cells. In practice though, this is likely to be between 10 -3 and 10 -4 cells.
The correlation between the ATP concentration and the concentration of bacteria is very marked. This can be seen when looking at the R 2 value, the closer the number is to one, the more significance in the correlation between the two sets of data. Here, the R 2 value was 0.99 which is very close to 1.
The ATP assay was able to detect differences in the level of contamination between the two pieces of wood. However, the levels of ATP were at the lower limits of the capability of the Hy-lite machine. This means, although it is possible to say that it was the piece of wood 'A' that was contaminated it cannot be expressed with any confidence.
The major problem/criticism with the ATP assay method is that it does not solely account for ATP from bacteria. It detects all ATP and, as all living cells contain ATP, any food particles left on food preparation food surfaces will also be taken into account. Having said this, if a food surface is clean it should have no food particles and therefore no ATP. On food production surfaces therefore, the aim should always be to obtain as low as possible ATP readings.
The ATP assay method is clearly more sensitive when compared to the resazurin method. This is because the ATP assay method gives a quantitative result for the number of bacterial cells present whereas the resazurin method only give a rough identification as to the level of micro-organisms, to the nearest 10 -1.
