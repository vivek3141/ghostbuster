Second language acquisition is a thorougly investigated field and one attracting the interest of linguists over the years. The SLA theories that have been developed can be grouped into two major sets: a) those that "give primary importance to the learners' innate characteristics" (Lighbrown & Spada, 1999, p. 31) such as Constructivism and Innatism and b) those which "emphasize the essential role of the environment in shaping language learning" (Lightbrown & Spada, 1999, p. 31) such as Cognitivism and Behaviorism. However, in the limited space provided, this essay examines how Cognitivism, Behaviorism and Constructivism view the role of L1, input and output in SLA and analyzes how these key issues explain certain features of my learning of Persian such as the course-book design, grammar and vocabulary.
To conclude, this paper has examined the role that L1, input and output play in theories of SLA and has shown how these elements can explain certain features of my learning of Persian. Generally, the acquisition of a second language is a very complex issue and its discussion includes a lot of parameters. In particular, some of these parameters such as the role of instruction, motivation, aptitude and learning strategies were not examined in the essay and thus constitute part of its limitations. Besides, reference was made only to some theories of SLA and not to others which is another limitation of the analysis. However, apart from these limitations the essay provides a good understanding of second language learning. This understanding according to Brown (2000), "will determine your teaching style, your approach, methods, and classroom techniques" (p. 7).
