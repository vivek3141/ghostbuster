This report consists of a detailed analysis of the departmental profit and loss report, suggesting alternatives to cut costs or increase profit, taking into thought the significance of the variance figures and percentages. A general analysis of the front page P&L will be related to the departmental statements and its consequences and influences put forth. Finally, an evaluation of the Balance Sheet and relevant Ratios is also taken into account.
A higher importance will be given to variable costs, as when it comes to decision-making, it is more functional to bear in mind controllable costs, due to fixed costs being mostly altered because of external factors which are beyond the handling of the hotel (Adams, 1997).
After analysing figures in the different statements, it is concluded that the Bards Hall Hotel general financial performance is positive; however, there is always room for improvement, and the remaining idea is that the hotel should work to keep control of its variable costs and improve sales, as these measure will contribute to a growth in profit (Burgess, 2001). The net worth ratios, also prove the positive performance of the measure and should be kept track of, as they guarantee economic stability (Jagels & Coltman, 2004).Other ratios such as average spend should also be continually monitored and if needed decreased, however, and as stated before, levels of quality should be assessed so they don't fall when cutting costs (Chin et al, 1995).
