This essay will explore the different concepts pertaining to legal parentage and parental responsibility in family law; focusing on how legal parentage is determined in common law and following the enactment of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 (HFEA 1990). The emphasis on this essay will then shift to the concept of parental responsibility and the numerous ways in which an individual who does not have parental responsibility can then take steps to acquire it. As such a discussion of those legal steps e.g. residence and adoption orders will be conducted on the basis of the current problem being analysed. Lastly the conclusion will be a reassessment of the issues discussed in the main sections and consequently a brief discussion as to whether these concepts are coherent with modern family life.
