For this exercise, a reflection coefficient of 0.18 was used, representing a deciduous forest. The growth rate of the forest, derived by multiplying the amount of absorbed solar radiation by the Radiation Use Efficiency (RUE) of the vegetation, was seen to change in response to variations in incoming solar radiation, leaf area index, extinction coefficient and RUE. The effect of changing each of these parameters in isolation, as well as their interaction, is discussed below.
Sheltered and open soybean crops showed differing energy balances and rates of water use over the three days (table 2). Where E is greater than Rn, and C is negative, the amount of energy used by the plant for evapotranspiration was greater than that received as solar radiation. This energy comes from the air surrounding the plant as heat, as well as directly from the sun and is used to turn liquid water into water vapour (latent heat of evaporation, ).
