Induction generators are simpler, smaller and more robust than synchronous generators, and are not limited by fixed speed requirements. As such, they are increasingly being used in the field of renewable energy. In this experiment, an induction motor/generator was investigated in relation to being applied to hydro-power.
A 0.75 kW 4 pole motor with a synchronous speed of 1500 rpm was used in the experiment.
Firstly, the motor characteristics were investigated with the motor connected to an exterior power supply. Secondly, the characteristics of the motor acting as a generator were investigated, after the motor was disconnected from the grid and a water turbine was used to power the generator.
The motor used was hardwired in a three-phase delta connection, with a line current rating I L of 3.2 A and a line voltage V L of 220 V. The system was set up as shown in figures 1 and 2.
The first parts of the experiment (a - b) were to determine the value of these circuit parameters.
The synchronous speed of the motor is about 1500rpm, as can be seen from table 1. The motor speed remains roughly the same while line voltage and line current increase: the power output increases due to the magnetic field strength increase. Table 5 shows how power is generated when the motor is pushed supersynchronous: when the motor speed goes above 1500 rpm.
The overall efficiency of the system is not high, but increases as the motor runs faster. Using ballast load control, the generator can be run at a constant load, however this decreases the efficiency of the system as there is a lot of waste power dissipated in the resistor bank.
