As I got into this piece of work, I enjoyed doing it more than I expected. There's a great moment on each question where you press enter after putting in a lot of code or chasing a bug and it all just works. I have learnt a lot about using lists in Caml, as I hadn't that much experience with them before. I have previously written two or three functions that act on or use lists, but I've never written a function with two lists as its arguments before.
I think the thing I found most difficult was remembering to use the right brackets all the time in the functions, and remembering which variables contained lists, and which contained single variables. I often got type synthesis errors when it tried to match int list list list with int list list, when everything should really just be int list. Once I gained experience of identifying where the mistakes were, I was able to program the functions in the latter questions with very few errors and bugs.
I think that after doing this coursework, I have a much more mature and experienced view of programming in Caml, and find it easier to see how problems can be tackled in a functional way.
