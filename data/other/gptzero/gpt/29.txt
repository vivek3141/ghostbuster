One craft that originated in Egypt is the art of pottery making. Egyptians have been making pottery for thousands of years, creating a wide range of functional and decorative items, from bowls and jars to figurines and ceremonial objects. The ancient Egyptians used a variety of techniques and materials to produce their pottery, including wheel-thrown, hand-formed, and molded methods, and firing the clay at different temperatures to achieve desired effects. Today, pottery remains an important part of Egypt's cultural heritage and a popular souvenir for visitors to the country.
