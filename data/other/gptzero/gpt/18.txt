The Swedish company Electrolux announced yesterday that it plans to move production of washing machines from Sweden to Poland, in a move that will see around 2,000 jobs lost in Europe. The company said that the decision was made in order to "remain competitive", and that the jobs would be moved to a "lower-cost country".

This news will come as a huge blow to the workers who will lose their jobs, and to the Swedish economy more broadly. It is yet another example of how globalization and the race to the bottom in terms of labour costs is damaging European industry. While companies like Electrolux are able to move production to wherever is cheapest, workers are left behind, with little prospect of finding new employment.

It is time for the European Union to take action to protect its industries and workers from this damaging trend. We need to see a level playing field, where companies are not able to exploit workers in other countries in order to lower their own costs. Otherwise, we will continue to see jobs and businesses lost, to the detriment of us all.
