You can use the IF function in Excel to replace "now" with an abbreviation. Here's an example formula you can use:
=IF(B2="now","TBD",B2)
This formula checks if the value in cell B2 is "now". If it is, it replaces it with "TBD". If it's not, it leaves the original value in place. You can copy and paste this formula into cells C2 and C3 to replace "now" with "TBD" or any other abbreviation you prefer.
