Verse 1:
From the moment I saw your face 
The path of my life made a sudden change 
I had no idea what love could be 
Until I saw you loving me 

Chorus:
My love, I will go the distance 
You and I will forever last
My love, I will hold you close 
In my heart our love will last

Verse 2:
Our love will be true and never die
It's like a star in the sky 
Fate brought us together, I'm so blessed 
You and I, a special recipe for success 

Chorus:
My love, I will go the distance 
You and I will forever last
My love, I will hold you close 
In my heart our love will last

Bridge:
As time goes on, I'll never forget 
The moment our moments first met
And as long as I'm alive 
Our love will forever survive 

Chorus:
My love, I will go the distance 
You and I will forever last
My love, I will hold you close 
In my heart our love will last.
