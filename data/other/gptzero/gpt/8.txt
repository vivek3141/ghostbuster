AI explainability is the ability of AI systems to provide a clear and understandable explanation of how they make decisions. This explanation can include visualizations, narrative descriptions, and other outputs which the AI system uses to explain its decision-making process and decisions. AI explainability helps to make AI and machine learning models more transparent and trust-worthy.
