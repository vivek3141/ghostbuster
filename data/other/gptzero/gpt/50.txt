Here are two ideas for reducing pollution: 

1. Implementing greener transportation options: Encouraging the use of public transportation, carpooling, biking, or walking can reduce the number of vehicles on the road, leading to lower emissions and improved air quality. Additionally, promoting the adoption of electric vehicles and improving charging infrastructure could further reduce transportation-related pollution. 

2. Promoting sustainable practices in industries: Governmental regulations and incentives to encourage businesses to adopt cleaner technologies and reduce waste can help reduce industrial pollution. This includes practices such as energy efficiency, using renewable energy sources, reducing the use of plastic and other non-biodegradable materials, and proper treatment and disposal of waste.
