Neural networks are being used in many areas of the medical industry to make diagnoses, recommend treatments, and identify patterns in data. For example, they can be used to identify diseases such as eye problems, heart arrhythmias and even cancer. Neural networks can also be used to help predict how a disease will progress and how a patient will respond to treatments. Additionally, they can be used to create personalized treatments for patients based on their previous medical history. Neural networks are proving to be a powerful tool in the medical industry, helping to improve the quality of care for patients.
