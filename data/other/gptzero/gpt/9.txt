Three ways to tackle climate change are:
1. Reducing emissions by switching to cleaner sources of energy, such as renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. 
2. Reducing the use of fossil fuels through energy efficiency measures such as improved insulation and energy-saving appliances.
3. Encouraging the adoption of sustainable practices such as waste reduction, sustainable farming and forestry, and carbon sequestration.
