Yes, definitely. In C++, a try-catch block is used to handle exceptions that can occur during program execution. Exceptions are unexpected situations that occur while a program is running, such as an unexpected input or a division by zero. 
Here is an example where a try-catch block can be used to handle an unexpected outcome while ensuring the security of the system. Suppose you are writing a program that reads user input and performs a calculation on it. However, if the user inputs a negative number, the calculation could result in an overflow or underflow, which could potentially lead to a security vulnerability. 
To handle this situation, you can use a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that occur when the user inputs a negative number. Here is an example code snippet:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
int main() {
    int num;
    std::cout << "Enter a positive number: ";
    std::cin >> num;
    try {
        if (num < 0) {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Negative number entered");
        }
        // Perform calculation with num
    }
    catch (const std::invalid_argument& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
        // Handle the error securely
    }
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, if the user inputs a negative number, the `throw` statement will throw an exception of type `std::invalid_argument`. The `catch` block then catches this exception and prints an error message to the console. You can then handle the error securely, such as by terminating the program or logging the error. 
By using a try-catch block, you can ensure that unexpected inputs or outcomes do not compromise the security of your program.
