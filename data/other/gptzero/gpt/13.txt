Vaccines are a critical tool in preventing and eradicating infectious diseases. Vaccines are made up of components of an attenuated virus or bacteria, which stimulate the body's immune system to develop antibodies that can fight these diseases. Vaccines are available for many different illnesses and can be administered to both adults and children. The efficacy of vaccines at preventing illnesses has been proven in numerous studies. Vaccines have the potential to save millions of lives and to protect individuals of all ages from serious and often fatal illnesses. Vaccination can also help to reduce the spread of disease by ensuring that most of the population is protected from infection. Vaccines are essential for protecting the health of the global population and have positively impacted human health for centuries.
