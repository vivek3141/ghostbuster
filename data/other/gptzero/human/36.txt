subject dependent, but my default answer would be:  --configurable seating arrangement so you can do rows, a U-shape, a square, small groups, etc. --an easily portable lectern so a prof who likes to stand behind one can have that available (can be useful to hold notes, etc.) --a projection screen --white boards, or even better, idea paint for the walls.  Expensive stuff, but I like the idea that students can make notes as part of projects in convenient places.
