Seems like career suicide to me, but ultimately you need to do what it takes to be happy.  The trouble is even if you're a great candidate, departments don't often have open positions that you fit. You could be lucky, or you could wait years and it won't be easy (perhaps impossible) to maintain a research program in the meantime.
