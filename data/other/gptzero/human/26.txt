Well, a product of consequentialism is that via decision theory, you have to go where the evidence leads. Likely they will be loosely related to ethical socialism, but the problem with regular hard left socialist thought is that quite simply, in the field of economics its defenses as anything able to be tried easily in modern day is not very strong. (Assuming that you're not counting social market economies as socialism). That being said, the balance here is that one should still march in that direction, but in a cautious manner that prevents people from emotionally making leaps that are not for the best long term. Since something being ethically preferable does not actually make it realistic, though it will help frame into context what one should look at. Socially one would obviously not consider abstract appeals to freedom to heavily outweigh beneficial societal projects. Though one might disagree about what qualifies here, and more importantly what times one thinks that there's an obvious better answer for.  Note that one thing that might set consequentialists apart is that they will look at both what is reasonable to do right now versus what will be in the future, and by extension how to get there. Some things may be for the best in one time period even if once society marches on they are not. Ironically, making marching society forward another important goal, rather than looking only at the present. So there isn't necessarily one true set of laws and economic ideals that always holds true. At the same time, one must still be cautious to not presume one knows more about some hypothetical future state than you have the required gnosis to act in.
