Any history of this in your family?  Any history of Crohns or Ulcerative colitis? Irritable bowel disease?  Do you have any changes in your skin anywhere else aside the legs and the finger / toe blackening and purpura?  how did you get the blood blister?  What was the prednisone for?  have you been tested for hep c?  Because a physician has answered and it is an insanely more likely answer, Iâ€™ve removed my response.
