Indonesia 's government has confirmed it is considering raising fuel prices by as much as 30 % . Millions of Indonesians use kerosene for basic cooking , and prices have been heavily subsidised for years . President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono 's government has said it wants to curb fuel subsidies and direct the money into aid programmes for the poor . But critics argue cutting subsidies will hurt the poorer families that his government says it wants to help . Millions of people were left homeless in Indonesia Aceh 's region following the earthquake and tsunami disaster in late December . Indonesia pays subsidies to importers in order to stabilise domestic fuel prices , but higher oil prices have forced the government to spend more on holding prices down . It spent 59.2 trillion rupiah ( $ 6.58bn ; Â£3.5bn ) on fuel subsidies in 2004 , a sum far in excess of its original projection of 14.5 trillion rupiah . Since President Yudhoyono 's government came to power in October , it has indicated its intention of raising domestic fuel prices by cutting subsidies . `` The ( January to March ) quarter of this year is the best time for us to increase fuel prices , '' said Sri Mulyani Indrawati , State Minister for National Development Planning . `` We are still considering if a 30 % hike is suitable at the moment . The sooner the better for the state budget . '' The BBC 's correspondent in Jakarta , Rachel Harvey , told World Business Report that there was likely to be a strong public reaction to any price rise . `` The big question is whether they go for one big , short , sharp shock and raise prices between 20 % and 30 % or whether they try to stagger it , '' she said . Indonesia 's previous government , led by President Megawati Sukarnoputri , also attempted to cut subsidies in 2003 , but was forced to back down in the face of public protests .
