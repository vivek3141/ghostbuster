The thing I picked up on here is how you focus on your conversation partner's research and interests. It's good but don't overdo it - conversations are two way interactions after all. Don't be afraid to share your own interests and opinions and establish common ground. A blank slate isn't an interesting conversation partner.  And not all interactions need to go on for ages. Sometimes a quick chat is enough, esp.when mingling with strangers.  And finally, often people, even experienced people, are uncomfortable talking to strangers and feel that they're pretty bad at it, so that might also motivate them to leave. Not your fault and nothing to be done about that unfortunately.  Source: I'm not an experienced scholar but OK socially :p
