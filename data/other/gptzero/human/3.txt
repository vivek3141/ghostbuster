US aircraft firm Boeing has unveiled its new long-distance 777 plane , as it tries to regain its position as the industry 's leading manufacturer . The 777-200LR will be capable of flying almost 11,000 miles non-stop , linking cities such as London and Sydney . Boeing , in contrast to European rival Airbus , hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances . Airbus , which overtook Boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in 2003 , is focusing on so-called super jumbos . Analysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between Boeing and Airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry . Boeing plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world 's airports , getting rid of the need for connecting flights . It is banking on smaller , slimmer planes such as the 777-200LR and its much-anticipated 787 Dreamliner plane , which is set to take to the skies in 2008 . The 777-200LR , which had its launch delayed by the 11 September attacks in the US , is the fifth variation of Boeing 's twin-aisle 777 plane . The company offically `` rolled-out '' the new 777 in Seattle at 2200 GMT . Better fuel efficiency from engines made by GE and lighter materials mean that the plane can connect almost any two cities worldwide . `` Boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful , '' said David Learmount , operations and safety editor at industry magazine Flight International . But the 777-200LR `` is a niche player '' , Mr Learmount continued , adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft . Mr Learmount pointed out that the 777-200LR has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders . He also said that while the plane may be able to fly to Sydney from London
