Assuming property tax is the same as council tax  Would you mean that's the upper limit or that's the new price? Me and my partner own our home together and our council tax (your property tax) is 1750 a year  Our combined earnings are 42,000 (before tax) so does that mean my council tax would more than double under the new plan? Because we have about 50quid left over at the end of the month as it is
