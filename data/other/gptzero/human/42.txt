Good rule of thumb, if it has a woody steme you can use it before, if not use it toward the end. So like thyme, oregano, rosemary, marjoram, you can use at the beginning. If it's pleasent enough to bite into you (like thyme) you can also use it at the end. Things like basil, parsley, cilantro use at the end, they basically turn to flavorless mush in cooking. Mint is kind of in between, it can stand up to cooking but it loses the mintiness but retains the other flavors of mint, like making mint chutney you usually do cook the mint a bit to take the toothpaste edge off.  Basically the hardier the herbs the better they stand up to cooking, more volatile herbs use at the end and if you aren't sure the volatile ones tend to be annuals so you can look them up. I think dill is really the only exception because it's so strong it works with anything.  The same goes for drying. Dried parsley has significant less flavor than dried rosemary, I tend to avoid buying dried herbs like that and stick to dried hardy herbs, especially ones I grow and know are very fresh when drying.
