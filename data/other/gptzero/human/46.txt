After reading/lurking, and then commenting here and there on AskHistorians for the better part of 6 years, I'm eager to put in an application for flair! I've popped up occasionally on medieval European history, but I don't consider myself an expert in that. Rather, I'll be graduating very soon with a degree in History and Politics, having focused on more recent nation/statebuilding, development, and political thought.  My expertise lies with post-WWII histories of decolonisation, international organisations, and global economic and political developments (especially as they relate to neoliberalism). I'm most confident with Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa - nonetheless these themes are often global and difficult to bound in space and time.  Flair-wise, something like '20th c. Development & Neoliberalism' could work, encompassing themes like human rights to structural adjustment and relevant international bodies. If possible, I'll request a second flair of Modern/20th c. Singapore (Southeast Asia might be too ambitious) - there are some relevant comments I haven't linked below.  Selected answers from the last couple of months, with some being multi-parters:  *Development/Neoliberalism*  "Did President Carter's deregulation efforts signal a "neoliberal" or "Third Way" Democratic positioning before President Clinton?" (history of econ. thought; some interesting discussion with another user too)  "What caused so many recreational drugs to become illegal in the past century, and why is that illegality an international norm?" (history of development, international organisations)  "Historians say that American Conservativism began with Buckley and associates in the 1940s, but what does this mean? Hasn’t about half of America always been "conservative"? Hasn’t a philosophy of small government, individuality, and capitalism been pretty fundamental to America since its beginning?"(history of political thought, a little on neoliberalism)  Saturday Showcase on Singapore's Housing History (urban, development history; Singapore)  *Singapore/Southeast Asia*  "Sweden's involvement in the Indonesian invasion of East Timor?" (decolonisation; Southeast Asia)  "Effect of colonialism to nationalism in the South East Asia "new countries"?" (decolonisation, nation-building in Southeast Asia; focused on Singapore and Indonesia)  "What was the battle of Singapore like for Singaporean citizens?" (Singaporean archives)  I'm also quite interested in historical methods and the study of history itself, both in terms of interdisciplinary approaches and the use of history in the practice of politics. Some of my answers/comments reflect this, but I don't think this is particularly flair-worthy. Always happy to keep provide reading recommendations too!  E.  Edit: Hope it's fine to insert another two answers since I'm trying for two flairs!
