This is a great question, and perhaps more complex than it appears. The notion of Appalachian isolation, in a true sense, has been the subject of much debate. Cratis Williams and Wilma Dunaway each contend, to one extent or another, that our idea of complete or mostly complete isolation in Appalachia is, very generally speaking, false. This misapprehension may, perhaps, be laid at the feet of the exploitative media practices which emphasized the idea of an isolated and fundamentally backward Appalachian region through ‘local-color’ pieces and, eventually, film and television for profit. Whatever the reason for the trope, it is quite likely that it is, at best, an exaggeration and over-generalization of the actual state of the region. Dunaway argues that Appalachia has been economically connected to the world (meaning national and international trade) from settlement on. Williams outright states that the average Appalachian homestead was no more isolated than any other frontier settlement. By the time we reach the 19th century, we can be fairly confident that, with some few exceptions, the region was not as isolated as it has been portrayed. We can safely say that parts of the region were more isolated than others - even if the character of that isolation was relative rather than absolute throughout most of the region.   .    However, this raises an important question: Appalachia is huge! Even limiting it to the mountains of the former confederate South means dealing with a daunting level of diversity. So, where are we talking about? Since you asked about the more isolated hills of Georgia, I’ll address that. But, be aware that what is true of Northeast Georgia is not necessarily true of other parts of the region.    .   When we speak of the more isolated parts of Appalachian Georgia during the war, we must really discuss Northeast Georgia. The Northwestern part of the state was both more well connected to urban confederate centers (like nearby Chattanooga and Atlanta) and saw a great deal of direct action. I think that we can agree that the central and southern parts of the state, despite also seeing various amounts of action during the war, are neither geographically nor culturally part of Appalachia (difficult as the boundaries of the region can be to define). So, I’ll confine my answer to the Northeast (think: the region near the Ocoee and Oconee rivers that includes Fannin county, Copper Hill, Dahlonega, Helen [of cabbage patch fame], and still more rural locales).    .   To begin, you’ll want to remember that a more rural area with the sort of ridge and valley topography that is characteristic of Northern Georgia was not well suited to the mass agriculture projects which may initially come to mind when thinking about the confederate south - meaning that large plantations (with many slaves) were not the economic drivers that they were in areas with flatter terrain. When one considers this, as well as the rurality of the region and the hostility with which confederate draft officials were often met there, it is little wonder that residents of the region were less likely to be directly involved in, or materially supportive of, the war (in a large sense) than other Georgians. That isn’t meant to imply that the area was ignorant of the war nor that the people who lived there were uniformly opposed to it. Rural counties in the Northeast still supplied troops and (a smaller amount of) war material to the confederate army. (Though, at a guess, it seems more likely that they were more often supplying those goods that they did send to their fellow Georgians rather than the larger confederate forces given Governor Brown’s tendency to put Georgia and her needs before those of the confederacy.)   .    In short, it is probably safe to make the general claim that most of the average residents of rural Northeast Georgia were aware of the war and were, collectively via county governments, involved in supporting the war. It is impossible to prove the negative and say that there were no communities or individual households, in either Northeast Georgia or the more broadly constructed Appalachian South, which were ignorant of the conflict. However, given the engagement of even these rural areas on the county and municipal levels, it seems very very unlikely that you would find large pockets of such ignorance of either the war or the area’s secession.    .   Thanks for the great question! For good arguments about Appalachian connections to international trade (and therefore a refutation of the notion of a more absolute regional isolation), Dunaway’s The First American Frontier is a good read. Likewise, just about anything you find by Williams is worth reading, though his The Southern Mountaineer In Fact And Fiction, and the excerpted “Who Are The Southern Mountaineers?” are great (if more than a bit dated now). A good bit of follow up reading on the war in Northeast Georgia should probably include Sarris’ A Seperate Civil War.
