My PhD advisor leaves at least 100 comments to any of my works. He also corrections my English and the way I express myself since it is not my first language and I am still getting used to using it. My other collaborators leave less comments but all of them are aimd to make my work, our work better. These days I am also often asked to leaves my comments on other people's papers so I have been on the other side of the barricade too. Actually if I don't leave a comment, I feel useless... My anxiety in the beginning turn into understand that it's not about me, it's about the science, it needs to be about the science. This is how may perspective evolved, maybe it can be helpful ðŸ˜Š
