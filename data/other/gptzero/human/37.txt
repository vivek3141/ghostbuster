Trends that were already present were then greatly accelerated as it became undeniably obvious that upper-upper-management was grossly incompetent.  NASA has had a stagnation problem since W's presidency (or, arguably, much earlier), but we always hoped we could turn it around. But the vacuous nonsense Trump has been spewing and the incompetent micromanaging he has been attempting have been a big nail in the coffin. We haven't had an official administrator in over a year and the temporary administrator has had to directly, publicly refuse POTUS's requests on multiple occasions in the name of mission safety, something no other administrator has ever done or has ever had to do (you don't put a living crew on a rocket's first test launch, dipshit, and when Kennedy gave a date to reach the moon, he didn't just make it up, he actually talked to the experts). So not surprisingly, the effect this has had on morale has been bad and staff has lost confidence in the Legislature's and Executive's abilities to look beyond covering up their own scandals and manage a space program. People are leaving in increasingly large numbers. Myself included. I'm talking to SpaceX and I'll be saying goodbye to NASA in the next few months. It took me several years of focused effort to get in here, and now I'm leaving. Weird feeling.
