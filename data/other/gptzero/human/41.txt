1. You can still put your phone in the cupholder upside-down. Orientation doesn't matter when you aren't using the phone.   2. If you're at a desk with the phone plugged into your laptop, the phone and the USB are naturally perpendicular to each other so having it at the top vs. the bottom shouldn't make a difference. If you lift the phone up from the desk, the outlet is now below you and it's better to have the port on the bottom.  3. The ergonomics are better only in cases where the outlet is *above* you. The ergonomics are the same if it's in front of you but admittedly you wouldn't need as long of a cord if it were on the top. However, as other commenters have pointed out, 99% of the time, the outlet is below you and the ergnonomics are therefore better if the outlet is below you. You can get away with a shorter cord, and it doesn't get in the way when using/holding the phone.
