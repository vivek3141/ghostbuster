Worked two year as a job sites manager for Tunnel boring machine.  1. There is three kind of boring machine, hard rock - EPB - Slurry.  2. All the boring head are flat, those machines are differentiated by the cutting method and material extraction.  Edit: why the head could never be conical: the top priority is avoiding the earth/mud to collapse in the machine and being extracted. That is why most head have (EPB/Slurry) have “small” openings on the face with a bigger passage in the middle. There is absolutely not extraction on the periphery, and the head thickness is has small as possible. A conical face would mean scrapped raw material would have to extracted all around the head and the gravity would mean that earth on top of the machine would naturally fall inside the head uncontrolled and just destroy everything on top. It would increase tenfold the torque necessary for rotation, and a 6m flat head is already around 6000kN.m the speed of the machine is partly due to the scraping capacity,  but mainly how quickly you can removing the material extracted while controlling that ONLY the material in front of the machine is extracted, control is always more important than speed. There some Japanese machine with large opening and high speed but they really need favorable ground to able to work (only earth, not sand, no water, no rock, stability of the top ground etc, cannot drill too deep.  A machine will conical head could not even be able to start boring before collapsing everything.  3. Slurry means you plan to bore mainly in mud, sand or other similar soft with important water penetration. Meeting any kind of big rock is a huge problem as it may destroy all the tooling. The material extraction is done by injecting of a special kind of mud (the slurry) which is injected under pressure inside the first 10cm on the cutting face. It helps at two level, it creates a consistent area of mud for the carbure tool to scrape and create a bubble hermetic to air and water to maintain the cutting area pressure. Maintaining the pressure is very important because he slurry is extracted using a hydraulic circuit with huge pumps (~600kW each) in series which move the mix slurry + mud + sand + small rock on top of the site. If the bubble breaks two possibilities: pressure from the machine was too high, the machine will stop moving but nothing much will happen, pressure from the machine was too low, in that case you may create collapse of the river/building/bridge on top, in worst case scenario you can lose the whole machine and project and cause major building collapse. On top there is slurry traitement plant which extracts the slurry to late re-inject in the circuit. At the bottom of the cutting head is huge rock crusher which reduce most kind of rocks into small pebbles.  3. EPB is the same as slurry but there less or no water involved. Less need to maintain pressure in front. The extract is usually close to atmospheric pressure and there is only a hermetic screw conveyor which both move the raw material and adjust the pressure. The main trick with thing kind of machine is designing the right kind of head, guessing the size of the rock, the chance of meeting a underground water river/lake, the chance a meeting à gaz pocket, the % of sand compare to earth. It will change the size of openings, the types and number of carbure cutters, and type system treatment of the soil. Once the head is fixed, then you have to design the treatment of the soil. Most EPB will use special kind of foam, again it is used to create a small pressure bubble to avoid collapse of all the buildings above (note: most city metro used EPB to bore the tunnel) and avoid creating fronti (total collapse), the foam is also here for protecting the tooling and lubrification in the conveyor screw. EPB Is the most common kind of machine and the cheapest  4. EPB is historically the first type of boring machine. The slurry machine is much more technologically demanding and was created to answer the drilling in high water situation.  5. Hard rock machines are an entirely different beast altogether. The idea there is not to scrap or “cut” the front face. At the start point of the tunnel is created a flat surface of rock which will be used as the initial cutting face. The cutting head is quite full, with hundreds of steel rollers (diameter around 200~250mm) instead of scrapper. Each roller has an individual path on the cutting face and the distance between each path is calculated depending on the type of rock (during functioning the cutting face looks like hundreds of concentrical lines). The aim is to create small rock chips without creating too much dust. The power of the machine is quite low but the head rotation is the highest. Those machines still generate a huge amount of dust and vibrations. Compensation for the vibrations is vey important or the machine will dismantle itself in a few days. The risk when drill in rock is meeting a pocket of gaz or water. Each of those may fill the tunnel in a few minutes and kill everyone. Compare to other boring machine where the apparition is slow and progressive, here invasions are very very sudden.  A 6m diameter EPB boring head typically has a torque around 6000kN.m
