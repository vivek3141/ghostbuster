The governments recent actions regarding dissident Wang Xizhe have garnered attention both locally and internationally. They have accused him of crossing the border and pursuing individuals who aided him in doing so.
Wang, a well known figure in the Chinese pro democracy movement has long been a thorn in the side of the ruling Communist Party. His previous arrest in 2014 stemmed from his criticism of government corruption resulting in an eight year prison sentence.
However news surfaced in December 2020 that Wang had managed to enter Myanmar and sought assistance from pro democracy activists. Reports suggested that he intended to make his way to Thailand with the goal of seeking asylum.
Citing violations of security laws Chinese authorities have labeled Wang as a "criminal suspect" and issued an international arrest warrant. They claim that he departed China unlawfully and engaged in activities that could be detrimental to the states security.
In a statement released through state media the Chinese embassy, in Myanmar accused Wang of breaking domestic laws by leaving China without permission and engaging in acts that jeopardize national security.
The embassy further stated that Wang had collaborated with individuals opposing China accepting their support and funding and intensifying his activities against China. In addition the authorities warned anyone who assisted Wang in his escape from China that they would face consequences. Human rights organizations and pro democracy advocates have criticized this action by the Chinese government viewing it as another instance of suppressing dissent and curtailing freedom of expression in Beijing. Amnesty Internationals China researcher, William Nee remarked that this move was an endeavor to intimidate those who dare to challenge the Chinese government and speak out truthfully. Nee expressed concern over the governments pursuit of individuals who aided Wang during his escape from China stating that such actions constitute a clear violation of their fundamental human rights. Furthermore this case has raised concerns, among Myanmars democracy movement amidst its ongoing political crisis following the military coup in February 2021.
Many activists in Myanmar who support democracy are concerned about the possibility of the government pressuring Myanmar authorities to send Wang back to China.
However according to a statement made by Myanmars Ministry of Foreign Affairs they have not received any extradition requests from the government. The ministry further emphasized that Myanmar has always adhered to the principle of non interference in countries internal matters and consistently respects and protects the rights of political asylum seekers as per international law.
Wang on his part has shown defiance towards the accusations made by the government. Through his lawyer he released a statement expressing his fearlessness and determination to continue advocating for democracy and human rights in China.
"I firmly believe that freedom, democracy and human rights are fundamental, for all people " he stated. "I will persistently fight for these values until they are achieved."
