As the soft morning sunlight streamed in through the curtains I slowly opened my eyes feeling a bit drowsy but ready to embrace another day. Little did I know that this day held surprises beyond the usual. As I clumsily got out of bed my hand. Accidentally brushed against the cool wooden floor causing me to stumble.
In that instant a mysterious energy coursed through me infusing every cell of my being with an invigorating power. Curiously I raised my finger to inspect the floor. Was astounded by what I saw. It was spotless. Not a speck of dirt or grime remained! It dawned on me that I had acquired an ability. The gift to effortlessly cleanse any surface in an instant.
Filled with excitement coursing through my veins I made up my mind to utilize this power for good. Stepping outside it didn't take long for me to notice litter strewn across the streets walls adorned with graffiti and fountains tainted by pollution. With a touch, from me everything transformed right before my very eyes. The world became an healthier place.
However as time went on throughout the day an overwhelming sense of dread settled over me like a storm. It dawned on me that by using my touch to eliminate filth I inadvertently disturbed the natural balance of bacteria thriving beneath our feet.
Under my touch the soil transformed into a wasteland devoid of any signs of life.
Shocked and dismayed I realized that I could no longer bear the consequences of this power. It dawned on me that cleanliness and purity should coexist harmoniously with the order of things. With humility I made the decision to use my power selectively stepping in when cleanliness was absolutely necessary while allowing nature and the world to thrive in their own unique ways.
So armed with this newfound insight I wholeheartedly embraced my extraordinary yet delicate ability â€“ a catalyst, for creating cleaner surroundings without disturbing Mother Natures magnificent masterpiece.
