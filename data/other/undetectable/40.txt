Beijing, China. Chen Guangcheng, a human rights activist from China who's currently in exile has expressed his opposition to the decision of charging Wang Dan, a detained dissident with capital offenses. Wang Dan, known as one of the leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests was arrested in March 2021. Has been held in custody ever since.
Chen, who gained recognition for his advocacy against forced abortions and sought refuge in the United States after years of being under house arrest in 2012 released a statement expressing his concerns regarding the charges imposed on Wang Dan. According to Chens statement Wang Dan is facing accusations of "endangering security " which could potentially lead to a death sentence.
"Wang Dan is an individual of courage and unwavering principles who has fearlessly fought for justice and freedom despite personal risks " stated Chen. " than being punished for his endeavors he should be acknowledged."
Chens statement comes at a time when there is an increasing crackdown on dissidents within China. The government has intensified its efforts to suppress any form of dissenting voices. Notably several other prominent individuals have been arrested over months. For instance Ren Zhiqiang—a businessman and government critic—was sentenced to 18 years, in prison on charges related to corruption and bribery.
In his statement Chen also made a comparison between Wang Dan and Liu Xiaobo, a known Chinese pro democracy activist who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 while being imprisoned. Unfortunately Liu Xiaobo passed away in 2017 while still in custody.
"We must not allow another situation like Liu Xiaobos to occur " Chen remarked. "Wang Dan should have the freedom to express his thoughts without fear of retaliation."
The charges against Wang Dan have also faced criticism from outside of China. The European Union expressed concern over his detention and the unjust imprisonment of human rights defenders within China. The EU called for the unconditional release of Wang Dan and other detained activists.
These charges against Wang Dan come at a time when tensions between China and the United States are heightened. The two countries have been engaged in disagreements on matters such as trade, human rights and even the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Recently there has been an increase, in US criticism regarding Chinas treatment of dissenters. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted in support of Wang Dan stating, "We stand with Wang Dan and all those who strive for freedom and human rights in China."
Despite facing increasing pressure China has not shown any indication of easing its crackdown on dissidents. The government continues to exercise control over aspects of society adopting an increasingly authoritarian approach. This situation puts activists like Wang Dan in danger as they risk being permanently silenced.
Chen emphasized the importance of holding the Chinese government accountable, for its actions. Emphasized that allowing them to escape consequences is unacceptable.
