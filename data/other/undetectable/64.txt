Ivory Coasts top industrial firm, Société Internationale de Plantations d'Hévéas (SIFCA) recently announced its plan to wind up its subsidiary, SAPH which has been incurring losses. However SIFCA assures the public that this decision will not impact port arrivals.
According to a spokesperson from SIFCA the liquidation of SAPH is necessary due to the subsidiarys financial challenges. These challenges include difficulties in meeting obligations such as debt repayment and employee salaries.
"SAPH has been facing financial difficulties for some time now. Despite our efforts to turn things around it has become clear that maintaining the companys operations is no longer feasible " stated the spokesperson.
SIFCA wants to assure everyone that this liquidation process will not disrupt port arrivals or affect the operations of their subsidiaries in Ivory Coast.
"We will continue operating our subsidiaries without interruption including Société Africaine de Plantations d'Hévéas (SAPH) which is performing well as a palm oil producer. The liquidation of SAPH will not hinder our ability to supply products to the market " added the spokesperson.
SIFCA holds a position in Ivory Coasts agricultural sector with its diverse range of activities encompassing rubber plantations as well, as palm oil, sugar and cocoa production.
The group possesses subsidiaries in Ivory Coast and nearby countries like Liberia, Guinea and Ghana. SAPH, a company that manages rubber plantations across the nation has been facing challenges for a considerable time now. It is reported to have accumulated debts of around XOF 50 billion ( $93 million). The company has been dealing with declining rubber prices, low productivity and high operational expenses.
According to a report by the International Rubber Study Group (IRSG) SAPH has faced competitiveness issues in recent years. Factors such as operational costs, labor scarcity and decreasing rubber prices in the international market have contributed to their struggle. African countries, including Ivory Coast are experiencing increasing competition from producers in the global rubber market. This competition has resulted in prices and reduced demand for rubber grown in Africa.
SIFCA holds a 51% stake in SAPH. Has made efforts to revamp its operations by reducing the workforce and cutting costs. However these measures have not been sufficient to rescue the subsidiary from losses.
The liquidation process is expected to span months during which SIFCA will work on settling SAPHs outstanding debts while providing support, for its employees.
"SIFCA is dedicated to providing support to the affected workers through offering severance packages, retraining programs and various other forms of assistance aimed at helping them explore opportunities " stated the spokesperson. The announcement regarding SAPHs liquidation has raised concerns about the condition of Ivory Coasts sector, which has been significantly impacted by both the Covid 19 pandemic and the decline in commodity prices. Ivory Coast, renowned as the worlds cocoa producer has experienced a decrease in cocoa prices over recent months resulting in hardships for farmers trying to make ends meet. Furthermore global supply chains have been disrupted due to the pandemic thereby affecting the export of products not only from Ivory Coast but also from other African nations. Nevertheless SIFCA remains optimistic about the sectors prospects and highlights the potential for growing demand for sustainably produced palm oil and other agricultural commodities. "SIFCA maintains its commitment towards investing in Ivory Coasts agricultural sector and creating favorable conditions for farmers and workers within the country. We firmly believe that with policies and investments Ivory Coast can sustain its significant role, in the global agriculture market " concluded the spokesperson.
