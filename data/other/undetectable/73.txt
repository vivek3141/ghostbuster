Such unethical practices can also erode trust in the organizations management negatively affecting motivation, productivity and loyalty. Additionally these practices could harm the organizations reputation making it challenging to attract and retain staff.
3. Management bears the responsibility of ensuring accounting practices. However in this case study both the CEO and CFO are involved in manipulating figures to meet financial targets. Although they may try to justify their actions as a means of addressing term financial difficulties they ultimately put the companys long term stability at risk while tarnishing their own reputation and potentially facing legal consequences.
