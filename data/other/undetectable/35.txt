Sarah sat down with her daughter, Emily excited to share a family album filled with memories from the past. In this era cloning oneself had become a reality and Sarah had chosen to raise a female version of herself as her own daughter. As they flipped through the worn out photographs reminiscences flooded back. One particular picture caught Sarahs attention.
"Look at this one, Emily " she exclaimed while pointing at the photo. "This is me when I was around your age."
Emilys eyes widened as she carefully examined the image. "Oh my goodness, Mom! You look much like Aunt Lily!"
Sarah froze in disbelief; a shiver went down her spine. Emily was absolutely right. The girl captured in that picture bore a resemblance to her sister Lily when she was that young. It didn't seem logical or possible. How could her cloned daughter look much like her sister?
Overwhelmed, by curiosity and confusion Sarah made up her mind to confront Lily about it. As they found themselves sitting together in Lilys living room Sarah searched for just the right words.
"Lily " she began hesitantly "I showed Emily some pictures today and she noticed that I looked exactly like you when I was her age. Can you help me understand how this is even possible?"
"Lily her eyes filled with a mix of surprise and sadness spoke softly. 'Sarah there's something I've been meaning to tell you. Shortly before you were born our mother passed away. Dad was devastated,. He wanted a piece of her to live on through us. He secretly got hold of Moms DNA. Hired an exceptional geneticist to create a clone. You.'
Sarahs heart raced in her chest. 'Why didn't you tell me earlier?'
Lily reached out. Gently squeezed Sarahs hand showing empathy. 'I wanted to shield you from this information, Sarah. I didn't want you to bear the burden of feeling like a replacement or constantly living in our mothers shadow.'
Tears welled up in Sarahs eyes as she tried to comprehend the weight of this revelation. Her mother, someone she had always wondered about was now ingrained within her existence.. Now as she looked at Emily the truth became painfully clear.
'Emily is more, than my clone... Isn't she?' Sarah struggled with her words.
Lily nodded lovingly her eyes brimming with affection. 'Emily carries not your genetic material but also our motherâ€™s.'"
Sarah felt a surge of emotions in her heart. The complexity of her past surprised her. It only made her bond with Emily stronger. She understood the importance of embracing her identity while also treasuring the legacy left by her mother.
From that moment on Sarah looked at Emily from a perspective. Although they shared a resemblance to Lily there was a connection, between them all. They were not just mother and daughter or sisters; they were also carriers of a spirit that would pass their familys love and strength to future generations.
