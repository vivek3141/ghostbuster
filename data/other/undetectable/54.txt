The atmosphere in the Great Hall was heavy with silence as Sir Galahad found himself accused his unblemished reputation as the kings most trusted knight now crumbling to dust. What was once a hall now resembled a theater of darkness, where justice had been overshadowed by the betrayal of ones own kin. The kings life had been. All suspicions seemed to point towards Galahad.
As beads of sweat formed on his forehead Galahad addressed the Royal Court with a voice that trembled under the weight of his desperation. "I stand before you today innocent of this crime that tarnishes my honor. I held affection for my king and would never have turned against him." Eyes filled with accusation bore into him eagerly searching for any sign of guilt. "I beseech you to consider that it is the Queen who should be held accountable; her heart is cloaked in darkness."
Gasps escaped from those who watched on their disbelief quickly transforming into curiosity as Galahad skillfully wove his tale. "I have witnessed firsthand the Queens desiresâ€”I have seen the glint in her eyes when she spoke ill of our ruler. She yearned for power. When marriage denied her that influence deceit became her weapon of choice."
Whispers spread throughout the hall, like wildfire growing louder as Galahads voice faltered.
His attention shifted towards the queen, her complexion pale and devoid of any emotion. He understood that his argument was falling on ears. The Royal Court stood loyal to the crown and the Queens flawless image appeared radiant to be shattered.
"My lord " Galahad implored, turning to the kings trusted advisor "you above all others are aware of the darkness that resides within the Queens heart. You have witnessed her nature; do not allow her to deceive you." His voice lingered in the air wavering like a flickering flame.
One, by one the councilors shook their heads their expressions filled with doubt and sympathy. The truth remained concealed beneath the Queens captivating facade. They couldn't fathom that such malice could reside within the woman who stood among them.
Galahads eyes welled up with tears as he realized his fate was sealed. "I implore you court; do not condemn an innocent man to death. I have faithfully served this kingdom and its king seeking nothing but justice."
However justice appeared like a dream fading into obscurity. The Queens graceful smile broadened while her eyes gleamed with triumph.
Galahads voice slowly faded away resonating through the Great Hall but sadly nobody paid attention to his desperate plea for the truth.
The kings loyal knight was unjustly accused and his appeals were disregarded. Galahad looked intensely at the Queen vowing to uncover her actions. The voice of justice had been silenced, leaving a feeling, in his mouth as he confronted his unavoidable downfall.
