China has recently inaugurated a shipping exchange in Shanghai with the aim of advancing its maritime industry and bolstering its aspirations to become a global force in shipping. The China National Shipping Exchange (CNSE) commenced operations on June 28 following approvals from both Chinas Ministry of Transport and the Shanghai municipal government. This exchange serves as a platform for shipping companies to engage in trading assets related to shipping including freight contracts, ship rentals and sale agreements. With than 4,000 registered members from both domestic and foreign origins CNSE is expected to promote fair and transparent market practices for shipping transactions. It will facilitate efficient resource allocation while reducing transaction costs for all participants involved. Liu Xiaosong, CEO of CNSE emphasized that constructing a shipping exchange is a crucial step for promoting the development of the shipping and logistics industries in China – the worlds largest shipping nation. Moreover it plays a role in expanding financial market openness and collaboration. The launch of CNSE is part of Chinas strategy to strengthen its shipping sector while providing support, for its Belt and Road Initiative – an ambitious project aiming to connect Asia, Europe and Africa through an extensive network of trade routes.
Based on data from the China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry Chinese shipping companies currently hold a 40% market share in global shipping. Notably China boasts the worlds ports in Shanghai and Ningbo Zhoushan. Interestingly Chinese companies now own ships than their Japanese and South Korean counterparts.
Nevertheless this industry has encountered obstacles such as capacity, substantial debt levels and fluctuating freight rates. The COVID 19 pandemic has further exacerbated these challenges by causing a decline in demand and intensifying competition within the sector.
In response to these issues Chinese shipping companies have been exploring business models and technologies like blockchain and digitalization. Their aim is to enhance efficiency while reducing costs.
CNSE (China National Shipping Enterprise) plans to integrate these technologies into its operations offering services like digital bills of lading, online auctions and risk management tools.
"The establishment of CNSE represents a milestone in the transformation and innovation of the traditional shipping industry. Our association will continue to enhance our services and products for the sector while promoting the high quality development of Chinas shipping industry " stated Zhu Hongjie, Chairman of CNSE.
The launch of CNSE is anticipated to invigorate Chinas shipping industry and reinforce its position as a player, in global trade.
Furthermore it opens up avenues, for cooperation and fosters the growth of a shipping industry that is both inclusive and environmentally conscious.
