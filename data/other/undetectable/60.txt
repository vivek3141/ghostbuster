Monsanto the multinational corporation specializing in agrochemicals and agriculture biotechnology recently surprised analysts by urging them not to raise their full year earnings expectations for the company. This surprising move comes after Monsanto reported than expected earnings for its second fiscal quarter.
Over the couple of years Monsanto has faced declining profits due to low prices for staple crops like soybeans and corn. However their herbicides business experienced sales during Q2 resulting in higher profit margins than anticipated. The companys stock rose by 6% following this announcement although it seemed somewhat delayed in response to the positive earnings report.
During a conference call following the release of the earnings report CEO Hugh Grant advised analysts to exercise caution when making estimates due to uncertainties in commodity markets for the upcoming quarter and beyond. Grant emphasized that while there will be pressure on farmers to meet food demands by increasing crop production pricing uncertainties are likely to persist and impact profitability for companies like Monsanto.
One growing concern for Monsanto is a decline in sales of engineered corn seeds as farmers face resistance, towards planting new GMO crops.
Farmers worldwide are increasingly adopting crop rotations and opting for non genetically modified (non GMO) crops instead of genetically modified ones that rely heavily on chemical pesticides and fertilizers. This shift has led to a rise in the sales of companies catering to the organic and non GMO crop market.
Monsanto executives are well aware of this challenge and the fact that farmers may struggle with the rising costs of genetically modified seeds in the future. As a result Monsanto has been carefully planning for a transition to GMO crops for some time now. They have been acquiring companies specializing in bio agriculture and exploring natural pest control alternatives. Monsanto plans to introduce new non GMO hybrids that promise increased cost effectiveness and crop productivity.
In summary Monsantos message to analysts reflects the difficulties faced in a global market. However they remain optimistic. Prepared to adopt new strategies that ensure sustainable success, for American farmers in the long run.
