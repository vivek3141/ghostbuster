Once upon a time within a mysterious forest
There lived a creature named Frank, a monster whose spark was the darkest.
His claws were sharp like razors, his fangs dripping with goo
In solitude he dwelled, unknown, to any few.
Curiosity led children astray their innocent hearts enticed,
Into the woods where Franks dwelling disguised.
With red eyes gleaming in the nights embrace
He observed them cautiously from his hiding place.
Then one day a brave but curious lad appeared,
Timmy, merely ten years old, unafraid but slightly weird.
He ventured far into the labyrinth of trees so dense
Unaware of the watchful eyes and their intense suspense.
Frank leaped out from behind with claws gripping tight
Imposing darkness upon Timmy filling him with fright.
The boy trembled and wept as he begged for release
But driven by hunger Frank denied him peace.
Silent screams reverberated through the forests core
As Frank devoured innocence without remorse or anymore.
Day after day he feasted on children pure and young
Snuffing out their lives extinguishing their songs unsung.The people of the town mourned, their hearts heavy, with sorrow
Parents cautioned their children "Be careful don't go,
Into the forest where a fearsome creature lurks,
A darkness that breeds cruelty and hurts."
Even now the dreadful story lives on
Like a macabre fairy tale that leaves hearts undone.
So remember, ones always stick to the trail
For wickedness like Frank seeks to prevail.
