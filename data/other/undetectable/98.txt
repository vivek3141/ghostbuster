Introduction;
Unemployment rates in the United States have always been influenced by socio disparities, which result in unequal opportunities for individuals. The COVID 19 pandemic has worsened these divisions leading to increased unemployment rates and a widening gap between socio economic groups. In this essay we will explore how socio economic divides impact unemployment rates both before and during the pandemic emphasizing how the virus has intensified existing inequalities in the job market.

1. Pre pandemic socio economic divisions and unemployment rates;
a. Income inequality and employment prospects; Socio economic disparities, marked by distribution of income have historically affected employment opportunities. Individuals with incomes generally have better access to quality education and resources which enhances their employability and reduces their chances of being unemployed.
b. Racial disparities; Socio economic divisions also intersect with race resulting in minority communities often facing unemployment rates due to systemic discrimination and limited opportunities. Structural barriers perpetuate poverty within these communities leading to restricted access to job markets and precarious working conditions.
c. Regional disparities; Unemployment rates vary across areas due to differences, in economic development and job availability. Rural regions often experience levels of unemployment compared to urban centers exacerbating socio economic divides.
The COVID 19 pandemic has had an impact on different sectors particularly in hospitality, tourism and retail. Unfortunately this has affected low wage workers the most, who typically come from socio economic backgrounds. As a result unemployment rates have risen significantly for these groups compared to those in higher socio economic positions.
Moreover the shift towards learning due to the pandemic has created educational disparities. Students from low income households face difficulties accessing education, which further widens existing educational inequalities. This not hampers their future job prospects but also increases their vulnerability to unemployment.
Additionally the pandemic has shed light on the access to healthcare and financial stability. Low income communities often lack healthcare insurance. Have higher rates of pre existing health conditions. Consequently they are more susceptible to infection. Face considerable financial hardships when unable to workâ€”leading to increased unemployment rates.
In conclusion socio economic divisions have long influenced unemployment rates in America. However the COVID 19 pandemic has exacerbated these divisions by exposing inequalities that disproportionately affect marginalized communities, low wage workers and individuals without access, to essential resources.
To tackle this issue it is important to implement approaches that prioritize equal opportunities, in education, healthcare and financial assistance. By emphasizing inclusivity and addressing socio inequalities we can foster a labor market that is both resilient and fair ultimately lowering unemployment rates for everyone irrespective of their socio economic status.
