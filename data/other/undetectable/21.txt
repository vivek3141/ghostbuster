It was the eve of an event called the global redistribution, which took place once every fifty years. On this night social inequality boundaries would be shattered fortunes would be.

His parents had faced challenges and he had made a promise to himself to break free from the cycle of poverty that had affected his family for generations. The moonlit night added a touch to the atmosphere filling Ethan with a mix of excitement and anxiety about the upcoming redistribution.
When midnight struck the grand doors of Spectrum Hall swung open revealing a machine inside. Enchanting lights danced across its surface captivating all those present. A hushed silence fell over the crowd as the Wealth Allocator began to hum indicating that the significant event was about to begin.
People looked on in awe as gears started turning within the machine creating a symphony of motion. A screen displayed numbers and names representing some of the worlds individuals. Each digit. Jumped, gaining momentum until finally settling on a randomly selected winner.
As fortunes fluctuated on the screen cheers and gasps filled the night air. Those who had endured poverty celebrated their luck while others struggled to understand their sudden change in circumstances. It felt as if the world had shifted its course presenting possibilities, for everyone involved.
Ethan held his breath his heartbeat racing in his chest as he anxiously observed.
The numbers on the screen started swirling and changing until they settled.. There to his complete surprise he saw his own name. In that moment a rush of emotions overwhelmed him—relief, happiness and an immense sense of gratitude.
With steps forward Ethan became one of the fortunate ones. He knew that his life would never be the same again. However down, inside himself he made a promise to never forget where he came from or the hardships faced by those left behind.
