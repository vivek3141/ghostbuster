Once a cheerful young man Alex was struck by a curse cast by a witch. Through an enchantment she took away his heart and replaced it with an icy fragment, devoid of warmth and emotion. As the frost consumed him his ability to experience love faded away. Relationships. He became unfamiliar with the concept of warmth. He helplessly observed as friends and family grew distant over time. Despite the passage of time the ice, within him remained untouched by the suns rays. Fearing that loves passionate touch would melt his heart he concealed himself behind a cold mask. Little did he realize that love possesses a power to melt even the most frozen hearts.
