In a lit basement office situated in an ordinary building hidden deep within the vibrant city there sat a man behind a desk cluttered with various items. His name was Edwin Powers. He operated an intriguing business venture. What made him famous? He provided aspiring villains with a wide array of minions.
Edwins bookshelves were filled with files each containing information about potential recruits. These individuals ranged from masked individuals lacking aim to captivating and even alluring merfolk – all ready to serve the desires of the worlds most malicious minds. This secretive endeavor remained known to a select few villains who sought out their loyal followers through Edwins discreet services.
Everything changed for Edwin when he crossed paths with Simon Vex, a villain. Simon had once been an imposing adversary. Had faced setbacks in his attempts to create his own army of faithful followers due to unreliable suppliers. That's when Edwin stepped in offering his expertise in recruiting and thoroughly vetting the kind of talent. Impressed by Edwins methods and track record Simon abandoned his ways and became Edwins trusted right hand.
Since that day Edwins reputation soared higher than ever before. Super villains from every corner of the globe sought him out knocking on his door, in search of henchmen to bring their schemes to life.
There was this one client, Doctor Malevolent, who had a thing for hideouts and needed suitable guards for the job. Word got around about the Doctors plans and Edwin understood that he needed something extraordinary to meet his requirements. After doing research he stumbled upon a hidden cove where a tribe of captivating yet ruthless merfolk resided. In a corner of his office Edwin maintained files on dangerous individuals – each carefully documented and categorized. Among those files was the location of the merfolks underwater kingdom.
Donning attire Edwin embarked on a perilous journey to meet the merfolk. Through a combination of charm and cunning he managed to establish an alliance by promising the tribe resources in exchange for their assistance in guarding the Doctors hideout. The merfolk agreed, recognizing an opportunity to obtain treasures and sow chaos among their unsuspecting adversaries.
Back at his office Edwin observed with satisfaction as the Doctors wicked grin widened upon introducing the merfolk into his ranks. These aquatic enforcers with their shimmering tails and radiant skin added a beauty to the Doctors malevolent empire.
However Edwins responsibilities did not end with managing the merfolk. Super villains from backgrounds approached him with requests, for henchmen possessing different capabilities.
Some individuals relied on strength to assert their dominance over others while others sought out cunning thieves to execute secretive thefts. Edwins success allowed him to employ a network of recruiters and trainers who were skilled in finding and preparing the individuals for any given task that came their way.
As Edwins clientele grew so did his ambitions. No longer satisfied with ordinary individuals he began recruiting and training highly skilled operatives who possessed extraordinary abilities similar to those of heroes. In a world where heroes emerged to combat villains there was always a race for superiority. For every punch thrown by a hero a super villain would counter with a weapon crafted by Edwin himself.
Edwins enterprise thrived for years until destiny unexpectedly intervened. A group of heroes uncovered his operation leaving no stone unturned. The heroes swiftly deduced that Edwin held the key to dismantling the network of evil.
Cornered and aware that his days were numbered Edwin remained steadfast in his dedication to the cause of villains. With a smile he accepted his fate knowing that the actions he had set in motion would yield dark consequences, for years to come.
As the heroes closed in on him Edwin discreetly packed up his office leaving behind faint traces of his presence.
As he left a neat business card materialized on the desk replacing the files. It displayed the name "E. Powers. Quality Recruitment. When Evil Calls." Like that Edwin disappeared into the depths of folklore.
Today supervillains rely on Edwins renowned business to find their henchmen. His legacy endures, ensuring that in a world of superheroes and villains the forces of darkness will always have access to an army – all thanks, to a mysterious individual who specialized in providing an assortment of loyal followers.
