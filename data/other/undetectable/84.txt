The day we had all been waiting for finally arrived when extraterrestrial beings made contact with humanity expressing their interest in establishing a trade partnership. This news filled people around the world with excitement as they contemplated the possibilities of this interaction. In response a grand international convention was swiftly organized to showcase the resources, inventions and cultural marvels that Earth had to offer.
Representatives from nations across the globe gathered in an exhibition hall setting aside their differences momentarily. The extraterrestrial visitors were left awe struck by the captivating displays of science, art, technology and cuisine that our planet had to offer. Scholars eagerly exchanged knowledge artists shared techniques and chefs presented their creations in hopes of impressing these celestial beings.
As the event concluded and negotiations began it became apparent that the aliens were interested in something something no one had anticipated. They expressed a desire to purchase ordinary human artifacts; used items steeped in history and antiquity.
Bewilderment washed over onlookers as alien visitors examined garage sale finds, old furniture pieces,
vintage clothing items,
and scarcely used gadgets.
Their fascination extended to rusty tools
chipped porcelain
and tattered books.
Despite possessing technology
the aliens lacked the ability to create objects that bore witness, to human history.
In no time all
the convention transformed into a vibrant flea market scene.
People excitedly searched through their attics,
basements,
and closets
in order to sell off their no longer needed possessions.
An old typewriter brought in a sum a worn comic book fetched a hefty price and a tattered vinyl record sparked fierce competition among bidders. The extraterrestrial beings found joy in our history longing for our nostalgic artifacts. Their insatiable desire for our past served as a bond, between Earth and their species. Thus we began an fruitful trade alliance centered around the remnants of our shared heritage.
