On Wednesday the Toronto stock market experienced a decline in value due to a sell off in the financial services sector. This unexpected turn of events occurred a day after the market had reached record high trading volumes showcasing the resilience it had displayed amidst the economic downturn caused by the COVID 19 pandemic.
According to reports from the Toronto Stock Exchange major financial institutions such as Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank and Bank of Montreal all saw their stocks drop by than 1%. Additionally Canadas largest insurance company, Manulife Financial experienced over a 2% decrease in its stock value. However stocks in sectors like energy and telecom remained relatively stable during this period of decline.
The primary reason for this selling frenzy was attributed to actions taken by the Canadian government. Ottawa decided to halt dividend raises in federally regulated financial institutions as an effort to alleviate financial burdens faced by Canadians due to the ongoing pandemic. Investors appear concerned about future dividend freezes even in the long term.
It remains uncertain whether this minor sell off will continue in the coming days or if it will be seen as just a temporary blip, within an otherwise promising stock market. The manner in which leading financial institutions have navigated through these times has been commendable thus far.
Banks have been kind enough to waive fees allow mortgage payments to be deferred and offer low interest loans to individuals facing difficulties. If we can find a silver lining in the market downturn it would be the significant increase in trading volume on the Toronto Stock Exchange this Tuesday reaching unprecedented levels. With interest rates expected to remain low for the future investors are eagerly exploring opportunities for higher returns in an environment of limited yields. It is crucial for us to patiently observe and assess how long this downward trend, in the financial services sector will persist and whether other sectors will also be affected.
