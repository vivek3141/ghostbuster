I agree the opinion. It's because I have really experienced such cases. I love a model of the fashion magagine. Besides, if she wears something cloth, it encourages me to buy the same one, only by seeing the shot. However, actually when I visit the shop of the cloth, it doesn't suit me at all. Some of my friends said to me that they have experienced such as me. Therefore, like this, it is common for advertisements to seem much better than they really are. We can say in other occasion. 
 Like my experience, people is easily made to want products that popular and famous people for example, artists, models, actors or actoress, used. Companies use this method. Therefore, today, we can see advertisements in many cases. These are commercials in television or radio, on newspapers or magagines and finally even in trains or buses.
 Take an example on online shopping on TV. The buyer shows us his/her pleasure after using the products on the screen. Or, the clerks or famous actors appear on the screen, then they insist that the products be good. Then, people that saw the TV program make their minds into buying the product. Until we touch the product directly, we don't know whether the comment on the screen is true or not.
 Besides, the clerks emphasizes that the product is cheap, or with some presents only now. It is the way of showing good by the clerks. So, the more effectivelly they introduce the product, the more people want to buy it.
 Therefore, I agree with the statement.
