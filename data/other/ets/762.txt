Do I agree? Well, I do not agree.
 I was young once and I'm getting old now, so that makes me somewhat an expert in the matter. First of all there are many reasons that would not support that theory, such as:
 Inexperience, Carelesness, Finaces and the fact that youngsters think that they know it all. Lets elaborate on the first one; it summarizes in one phrase, " A person can only gain experience one day at the time." Finances, are a big deal big deal in your younger years, you are living on a tight budget and most of the time you cannot adhere to it, because all the media, peer pressure and nevertheless inmaturity. Finaces can very easy make your younger years hard and like we all know that generates an snowball effect on everything else.
 Moving on, carelesness and "know-it-all syndrome", what can I say, in a way they all derive from eachother. These theories are backed up by facts and figures that wont lie, I live through them. These are the reasons why I do not agree with that statement; older people are wiser, more thougthful, financialy secure and of course more careful about doing again the stupid things they did in their earlier years. Also when you are older there is a great chance that you are finacially secure, and can afford the nicer things in life. 
 In conclusion ,as we all know, life is a race...
 so by far older people the winners in this race.
