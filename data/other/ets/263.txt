There are many ways one can travel.people can travel alone or in group led by a tour guide or travel in groups without a tour guide. i do prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide. Because with the help of a tour guide we can save time,save money and get the effective use of their rich knowledge about the places.
 
 i prefer to travel in a tour led by a tour guide.Because they will have experiences in planning and arranging tours.By this way we don't need to scratch our head to plan the tour. For example,one our family planned to visit singopore. In singapore, we missed many important places to visit. This is because we had less knowledge about the place and language.We would not have faced this problem if we had hired a tour guide.
 
 With the help of a tour guide,we can complete our tour with less cost. because they will have a complete data base of hotels,travels,lodges and other important things around the world . They can find effective tour plan that will fit into our budget. For example, one of my friend who also visited the singapore with his family with a tour guide completed the tour with inly 10000 dollars. but in our trip i spent more that 15000 dollars. so i think a good tour guide will help us in saving money.
 
 By hiring a tour guide we can save time during the tour. because they can plan us some good schedule so that we will visit maxium places in the limited time. Also,by choosing a good and experienced guide we can get to know the historical facts behind the place or city.
 
 Though we will get a overhead of paying to the guide,i think its more worth than the amount we pay them.So i think considering all the important facts mentioned above,its better to hire a tour guide when we are going to travel in group.
