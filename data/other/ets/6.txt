I diasgee with the statement.According to me it is equally important for students to understand ideas and concepts and learn facts.
 
 Mostly ideas and concepts are based on facts and if the students wouldn't know the facts how would they understand the ideas and concepts and build on them. Lets take the example of a nuclear fission/fusion reaction and the nuclear energy which is used to provide electricity to a large part of the world.If the person who came up with the idea of building a nuclear reactor would not have known the fact that nuclear fission/fusion reaction emits a large amount of energy he/she would not have come up with the idea of tapping this energy and concepting the idea of a nuclear reactor.Facts are like the foundation stones without which all ideas and concepts would be baseless.
 
 Equally important is for the students to understand the ideas and concepts.If the students don't understand the new ideas and concepts how will the world advance.All these technological innovations today have been possible because people have thought over the ideas,extensively researched the facts and then used both of them to their advantage.For example,if Alexander Graham Bell would not have had the idea that he could build  telephone or Thomas Edison would not have the idea that electric bulb could be made then we still might have been living in a world full of darkness and this kind of communication would not have been possible.
 
 Also if the students would not concentrate on ideas then they would just become a kind of robot with data/facts feeded in and with no innovative and imaginative ideas.Students also find an outflow of their emotions in the ideas they express.
 
 So,the students should concentate on both ;learn the facts first and then build ideas over it.Both are equally important.
