the bwst way to travel is in a group led by atour guide. I agree with that for many resonse. if there is a tour guide the group will be on control, there will not be any fight about the rode, and he will be the best known of the way.
 first, if there is a tour gide the group will be on control. He will control the stops by diside how much stops should they have and how long , and where should they stops.
 second, there will not be any fight during the tripe. they not have any space for each one to give his opinion about the way and which one is right and which one is wrong.
 third and the last, if they have a tour guide he must be the best known about the way. He must be know which way they have to go. he must know which way is right and which way is wrong. He have to realize which road is dangures and which way is not. And also he have to be good known which is long way and waist there time and which way is short and save there time
 IN conclustion, traviling in a group led with tour guide keep the tripe sweet and safe. It keep the relastionshipe good by no having any fight between them. It safe the time by going in the short and safe way. And also be relax by going with person who know the road very will and have agood idea about the best way to get there with.
