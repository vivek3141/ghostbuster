I think that in twenty years there will be flying cars! Today the car is become a status symbol, there isn't a family without a car, but the problem is that there are a lot of people who prefere to have a beautiful car than a sweet home. The famous sentence "home sweet home" is in danger because is not more at the first place of the desires. A car was the symbol of a generation, our parents remember their first car like a realized dream, today the guys want a car because the best friend has one and not because they understand the real meaning that it can have. I think that in twenty years this object of desire will be more wanted, more desired and more dangerous...There are just now a lot of car that ride too fast, in the twenty's it will be certainly worst. Today young people die because they can drive cars that run very fast, tomorrow they will can fly. I hope it will be different. At my grandfather's time the car was a luxury good because he coldn't have one. A car is a lot of money and when there was the war money are ghosts. In the sixties some people like Corradino d'Ascanio created a way to help these person to discover the world: Vespa. This has been a real status symbol thanks to the great meanings it had. "With Vespa you can fly" and with this beginning, motors became the most important thing for people. In the sixties it was possible to fly away, tomorrow it will be possible too? It's important to be free, with a car I can be free because I can go wherever I want. For this reason there is the fewer cars. A fewer that will never pass.
