As to the option that wether to travel in a group led by a tour guide, many people believe that a single tour will be better because there are more freedom during the tour. I am, however, most likely among the ones who think that there are far more advangtages to travel in a group with a tour guide. The reasons are as follows.
 
 The most obvious reason is that we can make more friends in a group.Take myself as an example. Once I visited Beijing in a group, I made a lot of frirends. We are still keep in contact now and have already decided several trips after that and really enjoyed the time we spared togather. It is undoubt that taking a trip with friend makes the trip happier and of greater valueble. 
 
 Further more, it is better to have a guide with us during the trip so that we can know the background of the places. If I visit a new place, I would like to know the culture of the place, How the peolpe live, what is the famous feature of the place, what has happend in the past on this land.... All of these seem attract me a lot. Therefore, a guide who can describe all the things above is extremely necessoy.
 
 Finally, the disadvantages of a single trip is indisputable. For a stranger to a totally new place, it always to take a long time to get familiar with the site. It is a waste of time as well as a watst of money for a traveler to stay in a place just lingering to find where to go. In addition the instance of a single traveler getting lost can be found anywhere.
 
 From what has been discussed above, we can safely draw a conclution that traveling in a group led by a guide is far better than a individul trip.
