It is predicted nowadays that in the next twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. I don't know if I would agree with this new saying, but I think there are some possible reasons for this taking place.
 The major reason behind using fewer cars is the amount of fuel that will vanish decrease bit by bit from the earth, as all the world has so long struggled with. It is the main resource for the cars to be working. The battery of the car might be replaced by another technological advancement that might be more complicated for people to use the car. In addition to cars, there might be other means of transportation easier to drive on the road or simply the structures and new models of cars could be changed into very complex materials. The components of the car will change starting from the engine, motor and everything inside the car, such as the seats and the hand brakes. There could be the possibility of the appearance of cars with wings that can fly and old people will face a problem because of the heights that scare them as they move higher into the sky. This reason is not so possible, but it might happen. Instead of fuel, scientists could explore other resources that are designated to work a car. However, this will surely bring difficult financial problems for people who are incapable of paying. The discovery of new resources might be very rare
