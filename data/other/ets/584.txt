I agree with this statement. The publicities and advertisements find to convinced people in every way about their products also these are false. This is no wrong with the people beacuse the effects of the products can also be dangerous even if the products are painted as the most beatiful exists in the world. 
 This type of advertisements are most important specifically for medicine and cosmetics products that can be caused very important problem. There are so many cases of intossications.
 For example, the dietetic products are more difficult that really help you , but using nice words and false tests, they can be convinced people to take. 
 Also technology products. Design and beautiful colours used to distract people on the very important aspects like the processors, hardware, ram ect...People are attracted by the colours that see and the nice words that listen.
 Stay on the people`s capacity and attention to understand what is true and right that can only help them. 
 For money all people may say and do wrong and false things. 
 Another reason for this comportament is the success much legated with money. 
 We are so many conditionins about the advertisements and this is so wrong. We must learn to read the tickets on the products and certified that all the things writed are right, asking and doing some researches, and we must research the way to conviced people don`t buyed if they are not sure .
