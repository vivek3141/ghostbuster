Me as many other students face the decision either to have a general knowledge about many accademic fields or to specialise in one field only in order to be considered an expertise. The decision that will come out will reflect the characteristics of the person. A person with many interests will never renounce to the pleasure of knowing more and more different things. On the other hand,  people with a passion will tend to specialise in a field that will make them happier and happier.
 A general education has many positive aspects such as a greater flexibility in changing preferencies and visions for the future. This kind of preparation gives the possibility to the students with no clear ideas about the future to postpone this important decision and take time to identify the main desire. Furthermore, a general education  gives much more flexibility in adapting to different job conditions. 
 A specific education focused only on a subject gives the advantage to the student to be an expertise in a field. This is a great advantage on the job market. In the same time, these students usually are much more rigid, unable to change and to handle with changes. These characteristics are not always required by employers.
 Personally, i think that the best choice for a person would be a solution that takes into account both its own personality and the inner desires, for this reason i do not think there is only one best education. Furthermore i think that the accademic education that must be followed should reflect the requirements of the field that the student is studying, we cannot compare the specificity required in medicine by the doctors with the general culture required by an teacher.
