Some people believe that the products in advertisements are the same as the real one because it looks like the real one. However, I  
 do not agree with it. I believe most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because of well-taken pictures and the stratagy of commpanies.
 First of all, well-taken pictures are very attractive. The purpose of advertisement is to show the products well to people. For perfoming that purpose, the products in advertisements should be a good shape. A freind of mine, he is working in advertisement company in Korea. One day, he showed me two pictures of apple. One was just regular picture and the other one was the picture that he added some color balance with photoshop. Two picture was totally different from each other, and he said that his company will use the latter picture for the apple advertisement. For this reason, I believe that the goods in advertisements is better shape than the real one.
 Moreever, advertisement should make people to want  the products, and that is the stratagy of advertisements. For letting people buy the goods, the advertisements have to use any way to attract people even they exaggerate. One day,  I saw the advertisements of Kim-chi, Korean traditional food, on television shopping. The seller was eatting it and it looked like really really delicious. I could not wait to buy it and finally I orderd it. However, as soon as I god it, It was not that delicious than i expected.
 For these reasons, I strongly agree with the idea of that most advertisements make goods seem much better that they really are. Because well-taken pictures and the purpose of advertisement are most important factor of that people choose the products.
