i m not that young nor that old , for a guy in the end of his thirties ritching the fourtine what  should he think about the life? it is so confusing as from the begining where should i position myself to give a good answer to this topic. well, usually we have to wear either of these both personalities or ages to give the right thought.
 i believe we are misclassifying  people,in my point of view i d rather say very young and youg people, old and very old people, that way i can classify myself as of part of poeple then give a very bright ansewer. 
 the statement talks about the enjoyement of the life mainly which is a purpuse of the minkind, of corse the way they doing would be different going from their experience , age, knowledge and also their capacity doing it.
 the young people are more healthier, more energitic,they 'd rather spend their time playing , practicing sport, having fun with girls and boys, doing some tough jobs to feel their strenght , all these citations are kind of enjoyement , where young poeple use their time and money , taking many riskes for the love of the adventures.
 in other side the old people also enjoy their time or life but more wisly , of corse  it is not the same like the young once in matter of time spend , but it is an enjoyement with more experience and care, from reading , cooking, traveling , but not a crazy things that young does
