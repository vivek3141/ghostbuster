I agree with the idea to travel in a group led by a tour guide because I believe  that it is really helpful when you are traveling in countries or cities where you do not know the lenguaje, the streets, the customs, or the laws, due to that I think that is very important to be accompained with somebody who can help you with all this troubles, as an example I can mention that I remember a really embarrasing situation that happened to a friend when he was traveling in Europe, specifically in France, and he was in the airport and nobody understood what he needed because nobody could understand his lenguage, due to that he called to his sister in who lived in other country and talked french, and finally he spent all his money calling her all days during his trip to ask her to translate him everything, like to talk with the waitress to translate what he wanted to eat, but of course that if  he was accompained by a tour guide he probably had not had spent all these money and he better could have enjoied this extra money buying curiosities or clothes or to make a larger trip, or anything.
 Other excellent thing about a tour guide can provide you in atrip is that you can to know more about the history of the place, to visit important buildings, to eat typical food in typical and cheaper restaurants recommended by him and you can ask to the tour guide for more tips to make your travel unfforgettable.
 however, I am a kind of person who enjoys to be in a sure place with sure people as a travel group with friends, so, the fact to be traveling in a place where I do not know people is something difficult to me, due to that, I really think that a tour guide is an excellent resource, and is not as expensive as to pay the consecuences to be lost in a big city.
