Since a long time at universities and elsewhere a discussion is going on on how the education of people should be organized. There are basically two different ways which have an important effect on the quality of people's later way of working: You can build your education on a very wide basis and try to collect knowledge of as many academic subjects as possible. Or you can do it the other way round: You can specialize on one specific subject and try to get as good as possible in it.
 
 At first we'll have a look at the method to try to gain a broad knowledge of a variety of academic subjects. With this strategy you are able to see how things are connected to each other, in which way they work together or influence each other. This later makes it unlikely to you to produce products that work fine in one special way but do not fit the needs of a large number of customers. When developing products you will have an eye on each group of customers, on the companies aims, on the nature, and so on.
 
 However, a big problem of the previous mentioned strategy is the following: If you are good at practically everything you can not do very well at anything. So, in fact, you have to gain a specialized knowledge of the topic that is most interesting to you. In this way you should be able to achieve very good or even outstanding results. This can bring you, your company, or sometimes even humanity one step further.
 
 In my opinion the best solution lies in the middle of those extremes. Specialization is good because you can not perform very well if you do not have in depth knowledge. On the other hand, if you just have knowlege on one specific topic, you can not see in what way your decisions influence other areas. So you should specialize on one subject and try to get basic knowledge on other topics, at least on topics related to your subject.
