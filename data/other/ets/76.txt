In the present world as their is a rapid change in the development in student in all the aspects  i.e  in IQ,sports,information technology, electornics,media and many other fields and more over in school studies. The students main aspect of learning things is by understanding the facts beside it and the other way is to understand the ideas and concepts about it.
 In olden days student used to learn things by learning the facts about the things which they are going to learn, As it certainly takes more time to learn a particular subject as they i has to know what actually the subject is and how it is going to work, but it is time consuming thing to learn a particular subject.
 while coming to learning subject by knowing or understanding the ideas and concepts about the subject is the better way how to students understand about the subject and solve them easily.
 let us consiber an example to solve an mathematical problem to find the area of the given triangle,which is given to two
 different students in the class, who can solve the problem by knowing the facts and the other   student who understand ideas and concepts of the problem. response who knows the facts of the problem and the student who understand about the ideas and concepts. The student who know the concepts and idea about the triangle can do better and fast by using the formula of the triangle, but the student who known about the basics i.e facts about the triangle will take more time.
 In this developing and competional world one should be more effecient and more faster to survive in their life. so in my opinoun the student who understand ideas and concepts is more important than the students who learn facts so as to face different compitative exams which are likely to held in every part of the life, where they test only the output of the student rather than how much he knows about facts
