First, to decide wether or not to study a subject deeply, a decision for what a person want to be in the future must be answered carefully before.
 
 Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is really essential for our daily life. People are created to learn lots of information on aregular basis in order to coupe with the enviroment in which he lives in, and a person which has no base of knowlege cannot survive within a society. For example how can a person explain to himself the idea of how the planets revolve around the sun or how the moon is able to rotate around the sun without losing its track? Or how can the sun supply the high amount of energy needed to light the earth, without learning science! Can you see, thats the diffrence between an adult and a baby. Being able to use all the academic knowlege accuired during our academic study is essenciall even in our work. But goin on with this idea people will spend a lot of time and effort only to accuire broad knowlege.
 
 While having a specific subject in which a person can specialize in is very important for his work. Trying too gain a deep knowlege about a subject is just great, cause why to study other subjects that you donot like and miss the knowlege that can be accuired on the subject that you are not intrested in. Now and by studing the subject you favour you can always gain lots of information as you won't be bored as this is the field of your intrest and you will keep on increasing your knowlege on and on.
 
 I really think that studing on a broad scale would be better as a person may have many fields of intrest, besides he would have knowlege in other fiels of study that may help in the field that he wants to specialize in as most of the studies that we learn are somehow linked together in a certain way or another.
