I can say I do agree with the statement because the whole industry of advertising has been constructed on the use of psychological tricks that can work to perasuade average people, or more likely some targets of people, to buy a certain product. The characteristics described in TV advertising have often been exagerated because people have to be impressed in first place to remember the name of a product, recognize it in the shop and then buy it. Fact is, that people can effectively realize how good a product is only once they have tried it, but this way the aim of the advertising campaign has already been reached. Now, what are the strategies people can develop to defend themselves from this sort of manipulation? First, they can try to get suggestions from people they know and trust, such as relatives of friends, about a specific product they are willing to buy. Second, they can take advantage of the large number of offers dealers make when they have to launch a new product on the market: this way they can try something new without spending too much money on it. Third, people can always count on some associations, which have been specifically created to defend customers from manipulation of companies` advertising. These are often no profit organization which are giving to give suggestions and assistance when people need it, making sure that the clause "satisfied or refunded" is respected. In conclusion I would like to recommend people to always think twice before buying something which looks too good, because, as far as everybody knows, good brands never need advertising simply because their name is always on everyone`s mouth.
