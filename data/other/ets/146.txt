I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do for these reasons: young people have alot of power which life needs, yonge people have alot of time for enjoy in this life and older people have alot of problems that make him not enjoy in their lifes.
 
 First, young people have alot of power in this time. Young people have a good health, a good and nice body  and more they are more active. Ali can to go to Desney town and play there most dangeras games, but his grandfather can not.
 
 Second, Younge people have alot of time. They do not have alot of responsility like childrern and busness. Researches say that more than 50% of young time is for enjoying, but the olders have less 20% of their time for enjoy.
 
 Finally, old people have alot of problems that make him not enjoy in thier lifes. Old people have alot of disease and children that make there lifes not intersting.
 
 In conclusion, the best time for the human is when he is young. Young can do every things. Although we can not stop the time, we should enjoy in every minut in the young time.
