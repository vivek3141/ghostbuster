It is dificult to forecast the evolution of the use of cars in twenty years, because it depends on a lot of factors that could change in such a long time. However, and given the news that we are facing all days, I think is possible having an accurate idea about what the future will be, and in this future will be fewer cars.
 
 At first, looking back to the past, we can see that the development of car manufacturing was linked to some social and economic factors. In the very beggining of car industry, a car was considered a luxurious device for most of the population, but thanks to Henry Ford, the private automobile became a popular consume good, formerly in the United States and later in Europe. In its heyday in the fifties, the american cars were a symbol of power and wealth in all the countries of the world.
 Nevertheless, the environmental conditions have changed widely in the last decades. The continuous rising of the gas prices, linked to the political unstability of the leading productors; the rising of the consciousness that the planet resources are limited, and the fact that the natural environment is being harmed, have changed the attitude towards the private car. Indeed, the urban life has been severely disturbed by the wide use of cars. The possibility of using the car to conmmute everyday has created the sprawl phenomenon, with the bitter consequence of decaying inner cities, collapsed highways, destruction of farmland, pollution, and lack of social contact in the car-oriented suburbs.
 
 Therefore, I think that the use of the car will be reduced in the future. It is necesary that all the society face the environmental and social problems that cars are creating. Of course I think that cars are useful and I drive, however, I think that cars should be used in a more smart way than today. Combinig the car with efficient public transportation networks, we will create a different and most sustainable pattern of urban growing.
