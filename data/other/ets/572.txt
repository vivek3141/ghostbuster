I agree this statement. We can't experience all things. 
 Think about the food. How many kinds of food did you it? or do you know how many foods in the world. Maybe we don't have any idea. We can just guess. The world is very wide ,we never see the all country(including detail culture, back ground, and so on), so the think is very important . All people's thinkings are different. If you ask one question, then you can hear many different answers. The idea's world is unlimited. If you read some books, you can experience the other people's life or everythings. May it is fiction or nonfiction. The facts make the other ideas. We can see many image books.For example, comic books ,fiction , movie and so on. All things are stat one fact, then you plus your image. Many teacher ask to  their student"You have to read many books and you need more thinking time. It is good for you." We heard many times from our teachers.
 When we were a chidren. We could see many books. It is fact. We read the books. We can do everything in your thinks. We will become robot, door, hero, and so on in your thinking. Then we have good dreams. I heard like this sentence" If you don't have a deram, you're very poor people. Our life is different. If your parents are rich or not , your ife is change.If you leave more big country, you can experience various culture. However, we have different all things The reaons are very various. Our enviorments are different, but we reduce the gab. book is very important . We have to read the bookl . You can thinks many times toyue
