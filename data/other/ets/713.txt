The purpose of advertisement is to sell a product; the product will be promoted to allure the customer into purchasing it. Therefore, I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Not only do they emphasize the product's qualities but they also do not mention features that can make the product hard to use.
 Emphasizing a product's quality in an advertisement is not unlike producing a movie preview. It, unfortunately, becomes more and more common to be disappointed by a movie after being attracted to it by its preview on TV. Haven't you noticed how it seems that all the good parts of the movie are shown in the preview? All you have left to discover, once you go to the theater, are the dull moments. Just like a preview which shows you all good things about a movie, an advertisement highlights the great product features. Once you finally purchase the product, the novelty wears off pretty fast and you are left with the mondain task of actually using it. You may even realize that the cool feature they were advertising was just that, a cool feature, and this product is not better than any other one.
 As much as an advertisement emphasizes the product qualities, it will hide any feature that can make the product hard to use. Let's take the iPod for instance, it is small and getting even smaller as new models are developped. It also as all the controls around a circle. This definitely looks great on the advertisement but once you actually try to an iPod, you realize that this cool product will require a lot of patience in order to master the thumb movement and control its functions. Any advertisement would be faulty if it lead the customer to think that there might be any difficulties in using this product.
 As can be seen on any advertisement, only positive points about a product are ever highlighted. This is what advertisers need to do to make products attractive. Therefore, they will make products seem better than they really are.
