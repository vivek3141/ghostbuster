I think it depends on individual's preference. Someone like to trip in a group led by a tour, and others do not. I'm a person of the latter type and I disagree with that statement. I don't like to travel in a group led by a tour guide, because travel in a group led by a tour guide will deprive flexibility from the trip.
 It is true that relying on a tour guide is comfortable. Someone should think that even planning where to visit is bothering. A group trip led by a tour guide is suitable for such a person. Tour guides are professional to plan and to travel safely. The trip led by a guide should be easy and safe. Traveling in a group led by a tour guide, however, lacks flexibility in the plan.
 In some cities, there are too many famous places, and travelers are forced to choose some from them. In London or New York, for instance, we have to spent three or four days in a museum if we try to see every thing exhibited there. In such a case, travelers should obey the plans of the tour if they participate in a tour led by a tour guide. A people who are especially interested in arts and wants to stay longer at a museum should prefer traveling freely.
 Sometimes I change my plan during a trip. When I visited Germanany when I was an undergraduate student, I planned to visit five cities during the one week trip. At the first place I visit, however, I was so impressed by the beautiful scene of a river and castle that I changed my plan and stayed there for one week. Consequently, I visited only one city during the trip.
 When we travel, we often encounter impressive scenary or event at the place we visit during the trip. Traveling in a group led by a tour guide do not allow us to change the plan stay there for longer time than we planned before.
