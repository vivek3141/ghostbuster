Some people think that it is more important for students to understnad ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.  However, I believe students need to learn facts rather than ideas amd concepts.
 First of all, students can learn what they should do or should not do from facts. When they learn consequences of a certain fact, they will know that the fact should be done again or not. For example, if students learn about wars, they will know that people should not fight each other again. Since students wll learn that wars cause so many deaths from the wars which occured in the past, they would think that wars are not acceptable.
 Second, while Ideas and concepts can be very complicated and difficult to understand, facts are easy to understand. For instance, when students learn the concept of "dilemma", they may not understand the meaning completely. However, if they learn examples of "dilemma", they would understand easily and deeply. 
 Finally, facts are related to real life. Therefore, students can match their experience with the facts they have learnt. As a result, they can predict what will hapen next and prevent bad consequences. For example, there was a huge earthquak in Japan and a lot of people died becase furniture in the house hit them. If students learn about that, they can prevent it from happning again by attaching furniture to walls.
 In conclusion, facts provide students with more useful information than ideas and concept does.
