Advertisements are one of the most power means of communication in modern society, people hardly ignore their existant. Undoubtedly, nowadays, advertisements are everywhere, people couldn't live without them. There are on the TV, in the radio, on the top of the building, event being printed on the subways and buses. Most of advertisements combine with words and illustations, these sentences and colorful pictures strongly draw people's attention. I Take myself as an example, I was always being attracted by the huge billbroad hung on the Time Square, and I felt these pictures are so delicate, elegant and beautiful. Nevertheless, have you ever think about that are they too good to be true. Are these modles on the billbroad really as perfect as princes and princesses in the child's book. I mean They have no pimples or extra hairs at all on their faces. Something must be done for this advertisement I suspect. After I went to graphic design school to obtain the knowledge about photoshop, I understood that actually these perfect faces had gone through special repairs, the advertisers or graphic designers applies photoshop to make the model's faces look fawless. In this way,  advertisements will attract comsumers to purchase more products, and make more profits for merchants. However, it brought about many disadvantages. Some products in the advertisements look too good to be true, actually, in some extent, the companies or merchants misled the comsumers. For instance, one day, I went to lunch at Wendy's, I was attracted by an advertisement that a huge hambager with a big pack of french fries only charge me $3. Then I bought it without a hesitation. When I recieved the food from the attentant, I was competely shocked. The food is not good enough than I expected before. From that day, I didn't trust food advertisement at all, I thouhght they are all fake, the food is not as food as they discribe
