The young people these days do not give sufficient time to help their communities.In this fast moving world young people must allocate sufficient amount of time to help their communities.I certainly agree that young people do not devote enough time to help their communities.
 
 Firstly, the world has become so materialistic that everyone thinks in terms of monetary gains.People do something if they get money out of it and are least interested in offering voluntary help to the people in their community.Let us take the example of a graduate student who is willing to teach undergraduates at a university since he is monetarily rewarded but, is completely reluctant to teach the poor students of his neighbourhood as he is not paid for it.
 
 Secondly, the population of the world is increasing at a very rapid pace which results in tremendous competition.There is a decrease in wages and people have to work for longer duration in order to survive.As a result of this a person earlier had more time at leisure to help the communities wheras the current generation would like to do other recreational activities rather  than helping their communities.
 
 Thirdly, there has been a drastic change in the attitude of the current younger generation.The current generation lacks the moral values that existed in the past and have become very selfish these days.Take the case of a young boys who are influenced by movies which do not believe in doing anything that does not give them anything back in return.
 
 Nevertheless, we always find some good young people who make it a point to find some time and help their communities despite having hectic schedules.They feel that by offering services to community they are serving the Almighty.
 
 However, I firmly feel that very few young people give enough time to their communities due to change in attitudes, greed for wealth and increasing competition.
