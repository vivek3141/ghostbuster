I agree with the statement that it is better to specialize in one subject rather than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it is good for a student to specialize in a subject that he is interested in than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects.If a student is specializing in a subject as he had concentrate only on that subject he can can do very well in that  subject rather if he had to concentrate on many subjects where he cannot concentrate on all of them at a time.
 
 Normally a student will have broad knowledge of many subjects as there will many academic subjects throughout the school level.After that once they enter into the college level they need to concentrate only on the subject they are interested in,but not on many academic subjects at a time.At the college level the students should concentrate on the subject they are intersted in,which will help them to specialize in that subject and to have indepth knowledge about that subject.
 
 More over i support my opinion by taking the example of a scientist of a particular field.A scientist in general will be specializing in the subject which is related with his currently working field and above all he will have indepth knowledge about the subject in which he specialized.Specializing in a field also helps in making advancements to that field ingeneral made by the person specialised by inventing many new methods or improving the old methods which he had studied previously.
 
 On the whole i conclude the specailizing in a subject in which an individual is interested in, will help to go into go indepth into the subject and probable the individual may specialize in the field of the subject. so it is essential to specialize in a help in a subject rather than to have broad knowledge about many subjects.
