Do people nowaday give enogh time to help their comunities? I think that people nowaday have tired to give enough time to their communities. There are several key reasons for my position.
 
 First, people nowaday have work very hard to survive. They don't have much time for themselves, not mention about the time for communities. Compared now  to the fivety years ago in Taiwan, people had a lot of time for their communities because people mainly worked as a farmers. For example, people have to work from 7 to 9 for their companies because the competions nowaday are so keen, however fiveteen years age people just needed to work 9 to 5.  It is a industry world everywhere and people have to do their best to survive.People  have tried their best to give their leisure time to the communities. 
 
 Second, governments nowadays always take a lot efforts to helping the communities so that people don't have to give too much time to the communities. Goverments have already made plan to helping communities. For examples, the government in Taiwan allocates human resources and money to every comminities to help children getting tutoring after schools for free. There are also a lot policies the goverment paying efforts to help the communities, such as local security durinf nights, providing human resources to help people to solve their difficuties.  People don't have to worry about that they don't give enough time to their communities because governments has already took care for the need of the commnities.
 
 Many people don't disagree with me, stating that people nowadays don't give enough time to the communities. I think people nowaday have already spent enough time for their communities since they don't have much time for theirselves and also government has also put much effort in the communities so that people don't have to worry about it.
