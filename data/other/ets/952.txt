Some people think that old people can't enjoy life the way young people do. But, personally I think they can for the following reasons.
 Most importantly, The age doesn't matter. If the person kept on mind that he want to have a good time and live a happy life, he will do and find the pleasure in alomost any situation. Nothing that the young people can do the older can't do it. It depend on the person himself. For example, When I was young, I used to go to the public park with my grand father. We had such a great time that we want there every weekend. We enjoyed playing dangerous electronic games. Even though my grand father was in his fifties he was stiil young and able to enjoy his life, while my father was vary young, but he spenjd all of his time in his office working. 
 In addtion, old people have more expriences in life. They are usaully wiser and know how to spend thier time. In today's modern society, young people are almost wasting thier time doing useless or harmful things. They don't have enough experience to do the right things or to know how to spend thier time in a good way. In other words, the expriences of the old people will help them to know the right ways to enjoy thier life. 
 Another reason is that young people have more responspilties. They have to study or to work. Whereas, old people don't have to work as mush as the youngs do. Most of them  have finished thier studies. Also, there children are grown up and started to depend on thereselves, so they have more free time. 
 In conclusion, I tend to think that older people enjoy thier life more than young people. They finished thier message in life, so they have the time and the experiences to enjoy thier life better than the young people do.
