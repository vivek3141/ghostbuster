Some people  know a lot about a lot of different topics, some other would just know about something specific. Knowledge is obviously important for your everyday life and for your career, but is it better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize  in one specific subject?
 
 It is sometimes important to learn and know a lot about just one subject, especially for some kind of works. For example, people would probably not be sure if you try to operate them without an surgeon's diplom, which proves that you know what you are doing. That is the same way when you are looking for a lawyer. You generally go to the one who is known as the best specialist. On a personal experience, some specific cultures as chinese or japanese like when you seem to be a specialist about something: they will trust you easily for business negociations.
 
 On the other hand,  most of business places don't necessarly require to have specific knowledge in one specific subject, but expect you to know about a lot of different subjects. In that way you may be able to show to recruiters or partners that you can adapt yourself to a lot of different situations. Besides, to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is a good thing for your own personality. Indeed, you can discover that thanks to this, the world is full of controversions and different things.
 
 
 However, It is hard to say that one way is better than the other one, because it mostly depends of the situation. As a business student, I would say that it is more important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, because it allows you to speak with more people, and developp your own personality. Even if it is hard to master every subjects, it enlarges your general culture, which is good for everybody.
