I disagree with this statement.
 My poit of view is different...
 I thinks that there are a lot of car today and there will be more and more tomorrow..
 My opinion is that until the reserv of petrol will finish the human didn't stop to make a new cars.
 The only way to stop this process is improve pubblic transport and make this more cheap than using car, but this will be not easy because it means make a change in politic's mind and in big company's rule.
 Twenty years it's a short time for make this inversion I thinks!!
 For example I had every morning an hours of car for make 25 km it's crazy but it is always less in term of money and time than taking a pubblic bus. 
 
 We also assist at the evolvig of oriental states who are density populated and they are now using a bikecycles but not for even!!
 this will be a problem for earth healt.
 
 
 
 
 I hope that my generation could view a society with less cars
