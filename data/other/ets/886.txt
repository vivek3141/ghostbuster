I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. I will present a couple of reasons why I do not agree with the statement.
 
 First, as technology develops, there will be more advanced types of cars in use in a variety of ways.. For example, in the present time, cars are being used on the road, but imagine the cars runing under the land, that is underground, or yet better, flying and running at the same time in the air and land. It would be possible to drive a car on the road and air like flying cars as we can see those kinds of cars in the movie. Technology is becoming more and more sophisticated, and it will make our dreams realized in the future.
 
 Second, there will be alternative power sources available in the future. People who think there will be fewer cars in use in the future probably considered the current energy problems. It is ture that the fossil fuels are limited, and other energy sources haven't been yet practical. However, the possibility of using alternative energy sources such as solar energy and geothermal energy is being intensively studied, and near future it will be much more real than now. In addition, a number of scientists are currently involved in developing feasible future energy sources, showing a good prospect for the future.
 
 In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the remark that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Automobiles will be one of the best transportation means available in the future as it is today.
