I totally agree with this statment and i blieve that every thing in our world has its own advantages and dis advantages and so does advertsment.
 Advertisment means  announcing about some thing wheather it is good or bad. but comercially ;you do not have to show the bad qualities of your product other wise peapole will not buy it 
 for example if you advertised that your product is not suitable for olders also the youth will not buy it so you have to lie and say it is suitable for all people to give it the chance to compete 
 you have to say that your product is tcken rapidly to incourage people to try it while in fact it is stored in all shopps
 
 Once I bought ashirt and it was advertised that absorbs sweat without harming the skin but after only one day i suffered from allergy up to two monthes after that irealized that it was not made from cotton but from pollyester 
 Once again I bought a pincil and it was advertised that it will last with you for at least one year but unfortunately it was brocken at the same day
 So finally I agree with the statment above and recommened all people NOT TO RELY ONLY ON ADVERTISMENTS
