In my opinion it is true that young people are starting to have lots of different distraction that are separating them from many interesting activities and responsabilities as helping their communities.
 But it is something that have been increasing several years ago.
 
 The development of new technologies as internet, mobiles,  televitions, dvds, computer games, etc,  have extended another ambitions and purposes in life.
 
 Nowdays teenager prefer to sit in front of a dvd player or play with their mobiles instead share some evenings in some communities where all kind of activities or services are planned.
 
 First of all, I think one of the reason is the education that they are receiving from their parents and from the schools. It seems to be more important to know how to use internet than which was the last book that they read.
 
 Secondly in this communities the should try to attrack teenagers offering them different kind of activities which could make them interested in going to this communinties and participate. For example, organizing: concerts (all types of music: classical, pop, rock...), football games or other kind of sports, creating a library which would include: internet, books, cd's, dvd'd; also try to perform some plays or go to the theatre. Also know much more about the place that they live and the enviroment in general not just the group or the city that they live. 
 
 At last, when young people can enjoy in this enviroment they will be very excited and very decided to colaborate in any kidn of activity or help that the community can create or organize.
 
 My conclusion is that if the community present a good range of attractive and new activities any youn people will be so happy to colaborate in the well being og the community
