Yes i agree with the statement, it is more important to understand the ideas concepts of a particular thing.
 Because it is more important for any one to  have an clear idea about that particular thing to work on it.
 I would explain with an example,when i am doing my first semester of my  under graduation i use to do my assignments with out understanding them and with out any clear idea about the topic given.i use to submit my assignments in this way only .when my examination is nearing,i dont have any idea about the topics because i didn't work on them clearly. Because,i thought just submitting my assignments in time would help me in the examination,but when i appear in the exam i could not do well because i dont have any idea of  the concept of the work.this makes my grades to be lower.
 when the next  assignment is given i used to work on it for a long time and tried to get a clear idea about the topic and made my assignments.this helped me a lot in the final examination to succeed and got a better grade.this is because understanding the concept of that made me to do well in the examination.
 Another example is  that,when an experiment is explained in an class room it is again asked to make the same one in laboratory.i used  to neglet to concentrate on the laboratory  class.when i used to revise the topics  covered after so many days, i used to forget the particular thing expalined in the class room and i again should see the particular professor for the left over one.If i would have performed the paritcular thing in the laboratory i would get the clear idea and the concept of the topic and would have remembered the thing in that topic.
 so i  conclude that it is important for students to understand the clear concept than it is for them to learn facts because understanding the ideas and the concept of the topic would do more than fact.
