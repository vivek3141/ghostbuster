Nowadays there is  a  contoversial between using your own car or using  public transports.
 this is a consequence of the environment destruction and the contamination of the earth causing by numerous actions that humans makes. 
 today there are a lot of organaizations that are very concerned about the pollution and the damaged of the environment.
 They are trying to find a  solution to diminishing this important  problem.
 these organaizations tries to encouraged people to  try  to  not contaminate a lot  and to use  healthy ways for not  damaging the envionmet. 
 
 One of the problem  is using your own car our  using a public transport.
 In my opinion  i agree with the statement  because  i think that in a  few years there wouldnt be as much cars as now because  other  confortable and faster ways  of transport will be used, as for example   the plane that its at this moment one of the best way  of transport or  another possibility is using   cars that works with solar energy or with  water  contribuiting  with the environmet.
 
 On the other hand the car is the most common way of travelling of most of the people. People uses their cars a lot becuase is the most cheapest transport and you can use it wherever you want.
 Also the car is very comfortable. The problem of this is that people should try to be concerned about the advantages or disadvantages of using the car or another transport.
 
 As far as i'm concerned numerous scientist are investigating new methods and ways of travelling.
 Scientist have made predictions about the future saying  that  by a certain period of time  there will be fewer cars  and  instead of using gasoline  in the cars use another alternatives ways.
 
 As a matter of a conclusion , in the future there will be fewer  cars because people will try to travell in a fastest and confortable way than in a car and also be concerning about helping and not  contaminating the environment.
