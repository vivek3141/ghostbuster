I disagree with the previous example because I do not consider one is option is better from the other. I believe that concepts or ideas are as much important as it is to learn facts. 
 
 Of course there  exists a different weight of this concepts depending on the field the person is studying, working on or leaving in. But in general I consider concepts give the knowledge about a certain topic and give the opportunity to the individual to form a personal point of view of something, then after the individual create his or her own perspective he or she could learn facts and later on review them and analized wich facts are in favor or against its individual perpective, and generate a conclusion on what posture should take; change the personal perspective about something or keep it. Also it does not exist a theory that stablish what to learn first concepts or facts, it could be better for a person to fisrt have knowledge about some facts and then revise the concepts of the same topic. But for other people shoul be better to participate in the learning process in the opppossite way. As an example we can see people that did not have the opportunity to study but they can have a good performance on different kind of jobs, just by knowing first the facts and then review the theory to solve the problem. For examble a lot of mechanincs, specially in Mexico, does not has a formal study formation but they know where can be the solution to  a certain problem and then get interested in knowing the concepts. 
 
 In recent year the combination of both statements is becoming the best way to succeed in live. ust ask how many universities include in their programs a 50% practical courses and 50% theoretical courses. And look for jobs that ask for expirience and ahigh university degree.
