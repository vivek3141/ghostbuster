I disagree with this question .  I think older people could enjoy life more than young people. 
 
 Old people can feel various things deeply beause of their experience.  The things they do not feel interesting in youg age will change enjoyable .  Older people knows things more than young people. That knowledge make their width of joy expand . 
 For example , I think watching picture is typical . The young people who can be interesting in watching picture would be less than old people. Watching the audience in musium proof it . Young people are difficult to find out the atomospher , sence , deepth from just watching picture because of their shortness of life . But old people will be able to feel life of writers just watching picture with hinking of own life . This kind of enjoy is calm but very deeply , and this can not do young people.
 
 
 And old people , in main case , have grandson or granddaughter.
 I do not have children . But when I was in childhood , I often played with my grandfather .  He loved me so much as if there are no other treasure for him .  Visiting his house , he always wellcomed to me with very nice smile .  Thinking of this , having grandson and meeting , playing with them is not only fun but also joy of life . 
 This enjoy is only feel old man . Young people never feel this . 
 
 Young people actually enjoy life . Playing sports , drinking with friends ,  etc .  But I think the real enjoy for life would be for old people.
