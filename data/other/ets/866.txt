When i was fifteen years old ,my father told me somthing which i have never forgot it ,and actually it helped me many times, he said "try to know small things about about every subject and try to know everything about one subject".
 
 For that i tried from that time to identify which kind of sciences i should specialized , and what are the related sciences which i should know about it.
 I dicieded to specialize in the structural design engineering and that force me to do well in the academic subjects dealing with that science.but i find that to do that well i should have a good knowledge of mathematics , physics,mechanics and in sometime medical subjects. It seems to be strange, how can some medical subjects related to related to structural design ? the answer is the way the human is standing with by his bones is similar to the way of structure to. 
 So according to my experiences i think that specializing in a certain academic subject is very important, but you must have a small knowledge about the other academic subjects.       
 On the other hand people that supporting having a board knowledge of many academic subjects says that ; it will help students to have a bigger chances in the markets , but that is not correct . the market nowadays is searching for the specialized persons in a certain subject ,and also they pay for these kinds of experiences too much.
 Actually not specialized people always playing small rools in their companies and even if they are working too much they did not get a good appriciation as the specialized workers got. and ofcourse that will affecting the working environment  by spreading the feeling of jelous and make the one team project hate each others.
