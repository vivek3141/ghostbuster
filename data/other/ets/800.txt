It is a well known fact that it is only in the hands of the youth that the destiny of a society rests.In this fast paced world,there have been arguments galore about the time devoted by young people towards their community.On a personal note,I feel that youth nowadays is too pre-occupied with other things and is not contributing quality time to the upliftment of their respective communities.
 This can be illustrated by the fact that not many youngsters are actively involved in the working of the community help groups.The members of the council concerned with the problems of a community has a lot of middle aged men or people on the brink of retirement.Young people shun away from social responsibility thinking that the time can be more valuably spent in education or in a part-time lucrative job.Peer pressure also starts taking its toll.Youngsters feel that they should either be in the college,learning,or let their hair down by partying hard.They fear coming under criticisim if they get involved in charity work for the community,because they feel it is not a hip or trendy thing.Parental concerns also add fuel to the fire.Parents have undue expectations on their ward which result in the children working that extra bit hard to live upto them.In the process,extra-curricular activities and community work take a back seat due to lack of time.In addition,schools and colleges are always concentrating on academic work,whereas the emphasis should also be diverted toward forming clubs for community work.Only in a few countries across the world do institutions ask students for active participation in community work.The youth should be educated about their involvement in community activities and the benefits it has as the youngsters nowadays feel that earning money is everything in life.The lack of awareness on the problems haunting the community in which they live also contribute to the disinterest.
 Thus the precious talents and the fresh minds of youngsters are not being put to much use in community work,which,I feel may spell tough times for communities if the trend continues.I think that its high time that the youngsters balance their personal life and community work with perfect harmony to make the world a better place.
