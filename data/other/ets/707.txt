I totally agree with the statement, I think it is very important for students to learn and understand ideas and concepts, that stand behind the facts.
 Studying history for example, we're better know why the First and the Second World War happened, than knowing how every single country organized its trupes for the conflict.
 
 What I reffear to is the importance of communicate what are the reasons of the facts instead of knowing mererly what happened that day.
 Going on with the example of historic issues, it has a great relevance to understand the reasons, the ideologies, all the complex contest in which a fact is in. ..even becouse we are supposed to learn about those ways of thinking that led ancient people, and contemporary people to great successes, and to great disasters..what was the thread running through these events, how some dictators were able to strike a chord in people...that is what should be widely unsderstood.
 
 If we consider other matters, like studying mathematics or phisical and scientific studies, I still believe that is more important to understand how to get to a certain theory than learning only  that formula.
 
 Moreover, as a matter of fact, we tend to forget mostly of things we learn by chance, but we easily remember what we totally understood, becouse we undestood the mental process to get to that particular solution. 
 
 In conclusion, learning the concepts and the ideas, we developp our mental and logical  functions. This helps not only in succeed to examinations and testes, but in every single thing we do in our life
