Life is a journey from birth to death.Through this journey, a person experiences many things.But when it comes to enjoying life, certain qualities of a person affects the level of enjoying.One of this qualities is person's age.And I think, the less your age is, the more you enjoy life.That is, young people enjoy life more than older people do.
 First reason that comes to my mind why youth is more enjoyable is because you are healthier when you are young.If you are not healthy nothing can cheer you up as much as it is supposed to.It is obvious that when you get old, health problems begin to lower your satisfaction from life.And also the things to stay healthy get harder to make, for example, sports. 
 In addition to health problems, the fear of death begins to bug your mind more often when you get old.When a person is young he/she rarely thinks about death, because it seems far away from him/her as if it would never ring  his/her door.Existence of this fear makes life less enjoyable than it was when he/she was young.
 Hope is a very important thing when it comes to enjoying life. Hope makes you to gain the power needed to struggle with the problems of life.Thanks to the many years ahead of the young person and relatively bad experiences, he/she keeps his/her hope more easily than an experienced old person.Hope may not be necessarily result in a desired situation but the hope itself makes life more enjoyable.
 Lastly, as a more personal opinion: If I was an old person I would be sad that I won't be able to see the possible advancements in world.For example, I can predict that we will be able to see man like robots in twenty-thirty years.Having the possibility to see these advancements make life more enjoyable for me.
