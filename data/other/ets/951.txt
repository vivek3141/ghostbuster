I disagree with it.Older people enjoy life,too.It is just looks than young people enjoy life more than older do.
 I know many older people who enjoy life,my parants are also.They go to many places on every weekend.But I join young people am home,do homeworks.Which do enjoy life?
 My opinion is older people enjoy life more than young people.Older people had worked for a long time,but young people just play.I t is not enjoyment.For example,now I have studied at college.This is to be going to enjoy in future.
 Though some older people are unhappy with no maney,at last they become freedom from school,study,works,communicate with hate people and busy.Only Japanese are busy?I do not think so.
 Young people are always play,they can move and go somewhere.But older people's body will be worse.It is only bad thing.But their mind are good.
 I have a dream that I will be like my grandmother.Her is sometime like unhappy,but sometime not so.Sometime she say me that my body have painful,I don't like a husband.But sometime she is smile.I know she is happy,and I am happy,too.
