I  disagreen that successful people try to new thing and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.  There are have three opinions in my mind to talk why  i disagree this statement. 
 At beging of the statment, I think one of important reason that people can make successful because successful people have already to do this thing as they make successful ,they use more time than other people , they contiune their work all day , not give it up,so they successful. It is not to easy to successful to every successful people.
 Second, successful people as same as other people to do the thing, They just have more one experiences than other people , before this time, they would have many experiencesto fair when they do this thing but nobody knows it.  Successful are not clever than other people,only hard working than other people.
 Third, new thing not only have already can try to ,it need more time to think and to get some informataion to find some notes about it ,successful people can not try to new thing when they have not already. Thenfore, they change some opintions whart they have already know how to do well. It is to bad to successful people.
 All of them cak\n tell us successful people as same as other people, although they are successful poeople, they not alwat\ys successful in their lives. If they only want try to new things but not have alredy to do and to goive up that they have already thing ,it is bad ideaswith them ,almost can change their lives and they can not a successful people in the world, so do not want successful  ,just hard work  ev
