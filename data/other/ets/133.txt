I believe it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because I strongly believe that focus is a very important element for anyone seeking success. Having broad knowledge of many subjects does not make us experts in any of these subjects whereas focusing on a single subject helps us fully comprehend that subject and have more control over it.  Without focus, there is no direction or goal.
 
 Specializing in one specific subject allows us to research everything about that subject more thouroughly. It is easier not get distracted by irrelevant information when one has a single issue to deal with than many. 
 
 I experienced this six years ago when I started studying fine arts in college and took classes from every department including painting, drawing, sculpture, ceramics, fashion and illustration. It was exhausting to try to practice all of them together, so I decided to focus on painting which was the one I was most interested in. Now I am a painter, and I can say I know more about painting than anything else and this has brought self fullfillment to my life.
 
 No matter how some people might think that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better, it is an undeniable fact that we have limited time to spend on each of these subjects. Expertise only comes from practice and we obviously need time to practice. To put it in a simpler way; who do you think would bake better cakes: someone who bakes cakes, bread, croissants and cookies all at the same time or someone who does nothing else but baking cakes? I definitely think that the second person would have a much more delicious cake to offer.
