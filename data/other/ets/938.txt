There are different ways to enjoy the life also you can enjoy the life in different ways at different ages.
 The youngest age is a wonderful time of our lifes where we can live  almost without worries or they are minimum. As a teenager  the only worries they can have are: what  dress I am going to wear for saturday's party or why my boyfriend  doesn't call me yet .In contrast when we are adults the life cames with different responsabilities : take care of our own family ,spouse, kids ,school ,bills to pay ,mortgage, car,family vacation ,illness of any member of the family,the list is huge and we can fill the full page with all these responsabilities on an  adult shoulders. But those are no reason to no enjoy the life on their way , living with all those worries.
 There are millions of ways that we enjoy life : Getting a new house for the family , we have to pay more , but the happiness we give to our family is priceless. We can take a family vacation or a vacation just by yourself or going with a friend to that country you always wanted to go .
 Simple things in our lifes make us enjoy  and appreciate every minute we live , celebrating a  birthday ,going shopping with our favorite friend, go fishing or golfing in  our day off.
 As a child  life is easier to live and enjoy ,but that depends where do you live, who do you live with ,what do you do for your life.
 For sure, children living  in a problematic home, with parents or brothers always in problems, they won't  enjoy their childhood.
 From  my own experience and personal opinion , there is no age to enjoy life , it is not necesary to be young to have a happy life .I came from a well formed family  where I could  see the happiness  in my parents's faces.
 Some young people live in continuous party , but......are  they really living and enjoing their lifes?
