" I'ts all  youngone's after god who can do everything if they wish to. "         
 Mahatma Gandhi.
 
 I agree with this fact that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. At present if you see all young one's are just  trying to have a good job or other source of income rite after the begning of their career. Then after gaining this they are just involved in all that and just forget about their country, their parents. With the advancement of technology, many new means of entertainment as television, computer, internet etc were discovered. When children enters from childhood to young age, he has all meens of entetainment. He does not even need a friend to play with. He uses computer to play computer games, uses internet to have chat with others and all that becomes a part of his life. Thereafter he generally  becomes isolated from all the external and public works. 
 No one wants to join any community just because he thinks that it is all waistage of its time. The time which he spends in computer or just with some of his friends for gossiping. But it is very necessary for everyone to have a life which he spends in helping others or just of other tasks related to public. It is a great source of motification and influence in work if u work in community. No one knows his shortcomings if he just works alone.
 If we want all around development of our earth then we all have to work as a community, for which all of us should give our precious time. All of us are very energetic in our young age. If we'll  waist our time and not give it to help our communities now that ultimately we'll have to suffer after some time, when next generaion will come. Young people should place an example over upcoming youngsters so that they might also follow their path and will join communities which could be helpful for all others. I think that we all should join atleast one community and give atleast half an hour per day for its development.
