Education is most important thing for improving , but  education style is more than important  education . Because, education style effect future improvement in the science. How can we educate the students? Must  students  understand ideas and concepts or learn facts?  I agree that  it is more important for students to understand ideas and  concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
 First of all, students must understand ideas and concepts. Because, If they do not understand  base of theory. They can not improve their information about issues.  They only try to remember everthing which they learned. So, we must teach the students how they understand ideas and concepts. When a student learn the idea and concept about something. They can understand a lot of thing related with that issue easily and improve themselves alone. For example, a student  is tring to learn an issue about mathematic. If he does not understand  ideas and concepts related issue. He does not learn that issue. He will not  that course in future and  we will lose this student. If we teach him ideas and concepts correctly ,he will like that course and  we will not lose this student. He will work for science in future.
 
 Learning facts is other way of teaching , but I think that it is old way.  when we try to teach students facts about something. They must remember everything related that issue. A lot of student do not like remember something where they come. It is diffucult and boring for them. They do not know anything about course.  They must remember a lot thing.  Maybe, they will remember everthing which teacher says but , they will forget everthing. they do not remember anything in future related courses . Thus , learning facts is not good way.
 
 In conclusion, we must choose teaching   how to understand ideas and concepts , not chos
