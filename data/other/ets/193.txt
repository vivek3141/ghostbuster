As a first comment, I wouls say that there are two ways of being successful after having taken risk. The first one is when you are still alive after action and more wealthy than before, The second one  when you killed yourself while taking a huge risk endangering a family or a whole community. But this is more philosophy than real explanation...what is success...
 Generaly speaking, this is true that people who take risks are more successful than others. This is right for many reasons. First, they challenge their own mind, or what they have learned just because they dont feel confortable with regular rules. In fact they cannot live with what has been given to them, they have to re-invent the wheel or try something else like Bill Gates did in his garage. Because they feel free in their head, they find new solutions and new ideas that save money or facilitate once life with products or ideas that every one will buy or follow. Very often they invest they own money or borrow a big amout of money. But money doesn t make all the difference. This is because they have taken this risk with a huge faith in their project that they are successful. They never stopped even if they failed once.
 In other cases they put their own life in danger and one of the best example could be what the Appolo 13 team has achieved.
 The fact of only doing things that are very wee known and established is always leading to the end of an era or a civilisation and everybody knows this and this is why the populations recognize easily their heros that are taking risks.
 We are used to say they take risk but in fact in many case they have nothing to loose or they dont even see the risk they are taking just because this is simply their own way of living.
