Being Bill Gates
 Success is an important thing for modern human and there are lots of description of success. But everyone wants to be successful in life, from a housewive to a scientist. In my opinion, successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they are already know how to do well, because there is new opportunities, chance to develop themselves and bigger success than traditional one in trying new things and taking risks.
 First of all, new ways always offer new opportunities to people. For example, in 1980s there is no computer industry; there is only special computers which are used in special centers such as NASA or FBI. But nowadays computers are everywhere, in our pockets with our cellphones! A man, named Bill Gates, become the richest person in the world who took risk and made a new computer program which is called WINDOWS. Windows is an easy computer program for ordinary people to use the computer in daily life and it was a revolution for computers. 
 Secondly, trying new things gives person a chance develop himself. For making a new thing people must research and learn new things. Researching process can be so effective for learning and developing new things is also developing people's themselves. People think and see new thing which are not important for them before. 
 In addition, traditional ways give people traditional success. There is no chance for big and important success. But in taking risks there is tremendous success. In ordinary way makes ordinary job, no one remember your name at the end.
