Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they are already know how to do well. That is, the exploratory spirit of the human being make it easy to success in their common life.
 
 First, usually successful people attract more succesful people. For example, these people can know their new boss or their new employee by taking a cup of coffe with their friends. That is, this meeting provide them the opportunity to take the risk of a new job and this kind of people, not terrified by the fault, will take the chance to prove and normally, they are going to win, the people tell that they are lucky person. It is said that successful people meet succesful people, it is true that it provides them the opportunity of new challenges, but also, they take the chance. 
 
 Second, two important motors of human beings' behaviour are motivation and emotion. These people are really motivated to get new experiences, learnings and knowledge. And even, this behaviour make them pleasure by increasing some chemichal substances in their brain. For example, taking new risks, such as changing the location of living, taking a new job and meeting new colleagues are really activities that pleasure them. They are moved by their motivation and emotion in order to reach their goals and to become satisfy with them and their environment.
 
 Finally,  I think that success in the life, that is, reach their goals, to be satisfy with theirselves can be got by trying new things and taking new risks. These actions enlarge a person knowledge and information increases the critical perception of the world.
