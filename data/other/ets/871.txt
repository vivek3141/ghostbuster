I disagree with the statement that "In 20 years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.". Because the main reason for the idea of non-existence of the cars is due to the non-availability of the fuel that makes the car run i.e; petrol or diesel in next 20 years,but the cars can be ,made to run with other sources like electricity or some of the non-conventional sources of energy like solar or wind energy.
 As we all know that the petroleum and its products would be exausted within two or three decades,but how would the people move,transportation of necessity goods would occur without cars.So there should be an alternative to be found which is nothing but the non-conventional sources like solar energy or wind energy.
 Presently,the scientists are researching in finding an alternative based on two aspects;one is which does not pollute the environment and the other is how we can use the present non-conventional resources available with us now and to its best.
 As the population of the world is growing rapidly day by day,there will be a great necessity of cars i.e; transport.I think for the population to sustain,grow,develop it is necesssary to have the basic amenities like food,water and clothing which has to be transported to the regions which don't have these amenities.
 Also,according to the recent surveys,the luxury,fashion and cost of living is growing in all the countries.The presence of car shows the richness of the people and the secure travel they can make.So it is necessary that  cars are essential.As the population is growing,there is and will be a growing demand of cars even after 20 years from now.
 Also if some says that "How in the age of aeroplanes and jets,cars are used in future ?".The answer is that we cannot use the flying machines to all the places and if the place is too near means how would the people use the aeroplane or something.
 hence the statement "In twenty years ther will be fewer cars in use than there are today." is false.
