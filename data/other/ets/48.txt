If someone asked you, "What would life be like today if we did not have technology?" Would you be able to answer it? Computers, cellular phones, television, and iPods are all examples of success in technology the people have made today. They have all become a part of our lives, and it would be difficult to live without them. Thanks to the inventers who invented them, we know the lives that we are spending today.
 Although some people never succeed in something no matter how much they try, people who do succeed in something, are always working hard in it. They have imagination as well as curiousity. Without imagination, people would never be able to think of something new. One could always fail, but failing opens up a new path to success.
 I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. For example, one of the presidents of the United States of America, Abraham Lincoln, is one of the successful people who took risks, but tries to things.
 Abraham Lincoln lead the North union of the US during the Civil War. He believed in himself that slavery was wrong and fought with the South. He later became president and officially made slavery illegal. Back in his time, most of the US citizens of the South were against him because they lost there servants and workers. However presently, Lincoln is considered one of the most important leaders in world history. He risked his own life and future to stop slavery, and by making a step towards complete equality of men, such as colored people and non-colored people.
 Those who succeed are always imaginative, hard workers, and take risks. They do not fear mistakes and always believe in what they are doing. People who fail to do so, are the people who will not reach their goal. Experience many things, and make a new discovery! It could change your future.
