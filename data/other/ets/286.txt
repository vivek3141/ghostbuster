I think is good if you can have knowledge of many subjects, but today, if you want to be effective and competitive, you should specialize in one specific subject. The problem is the following: nowaday the knowledge has been increased a lot and this proccess go on. In example, the natural science is increasing the knowledge day to day and there are a lot of information about complicated proccess as DNA replication that years ago did not seem possible to discover easily. On the other hand, the specific knowledge has a great problem. When a person is more especific can lose capacity to analize minor problems. It is probably that the people with specific knoledge would try explain all the problem under their vision. In example, a doctor who work with pshycology, probably he would try to explain a lot of cases trougth the pshycology. 
 
 Therefore, I think that the best position is support the two types of knowledge. The government should care that people in their countries have the opportunity  to choose both things and the governments could manage how many people take place in one or another possibility trougth policies and fellowships for students. The final objective is that the country will have proffessional people in both areas and each area will have their function. In that case, the specific area provide knowledge to general areas when this need it. In example, a group of researchs discover a new medicine and they should give the medicine to doctors who works with the patients. 
 
 In conclusion, both types of knowledge (general and specific) are neccessaries to support the science advance (the increase of the knowledge) and the normal life (the solution to the common problems).
