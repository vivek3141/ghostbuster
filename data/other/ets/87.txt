I agree with this  that young people nowadays do not have enough time to help  their communities . 
 I  agree with this because  nowadays people are becoming or doing their work like machines to earn lots of money to enjoy later . they are not bothering about the communitie they are living around them. they doing as they like after  passing through some age.
 I have a friend who is doing her job in MNC'S .Nowadays she is earning a lot of money in the job. & now she is suffering with lonelyness & she thinkking about something bad. Getting enough money makes pople like in the better way,peacefully.
 we should have enough time to help others also i.e; in the society there will the" poor& the rich, good & the bad". we should transform some money  to trusts  that will  help the people . helping may not be financial it may be physically also. doing help physically helps the people more energitic in their daily life. we should enjoy the life but  it should be of some extend only.
 Throwing lots of money in the pubs & restraunts  is not a good habit . It may spoil the health also. spearing sometime with the destitutes knowing their problems  is agood habit . We mat noy solve them but  we have chance of making them happy. the problems are get ridden by telling them to any body by the side of us.
 Communitie means " Group ". It is not a single thing or single person .Helping a person in a scocitey  means  helping the world to build. Mother teresa  should be the role model to all he young people today.an intimation strats from one person but  we should join the hands  or take participation the in that field. like our freedom fight Gandiji  started  the  revoulution then amny of our Indians  joined there hands in that.  
 
 I conclude  this by giving an encourgement to the young people  to take part in the communitie.
