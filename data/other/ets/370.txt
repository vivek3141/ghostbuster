Helping our community.I think it's true that young people nowadays  aren't willing to help their relatives and friends as much as they did decades ago.But i also think that this is a phenomenon appearing strongest in the 'developed western civilisation'.For us times change rapidly,everything grows faster,moves faster,people travel a lot and the world itself becomes 'smaller'.I mean you have the chance to study in Europe,work in China and buy a holiday cottage in Mexico so i think our way of living tends to go into a more 'selfish' way.
 Family and community is a strong background that everyone needs but i think it's not the first thing you think about in our times if you start living on your own.You live on your own so you care about yourself first that's our way of living i think.
 Years or decades ago people settled down and founded a family,helped their parents keeping the business and traditions alive and so the connection to the people surrounding them was more evident.
 But as mentioned,in my opinion,i think this is more a cultural thing,people,especially younger people in a third world country for example still have that close connection to their relatives and communites as it's necessary.They are more or less their parents' life insurance that you pay here from your own money,so i think that's one more reason that people nowadays are more focused on themselves.
 All in all even me as one of those young persons nowadays still feel that there's enough time to help my community.Maybe it's based on different reasons than years ago but i try to help my people whenever it is necessary in all aspects of life and i also like to receive support from my community myself.
