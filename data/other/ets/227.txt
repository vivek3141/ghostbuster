Acc. to me a student should focus more on ideas and concepts than on learning concepts because if he will know the idea & concepts he will be able to apply his learnings in his practical & normal life rather focussing on facts . By knoowing the idea & concepts , he can check & approve the practality of a learning . But in the case of facts he has to follow them blindly like a theoritical essay . Also by knowing the ideas ,he can use them formaking basics of other related subjects & can continue to researchs on the basis of concepts & make his own learned facts .But in case of facts , he wont be able to go out his bounded area of learned fact & continue to follow on the same & wont be able to explore & prove his facts . This will kill a student's curiousity & he will become a follower not a leader . there wont be any pace in his life .He will continue to work on same old facts. But by knowing the ideas & concepts , he can come close to the practacility of a topic &it will become a learning for his life.These ideas & concepts broaden the mind of a student to think & develope more but in case of facts , these narrowed the emrging thinking of a learning student. by learning ideas & concepts, he can lead them to a certified notion by producing practical results but in case of facts ,he will not be boter to work any more on that because it will be a so called proff to him . So focus on idaes 7 CONCE
