yes, I agree that young people do not give enough time for healping communities they remain envolved in other activities such as sports.children should take part in development of communities as they are future of our country .if community would develop our country wiil also develop then only people could get some work and we would be able to compare our country with developed countries.we should keep our sourrounding cleen in order to help our communities. it is true saying by some one that ''child is a father of an old man'' if children would help communitis from now in future it would be beneficial for them only.if there socities are well mantained and free from all kind of pollution all humanbeings living around them will remain healthy.As all of us know that cleaniness is very important.cleaness safe time as well as money because if know one is in bad health no doctor or medical fees would be paid.So if achild remain fits he can engoy his life so its important for achild to help his or her communities.
