Some people think that  it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide, because they can get more imformation from a tour guide and also they can make some friend through the tour.However I do not agree with this idea for these reasons.
 First of all, I like to prepar the travel schedual by my selfe before the trip such as I would like to go this restaurant, visit this museam, buy this shop, and so on. Without a tour guide I can get a lot of imfomation from Internet befor I go to a trip.
 Second  of all,  I can decide how many time I should spend in the place.If I find the really really good place,I  will decide to spend a lot of time to be there. On the other hand,If I go to a trip in a group led by a tour guide,because it has already dicided how many time I spend where I go,so I shoud leave the place within the time. I can not stand!! I would like to enjoy my trip!So I really think  people who want to spend great time in the trip,they should go a trip which they made schedual themselves. 
 Third of all, it is my challenging time to speak local people where I go to the first place. I like to comunicate with foreing country people. 
 If I go to  a country which is spoken English such as the United state,Canada, the UK and so on, I can develop my English through the experiment.On the other hands, If I go to a travel with a tour guide
 I think I will depend on him because he always appear beside myself!
 For these reasons,I can not agree with the statement,the best way to travel is in a group
