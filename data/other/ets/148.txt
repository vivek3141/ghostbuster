Environment protection has been a big political matter during the last decades. There were times when laws were enforced to reduce pollution such as the waste from cars. But the Kyoto protocol, which a lot of counties all over the world signed and agreed to, is not taken so much care of anymore. All the same, people are starting to realize about the necessity for pollution reduction. This has to do with the signs of our nature that we encounter nowadays. Glaciars are melting, the climate is getting warmer, the ozone in the atmosphere is shrinking, the forests are dying. Everyone knows that it is proved, that all of that has to do with how we treat the environment. So the connection to the number of cars is obvious. Since cars produce a lot of pollution, they need to be reduced in number. 
 
 Not just the awareness of the people will help though. Cars are expensive, so the finacial aspect of having a car could be an important matter too in 20 years. From what I know, a lot of towns in Switzerland are thinking about charging the carkeepers to drive into the town in order to prevent traffic jams. Furthermore, the parking spaces are gonna get more expensive since the space is limited. This is not going to change in the future at all since the population in a lot of countries is increasing. 
 
 Another aspect is the improvement of the public transport systems. In Switzerland, there is a fantastic system. Trains and buses are almost never late and there are very few areas that can't be reached with public transport. I am aware that this is not the same in every country but if people fear that a lot of jobs will be gone if people don't buy cars anymore, they have to see, that on the other hand, improving the public transport is going to create a lot of work too.
 
 In conclusion, I think that there will be fewer cars around in 20 years. I belive in it, that people will take their responsibility to protect our planet for the next generations to live on.
