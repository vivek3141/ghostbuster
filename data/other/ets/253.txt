We don't have the day that we don't look at any advertisements in our daily life. There are so many advertisements such as TV commercials, plates or posters on the street, and so on. And now nobody would like to watch a boring and less interesting ad. It causes the market for advertisments severely and unfaithfully. In this situation, I agree that almost all of the advertisements help merchandise look better because the product companies have to and sell huge amount of goods and advertisement companies must make a wonderful ad to compete thier rivals. 
 First of all, Company has to sell its products and get profits as muh as possible, otherwise it might be bunkrupt in the future because of a small change. It is clear and crucial for any companies, so every companies tries to improve thier products even if it is only advertisement.
 In addition, there are severe competition between ad companies. It makes the company to produce good-looking commercials. Now good and interesting view of product is very important for buyer to stop looking at them. Hence, these company are trying to make better one than it really is. 
 In conclusion, I strongly think merchandises must promote well. In my opinion, I also think this hard market produce a lot of lies. Therefore, the position of costomer servise became extremely important part of the company in a dacade.
