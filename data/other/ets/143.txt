I think against the statemente that young people enjoy life more than older people. To tell you the truth, my oppinion is just the oppsosite for the reasons which follows.
 First, because older people have more money than young people in general, they can some activities that yougng people cannot do. They earn money as official of the government, emplyee of  companies or some else while young people go to school and pay tuition. They can do somethig funny by using this money.  Let me show an example. Older people can dine at famous restraunt or go lugujury trip that is what young people admire but cannot attain for economic problem.
 Second, older people feel more on the same thing than young people, because they have more experiences. Let me talk about my personal experiences, several years ago I made a trip to Rome with my aunt and see some sightseeing spot. When we go to some place, my aunt suddenly burst to tears and talk me about romance she made with her ex-lover in Rome. She surely enjoyed the tirp more than me thanks to this romance.
 Certaily, there are somethings that are said to be enjoyed by young people. For example, love. Of course, love we made in our youth is sweet and precious momory for all of us. But who decide older people cannnot make love? Older people can make sweet love in the same way as young people do, and get wonderful memories. Besides that woule be more enjoyable for their experience as I showed in the third paragraph.
 For the reasons above, I think older people can enjoy life more than young people. They can do something young people cannot do thanks to better economic situation, feel more owing to their affluent experiences and do the thing that is usualy said as if the privilage for youth sach as love.
