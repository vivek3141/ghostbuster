In my opinion, travel in group with a tour guide is not a good way of travelling.
 
 Duo to you have to schedule your time at the time that  tour guide told you. And if you want to do others activities you just cant, because you have to go to the specific parts that were assignated for you since you choose to travel with a tour guide.
 
 In one hand, you cant go to visit places that you are more interested to go, in first place because you are travelling with a group of people and have to be togheter all the time. therefore you cannot live them and go to somehere else.
 
 Sometimes, it happens that you are looking something good for you in a store while you are walking round there, and you really want to buy it, but the problem is that you will not make any stop there with your travel group, so you have to leave, because the tour guide have rush on time, and he is hurring you, so you dont have the chance even to go through the store and see if the stuff isnt good for you.
 
 As far as i am concerned, if you go on a travel with a group and led you by a tour guide, you always go up on the travel bus, and all that you can see is through the window, and sometimes you even cant see anything, because the bus going fast.
 
 On the other hand, you cant really know the real places you are visiting  for, because in my opinion the best way of visit a city is going by your own or with a group of friends that they likly to go with you and agreed to the thinks you wanna do during the trip.
 
 In conclusion, it is possible that you can travel with a tour guide, but only if you are not interested in the city your are visiting, or if you are in a hurry and you just want to see the most relevant places you are interested.
