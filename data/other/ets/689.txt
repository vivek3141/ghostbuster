I would like to travel in a group led by tour guide, because this way makes my trip better.
 Actually, there are negative aspects in a group trip. For examle, it reduces my own free time. If I travel in a group, I have to pay attension to other people so even when I want to buy suvenior taking a long time, I cannot do this.
 However there are more good aspects in a group trip. Last year, I went to Australia in a group. As it was my first trip to go abroad, I felt a little nurvous at the first time but gradually we began to talk each other and my nurvousness was removed. More, during the trip, I lost my wallet, but people who travel with me looked for my wallet together. At that time, I was very moved. Moreover, a tour guide taught me a lot of things about Australia. Before I traveled in Australia, I know few things about Australia, but thanks to a toue guide, I learn a lot of things about Australia, for instance, the history of Australia and aboliginy. When I was a junior high school student, I read a book whose main locaion is Australlia and the man in the book climbs the ululu, so I wanted to climb there. However a tour guide told me that ululu is the speciall place for aboliginy and they do not want us to climb. I did not know such a thing.
 That is why, thanks to a trip in a group and tour guid, I had a very good time during my trip, so I agree with the statement that the best way to travel in a group led by tour guide.
