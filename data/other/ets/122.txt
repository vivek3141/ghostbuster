A major feature in which we, the youth, differ from our predecessors, is in the amount of time we use in order to help our communities, which in some cases is none. Multiple reasons are alleged, some say they lack of time whereas others accept they are to selfish to help others without a vested interest.
 
 It is true that nowadays young people are always rushing to and fro, since due to the competitive world we live in, we have really tight schedules. In addition to this, if you bear in mind a youth cannot afford most of the times to live close to our workplaces, you have to count with the commuting times. For example I leave home at eight o`clock each morning and don`t come back until eleven in the night.
 
 Sometimes it is not only a matter of time but of upbringing. If a person hasn`t been taught to be generous, you can`t expect from him or her to share his or her time for a certain task, eventhough when he or she understands it would benefit his or her community. It is a fact that moral values are decreasing and that a solution has to be found. I am perfectly aware of how difficult is to handle this problem, since my 15-year-old brother has plenty of time and although both me and my parents keep constantly encouraging him to do something for others, it has really no effect.
 
 Fortunately, there is people whose work is mainly focused on providing those types of services to the community, but this shouldn`t deter us from trying to improve ourselves, that`s it, to reschedule or find a bit of time during the weekend and to bear in mind that the next generation will behave accordingly to what we teach them.
