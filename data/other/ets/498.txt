They say that those who win write history. However, it does not mean those who lose were not part of it. Taking risks is a double-edged sword, depending on the ability of the samurai. A saying like this would drive a person to take unnecesary risks, without giving them fair warning that taking risks is serious business.
 
 Back in my Junior year business class, we talked about the Risk-Return curve; which basically stated that the greater the risk, the greater the return. Succesfull people who have taken great risks and in turn earned great return from it, can get away with rolling that statement around. It is a different tune for those who took the risk to high, and did not recieve a return.
 
 Doing the same thing, is not entirley as bad as the statement makes it seem. Sure, taking a risk once in a while is good, but perseverance and constance are also traits succesfull people posses. It gives those who depend on you a sense of security and stability, which is benefitial for any business.
 
 A healthy balance between taking and not taking risks is, in my opinion, a healthy adivse. More than anything, knowing which risks to take. Being wise comes with experience, the same way the ability comes to the samurai wielding the double-edge sword. Experience is aquired with patience, but also with a keen eye and an ambitious mind set to succeed. One must know when and where, but most importantly, why.
 
 In conclusion, yes, succesfull people take risks. But risks taken after deep analysis and gained experience. Knowing when to attack, when to defend, and when to fortfeit is what makes a person succesful; It is what guarantees the samurai's victory.
