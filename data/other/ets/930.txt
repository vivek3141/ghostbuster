I don't think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. It can be very convenient, of course: for example you don't have to think about anything (for instance car hiring, hotels, restaurants, museum tickets...); you simply sit down in the bus and enjoy the trip. Furthermore, the guide is supposed to know everything about the places you visit and so she (or he) can tell you interesting stories about, as well.
 At the same time, though, travelling in a group led by a guide has a lot of disadvantages that, according to me, are not worthy.
 First of all, you have to respect a strict and not flexible timetable; you can't choose what you want to visit or where you want to eat, for example. Usually during tours there are thousands of things to do (and some of them pretty awkward) so you don't have enough time to enjoy the places you see along the way; in many cases you have just the time to get off the bus, take a picture and go back to the bus again.
 Then, having to follow this strict plan, you can't ask to stop when you see something you think is really nice, even to take a picture. And, above all, you can stop to go to the toilet just when the plan tells that you are allowed to!
 Sometimes you are obliged to do things you don't like, as well. For example climbing a mountain even if you are afraid of it or sleeping in a camping where there is no water at all, except for a river in which "friendly" crocodiles live.
 Last, but not least, you never know people you will travel with: if you are lucky they will be very nice and you could go on with them quite well. On the contrary, if you are not lucky, you could have to stand for some days (or a couple of weeks, that is even worst) the company of a group of people that you really dislike, very different from you, sometimes very boring, sometimes too excited.
 All these things considered, together with my personal experience,  make me prefer a journey by myself or with some very reliable friends.
