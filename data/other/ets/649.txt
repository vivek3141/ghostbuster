If you ask me if advertisements make products much better that they really are, my answer will surely be positive.
 In my opinion there are a lot of reasons to support this fact. These reasons have a feature in common: that advertisement are always based on deceit.
 First, when you see one product on tv, you see not the real product, but only a "visual manipulation" of it. It will always seem bigger, brighter, better than what it really is. 
 In order to explain this, are you really sure that the famous Big Mac is really as "big" as it seems? I don't think so. 
 So, before you chose to buy a product, go and see it in reality. Most of the time, it will be a delusion.
 Another point is the fact that, during an advertisement, there are a lot of "distracters". In other words: it is not the product itself what is important, but what is around it. For instance: haven' t you noticed that, in a lot of advertisement, there are a lot of beautiful girls or men? What is the connection between a product to paint gates and a young pretty girl?
 So, the advertisement remains in our mind not because of the product, but because of "other" factors.
 The last point is that advertisements play on our imagination: we don't buy the product for what it really is, but only for what we believe it is. This "imagination factor" is created by a combination of the previous mechanisms, and yet others, that gain their strenght upon other, even unconscious, weaknesses.
 So the bottom line is, never trust the advertisements, because they will always play tricks on you.
