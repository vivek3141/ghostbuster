I believe that both my grand mother and I enjoy our own life and fell happy through such daily days. In my situation, I think that my way to enjoy is quite defferent with  my grand mather. Therfore I mean that there is a big defference point to enjoy of life between young people and older people. However personally,I agree with this atatement.
 Firstly, when we go outside, especially downtown, there are more things which young people enjoy with, such as amusement parks and shops  that of older people.  Therefore they can enjoy their free time more easily older prople can .
 Secondly, because generelly young people are active and out going. Therefore they have more oppotunity to meet a lot of people. through  these meetings, someone can have make a good friends,  the other can  find soul mate in rest of your life. I think  these oppotunities make our life more fun and exciting. 
 Thirdly,  many young people have specific dream in their furture, such as  what they want be or what they want to in the future,and they must work hard for it. thats completely great thing. For example, a friends of mune are now studing so hard to be Japanese teacher. Although ,of course,she sometimes feel negative or stressfull for her hardships she always sparkling. I xan feel that she is enjoying her life very much and satisfied.
 In conclusion, I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do, because of these reasons. However, I think that the older people should enjoy their life as muchas they can, and many of them do already. I hope that we can enjoy whole of our life regardress our age.
