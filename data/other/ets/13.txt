There are certain considerations which everyone takes into account to answer this issue. People may think about how useful is a car for themself, does it make my life easier and if he or she can imagie to live without a car. The most of the people would more or less think that the values above are important to them. When someone asks his\herserf the question: " Do you think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today?" The answer depends on a lot of factors such as his own experiences he had with cars in the past.
 After stating that everyones opinion can differ about this, I am confirmed that the amount of cars which will be used in 20 years will increase.
 
 I guess it is a broad accepted agreement that cars makes life easier. They can take you to far away laying places in a pretty luxurey way. And the way of traveling must be convenient for the humans. Futhermore, you konw, it is a fact that the amount of cars still become bigger. A lot of people can't imagine a life without a car, I assess that they depend on the existence of cars. For exaple, today I came from Stuttgart to Heidelberg to take part at the TOEFL. And if I hadn't taken the car, I would have spend lwice the time in a bus or on the train. Ok I agree that this is a question of luxury. But don't want to miss it.
 
 As an engineer I think that we are able to find a new method to get the cars not as harmful as they still are, for nature and for our nature. You know I mean the smoke which is caused if you take a car. And if the gazoline or oil becomes less, I gess, we will find a solution.
 
 The last thing which came up into my mind is, that germany has a great automotive comanies which are interested in selling cars.
