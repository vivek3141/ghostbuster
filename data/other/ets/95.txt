Bettering ourselevs is inevitable thing for our living.  We usually major in expartize in college and also can get a job by using specific subjects. However, I agree wiht this statement for some reasons.
 
 First of all, many kinds of knoledges give us meaningful life time  and the abilities to get along with others because we often face on situations that we can not expect. For example, when people suffered from illness, and you face on such circumstance,  if you have knowledge regarding illness although your major is not related with illness, you can save his life.  Such matter is sirious issue so we can save them as soon as possible.
 
 Secondly, whenever we study something including expertizes, we should know other subjects. For example, when you study law, we have to kow the situation of society, economic situations, political situations and so on because such things affect law a lot.  Considering situations of societies, sometimes we have no choice but to change content of law. With out considreing such things, we can not make rules like law.
 
 Thirdly, broad knowledge affects characters of people. For example, to better yourself, you have to listen or read many kinds of opinions. Of course, it is important to have your own opinion but  we should consider various opinions to make yourself better. Having broad knoledge is the same as having many kinds of opinions.
 
 In conclusion, I agree with this statement. As above, having broad knoweldge gives us many advantages. In additon to that, it is said that information is increasing because technologies are developing. Therefore, we have to have the abilities to distinguish whether or not the information is correct. At that time, if you have broad knowledge, you can feel easy. What is more, it become more belieavable. We always brush up ourselves so we try to acquire not only specific subject but also broad knowledge.
