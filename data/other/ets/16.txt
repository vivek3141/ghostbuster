i am agree with this statement. indeed, to be successful, it is important to be creative,  try new things and take risks. i think that it is very important to do a lot of thing that we don't already know, because if we already do what we hnow, we cannot carry on in the life. 
 
 To illustrate my point of view, i would like to use several examples.
 In the professional work, it is important to try new things and take risks to be successful and not to do only what we already know. if someone wants to create his own entreprise or create a new concept, it is important that he has quality that other people doesn't have. Why not open a new company creating an innovative and concequently a new product. At the beginning, it is sure it will be hard, but if we never try new things we cannot know.
 
 I think that so many people are scare about new thing and prefer doing something known. For example, before the ipod or Mp3 players, everybody listened music thanks to a walkwan. Ererybody was happy and liked it.  But one day, a man decided to create something new, with another concept and it was a very good idea. We know that today Apple is very successful, many young use apple's products and the creator is very rich. Why? Just because he tried something new and he took risks.
 
 I think it is the same thing in all the domain. At work, a director prefer a employee who try new thing and take risks than an employee who already do the same thing, something already know how to do well. To my mind, the first one will have more  chances to sucess, and a better evolution carreer.
 
 To finish, even in the artistic world this statement is confirm. Indeed, at the beginning, a singer is not known, but taken risks ans trying to sing, he can become successful, even if at the base it is not his job but more a passion, an hobby.
