Understanding Ideas Versus Learning Facts
 
 
 Last week I attended a class in history, and the teacher began talking about the arab history and speaking what had happened during these ages reaching the twenteenth century. Then I had a Physics class and the teacher was explaining the lesson. But this time the teacher was trying to make us understand the concept and how things work. The next day I remembered all what we took in Physics but non in history. And that is why teachers nowadays tend to teach their students by making them understand the concept.
 
 Teaches believe due to previous experience, that the knowlege get stuck in the student's head by trying to make him understand the idea and not just telling him some facts. It is better this way since the student will be able to understand the idea first then  apply this concept from what he understood. But if he just learned the fact without understanding it he won't be able to apply what he studied, and thus it won't get stuck in his memory.
 
 In addition to that if the student understood the topic he might enjoy it and try to expess his idea and ever participate and that is what motivate him to know that concept and never forget it. Where as if you just told him to study certain fact he wouldn't be interested and might not focus on the subject, and thus he might not memorise it and then he will forget it. Since with repetiton and understanding the student will know the concept without even studying since the moment he understood the idea it got stuck in his memory. And that is what happened to me.
 
 So it is much better for student to understand the idea and the concept rather than learning facts which might look kind of booring to the student.And these days students  tend not to study and memorise but they rather understant, which will enable them to study it much easier.
