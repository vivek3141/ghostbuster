There are diffferent types of people and different life styles in the world. Answering such a quastion of ``do young people enjoy life more than older people`` is therefore very hard. I personally agree this claim because of young people`s physical  and mental advantages, time of young people live provide more entertainment.
 
 
 Firstly, because of the effects of passed years all humans become old and their physical atributes fell down, for example they can not run as fast as they can before, they need more time to sleep any way they can not do what they want. their body does not let old people to do what they want. On the other hand young people have more energy, they are stronger and they can spent more time to enjoy themselves. For the reason older people lived their younger time more enjoyable their wish to enjoy themselves, become less important. Because they did these actions before and they are full of experience, the do not need to revise these action.  On contrary, young people have more interest on enjoyable actions for their life , they want to try,  they want to know consequences and they want to taste all pieces of life.
 
 In addition , by the time and improved technology, more entertaining enjoyable conditions are provided to the new generation. they have an option of internet , rapid transportation oppotunities to be with people they enjoy  besides  more complexes such as; sporting areas , cinemas , theathers provide young people more places to spent their time enjoyable. However , these opppotunities were not chances of older people. Because they enjoyed their life with limited ways
 
 to sum up, younger people enjoy life more than older people because of two reasons that they have better physical and mental ability accordong to older people , also  more opportunities  provided to them to enjoy themselves.
