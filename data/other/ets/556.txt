Understanding is the most important way of learning
 
 I would say that understanding the ideas and concepts is more important for students than to learn facts.
 In maths, understanding the ideas and concepts is the only way of passing a test successfully, because there are only a few facts that could be learned. You have to now how to add 2 to 2 in order to get the right solution. Because only knowing the solution to be 4 does not help you with adding 145 to 589.
 
 Another example is an interpretation of a text.
 The student  has to know how to do the task. He has to analyse the text concerning rhetorical devices and theories of communication in order to get a good mark. The knowledge of an metaphora in a special line does not help him to compare it to the epoch or characteristics of the protagonist.
 
 In general, facts concern a special problem or situation, like in history. One example for a fact is the existing of a monarchy in Germanz until the 20th century. But the concept of a former German monarchy is similar to a former French one. Only when you know what ideas and concepts are about you are able to compare them to another similar situation or use them on another subject. And usually the knowledge of development and their reason are more important than the dates alone.
 
 When scientists are searching for a problem, they compare the aspects they know to the facts they discover, but to understand how a process works, thez need ideas and concepts.
 
 Despite the fact that students must learn concepts and ideas to succeed in tests, they should not neglect facts, as well.
 Every thesis needs a backround of facts, which prove that the ideas ans concepts are correct and useful.
 To summerize the idea I have to state  that the understanding of the ideas and facts is more important than the knowledge of facts. But any idea would exist without facts, so the second question in a test will be about specific examples.
