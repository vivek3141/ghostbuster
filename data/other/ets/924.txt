I disagree that statment that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for several reasons. 
 First, when we buy something in the store, we almost read the advertisement about that we are going to buy. Then we decide if we should buy or not. If the advertisement about that we are going to buy is good for us, we may buy that. Wether we buy something or not is depends on advertisement, so they should not tell a lie.
 Second, if advertisements use the information that seem much better than they really are, and consumers buy and use that stuff, it can be harmful for consumers. For example, if advertisements say that this meal doesn't include fat at all although it really include much fat, those who buy that and have regurally can get fat. It is not good for health.
 Finally, if most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are, consumers can't believe them and buy anything. It is serious problem. For human can live safety and confortable, advertisements should be honest, I think. 
 For these reasons, I think most advertisements should not make produsts seem much better than they really are.
