One statement I will support for sure is the following "most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are". In this essay I will try to demontrate my opinion using specifics reasons and  differents examples. 
 
 The mean objective of adverstisement is the purchase of the product by the consumer.Almost everything is allowed to make the product appears better than it really is .This is one objective of advertising .
 So obviously when you discover the product you might be a little bit desappointed .For example,almost everyone has been desappointed by one product that appears to have incredible properties on TV  . I remember having been desappointed with a christmas gist because the toy I saw on the TV was not the same as the one I received but actually but it was the same but was not that fantastic as the TV said.
 
 Another striking example is advertisement for candy and chocolate bar ,in the advertisement they say that it is  good products made with natural ingredients ,but what they do not say is that it is bad for health to eat such junk food. 
 
 Almost all advertisement do not state the bad side resulting  in the consumtion of the product ,or try to exagerrate the good properties of a product for instance a product might appears bigger in the advertisement or more shiny . 
 
 As a results with the help of all these examples I support the opinion that most advertisements  make products seem much better than they really are.
