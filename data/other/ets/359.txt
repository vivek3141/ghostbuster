According to the statement, the number of cars in use will decrease in the next twenty years. Three reasons for that decrease can be stated.
 
 First of all, it is stated that most of the people in France live in or nearby big cities, and work everyday in the city. These people choose to go to work by car. Because the traffic is very high every morning and every evenig, some of them start to be fed up with their car and think of other possibilities to go to work, such as using the metro or even biking. 
 
 Additionaly, the government insists on the necessity to decrease pollution. Since the car is the most polluting travel means, the government encourages people not to use it by widening the opening time of the metro. Indeed, many people use their cars because the metro closes at midnight, and they are conseauently  not able to come back home without using a taxi after that time. Because taxis are too expensive, they prefer to use their car. This decision will convince people not to use their car anymore.
 
 Finally, another reason why people will not use their cars as much as they used to is that the average age of the population is increasing. In twenty years from now, most baby-boomers will not be able to drive a car anymore. This will consequently reduce the number of drivers and the number of cars in use will decrease. 
 
 As a conclusion, it is obvious that people will still need their cars, to travel for example. However, many efforts are made by the government and the people to decrease the pollution level, and the easiest way to do so is to reduce the use of cars. It seems to me that, in twenty years, fewer cars will be in use than there are today.
