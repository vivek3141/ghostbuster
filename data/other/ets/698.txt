Portrayed by enormus poets and artiests, life and the joys of life are so attracting as well as noble to everyone. Lives of young people are appriciated as being vigorous and vivid, while older people are admired for having wiser speculation and richer experiences in life. But who, after all, enjoy life better? In my point of view, young people tend to enjoy life more.
 
 First and foremost, curiosity is a rather important factor in the enjoyment of life. Young people, just like other young animals, possess enough curiosity to urge them exploring this world with discovering eyes and open hearts, which in turn rewards young people of an endless advanture of new archievements.
 
 Another reason, perhaps equally crucial, is the fact that young people always have more physical capability than older people do. Far too often can we see young people mastering all kinds of exciting sports and engage themselves with thrills. By contrast, what we can frequently hear from the older people is simply the complaints like, "If only I was 20 years younger." or "God bless my heart.".
 
 Of course, older people do have their own advantage in enjoying life. The aboundant experience accumulated along with life span enable them to taste life in a slower, yet maybe wiser pace. But also undeniable is the pitiful truth that they often don't have adequate energy and passion to keep up with the fast tempo of time. They will more probably take a rest from time to time and doze over where young people enjoy their precious youth with no reversion.
 
 "Old people have a glorious past after them, while young people have a brilliant future before them." This quote has addressed the problem in a neat and sentimental way. With far more planty time and novel futures ahead, young people will almost definitely enjoy life better.
