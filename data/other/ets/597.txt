Last summer, my wife and I were planning for our vacation, and after we selected the place where we wanted to go, she suggested that it's better to travel in a group, and I agreed on that, and added that it's best to have a group provided by a comprehensive plan for the trip, and a tour guide, since I consider this is the best way to travel, especially if I'm going to a place that I don't know .
 Travelling has many benefits, the most important of which is knowledge. By travelling to a certain contry or island that I don' t know anything about, I must come back with much information about it, otherwise my trip is useless. The best way to get information about the area which I want to travel to is to go in a group led by a tour guide, who will explain everything about the place: History, Value, Landmarks, and all the important details. I found the tour guide very useful in last summer when we (my wife and me) went to that Greek Island : Rhodes, which was like a museam in which we studied the Greek history. The amount of information we gained about that area of the world is so tremendous, and all that was because of that distinguished guide.
 In addition to the assistance for getting the important information obtained from the guide, he is a great help in every other aspect of the travelling, like dealing with the people in the "strange" place, directing us to the greatest places that we must visit, and all the other daily life matters that without him, it could form a big issue or problem.
 Finally, I consider the guide an essential element for a succesful trip, and he is indispensible for all the services that he can provide before, during, and even after the trip.
