Saying wether or not knowing many academic subjects superficially is better than specialize in one speficic area of competence is very hard.
 I can't give an immediate answer because there are advantages and  disadvanteges of both types of knowledge.
 People who have learned many academic subjects will be prepared more completely than those who specified in one single subject.
 But the knowledge of the former will be clearly more superficial and inaccurate in every field than the knoweldge of the latter  on the area of their competence.
 I would probably prefer having a broad knowledge of everything because it allows you to try different studies and  different jobs to test your ability and make your goals.
 Furthermore I think it is more interesting to know little of everthing, you finally know a lot of things that you could always want to know better later in your life. 
 In addition this type of knowledge permits you to understand ,. although superficially, different aspects of the world.
 On the other hand the person who knows one single subject and who excells in it  is oblyged to do that  thing all his life.Of course he can always improve his knowledge and find new goals to reach in the same field, like a researcher does,  but I think that not only it is more boring and less stimulating for our brain but it lessens one's possibilities to find a job in another work's field.
 Of course I have to admit that without people with a very specific knowledge in one field we wouldn't  have progress in sciences or new discoveries due to their patience and application in their subject.
 In conclusion I would say that it is  good  for a country to have people who grew up with both of these two different types of knowledge.
