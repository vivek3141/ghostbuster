I disagree to the statements that successfil people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.
 
 
 Firstly, in order to success, the analyzing the data and control the racio of wining is important. Now I am working at Bank as a foreign exchange trader, even professional, made the decision and scale the timing using the analyze of reading the charts, checking the orders and researching the economic data. Because foreign exchange market is unpredictable. I think it is the same thing apply to this theory.  In general,  unpredictable things often occers, sometime, people who has good luck might be survive from the happening but I strongly think those luck is not continue without their well background knowledge nor experience. Just trying new things without knowledge is just a risky.  
 
 Secondly, when I play tennis match. In those situation, I do not try new style of serve when I really want to win. Because the racio of I miss is very high.
 
 Thats why I strongly believe that people who are succeed in the world are based on their knowledge and their experience.
