I strongly support the statement .
 young people play life more than older people do ,because of these reasons.
 First of all ,young people havn't any probleme;for exemple when the sun arrive the young people go to play game.
 second of all,young people havn't some one to do ;for exemple the day when they havn't school ,young people prefer to sleep long time or to look at tilevision and over.
 also ,young people havn't a responsability;for exemple if they havn't  give the house propretor money heir mather or father wlould pay
 from him.
 In conclusion , older people cannot enjoy life like young people because they have  a big responsability to do.
