Products seem much better than they really are? In my opinion i agree. In this days the best seem product is the best seller. For me they are three reason of why these happens. Firts the price of the product. Second the way of the  owner  present the product to the society. Last but not least the quantity of money that the producer will spend on  make the product.
 
 
 	 Let's talk about price. The money is he one that move the world. In United States the most biggest society class is the middle one , that  means the worker class . Most of the population will be looking for the cheap product. The advertisements make look the product good and if the price is good  people will buy the product.
 
 The fist impresion of the product, is waht we first look at. The promotion is very important, if the advertisements convince the person thatthe product is good they  will buy it. Also people do not  have to much time to look the diference between of the products and if in the promotions say's that is the best seller  you will buy it without notice that dosen't means that is the best one.  
 
 The company cost for make the productis the most important thing fot them. Alot of company's preffer to safe money, than sale to the people a good product. A good example of that are the food, natural food is better but  j artificialy flavor is most cheap, so flavor maybe it will be better but is not because is not natural.
 
 
 In  conclution produces will be make them products seems better than other because is market competition. My advise is to always look the contain of the products if is foot, medicines or any supplemets. If is a traportation like cars, equipment, etc ; look the material of what are compose that will help you to know wich one is better. Mos importan look for seconds opinios or compare products so you by your own self determinate wich one is better fro you.
