This is a controversial issue about whether we should be general talents or specific talents.Depending on personal expericence,life style and personality,some people will tend to have broad knowledge,while others are pursuing to be the talents who just specialize in one specific subject.The choice,nevertheless,is not easy to make.But in my part,I will definitely choose having broad knowledge of many academic subjects.My reasons are listed as follows.
 First of all,broad knowledge just fits the trend of "knowledge age".As we all know,nowadays knowledge is accumulated by multiply but not simply add up.Thus it is a urgent need for us to have the broad knowlege to cover most of the academic fields so that it can equip us to face the knowledge age.A good point in this is nowadays,the painter or singer who only specialize in one subject often doesn't earn as much as the merchant,who always just knows some easy principles of economics but at the same time, master a broad knowlege of many different academic subjects so that they can act as a medium towards two different fields.
 Secondly,broad knowlege can also enlarge your interest and help you find your true passion. Our choices towards be  specific talents or general talents are the same as whether to live in one country or many countries during your lifetime.Evidently,having experience towards several countrys can help you overcome coulture shock and eventually let you understand your own country deeper.And what's more, you can compare the merits and drawback of the different countries and finnally find what you like.And the way goes the same if you choose to be a general talents.
 Last but not the least,lift should be full of varieties and colourful.Don't you think you just focus on one specific subject in your entire life is somewhat boring and monotonous?Life is short but it can also be meaningful and interesting,because there're so many choices offering us and let us think which one or several of them may be our true passion.In addtion,the process of choosing several academic subjects is also interesting.
 Admittedly,just specialize in one specific subject has its own merits.For instance,it can help us to understand certain thing much more deeper than the others.However,owning to having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can fits the trend of "knowledge age",fine our true enthusiasm and add colour to our life,I strongly commit to the notion that its is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.
