I very much agree to the fact that young people enjoy life more than older people do. The fact that they are energetic supports the previous statement. Biologically speaking,  the metabolic rates in the older people are very slow and thus will be left with very less energy to work with. As the immune system goes weaker and weaker, it becomes difficult for the older people to be active.
 In contrast, the younger ones are the most entertaining beings. With a very high metabolic rates the younger people have lot of energy to perform their functions. Its not that older people don't enjoy life but then, it is just a comparison. Sitting at a place is a kind of enjoyment for the older people as they suffer from all sorts of problems relating from limbs to heart. Such is not the case with the youngsters. They are always enthusiastic and energetic, always eager to be active in all the actions that are up. The functions and the parties attended, the sports played by the youngsters cannot be performed by the older ones as their age restricts them to do so. 
 Let us take an example of a grandfather and his grandson. The state of activeness that is seen in the grandson is by far, incomaparable to that of grandfather's. Equally true is the fact that the grandfather might have enjoyed in his childhood. But taking his age into consideration he is rather adviced to take rest and be under certain limits for the sake of his safety.  An older body cannot cope up with the high energy consuming activities unlike the youngerones. Not to be partial, older people have their own ways of enjoying life which might be difficult for the youngerones to follow.                        Nevertheless, it is the young people who can work upon the stress levels much elegantly than an older person. Although, older people do earn money, travel a lot it is the yougsters who make their way a step higher in all respects.True to the fact that younger people enjoy life more, they dont tend to force things like in the case of older people. That is the reason why many corporate companies have restricted their workers to continue beyond an age of 55 in most of the countries. Although it is very strictly followed in government offices, it holds strong enough in the private enterprises too. It is only in the safety of older ones that they are adviced to be little rusty.
