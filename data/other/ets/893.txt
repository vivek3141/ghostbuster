To predict the future has always been a difficult task or at least a task that requires either a great deal of imagination or a deep knowledge of science and of its actual developments. Therefore what I can do now is a simple hypothesis based on my personal experience and on what I read on the newspapers.
 Basically I think that the statement is correct and that it is very likely that in the future man will use less cars then nowadays. This is for several reasons.
 First, as the problem of air pollution will increase, new technologies will be discovered in order to make the problem less urgent and hopefully to solve it. I would therefore imagine that instead of cars others means of transportation could be used. For instance, small airplanes fueled by hydrogen.
 Second, the actual trend goes in the direction of reducing the time in doing things in general and in moving from a place to an other in particular. It is a common experience in the life of each of us the morning traffic jams in which we get stuck.
 Third, probably in the long run it will decrease the need to phisically moving in order to fullfill ceirtain tasks. The movements will be in the 'virtual world' instead that in the real one. In other words, Internet, connecting people who live in different parts of a country, will dramatically decrease the need of transportation. In fact, it is something that it is already happening.
 Summarizing what I am trying to express, there are both reasons of health and pratical necessity that will lead to a situation of less cars and this will be made possible and affordable throught technology.
