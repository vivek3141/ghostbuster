Everyone wants to know about the world around him or her for the better understanding of different cultural back groundsand also to explore new things.This unquenchable desire of humanns not only lead him  travel to different places on the earth but also to other parts of the universe.In the fast moving era everything in the world is at constant change ,especially when it comes to time.Having proper Time table is the most valuble key for better life.So inorder to save my precious time i surely go to trip with tour guide.
 If we go to new place,its better if we have any local person who call tell us about the history of that place.Mostly locals know better than the scholars who did reaserch on that place.Because they will get all the information from their elders.Not only that the tour guide can also take visitors to different parts of the place from forests to rich green agricultural areas.In this way visitor can explore from wild animals to small beautiful local birds.
 Secondly,tour guide can show more places in less time.In other way it may take somuch time.I am saying this with my own experience.In my college days we visited a place called Delhi.First we started at one end of city then we went to other end to see one historical place.Then we remembered the fact that we forgot one most beautiful place which we supposed to see in the place where we started.Because of that we extended our vacation to one more day.This is not only waste of time but also money
 So it is always good  to go for trip with tour guide.In this way we can enjoy the trip with out doing much reaserch about place.If few people can share the expences in the process of hiring the tour guide this is also cost effective.
