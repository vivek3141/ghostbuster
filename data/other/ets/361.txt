I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks, because, I think, that's what makes them successful.
 
 Peolpe who remain doing things they already do for a long time get used to it. Developing routines gives security, but keeps your abilities on a certain level. After a certain amount of time you don't get better in what you're doing. I think, that's when successfull people decide to make a change. They realize there's no improvement and try something new. 
 My husband, for example, was working as an operator after his apprenticeship. He keeps telling that he earned good money those days. But he wasn't satisfied with what he was doing. Therefore he went back to school to become an engineer. Now he works as an engineer for 15 days and he's still very happy that he made that decision, because he finds the engineering work so much more interesting.
 
 Another point, stated in the statement, is that risk taking makes people successfull, too. In my opinion that is true, because starting something new implies to take risks. The risk can be to borough money, live somewhere else or even give up a job, like friends of us did. They both had good jobs in a big town in Germany. He was a manager and she worked as a doctor in a hospital. Although a lot of peolpe were admiring them leading such a life, the couple decided to quitt their jobs and move to the countryside. Everybody kept asking them, if they got mad. Their answer was, that they decided for their relationship. Obviously there must have been some problems, we didn't see. For some people this couple didn't look like being successfull, but I think, to be successfull doesn't have to have the meaning of earning a lot of money. Being successfull means to do what's best for you.
 
 In conclusion, successfull peolpe have learned to take care of their self-interest.
