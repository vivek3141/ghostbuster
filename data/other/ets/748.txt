Life could be enjoyed in different ways taking in consideration not only the age of the person, but also his interests, physical capacities and purchasing power.
 
 It is clear that young and older people usually do different kind of activities, but to set a value and compare the grade of joyness of each of them is not serious. A young person could be enjoying life as much as an older peson does, doing different things and knowing that if they change roles, they will be not enjoying at all.
 
 Young people usually believes that they enjoy life as much as anyone else. They are in their plenty physical conditions, they are willing to take risks or they usually do not have responsibilities such as a family to maintain or business to run. Nevertheless, they still have not enough experience and money to spend. For example, a young person could have the time to spend one month in Italy on vacations, meet a lot of women and have a lot of fun but he would live with a limit budget, perhaps working to eat and party.
 
 In the contrary, older people is commonly looked as persons who do not enjoy life at all. But those comments are wrong. Older people have experienced different situations, have visited many places, have married and usually have saved money. Hence, older people usually know exactly what they like and go for it. For example, an older person could travel to Italy on vacations, but just for one week to Venice, with his lovely wife to enjoy good food and wine and do sightseeing. 
 
 The point is that we cannot say that young people enjoy life more than older people do. A more serious way of thinking is to compare the grade of joyness that the same person had in his youth with the one he has in his older years. In that way we could have a more accurate answer, although I believe that life is enjoyable at any age, always.
