Some people think that lessand less cars  will be used in the future, while others belive that traffic is only going to get worse with time.
 Even if I would like the first thing to happen, I am not very optimistic about it, and I will now explain the main points that support my answer.
 
 First of all, I am afraid that if we take into account the entire world and not only the developed countries, we can see that in many regions having a car is still a luxury that not everybody can afford. But as these places get more and more advanced, cars will be introduced as they were in Europe and America a long time ago. As an example, when I was traveling throgh South America last year, I came across something that surorised me. Even in remote spots along the Amazon river, people managed to get cars or motorcycles, and this not only was a sign of their wealth, but also a means of living. But the main idea here is that only five years before that, there was not a single car in that area, and they said that each month the number of cars was  increasing really quickly.
 
 On the other hand, we could think that in twenty years there will not be enough petrol reserves in the world to keep up with the fast growing in the number of cars. Nevertheless, I am sure that alternative ways of power will be developed as soon as the act of obtaining and trading with petrol is no longer profitable enough.
 
 In a word, although I dream with a world with less pollution and traffic jams, I cannot deny the fact that, as it was said in a very famous movie or play,  "money makes the world go round". Therefore,  I am afraid that while having a vehicle helps a person to have a better life, no-one will exchange that for a better place to live in.
