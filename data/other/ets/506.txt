Many people think, young people have enjoyable lives and they think old people do not enjoy life as much as young people do.I agree with people who think like that.I have several valid reasons which support my idea.
 First of all, yaung people enjoy life more because, thay are full of energy and that cause them to do anything in any time.For instance, if a young person decides to do something hard, that person achieves that aim very easyly , but an old person can not does that thing easyly and it causes dissapointment and that disapointment makes old person unhappy.For me an unhappy life is equal to an unenjoyable life.
 Secondly, young people have lots of time and because of that, they do not have to be in a hurry to do something , but old people thinks they have several years to live so, they try to do lots of things at the same time and that makes their lives unenjoyable.Young people are looking forward to future but old people do not.Old people heve disapointment about their past experiences but young people do not because they have lots of time to fix those disapintments.
 The last but not least, old people have health problems due to, their age.Because of that, they need to stay at hospital or need private support and I think that makes them to live their lives unenjoyablely.Young people do not have to spend their times at hospitals due to, health problems.They can spend their time more enjoyable with doing different things such as, travel pleying PC or dating with their friends.
 All in all as I mentioned before young people live their lives more enjoyable rather than old people do.Because, old people have health problems and they are not energetic and thay are  not strong enough to do entertaining thing.The long and the short of it is that, old people are not able to do things that they want to do and that makes their lives unenjoyable.
