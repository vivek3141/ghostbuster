I agree with the statement. To me the question shown in the phrase is an ethical problem because societies which create a new product trick people who believe in their lies, so the entire population depends on advertisements which shows "incredible products" which can resolve many different problems, such as how to clean up houses or cars at best with a new soap which erases any stain, or how to repair a part of the furniture; in reality many of the effects of the products are created using a modern computer program. In this way people believe in something which partially does not exist and waste much money. 
 For example, one year ago I bought a new soap which could erase every stain on my shoes and clothes: I used it  only 2 times and then it didn't work anymore: now i still regret buying it (but the product presented in the TV advertisement seemed very different and much better than the real one).
 The philosopher Karl Marx, in the 19th century, said this: "...The religion is the oppium of all populations...": to me this expression may be changed in this new form:"...Advertisements are the oppium of people...", and it's really related to the today's situation.
