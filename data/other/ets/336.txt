In history, marketing was always an essential part of trade. Even in the early ages where trade was done exclusively with goods being exchanged with no currency, a person needs to describe the benefits of his product to the other person. If the person proves that his product is more useful than it really is, he can drive a better bargain. So, making products seem much better than they really are is the essence of trading even in trade`s earliest years.
 By the end of nineteenth century, the producer driven economies began to show up. New companies that both research technologies, make products and market those products were found. These companies were the origins of todays corporate system. Some examples are the companies found by Thomas Edison. After finding the ligament used in electric lighting, he began marketing his product to urban parts of America. In this process, he had to prove that electric lighting is much better than gas lighting. Therefore, the process of advertising is being used by companies for over a hundred years, and it has become an essential part of trade.
 Another more recent example is Microsoft. Most people, even the people not born at that time, have seen the advertisements for Windows 1.0. This particular operating system was shown as a great tool that would assist anyone. But, in the end Windows 1.0 came out to be an incompetent operating system. There are many examples like this in daily life in newspapers and television, with the same patterns. So, advertisements used today make products seem much better than they really are - this is an innate part of marketing.
 To sum it up, I agree that most advertisements shows products as if they are much useful than they really are. However, it is the nature of advertisements.
