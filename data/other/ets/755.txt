I agree with this statement.
 Young people enjoy life more than older people do becouse they have no problems, or at least very smalls one to compare with olders, that make them tired.
 In fact, if we stop now thinking about their simple day, we can observe that they have no other thing to do enjoying themselves.
 On the contrary, older people have too many problems and things to do during their simple day as work, children, parking, traffic and a hundreds else.
 In my particular case, i live alone in Milano and i have to do a thousands things all the day so i can-t leave time to relax myself with the consequences that i-m often tired and i never smile.
 I clearly remember when i was young and how the days run speedly with no problem, but it is live.
 I think that we have to re-discover the young there is in all of us because it is the only way to become a smily person< and i believe that it is possible staying closely with youngs- life.
 I think that they possess the correct kind to live the life, the only one we lost when we are young.
