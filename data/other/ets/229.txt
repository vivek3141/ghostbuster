Ii don't agree with the following. Is very difficult, in my opinion, think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.
 First of all   we have to consider that there are a lot of Countries that are in expansion, Countries like China, India, Brasil. In this place there is an economic boom that in my opinion will increase a lot the car's production. If we consider that in this countries live 1/3 of the world' s populations, it 's simple to think that the use of cars can  only increase. 
 Another reason cause i don't agree is that we, and when i say " we " i consider the " rich " world, don't want to use a different way to move or different solutions instead car. 
 In my own opinion is possible that in twenty years we can find a solutions for the pollution using elettric cars or another ki
