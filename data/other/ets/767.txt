Whats is life without trying new things? Well, life is all about trying new things and improving in various fields. what if Thomas Edison has not invented the first light bulb? We still would have been living in the dark.  
 Im kind of a person who likes to try new things and give them a shot. I believe that trying can make the life and the whole world a better place to live in, and yes only successful people try new things. Using risks can help you alot when you try a new thing. And it is really boring to have the same routine your whole life, life is meanless without trying new things as they can improve your life and get it better in many ways.
 We could have stayed on mailing our friends from other countries around the world by using the mail, but it takes days for the reciever to get it, but a new technology was invented to mail your friends and keep in touch with them all the time, and this new technology is called the internet, which made the whole world like a small place where u can reach your friend and mail them all the time and they also can get the mails at the same time, the same day. So internet was inveted in so many days and the inventor never stopped, kept trying, worked hard and he used all the risks to get what he wants and what the people want to make their life better. 
 Yes, life is all about trying new things and never stopping until you get what your goal or purpose is, and yes i totally agree with the statement of " Successfull people try new things and take the risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well."
