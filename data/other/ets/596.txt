I completely agree with this statement.In my opinion, most advertisements make products seem much better as that is what they are meant to do.
 Advertisements make the products look much more attaractive and much more useful than they really are.A lot of companies spend a lot of money only on this area.This is due to the fact that they have realised that most of the consumers believe the advertisements and will be under the infulence of them.
 However,a lot of the times it is very unfair to the customers as well.These advertisements can be very misleading sometimes and customers end up buying what they dont really want.I have seen it and experinenecd it myself.Television advertisements have mislead me in buying many products that i did not want.Another technique that many business firms use is that of using celebrities to persuade people for buying their goods.Celebrities with very high social status's can be very persuasive at times and this is another case of misleading the consumer.
 There is not much anybody can do about this either.People need to understand that firms would try their level best to make people buy what they do not what.It is us who are at fault as well.Beleiving these advertisements blindly would be stupidity on our part.We are the ones who are spending money and we need to make sure that we do not wate what we have.
 I think most of the advertisements are very misleading and make the products look much better than they really are.Nevertheless we are at fault as well and we need to make sure that we do not make mistakes easily.
