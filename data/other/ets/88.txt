well, in my opinion it  is important for the students to learn the facts, rather than  understanding  the ideas and concepts.because in my view the facts of  any situation or the subject itself is  more important.the facts  form the real basics  of that particular   situation or topic. and facts are more understanding    and   beleiveble than  having some kind of  an idea  or  knowing the concept  of  the topic.
 for example if the student is working on a project  related to the  subject  he is studing,then it is allways  better for him to  understand  and  learn the facts  of that particular  subject  than  just  getting the idea  about it . by learning the facts  he could allways   produce  more information or the real  work .If the project is  about   the topic in science.Like  the   importance of nutrition in a human body.Then it is better that the student understand the real facts  of the importance of nutrition in humans and then he can create some ideas while doing some reserch  on this topic and finally come to a conclution and understand the concept of the  topic itself.
 furthermore,I would say that  if the student  has only some ideas about the importance of nutrition in a human body then he would not present  a good  and complete picture of  the  topic. thereby giving a superficial  idea  of the topic.And make it look verry  simple.another example is if the student  is  studing  studing in a medical college  and attending an  anatomy class, then he  should realise and know  all the facts  of the  parts of the human  body , and also the importance of them.If he has just the idea  and  understand the concept  of how the organs work then it would 'nt  help much in getting the entire information and  working of the human system.
 therefore by stating these examples I would like to conclude that the facts  are more important than ideas or concepts in a student life  of learning  or studing
