very hard to understand many facts ,if it is not related by ideas & concepts & examples...
 i think both attach to each other cose with out the the facts their is no ideas.
 for example in the war, why  the war does not stop. it is been since the old centary we have war ,and everyone know the bad results of thw war: hungyness,pauverety,too much people go away,fritness,people with psychology problems,kids who lost there parents,family who lost there own home...
 but for my opinion the student understand all the ideas and concepts ,in the history about all the wars ,during all the history ,but if they can learn from the facts this will not happen again.
 another example more closer.when the teacher explain about a psychologie problem at class if he say the fact like :people still they  have psychologie problems,every student will wonder why?
 when he explain that many people who have emotional hungreness (their mother didnt really offer to much lets say love to there kids) and didnt teach her kids the right and wrong .this people love to still not because they need it ,but sometimes to satisfate there emotionel.
 in a busniss class when the proffessour said "the costmers always
 right".when he conyinue explaining his idae we understand what he means: the busniss with out customers doesn't work.it doesn't matter the company what she thinks ,but the customers who consumes this product. 
 for example when the constummer is been treating good he will be your door to another custommers, (friends,neighbours,cousins, family.....).
 but if he is not satisfate he will tell everyone and it will be a very bad reputation.
 everywhere not only at class even at home with our kids ,family i think  it hard to learn facts if their no ideas and concepts to understand.
