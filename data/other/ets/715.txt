I most certainly agree with this statement, "Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are". The two examples of my experience and aspects of magazine workers will verify the truth of my position. 
 A few days ago, my mother bouth a car cleaner which was advertised on television. The advertisement was too exaggerated. It said that every scratch can be eraised with that product. After my mother saw that advertisement, she bought one without hestitation because recently her car got a big scratch somehow. However, my mother and I found that it does not work as it advertised. We knew that we were diceived and decided not to believe anything advertised but only the experience of the others. 
 There is another example.  When I read the magazines, I always want to buy something advertised no matter it is expensive or not. By people who always focusing on selling the products to consumers, many magazines are decorated with fancy words and exaggerations. We need to consider about that group of people. In that peoples respect, they do not make products but only thing they have to do is make advertisements great so that they need to draw people. Their only purpose is to make people to buy that product which means they make advertisements make products seem always nice and perfect. Who woud show their shortcoming of products? 
 Because of the examples above, I believe  that most advertisements make products seem much better than they relly are. Every consumers have to be wise consumers which means they need to compare the real products and the advertisements before they purchase. So if one would like to buy the product only seeing the advertisements, I would like to say the one, 'Do not believe most advertisements but be wise and smart consumer'.
