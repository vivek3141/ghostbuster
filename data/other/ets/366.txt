I agree with the statement saying that most advertisements make products seem much better than they actually are.
 Indeed, advertisements are made in order to sell a product, they are not based on objectivity. In my opinion, advertisements are not a fair representations of the products they are proning. Most of the time they emphasyse the good side of the product but they avoid mentionning the eventual problems that can be found when they are used. For instance, an advertsiement for a piece of clothing will insist on the aesthetical aspect or on the fact that it follows the current fashion, but it won't insist on the fact that the fabric may be of bad quality.
 Furthermore, advertisements make product seem better because, when it comes to clothing, the garment is advantaged by the fact that it is wore by a person who fits the aesthetic criteria of the population. When a potential byer sees a piece of clothing, it is always presented to him in a way that it appears to perfectly shape the body whereas, in reality, the advertisors have certainly choosen the person who will make the garment look perfect. It probably won't be the case when an average person wera it.
 Last, the people who designed the advertisement often do surveys prior the release of the product. The surveys are used to ask to a certain number of people, representative of the class aimed by the product, what they think about the product, what they like or dislike about the its shape. This way of funcionning unables the designers to know what are the attracting sides of the product, it is easy then to highlight those aspects in the advertisement in order to attract the buyer.
 That is why I think that people should not trust the advertisements they run accross. Most of the time it has been designed to appeal to the customer and, when used, will prove to be much different than what one could have expected by seeing the advertisement.
