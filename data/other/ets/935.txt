The statement is about successful people ane their attitude in taking risks. I agree whit this statement, I think is true that people who have already reached a succesful place in society doesn't take risks if they're not sure of their success. Why they act like this? Maybe they don't want to look silly at the eyes of people that are looking at them. 
 If a man is kown as a genius in math for example, why should he try to write a sentimental poetry or sing in a Broadway musical? He's quite sure that this is going to be a disaster. I think that that's the principal reason why successful people don't even try do something that is far away from their speciality or that is not really something that they already know. People usually don't want to try anything new if they're happy with 
 I thik that I'll do the same thing if I were in them. I actually think that everbody would do that. It's natural. I think that only people that have nothing to lose would take the risk in doing something new. If you're a well-known person and you fail in do something you may gonna lose your face, and nobody want to lose his face. 
 But I have to say something else. I believe that the world really need people, even few persons, who are ready to take risks, also big risks, because if nobody takes risks nothing can change and every big discover that accurred in the last centuries has been generated by someone who took a really big risk. And at the end, if you take a risk and you success in that, you surely will become a successful person with all the merits , and maybe also the awards, you merit.
 All the success are paied back.
