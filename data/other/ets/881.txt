I disagreee with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do.   Ther main  reasons I support the idea are time and money.
 First of all, we the youg have to do things to do even though we do not want to do. For example, high school students have to go to the school everyday, or do homework of their dislike subjects. On the other hand, the elderly can spend their time on way their own. Nobody blames their way of using their spare time.
 Secondly, older people have  money that thay have earned for a long time.  They  can travel with their close friends or neighbors, or start the second business spending those money.  However, youg people has limitation of their money, because most of their money come from their parents. It makes them think about  on what they  they should spend money, in short, thay can not afford to travell abroad.
 Another reason is satisfaction and comfortablness.  Elderly people who had finish the role as a worker are confident to their skills that has supported thair country's industry.  At the same time, they might feel camfortable with the dedication.  These feelings make them happy, so they can enjoy the rest of their lives.  In contrast, the young always feel uncomsortable, and are under the pressures from their parents or teacher.  They they think thay have to do manything to their country or family. It causes mental problem.
 For those reasons, I think older people enjoy life than young people.
