According to my opinion,the statement that succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know is the one open for debate.
 Curosity has become a driving force which led to the new inventions and discoveries from century.Man from the time when he hunted the food than today when all the latest technologies are available.In this essay,i will first analyse ideology of succesful person and whether optimism and audacity is the only criteria for becoming succesful 
 and base my suggestion in favour of being optimistic.
 
 If we turn the pages of the history,one thing we find common in all the greatest leaders is the quality of being optimistic.They do not hesitate to take any audacious decision and exploring new things.Take for example,George Washington, americas first president,he always showed enthusiasm in trying out new thing.The other example is Abrahim Lincoln,a person who had reached the great height in his carrear by taking risks and experimenting with new things.
 I also support the point that ,if we do those things we already know we can do those tasks  more accurately and with less effort.However,this does not increse our effecincy .Think of the primitive world ,where our ancestors were very good in hunting and if they have never tried out  of breaking the old rituals of hunting and started living like civilised people we could have not reached the apex on which we are today.
 
 Obstacles are are the milestones which show us the path of success.While overcoming obstacles and taking new kind of risks people become stronger and discover new limits of success. 
 
 I would like to conclude by stating that,if u want to reach the apex of success than make yourself accustomed with different kind of risk and obstecle and In all conscience u will become succesful
