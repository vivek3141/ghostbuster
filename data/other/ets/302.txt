I tend to agree with the topic that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
 
 I believe that an understanding of concepts and ideas are the stairs to higher ground in all fields of education. This holds true for subjects ranging from science, business, medicine to fine arts. If a student is able to grasp the basic idea behind what is being taught then only he can proceed further higher to learn and understand more about the subject. 
 
 Lets take two examples, first one would be from the field of science. Everybody knows the fact that when white light passes through a prism it get divided into lights of various colors. So is it important to teach a student why the white light gets divided into various colors or is it sufficient enough for him to learn this fact and learn the names of the colors? It is so important for him to understand the basic concept behind the phenomenon which is that different colored lights have different wave lenghts and when passing through a thick glass they get reftracted differently. If he knows this basic concept he can take this further and understand the phenomenon of rainbows on his own and never forget it. 
 
 For my second example I would take take a student who is studying and working towards becoming a musician. In order for him to become accomplished in his field of study he should first learn the various notes, chords and other basic concepts and ideas in music. If the student is only taught the names of the greats and the symphonies that they created , would that help him anyway in becoming a musician himself!? 
 
 Therefore i would like to strongly state that though a student should be taught facts but there is no way that the students can do without an understanding of concepts or grasping of ideas.
