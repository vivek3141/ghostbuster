I think that this statements can not be considered probable for several different reasons.
 I guess the most important one is that there are many not Western countries (as China), where the presence of cars is actually not comparable with the one in the Western countries, which are fastly growing and whose request of cars for inabithant is growing in the same proportion, That makes the requestes for new cars to improve really fastly, and this is not a short term event.
 The second reason is that to have a car is still an extremly important stutus symbol, which would be hardly dismissed by a large part of the population. To have a car, expecially a fast and expensive one, is a central way  to subline the own social position, and I do not find any reason which suggest that it would change in the next twenty years.
 Third, there is a general financial problem in the balances of the majority of the states of the world. This condition takes away sources from the investiments, also from the innovation and the development  of the pubblic transports (with the exception of some big city). This fact obliges many people to use a car, which means to have a car, even if they would prefer not to use it. Honestly I do not think that in the next twenty years there will be found new sources to make the cars not to be necessary.
 The last point is that the car industry is still one of the central industry of the world. Its crisis would mean a strong crisis of the global economy, and twenty years are not enough to transform a strategical section of the economy in another one: it is improbable that in twenty years the car industry can convert is production toward other kinds of goods whithout a strong social impact. This is even the reason why the car production is so protected by the national institutions in so many different countries.
