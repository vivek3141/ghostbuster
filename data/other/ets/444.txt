They're very important for the human survival and for development of words but th "new theories" had changed the etical values and they are chaing the face earth. The people are influenced directly from these problems and they are dieing quikly. The contrast between economical proficts and human soul is a concept old like the earth. People go at a rich life and cut their emotions, their values and their concept of tranquillity life. So the " no good products " are really into the filosofical world of " Macchiavelli ".
