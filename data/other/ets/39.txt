I do not agree with the opinion that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. There are three reasons why I think it is bad.
 
 First, traveling with group means we cannot decide where to go by ourselves. We have to follow a tour guide and we have to see sightsd in limited time. However, I believe that one of the best things in traveling is to visit places where most tourists do not go. By doing that, we can experience different cultures that communicate with local people or exprience their lives. To give an example, I have been to Thailand and visited a Karen village where tourists have never visited. That experience made me broaden my knowledge and so on. 
 
 Secod reason is that we cannot spend a beneficial time in the places wherer we visit. My Swiss friend once told me that Japanese travelers often come to the sight only for taking pictures but not for walking or seeing the sight carefully and have a good time. This comes from the limited time that we are allowed to see one sight. In this sithation, we defenately cannot spend a nice time eventhough we travel to enjoy our lives.
 
 Third, it is not comfortable to travel with group members. Since we cannot decide which people to go with, there maybe some people that we I do not like. I think traveling with a person who I do not like is the worst thing to do. We should have confortable time during a travel.
 
 As you can see there are several de-merits of traveling with a group led by a tour guide. I prefer to trave alone or with friends, to enjoy my traveling and experiece different cultures.
