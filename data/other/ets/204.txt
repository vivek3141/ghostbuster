I would like to discuss the statement that young people do not spend enough time to help and suopport the community they are living in.
 
 To my mind young people nowadays spend less time helping their communities than they did some decades ago but you should consider that there are quite a lot of things that have dramatically changed over the past few years. Now, there are many new services offered by the government that give us the opportunity to spend our time doing something else than working for our community. An example for this would be the improved helthcare system: Some time ago, it was nearly impossible to work in full-time job if one of your relatives was very ill and needed permanent care and help. Today, you just have to apply for special services that are paid by the insurance and you will be given help.
 
 However, there are still some some services which cannot be provided and / or paid by the community. In those cases (i.e staff at the fire brigades, ambulance drivers, trainers at sports clubs etc.) there is indeed kind of a shortage. In my free time, I am working as an ambulance driver without being paid for this. Often have I experieced situations in which we ran out of personnel because nobody wanted to work on the weekend or wanted to stay up all night. I wish that in those cases, more people would recognize how important their contribution would be.
 
 All in all, I think that we do indeed need a young generation that spends more time helping their communities than many people do now, but we only need their support in some fields. So my suggestion would be to try to make some advertisement and promotion in order to show them how much fun it can be to play an active role in society and to help them to find the right kind of occupation for them.
