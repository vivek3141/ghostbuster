To be general, students can be childeren, teenagers or university students. All of them are not so matured, especially childeren, then teenagers, the last one university students. Becuase of being so young, they need to learn first, then  they can think. In primary school, first they learn how to write and read. To provide communication and understand what it is going to happen in their environment .They try to learn writing and reading.After learning reading and writing they start to read all books, newspaper and  to write a poem, a letter, a note etc., they start to learn more in highschool either about classes or about being person.After high school they go to university and again they still need to learn a lot of things about life and about their major area.Because of these situations they need to understand ideas first then they can learn facts. If they understand ideas first they can think themselves. They can have their own personality. If we don't teach different  but good ideas in school, they can not learn the facts in true way. Because of that in school, they learn all classses like maths, chemistry, physics, biology, history, phylosophy, religion, health, etc. After taking these classes they understand that which area they like and which occupation they want to have in the future.After graduating university when they get a new job they  face to real life and they start to learn facts.Because they have responsibility of new job and they earn their own money after all.They do not live their parents anymore and they live alone to take their desicion themselves. At that time they start to real things in life and maybe they will be worried about their future. Because of that they will want to be again a family and they will marry and have a child. 
 According to my witings in the above, first students needs to understand ideas then learn facts.In my opinian it is the healtiest way for students.
