I disagree with the idea that these days children do not have enough time to contribute to their communities. There are two reasons for my opinion; activety in schools and activety by government or communities.
 First, activeties held in schools give childeren a lot of time to engage in helping communities. For example, evey year in Japan schools hold a school competition. Parents of children come together with their families. They enjoy with seeing children running or playing sports. They communicate with other families in that that competition. In addition to that, volunteer actuveties asociated by schools also help children to help thier communities. 90 % of schools in Japan hold at least one volunteer activeties in each year. In that activeties children contribute to thier communities. Farthermore, in school children learn about their communities. They have to learn about their communities and do any activeties for thier communities.
 Second, activeties held by government or communities also give children a lot of time to help thier communities. For instance, government also hold volunteer activeties in each year. In total government hold twice ativeties as many as that held in schools. Government and communities give children more oppotunities to help thier communities. 
 Concequently, I think young people have a lot of time to help thier communities because of two kinds fo activeties; schools' activeties and government's or communities' activeties.
