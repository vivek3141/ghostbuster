the issue at hand is that most advertisement make products seem better than tey really are.this issue is important when it comes to choosing a product.
 
 in my opinion a lot of advertisements make products seem a lot better than they are.i believe this because advertising a product isn't usually about how good they are and what qualities it brings with it.a product needs to be sold and that's why companies need to advertise in a positive way about it in order to sell the product.for example take  a detergent to wash clothes with.this product gets compared with other dertergents,and usually the company who wants to sell this specific product  tells the consumer how much better it ist compared to its competition.the consumer might believe it and buy it,but the he finds out that it doesn' work as well how it was promised.
 another reason i believe that advertisemnt doesn' always tell the truth about it's product is that there are a lot of competidors out there who might produce the same product.every producer wants his product beeing sold the most.in order to to that the costomer needs to hear a few great things about it.
 on the other hand advertisement can be helpful in archievng a specific goal.for example you are in the music buisness and want your work published ,it is necessary to advertise your product in order to reach the public. someone can do this through flyers,happening events of the band and so on.this example shows that advertisement needs to tell the correct ambitions.,otherwise the consumer won't believe in this product and won't buy it in the end.
 in conclusion,most advertisements though use ooverexaurration on order to get a product sold.
