With this set of materials I'm really disagree!
 Cars will be fewer is a fantastic future! 
 In fact in the last years the number of the cars on a road is moltiplicated!
 Only if an organization like a GOVERNMENT or much importatnt like ONU or NATO will make some mesuerd like a laws for this problem We will see fewer cars turn around!
 My thesys is supported from the known of human mind!
 Some years ago people every day walk, go by bike or take a bus for go  to work, to study or to do other things! 
 Today man is able to buy a car and use it for his things, this because the world changed and are changing on!
 Many years ago peolple got up in the morning and think
 what the best ways for find a food?
 Later in the years when man got up think: 
 How can i do for live better?
 This is one of the means of evolution!
 So, I'm sure, next years peaple will think, for example,
 how many cars can i buy for live better?
 Another example to support my opinion you can find in the last years.
 Family ten years ago has only one car for family, that father usually use. Today for each family you can find minimun two cars, one for a wife and one for a husband.
 Now number of cars are increasing and next years you will see better in one family every components  of a family has a car!
 I know some my friends that have two car for each one.
 The evolution can help us to find a ways for limite a pollution for example or increasy the useful of a car, but modern people want to have everythind to take with the hands...
 The strange things is that this man or woman that doesn't want to walk or take a bus or move, in the evening will go in a fitness center for have a physicol activity!
 For this reason USA that is a rich country people are became fat!
 In fact fact is one of the problem of modern socety.
 Because machines like a car are doing the all thing that man did before.
 So i think that that sentence is very funny and fantastic!!!
