Some peple trust the advertisment that is real .  Sometimes it's not ture In my opinion.SoI agree that most advertisements make poducuts seem much better than they really are. I have tow reasons .
 The first reason why is I don't belive the comercial on TV . I think some comercial said make a story that it's not ture. For example , I watch the seans about first food . They said that is fresh vegetable and showing big meat . It seems  not like a junkfoods. It seems really good apatize. Though someday I visited there to eat . Unfortunantry, It was not like on TV. It was just humberger. They don't have a big meat like on TV. Moreovre it was not fresh vegetable . I was very frustrated . Thus, I don't  want to tust the kind of advertisement. I belive that we need to see before to try some fistfood.And we are supoused to hear a suggestion  from before
