In these days, many technology systems are developed.  For example, we could play in many ways in these days like playing an X-box in their houses and go to movie theator.  On the other side, the old people might not had a chance to play or watch the movie at the theator with their friends.  Not only playing to get enjoy life, we could also find for our new jobs easily and find their habits easily through the internet explorer.
 First of all, many young people in these days play X-box in their house.  Probably in the old day, they just play outside of the sports like basketball or soccer.  Howevere, in these days, we could play soccer or basketball in our house with using X-box.  The new technology systems affect us in many ways.  For example, we allow to talk to someone in anywhere and any time we want.  By calling or e-mailing with each other, we could find the enjoyable life.
 In addition, many young people in these days also go to movie theator to watch the movies.  In the movie theator, we could choose the movie we want to watch.  For instance, scary movie and sad movie.  By watching them we could have fun time in our spare time.  Also while we watch the movie we could also eat any foods we want.  In the old days, they didn't have any movies, so probably they all watched the news all the time.  
 Finally, we could find our habits and new jobs easily by searching in the internet explorer.  For example, we are interested in skiing in the winter brake, then we could search the place where we could go for the best and even we could learn how to do the ski.  By searching and finding our from the internet explorer, we could find out out habit is.  For instance, when I started to chat with my neighbor and I enjoy it, then it could become my habit.  
 In conclusion, many technology systems affect to live enjoyable life than older people did before their life.  Therefore, in my opinion, I agree that the young people enjoy life more than older people did before.
