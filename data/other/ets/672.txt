I disagree that a person should specialized in one specific object ,as this makes him able to achieve and develop in this field ,as an example a student studying buissines he must be specified in buissines but he must also gain knowledge
 and experience in other fields as in marketing and to widen his experience and gain many skills .a person must gain as much knowledge as he can . a person must try to combine and join between his specific subject and and other types of knowledge .the reason of success of many buissinesmen around the world is the variation of science .as an example a person studied computerscience at university and established a  company which devlop computer  programs as  as microsft he must be aware of other specifications as managment to be up to date in technology  and compete with other to give his best
