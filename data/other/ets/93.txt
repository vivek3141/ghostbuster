I completely agree with this statement, because i think adverstisement have been developped to sell products, and consequently it had to impress the mind of the consumer. Who creates the advertisement must present the product in the best way he`s able to do, also in order to defeat the challenging industries, that is, the other industries which sell the same object.
 To obtain this, the creators of the advertisement must present the product in a way that will make the consumer believe he`s going to do the right choice, and for these reasons the companies tent to present their products much better than they really are.
 To explain this concept, we could focus the attention on an industry which produces cars : if this company is going to launch on the market a new model of car, surely it will spend a lot of money in advertisement. Since the aim of the advertisement is making a person buy that new product, the car will be presented as a wonderfull object, full of technologies and of services created directly in order to satisfy the consumer ; even if  this description was wrong, the consumer will be influenced in any case.
 For these reasons, advertisement is merely created to influence society, and not to describe the real essence of the product; talking about this problem, in this years many companies and associations have been founded to protect the consumer, since people can be easily cheated by the market, and consequently after they buying a product, they rapidly discover that it is very different from the one they had seen on the advertisement.
 Concluding, we have to say that while it`s very common than companies present their product much better than they really are, the consumers must reflect well upon the choice they are made, and be sure they are not buying an useless object just because they have been influenced by the advertisement they have seen somewhere.
