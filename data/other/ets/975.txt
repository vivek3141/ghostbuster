Advertisements can change consumer's mind about products. So, I think that most products excessively make use of their advertisements that are making products seem much better than they really are.
 
 For example, during past summer, I participated in western America which are Lasvegas, Arizona, and Los Angeles tour program for forigner. According to tour company's advertisements picture, we were supposed to accomodate in a luxury hotel that have a swimming pole, a casino, and diverse show programs but it was just picture. We were accomotated in like a motel. So, this is one of advertisements that are exggarated.  
 When we watch TV advertisements, we propably can not find products that looks ugly and can not work well. However, when we use products, we can find the difference of the qualities. Therefore, I think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
 
 Although advertisements are very important to increase selling, consumers are not stupid. Eventually, they will chose the really good products not by advertisements but qualliy.
