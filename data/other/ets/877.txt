Most of people sort some bias aganist traveling, some consider it is more fun to travel alone ,but other choose to traval in agroup led by a tour guide. In my opinion i would prefere to travel in a group led supported by a tour guide for the following reasons.
 First, when you travel for a trip or a journey abroad and you do not know anything about that countrey , so it will be very hard for you to figure out the most intersting places in that country beause you do not have any a tour guide , who can help you alot to save your time and to enjoy the most beautiful places around. I think a tour guide can assist in that matter ,since he is more experience about the place and he have more information that can help you to understand certain thing in any place or any country you go.
 Second, it is very hard for anyone who does not speak a certain kind of lanaugae , for example if u want to go india and you dont speak indian what you can do in that situation , because not everyone speak english , therfore you should have a tour guide who can speak indian ,who will help you in anything you need .
 Third, the soule of the group is very good thing . they give you accompany in your trip and make it easy if the trip takes long time , you can share stories with each other and you can have a really  a great time . A tour guide can make the trip more orgnised and in that matter you can save time ,so you can spend it in another thing .
 In concusion, I agree with that statement because the group led and the tour guide really can make it different if you want to make your travel alone
