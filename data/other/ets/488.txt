I do not agree with the statement that "In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today". I believe that the amount of cars in the future will be the same if not larger than in the present day. 
 
 By analyzing the past and comparing it to the present one can notice the increase of growth in car manufacturing. As time goes by more and more car agencies are being created throughout the world, therefore more cars are being made. There are many types of brands of cars that exist today such as Jaguar, BMW, Daewood, and others which did not exist 30 years ago. Therefore i believe new agencies will keep surging and the increase in car manufacturing and making will continue in the future. 
 
 Also by looking at the population growth in the world and taking into consideration that cars are the number one use of transportation throughout the world, shows that it's demanding will always be present. The greater the population, the larger the amount of cars that will be needed, and if the world's population continues to increase then so will the amount of cars.
 
 In the present day cars are the most popular mean of transportation for the majority of the people around the world, and until this popularity is taken or replaced by any other mean of transportation, cars will continue to be the greatest demand for people and therefore more will be purchased.  
 
 Overall I think that in the future the amount of cars will either stay constant as the present day or will be greater due to the continued emerging of companies which make cars, the population growth, and the poularity of cars. The demand for cars around the world is too high nowadays to predict that there will be fewer ones in the future.
