I don' t think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. If that was the case, consumers would always be disappointed after purchasing the products. That would erode the confidence that the consumers have in that product maker and therefore would not allow the establishment of a longterm  relaltionship between the consumers and the product. Advertisers would have to constantly be appealling  to new consumers. 
 
 Whereas, what is important is the brand. Adverstisers are looking into promoting the product brand as much as the product itself. 
 Once the consumers have adopted a brand, they will be more incline to buy all the products from that brand. And this is what the product makers need: more faithful consumers who are going to buy over and over products from that brand. 
 
 Therefore, advertisers are working on a larger scope than just trying to make look the product as good as possible.  They work at creating a market, creating a need in the consumers, creating a fashion. They have much more complex messages than just: " that product is good" . Of course having attractive product is important, it contributes to the overall marketing message.
 
 If the consumer has the perception that the advertised product seem better than it is, it means that the advertisement has been poorly made and is not effective.
