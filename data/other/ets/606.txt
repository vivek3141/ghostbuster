Specializing in one specific subject is always better than having a broad knowledge of a large variety of academic subjects. However, to have some knowledge about other relateds subjects wouldn't be bad either.
 
 I've been studying photography and video in a university for three years. The system of this program I study is based on giving education about several subjects ranging from video art to documentary photograpy. From what I experience from this system, I can say that getting to know each subject a little bit but not being able to specialize on one academic subject is what you can do to ruin a students future. I am telling this because I know when I graduate I will find out that it is difficult to find a place for myself in any environment. For instance, when you are applying to a college for masters degree they would like to see the subject you specialized in, or when you get in to a job you need to have a specialization on something to be succesful.
 
 On the other hand, when someone who has a spacialization on a spesific subject but doesn't know anything else other than that it will also be considered as a bad situation. For example, if you are studying fashion photography, it would be an advantage for you to have some knowledge about other subjects related to fashion photography, like art history. Getting to know how the figures were painted by which techniques, what colours were used in order to express which emotions, what the basic principles of art at certain periods were, improves the quality of the photographic works.
 
 In conclusion to specialize in one subject is necessary to maintain success both in work and academic environments, but  as an addition to that extra knowledge on other subjects that will add to your specialization will be a remarkable advantage.
