Every stage of live has its own priority and ways to enjoy the moment. I do think that young people and older people can both enjoy the life they are living. 
 However the intesity with which someone can enjoy live mainly depends on the efforts and the sacrifices he had to do to reach to that point. In fact we can take the exemple of a young boy: his live, his universe is quite simple. A single simple thing can fulfill him like the consideration of his teacher when he has drown a beautifull tree or learnt a poetry. But I think to enjoy that moment of proudness he had to concentrate and to make an effort.
 On the contrary, I am sure that some student who doesn't really work hard to succeed in his studies and who thinks that what he is doing is just enough to pass his exam can't really enjoy live. In fact even if he has all the time and the possibilities to go on hollidays and to party with his mates, he would soon or later fill that he is not doing his best and won't enjoy this live anymore. That's why I am depply convinced that in order to enjoy live, we have to see in our past and be proud of what we have been able to perform.
 Moreover, after years of work in a very fullfiled career, older people have earned money that can allow them to travel, to have the live they have always dreamed of. But they have earn more than money during their career: they have earned the ability to be sincirely proud of what they have done. That is to say, the familly they have built, the education they have given to their child and the good memories they are giving to their grand-children. That is why I think that older people can enjoy live more than younger ones.
