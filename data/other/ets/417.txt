Some people will like to understand the ideas and concepts while some people will learn it from the facts they experienced.But i agree with that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than they learn facts because if they understand the concept of the particular they can face the fact confidently.
 
 That is if you understand a problem and the concept behind that problem then u can understand the type of problem and you can think an idea for the problem and you can solve the problem when you really face it with much better way than you face it directly as you have never face that situation before that time. For  example, in the study of medicine why to teach about how to deal with patients and how to recognize the disease by readig books first than going to the hospital and examining the patients ,it is because we need basic theoritical knowledge first to face any situation first we should know how the patient will be then we should know how to recognize the disease of the patient then we can eamine the patient about the disease he is suffering with but we cannot go to the directly to the doctor room with out any knowledge about that and go and ask the person about their symptoms of uneasyness, as if they say also we don't know the disease first to give medicines.
 
 It is also important to learn from facts but before that we should learn some what from concepts and ideas about the thing that was been done by the people before us that how they faced the situation for that instance if it is well we also follow the same way of approach otherwise we will think of the better way how to solve the same thing in a more effective way when we face such a type of situation it not only in the field i mentioned above but it is also applicable in all 
 fields of work and this is mainly for students as they learn things newly so gaining more theoriticall knowledge for students is better than learning it from facts.
