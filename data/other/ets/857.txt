In my opinion, I think that it is better for undergraduate students to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. What is more, it is better for graduate students to specialize in one specific subjuect. My reasons are lised as follows.
 
 In the first place, the majoritey of undergraduate students face the problom of finding jobs when they graduate from the university or college, except the students who plan to pursue the higher degree. If they have broad knowledge of many academic, it means that they have more oppotunitise to recieve a good job. On the other hand, it is obvious that undergraduate students just recieve a fundational education in the university. With the broad knowledge background, the undergraduate students will become move competitive in the job market.
 
 As far as the graduate students, Since their tasks is be outstanding in one special field, and they have not enough energy to study deeply in various fields. Therefore, it is suitable for a graduate students to specialize in one specific subject. As far as I am concerned, I always believe that a graduate student is a person who is so intellegent that can contribute to the field of science which  he or she is studing. 
 
 Ademittedly, having broad knowledge of various academic subjects is definitely benefacial for graduate students to achieve success in his special field. As a result, it is greatly useful for everyone to devote himself of herself to enlarge the sphere of knowledge.
 
 Taking into account of what have been discussed above, we may reach the conclusion that the undergraduate students should have broad knowledge of many academic, and the graduate students are more suitable to study in one specific subject.
