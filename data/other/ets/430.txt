Being led by a tour guide while travelling in a group is one of the best ways to do, where this seems to make it more special and interesting.
 A person would get to know more people from the group, which will make the trip feel enjoyable. A tour guide will help  in discovering alot of new stuff, and will show the tourists so many amazing places, especially if this is their first visit to the country. People usually travelling alone to another countries and trying to explore the best places by themselves, are going to face much difficulties doing that since they don't have any idea of what they are looking for, and whether they will like or not. Unlike the tour guide, who will save the tourists plenty of time introducing them to all the hot areas, one after the other because he knows almost every location in the country. Moreover, people sometimes pass by alot of old buildings without even noticing their significance and their history too. While, a tour guide will provide the toursists with all the details and the history of related to these places. Tourists are going to enjoy it more, and they will feel better after being told what to do and how to react to a certain situation opposing them.
 A tour guide will help the tourists spend the best time, so they would know what to do and where to go, incase they visit again sometime later.
