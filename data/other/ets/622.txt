Today, many people go to many countries easily. Do you agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide? Some people agree with that, but others do not. There are many opinions. Personally, I agree with that for several reasons.
 
 First, people can go to many countries and they can enjoy their cultures, views and so on. However If we go to travel to other places, we have to study about tha way that how to go to the famous places and everything about the plece what you will go. When I was a junior high school student, we had a school trip. We went to Korea for the school trip. Before we go to Korea, we had to plan what we want to go. We could have a guide, but we did not, because we thought if we get much information for the traveling, our travel will not be bad situation. We though the information is very good, we will not lost any roads. However we losted roads. Even we could not find ant stores which we wanted to go. Serching the information by themselves is good things, but we can not lead the right way always, because the traveling place is not your home town. 
 
 Second, when you go to Canada, but you can not speak English what will you do? Tour guide always speak nice English and even speak language which you live in. Sometimes people have some trable in the foreign country and they can not solve the problem. If you had a travel like that, you will not be able enjoy the travel later. However when you have a tour guide, it does not occur. Your tour guide will solve the problem clearly and you can enjoy the travel again. 
 
 In conclusion, tour guide always lead us good way and they will solve our problems easily, So I think it is good for people to have a tour guide.
