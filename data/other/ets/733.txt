Instead of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects, I prefer to become an specialist in one specific subject. Of course, this decision depends on each person and the enviroment where he use this knowledge.
 When you study several subject, you manage to achieve a quality of education that let you be useful for many jobs. You are not specialized for a particular task and you have enough knowledge to understand problems in different areas and manage to find a solution.
 Another advantage of this education method is that you can work with specialist of different areas and understand, no without difficulty, what they are talking about. You can be helpful bringing to the discussion ideas that are based on your broader education and experience. For example, software developers usually know how to use different programming languages and design techniques and many ways to combine them. This make them very valuable because they can work on different parts of the system they are developing. Instead, an specialist would be useful to solve a particular problem, but nothing else.
 On the other hand, there are many jobs that need to be done by an specialist in the subject. A clear example of this occurs in medicine, where just an specialist can operate a patient or know how to treat some uncommon illness.
 When the task you are accomplishing requires a lot of knowledge and practice, you need to be an specialist to be successful. If you are a researcher, you will need to study a lot about the area where you are working to learn about different approches that can be taken to resolve a problem or discuss with other researchers. If you are a lawyer, you have to be an specialist with the laws you are dealing with.
 As I have stated, both options are possible. Depending on the task that has to be done an specialist will be better or worst than a person with a broader knowlegde.
