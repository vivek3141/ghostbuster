Surely most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are.
 We have always to remember that behind any advertisement, when we watch tv, when we listen to the radio, or just when we walk in the street, there has been a deep and accurate research to make the people like that product.
 It's not just a matter of what is the product, what is possible to do with it  or  if it is definitely the best in the market, there is people studying and working to find out how to make it impressive.
 The advertisements work! And so, or we believe that the products that we see in tv are really better than the otehrs or we believe that the companies want to show it in a better way.
 Sometimes the companies create advertisements even nice to watch, trying to create in our mind a nice picture of the product.
 Every day in tv it's possible to find examples, it happened to me to notice that even for product that are proved to be harmful for the health as cigarettes or drinks, the association is always with something positive, beautiful or cool. Why? For sure because nobody would buy something is not attracted by and because a brilliant image is much more attractive, and this makes us think about the positive sides of the products. In this way we will go to buy what we have seen even if another product has the same qualities.
 I could never say: i don't agree with that statement, it's so true that probably there would be the need of a stronger regulamentation.
