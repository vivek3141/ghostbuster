I think education is a combination between the understanding of concepts and the learning of facts. 
 
 Concepts are important in the way they are the essence of the knowledge that the teacher needs to transmit to the students. They are the structure, to built that strong construction that supports all the academic tasks. Without concepts we will live in a world that doesn't worry and take the time to penetrate  the deepest parts of the understandiyng and mental capacity.
 
 Sometimes  education can turned to square and bored the learners, because everything is about ideas and how to get them. To pill the onion or to get to the center of the point, we need details, little facts that decorate our lives and the way we learn to see and  understand the universe. 
 
 Good educators are the ones that can awake their studendts throught a simple fact as a date o a number (that can be eassily fogotten)  using it as door to walk and search into an unknown universe full of posibilities that let her/him to understand the ideas that once we introduced we never forget.
 
 It is like a game. When we play to find the treasure we cannot forget our objective, but we have to be carefull of the facts and the extra information that we can collect during the search. The middle way is the best way to educate and help students to understand  different disciplines from mathematics to arts, because is the perfect combination between body and what is inside it. When we fallow thios way we find the gold, the wisdom.
