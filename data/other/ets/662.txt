The issue is concentrade if it is better to have knowlagde of many academic subjects thahn to specialize in one speficic subject.
 I believe it is very difficuilt to awnser this question, because tere are many aspects which speake for booth of them.
 I think to have a specialize in one spefcific subject is important for an special job, like chemistry. It will help you to be good in this work and  to have the kowledge. A boss in a firm or company would search for this special kowledge and i think you will have a good chance to get this job. The special kowledge is very usefull for you and you are an expert in a special subject. People would aske you for help and you are able to give a awnser, because you are good educated in this subjetct.
 But on the other hand you should have broad knowledge, because to have the chance to get a better job and people would respect you.
 In my view you have a better chance with a broad knowledge of a lot acedemic to get a good job in this world today.
 You have a better spectrum of knowledge and I think it will help you a lot. I think knowledge is power and that is very important.
 People would you more respect and you are only have a knowledge in one subject. You are specialize in more subjects.
 In my perpective it is the question for what you need your knowledge and what for a job you want to do. It is your turn to specialize in one specific subject or to have a broad knowledge of a lot academic.   
 In conclusion I would prefer to have a knowledge of a lot academic but in special jobs like chemistry you need a special knowledge.
 So all in all it depends from the choice of your job.
