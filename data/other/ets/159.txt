in our society we live arounded by every kind of spots: on tv, on internet, on the streets. spots are became very important for all industries and in generally for every businness activiities. for this reason who make spot want to realize something that capture the attention of consumers in every way. but we do not often pay attention to them and so we do not check if the spot messages corrispond exactly to reality. in this way the spots can easily influence who are hearing them especialy children that have not a lot of experiences and they often belive everything we tell them. this aspect can be dangerous for children who are not able to check the bad an dangerous sides of some products for example the medicine spot.
 so i think that autorithies must controll much more every spot and all advertisements of products in order to give more good infomation to consumer
