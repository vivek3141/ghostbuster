I agree to the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concept than from facts .
 The meaning of understanding the ideas is thinking about the concept.the three quwestions will arise while thinking that is while understanding ideas and conceptsthey are why , what , how. what the concept is how the concept arosed and what is the main theme of the concept  same as that in the case of ideas too
 Here the main aspect in understanding is moving into the deeper meaning of the idea or concept and understanding  about the concept it will make the things easier when studied by understanding ideas and  concept it will remain in brain for a long time than it is studied 
 According to the studies it has been concluded that most of the students who understand the concept can remember for a long time than we study the facts by understanding the cocnept we can get knowledge about the topic in two ways one is the positive results and the other the negative results from the concept.
 After analysing the concept we too can chosse the bet way if it is applicable in the real time apects too.the means of understanding the ideas and concepts is to make the studentsto get good knowledge on the concept
 There are many aspects in supporting the issue that understanding ideas and concepts is  good  for students.firstly the students can get the whole idea nof the concept they can get full knowledge of the concept.secondly they can get the reasons in supporting or opposing the concept .finally they can use it in the case of the realistic applications if it is applicable.the facts also make the students to learn more about the topic but when compared by understanding ideas and concepts knowledge isgained greatly than studying the facts as it is . the meance of understanding the concepts may lead to think about new ideas too which can improve the past there is a possibillty which can destroy the past ideas too.
 so finally it has been concluded that understanding the concepts and ideas will show more effective  than learning the facts .
