The development in technology has reached a point that, it is very difficult to predict what invetion will be done next. There are many technological inventions that people could not even imagine some years ago. I am completely comfortable to say that cars will be improved imaginary in twenty years; on the other hand, the increase or decrease on use of cars will depend to the calling the developed machines cars or something else than car.
 In my opinion cars will decrease considerably on roads, because the nowadays researchers even start to test the flying cars which are independent from ground, furthermore; these machines look like cars but transport people like planes. These machines will not use ground roads, for the reason that; cities are settled and modifying roads are impossible at the moment and the only way to deal with the traffic jam which big cities have the transportation system will be in the sky such as planes. Today big cities have diffuculties on solving traffic problem, besides; another solution is that, in order to solve this problem the machines that will be used to transport people will have more seats in it so that, it would transport as much as people that it can. By this type of machines transportation will become more easier and quicker. According to population growth on earth there will be more machines to transport people, this means that the need of transportation machines will increase so that it is obvious that there will be more needs for seat in the machines twenty years later. 
 In conclusion, I am not sure that, the new machines that transports people by flying to their destination, is going to be called the term car or not, I thik
