In my opinion it is more important for a student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for him to learn facts. 
 First of all, when a student learn a lesson, it's more important for him to undertand the meaning of his lesson than just read and repeat what he has just red. For example in law class, after reading facts the teacher always try  to make the student understand the reason why the juge take a decision. First, the juge analyse the facts through the law text, and after that he use the custom, the moral, and the social attitude to understand reason of those facts and to take a decision.
 Secondly, in a passage analyse, a student has to know "what" appened to be abble to understand "why" this think appened.
 For exemple a writer who describe a storie won't just give you the facts, because it doesn't make sens whitout the context, so he will give to the reader all the reasons why those facts happened to help the reader understand idea that he defend and the concept of his stories.
 This logical process is very important for student because  the facts don't make ghim understand the reason why he learn his lesson. To finish , i think that learn facts and understand ideas and concepts are bothe important but they must be together for a better comprehension of the student.
