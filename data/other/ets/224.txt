People enjoy their lives more when they are young.With old age come illness and suferring .Young people sure have more resposibilities. They have to work hard to secure their future.They have to aquire skills that will help them have a sustainable life.With all these responsibilities comes lot of fun and excitement.Young people have the desire to suceed.They also have lots of energy and enthusiasm to accomplish this.In the process of accomplishing something they enjoy life.
 Young people are very flexible..The flexibility makes them look at the positives in another person.So they can make friends easily.We are well aware that life without friends and family is meaningless.So young people live life to its fullest.
 On the other hand older people spend their time worrying about everyday affairs.They worry about their family,providing for them,their job and so on.This is the case in any family.Parents spend their life working hard for the family with no time for fun.A busy mother will not have time to go for a walk and enjoy nature.As one gets older things worsen.Health deteriorates with time.With illness comes all the suferring.It is true that health is wealth.
 Its true that a person becomes wise with time.But he also looses the ability to experement with life and take risks.To accomplish anything in life one needs to tahe certain amount of risks.So older people enjoy life lesser than young people.
 With youthfulness comes exuberence and vibrance.young people appreciate things that are taken for granted by older people like nature and so on.Time takes away the high spirits from a person.It makes them more sober.So young people indeed have more fun than older people.
