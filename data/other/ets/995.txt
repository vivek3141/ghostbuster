It is a well-known idea that young people should enjoy their life more than older people do because they still have 'energy' and 'time' to spend, but if we really think about that statement we can tell that it's not that true.
 Well first of all it depends on what we mean by 'young people'. If young people means child, the statement will be kind of true, what i'd like to say is that when your a child you will defenitely enjoy the life more than older people do because you're still sort of unconscious yet and without any kind of worries besides ' what am i getting for christmas?' and so on... But if young people means teenagers,student or young active it'd be another problem. As for me, I think that being a teenager a student or a young active is one of the most stressful time of our life not that it's not enjoyable at all but it's a period where time flies and it's a period that will define the rest of your life in other words everything and by everything i'd like to emphasize the word 'future'. What will i become in this world? What will i do? Well i guess those questions are getting unsignificant when your getting older. 
 I think older people among all should know how to enjoy life the best they can and time. As we're getting older, we're getting wiser (well i do hope so) and we won't have to worry about meaningless things such as what kind of clothes am i going to wear to school today. Altought older people cannot as much thing as they used to do when they were young but they would definetely take time to enjoy them.
