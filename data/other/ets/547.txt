I  this growing population and devoloping technology, people show up with more needs every day. But these needs can easily be displayed in an ostentatious ways like making the product seem much better than they really are. Even though the consumer already now that the product in not going to be a real solution to their question, they easily can get amased by the showy advertisements.
 
 I believe the best way to sell a product hides under the showy advertisements. Lets say there are to different componies which are trying to sell their hair loss product. The X company says that this product is not only going to be the permenant solution but alsothe costumer will be able to see the result in 2 weeks, even though it does not work like that. On the other hand, the Y company just says that the consumer will easily see the hair lossing problem ending in 3 months, after finishing the first bottle of that hair solution. Also they add that if the buyer would like to see the permenant answers they have to use 3 bottles. I believe it is not that hard to decide choosing the product that work for you.
 
 My answer would have been saying yes to the first company and buying their product which they empysize their product under the name of permenant solution. With that word group they can easily get the buyers attention, because the person who has the hair loss problem dos not want to face with the problem or spend their my on 3 bottles instead of 1. 
 
 
 As buyers we should not believe every word we hear on commercials. We should be more picky.
