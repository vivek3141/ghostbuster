I do not agree that in twenty years the number of cars in use would decline. The usage of cars is directly propotional to the demand of cars, which I believe will increasely significantly as we move on. Here are some of the reasons to support my point.
 
 First of all, the population of the world is growing for past several years and this trend is expected to continue. For this simple reason only the demand for cars and their usage is bound to increase.
 
 Secondly, as we are making more and more progress in technology, the prices of the cars would come down. Also the economy of people is grownig and people will have more money to buy cars at low prices thereby increasing the usage.Also with the advances in technology, the time seems to be flying more quickly and everyone tries to achieve the maximum in as little time as possible. Therefore people would like to  switch to faster travel options such as cars to spend time spent in travel.
 
 Also, given the alarming increase in polution due to industrialzation, the polution after twenty years is expected to be unbearable. It would also lead to harsher climatic conditions and hence pedestrians and two wheeler drivers would have no other option then to move to much safer options such as cars where utilities such as airconditioner would be able to keep the air healthier  and maintain a proper temperature.
 
 Currently some of the people, specially in developing countries do not prefer car because of problems such as traffic. But as the countries develop over the next few years their infrastructure would improve substantially and traffic conditions would improve considerably, again favoring car usage.
 
 To conclude, I strongly believe that as we make more and more progress in technology over the next few years the usage of the cars would increase significantly.
