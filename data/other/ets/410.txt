I partially agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide because it depend on the situations such as how you are going ,what palce u are going and how many people did u accompany  and also whether u know any thing perfectly about the place.
 
 Firstly,while we are going alone and if we are new to that place and we do not know any thing about the place than it is better if we go for a tour guide.Tour guide helps us to cover important things  and also it is safe  and also no confusion occur.I say this with all the experience i had in my trip .Last time me and my husband went to hawaii we attended a polynesian cultural center with a guide. The guy who guide is really good and he said alot of things about the culture and the people who are there in hawaii and so we know all the cultures that has emerged in hawaii and its sister islands and also about the same time we have known all the cultures and traditions that are there in hawaii and we covered almost everything went well.
 
 Secondly while we are going to place which are well known which does not have an historic importance there is no need of guide and also at the same time if we went with the guide we can't spend a lot of time where we like it and also there is no privacy if we went  along with the tour guide.Consider the example, if iam visting Las Vegas with the guide what should i do?Really i can spend my time where i like? No i can't.Visiting Las Vegas What is the need of guide .
 At last i would like to conclude that if u are visting an historic important place u really need a guide the guide helps u to explore more things and if u are visting for only entertainment there is no need of guide.
 So lastly i can say that sometimes i prefer guide while in sometimes i may not it may depend on the place, situation and time.
