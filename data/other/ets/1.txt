The statement of "most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are" is a fact.
 Adversetising is the engine of many companies all around the world, companies that could not sell a unit of their products if they could not have access to advertisment agencies. For example, everyone is aware  of the hazzards of drinking soda but because the companies that produce soda invest millions of dollars on advertising, they keep selling milions of units all around the world. Another clear example that supports the statement is tobacco companies; companies like the worldwide company Phillips-Morris wich business is to sell as many cigarrettes as they can, even though they are awared about the consequences of smokingas they customers do, they keep incresing their profits year after year because they great investing  on advertising, this is what permits them to show their product as something that is neither bad nor good, just as something that exists. 
 Usually many products fails because their marketing policies,  some companies with really good products had declare out of business after putting out their products without a good marketing support or many companies with regular products have been successfull because of it; one example of this, is that millions of clothes companies exists around the world but no all of them are known in different countries and they do not sell as the known ones do; many brands are selled in the world, brands like Tommy Hilfigher, Diesel, Perry Ellis among to many, but is not their quality or any other specific characteristics that these brands are so successfull, is just their marketing policies what permits them to succeed over the companies that have no marketing policy.
 In summary there is no statement that can be so real as "most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are".
