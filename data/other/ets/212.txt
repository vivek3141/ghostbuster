Do you have more pleasure when you were kid than when you are grown up? It seems quite obvious. We will see that being young provides less responsability, more time and places to socialize and a better health to enjoy the life.
 
 The biggest difference between older and younger persons is that the young ones has less sorrows. Children and teenagers don't have to care about money, their parents do. They also don't need to worry about cleaning the house, buying food, it is also their parents jobs. The lack of responsability enables to focus on other things in life: having fun.
 
 School is not only a place to study, it is also the best place to make friends. Courses and breaks are special opportunities to discover new persons and socialize with them. During all the studies, a student will meet more people he will ever can in his grown up, office life. 
 
 Old people has also other concerns. As we say in France: "If young people knew if old people could...". Health and physical condition is not the same for everybody. For older people is more difficult to practice sports, dance in night clubs old night long. 
 
 Older people will always regret their youth. I don't think that young people really wants to share their parents' life...
