There are different aspects of one's personality that may lead you to success. To name a few, we may say consistency, responsability, determination, etc. But, what about being couragous, creative and daring?? Without courage and creativity  humanity wouldn't have evolved and now days the word "technology" wouldn't exist in our dictionary. Definitely, successful people need to create new ways, try diferent ways and find new ways of doing things driving by the ambition for a better living. 
 
 Being curious, visionary and daring what has been "stated" has being proved  by history to be in a high extend responsible for our evolution. Staying "safe", doesn't get you anywhere. It may not get you anywhere bad, but for sure, it won't take you to a better place in life. 
 
 One important aspect of leaders is having vision in the way of leading a team, a company, etc. They also are able to reach and find new ways to approach a certain problem and try new ways of doing things successfully. 
 
 By trying new things and new ways, people get a better understanding of life therefore acquiring more wisdom. If one wants to live a better and more plentiful life, I find it basic to experiment, dare a little, risk it a bit and try new things.
