I agree with the statement that ideas and concepts are more important for students than facts. 
 
 An important purpose of learning is to develop one's cognitive abilities as well as to develop one's powers of understanding and  analyzing patterns of events or facts. A number of experts also develop the cognition and the ability to predict events or results in the  future by extrapolating information or facts on these theories and patterns.
 
 The physical sciences are based upon testing of hypotheses and  development of theory. Specific facts are not an important feature in their learning. The social sciences too are increasingly getting inclined towards developing theories and concepts.
 
 For example, students of History study past civilisations including their rise and fall across regions and time.They come across a lot of details about each of the events and features that characterizes the various developments through History. However, it is important for them to understand the patterns, ideas and the reasons of these events rather than the nitty-gritty details of the events per se. They are taught to identify similarity in patterns of rise and fall of civilisations rather than the exact dates for each of the events or specifics of historical artefacts and culture.
 
 Similarly, students of Economics study various economic systems that have existed across countries and through various periods of time. They seldom memorize detailed economic indicators of each of these systems. Rather, they study and learn the principles these economies were based upon, the patterns of their growth and the causes of their rise or fall , as the case may be. Present day economists use this learning to develop policies that would help society meet its desired objectives. Thus for the learning to be useful in this case, knowledge of facts is not important, understanding economic ideas and concepts are.
