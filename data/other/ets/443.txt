I disagree with the given statement. According to me the statement is not very precise. I think that people should hold on to what they already know how to do. It is much more beneficial that trying new things. The common saying "Jack of all trades but master of none" applies here very well.  The people who keep doing the same thing through their life are more successful according to me.
 
 The people who concentrate in the same field increase their experience vividly in the respective field. They can become more efficient by further training and support. Where as those who are trying new things every time can never be satisfied with one thing and can never be settled in life. Their life is spent trying new things and there is no particular job that they fit into. They are always changing jobs and are very unstable in their life. For example, a person who knows all the jobs os repairing but does not have enough experience is no better than a person who knows only wheel alignment but is widely experienced.
 
 Moreover, the employers are always looking for hiring widely experienced crew members. This type of experience in a certain field can be gained only by doing it for a long time and attending training sessions. The practice of doing only one thing over and over again can also lead you to become an expert in that field of work. This again contributes to an individual's success rate.
 
 In today's world of high population a person stands out only if he has a certain specific knowledge. The chances of a person who does the thing he already knows are higher of being selected for a certain job. Most of the companies avoid risk-takers to avoid the chances of loss to the company. Thus the people who prefer doing things that they are already familiar with are, in my opinion, more successful in their life rather than those who try new things and are adventurous. I completely disagree with the given statement.
