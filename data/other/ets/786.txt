For the following reasons, I personally agree with the statement that  young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.   
 
 First of all, young people, including myself, cannot afford to spend their time for the sake of their community, because of their hard work.  For example, in Japan, where I live, economy remains good and stable.  Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. a leading manufacturer of automotive parts where I work, needs to produce more and more in order to satisfy tough demands from Toyota Motors, Co., Ltd., a worldwide car manufacturer.  As a result, my colleague and I are forced to work like a dog every day and night.  At weekends, we have to take a rest in the dormitory so as to prepare next week.  As the example demonstrates, young people do not have extra time to help their community.
 
 In addition, nowadays, there is little opportunity for young people to help in their community.  For example, in the middle of August, my community used to hold a summer festibal named as ''Obon Festival'.  When I was a child, I took part in the festibal together with my friend.  However, a few years ago, Obon Festibal was ceased to be held because the number of children had been dramatically decreased.  Although I thought that I would help Obon Festibal when I grew adult, now I do not have an opportunity itself to support.  As the example shows, young people do not have an opportunity itself to use their time for their community.
 
 In conclusion, for the reasons stated above, I strongly agree with the point of view that young person do not provide enough time to help their communities.  I believe that young people want to give sufficent time to help their communities.  Unfortunately, as stated above, young people do not have time and opportunity to back-up their community by spending their time.
