I agree with the given statement.
 I think it is not only important to understand the ideas but also their interaction and relationships with each other.
 Usually, facts like formulas in economics and dates in history are something that one can use to get a good grade in a test or exam, but in the real world, that starts as soon as a student leaves the university, no one will care if you can calculate a fictional unemployment rate in a fictional economy or not. It is more important to understand how unemployment develops, what factors influence it, and how it can be influenced by governments. And it is also more important to understand the development from World War I to World War II than to know on what exact day the conferences of Munich took place.
 Ideas and concepts give a student a toolset of how to approach a problem, how to think. An idea is open to changes, it can be transformed, developed and adjusted to the situation in which it is needed, why a formula or a fact is only relevant under special, given circumstances.
 Of course it is important to know examples, from different times, from different countries, so one can compare reasons and development lines, but this does not include numbers. In a university lecture one might hear about the Great Depression - but it does not make a difference for the understanding if there were 10 or 11 percent of unemployment, it is more important how it was caused.
 The only exception in my opinion is in the field of science - physics, chemistry or medicine, where the difference between one or two degrees of body temperature for example can lead to totally different actions and outcomes.
 Students need to learn to think by themselves, develop their ideas and find arguments, for or against a theory, they need to learn to judge a situation to act appropriatly, and they will not get to that by learning numbers by heart.
