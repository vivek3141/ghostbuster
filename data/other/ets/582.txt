I disagree with the statement because man has always been on the for methods to make his life more convinient , and as far as getting from one palce to another on a daily basis is concerned, four-wheelers are what make his life comfortable and so he has no qualms in procuring a car if he can afford one.
 In twenty years from now, it is unlikely that population of the world would decrease or even remain fairly constant , and with more and more automobile firms introducing cost-effective cars it is safe to assume that in the future more and more people will be able to afford cars and hence the number of cars on the roads will increase.
 Another major factor to support my claim is the fact that no concrete laws exist keep in check the number of vehicles in a particular region . This allows people, especially families, to purchase as many number of cars they want as per their requirement.
 Also the fact that people now consider two wheelers to be dangerous to ride also lends support to my stand. people now are well informed of the increasing number of two wheeler accidents which can be attributed to their relative instability and insecurity ac compared to cars. they feel reluctant to use  a two wheeler when they have the option of using a car and hence as time progesses it is safe to say that this preferance will indeed cause an increase in the number of cars in the coming years.
 Technological advancements in the automobile industry will also allow people to use " non-polluting " vehicles in the future . with the increasing number of pollution norms such cheap and "clean" vehicles will provide an escape route for the world's population whose rising numbers will obviously lead to the popularity and widespread use of such vehicles in comparision to today
 i hope that with the arguments stated above , it would be easy to forsee the increasing number of cars in the years to come .
