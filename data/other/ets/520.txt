I strongly agree with the statement that it  is more important to understand the ideas and concepts rather than just learning about the facts. I would say that students should come up with an idea to invent a new product and think about the concepts behind them rather than going through it blindly. 
 Firstly, I would like to discuss that being a pharmacy student, i would come up with an idea of inventing a new anti-cholesterol drug which would be suitable for so many people who is sufffering from the high cholesterol problems which are related to the heart diseases, diabetes and other dangerous diseases that is killing many people. I believe this would be a good step and look for the consequeses before go through it further.
 Secondly, i would describe about the concepts of inventing a new drug into the market. I would do the research and I would go through many pharmacy books which i have studied during my graduation and look for the concepts behind it like, the adsorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of the drugs and also for the adverse effects, contraindications and the interaction with the other drugs. I would also look for the dosage form to be manufactured before stepping forward.
 Thirdly , i would like to mention that before putting the idea further, i would put all these particulars on a new drug approval form an submit to the drug approval agency for getting it approved before doing the clinical trials and enter into the market.
 In conclusion, i would say that it is very important to understand the   the idea and concept for every student to go further into their research and learn the facts about the their research.
