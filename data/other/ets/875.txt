I agree that students should undestand the ideas and concepts than spending time in learning facts. I believe that the human civilization has come to the zenith of technology not because of learing the facts, but by understanding the ideas and concepts.
 
 There have been advancements in many areas. If the humans spend all their time on facts, our lives could have been ended in undestanding the history of our earlier generation. And  we could not have seen the progress. There could have been no progress of science. So, applying the concepts of the facts will move the world to the next levels.
 
 I always liked science which make me a scientist not because I know the facts, but the way I undestand ideas and concepts.
 I am taking a mathamatics call I will use the concepts and idea to get to generate a solution to the problem. If we use fact there will be times, they will not help get the solution.
 
 In our daily life, we live with ideas and concepts. A very besic example, If my parents want me to go buy vegetables form the vegetable market I will decide which way will be easier road. I will analze by asking myself using my concepts and not go with the facts.
 
 Our human mind can take only some facts and then we have to use the concepts to work towards succuss. There are many facts in this world and it will not be in our human abiliites to know all the facts. so it is more important that to know how to apply the concepts and ideas. To deal with the problem.
 
 On a whole, I think that facts can only help to certain level but most importantly it is the ideas and concepts that will hlep us in dealing with daily lives, in our career and also in work.
