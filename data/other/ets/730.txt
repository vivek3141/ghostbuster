For a better community, every individual of that particular place has to provide a helping hand to reach its success levels. considering the young people nowadays, thay have to contribute their part to help out his/her community . I personally agree with the statement that, Young people nowaday do not give enough time to help their communities for the following reasons.
 Young people is a combination of college going students as well as recently graduated ones from the universities who spend most of the time searching a better job. The stress on the students is so high these days that they hardly get time to entertain themselves. That is, they are always tangled with their studies and assignments they need to complete. In such case, they dont have time for other activities like improving their community.
 Other reason is, whenever they get some time young people prefer to spend time with their family and friends rather than improving a community. This is the cause of the excess burden they are facing from their daily schedule pattern. For instance, I myself being a graduate student, whenever I get some time from my assignments, I would prefer relaxing at home than going out and improve my community. 
 Young people also feel that , if the community heads and the corresponding heads feel responsible and do their part correctly then there wont be a question to call young people to participate in such programmes. young people have to concentrate well on their studies and go on up to their satisfaction levels because these are the people who are the citizens of tomorrow. young people have to mould themselves in such a way that they could become the role models for their younger generation.
 In the concluding note, young people dont give enough time for the improvisations of their community because of the above stated reasons.
