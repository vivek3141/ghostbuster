Cars are the most important investigation in our world, and it is very usefull  in all of our life ways. We can travel by cars for long distances and we can translocate our things. In my opinion it makes our world smaller than it is.
 For the privious benifites I disagree with the statment which said that "In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today".
 Let us go to the past, befor cars were be invinted, the man was suffer from traviling because it was lost his time and was very sloly and very difficult. we can immagine for example if we want to travel for  1000 kelo meters what the time we should be taken to arrive or reatch our station. Now adayes we can travel as far as we can without suffering or wasting more time.
 Second example why I hold no confidonce with the privious statment
 is the fast development of cars industry we can see today various kinds of cars differ from its use and which are less expensive or do not need alot amount of gas.
 Although in the last few years cars were became dangrous for human health because it can pollute the air, but recently new generation of cars are appeared and it consider as a friend of the environment.
 What is more if we had not cars what we will do return to the back and ride donkies or depend on our foot. I can not immagine life empty from cars.
 The last reason why cars will still for ever it provid some jops for the people, such as drivers, mechanicans and  workers in the cars industry. 
 Therefore we can say that because of the many uses of the cars it will be found for ever and will not decrease and will be develope to be appropriate for any environment using many sources of power which are not harm for human.
