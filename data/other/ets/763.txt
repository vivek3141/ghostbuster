The goal of advertisements is to show  products better that they really are, so i agree with the statement.
 
 If business people use advertisements it is only to increase theirs benefits. Fot that, they need to sell more. By consequence, they have to shows that  their product is the best. For example, advetissements for French cheese. A "camembert" is the same everywhere. So to increase the sale, they try to increase some aspects like more cream. So with technology and artificial caracters the cheese looks better on TV or papers but in reality it is exactly the same that before.
 
 When you walk on the road, and you see an advertisemts you are most of the time attracted by the product. For example a chocolate advertissement, with the reflection of the light on the slab, the brown color is more dark so it looks better. But because the aspect of the picture is better, the products looks better. so advertisements plays with your sweety taste.
 
 Depend on the moment of the year where you are, advertiser plays with advertisements. For example, during christmas period, a certain product looks better than three months ago only because there is a better or different presentation. This is the focus of an advertisement  and in this case the only difference for the sale is the advertisement. 
 
 If you want to rise your benefits, there is also the way : increase the need. For example for a vacuum, the used is the same every way but if you underline the fact that it is easy to use or esay to put an board  the products looks better. But if you think about that a vaccum stays a vacuum and you will use exactly on the same maner and it is the same product.
 
 Due to the objectif of an advertisement, advertisement make products seem much better than they really are.
