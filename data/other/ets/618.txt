I agree this opinion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are three reasons why I think so. 
 First, young people spend much time studying and joining clubs. For example, they need to enter the good schools and get a good job in their future. Since I was 10 years old, my parents had told me to study hard to get good grades and go to a good school. My friends parents told so to my friends. So young people always have a lot of things to do, and they also don't have enough time to talk with their family. In order to get a good life for the future, young people belive that they need to make grate efforts, even though they don't have enough time to enjoy their daily life.
 Second, a number of young people is getting less interested their communities. In these days, people tend to talk to their friends through phones, emails, chats and so on, and they are getting less serious about the human relationship. Some of them may have little idea how toIt is one of the social problems. We need to talk to other people directly to solve this problem.
 Third,  young people don't know how to help their communities. They have no good idea what is the useful way to help their communities. So young people need to try to join their communities once. They will understand how to help their communities when they join them. 
 I explained three points why I agree this statement. In conclusion, young people need more time to join thier communities, to be interested in them and know what they can do for them.
