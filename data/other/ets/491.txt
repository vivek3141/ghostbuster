The topic at hand is whether it is better ,having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or detailed and specialized knowledge of one particular subject.I feel that depending upon the scope of application of the knowledge of a person ,the requirement can be broad or specific.The reasons are as follows:
 
 Certain professions for example that of a medical practitioner,requires him to have a broad based knowledge of the human body,the interliks between various parts and what effects a medicine for a particular disease could have on any otherbody part.
 Software professionals on the other hand donot necessarily need to have broad based knowledge of the functioning of the computer or its parts.For them a specialization in programming languages ,web page designing etc is what is required.Basically it is the application of the knowledge and using innovations that is important.For the case of a doctor , the more he knows the better he applies the overall knowledge.
 
 Then teachers of physical sciences for example need to have proper knowledge of subjects like physics ,chemistry ,mathematics,so that they are able to impart knowledge in a comprehensive way to the students and not poder over the doubts of the students.A chemist or a molecular bilogist needs to have specialized knowledge on the specific fields ,but less of other academic disciplines.
 
 Students on the other hand need to have broad based knowledge upto a certain level of educaton wherein all those subjects are addressed to which may find application ,though not in great detail  ahead in his proffessional career or practical life.After a certain level
 it depends upon the career path of the student,whether he chooses to specialize on a subject or increase his range of broad based knowledge. 
 Due to the endless ken of knowledge that could be accumulated,  the nature of knowledge that could  be possessed really depends upon the task at hand,the purpose for which it is required.
