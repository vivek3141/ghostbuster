I agree to this statement that successful people try new thing and risk rather only doing what they already know how to do well. It is tru about this statment that people who are success will never ever think that they will not get through any problem in life.
 When you have a possitive attitude in life you will really do good in your future, without risking your life we will not able to reach the destiny.I like to giv e an example;
 One of my friend tried to pass a exam, he tried several other ways to pass a exam but he was unsucessfu all the time. He has given the same exam sevaral times but he wus all the time unsucessful. when  i saw that he was not able to pass the exam after giving several time,i asked him what are you doing, what happened, he replied that i tried to cheat, copy from friends and i tried all type of trick i can but noting worked.
 Now i suggested him it is not easy to pass the exam, you should lot of deddication and hard work is needed. It is not a easy wory, if you make up your mind that i will do it at any cost than you will see one day you will pass the exam in very good marks.
 I disagree with th above statement that why shoud some one would risk the life to achive some thing in life. I dont  think that it will be a good idea to loose your life to achive something in lfe.
 So always sugest that not only sucessfull people or anybody in lfe should risk the life to be the best in life. It is prowd when you become sucess in life, you can always be an example to others.
