I completely agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Our modern world is full of such examples where people took risks and created new things. Upto a large extent, our modern age is made by these people. I will classify these activities in mainly two ways.
 
 First, where people just change the way in which we do  things. For example, take the music industry. Few year backs, music industry was dominated by the Walkman from Sony. If you wanted to hear music then you need to buy a walkman and cassettes. Sony thought that this was the best way but Steve Jobs from Apple had different ideas. He created i-pod where you can download your music in flash memory. This was more efficient and one can download large amount of music that was not possible with Walkmans. This made Steve Jobs famous but Sony lost a market because Sony executives were just making more efficient Walkmans. They never tried to try a new thing.
 
 Second, where people leapfrog the current way of doing things and create a totally different solution of the problem. For example, take the postal services. Earlier, if you want to send a letter to your loved ones then you have to write that in paper and send it by mail. It used to take time and process was in-efficient. Few people thought about the electronic transmission of information and internet was born. Now, sending a letter to someone is  a click away by e-mail. E-mail is much efficient and  much faster.
 
 Some people will not agree with the statement and they will say that trying new things is risky so we should not try new things. I would like to tell them that if our ancestors would have thought in the same way then we would have been living in stone world today. I agree that once you try new things then you might fail, but, learning lessons from failures and trying again makes some one successful.
