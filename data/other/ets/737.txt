People do many different things to enjoy their lives like travelling, playing sports, and . I totally agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do, at least this is true in the community where I grew up.  Young people have good health, take risk, want to explore new things.
 To begin, young people have good health.  To explain, person who is in a good physical health can enjoy palying different kinds of sports.  In addition, they are psychologically well, therefore; this make them friendly and open mind.  On the other hand, most older people ,either because they suffer of medical illness or of aging process, are unable to enjoy many sports
 Next, young people take risk more than older people so they enjoy life more.  To illustrate, they enjoy  climbing mountains.  Moreover, they enjoy risky competitions like racing.  While people affraid to climb a mountain or participate in a car racing because there may be something wrong will happen and loss their lives.
 Last, young people have stronger desire to explore new things.  To illustrates, young people in my country want to travel around the world.  For example, I travele to many countries to learn more about different cultures, food, and people.  While my father didn't travel outside my country at all.
 To conclude, every person wants to enjoy his or her life. However, young people enjoy life more than older people because they have in good condition, take risk, want to discover new things.
