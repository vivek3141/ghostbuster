I don't agree with the statement because of many reasons. 
 One reason could be the laziness of people. I think that many people like best moving by car than walking, because car is more comfortable and faster. 
 Another reason could be that nowadays cars are safer than in the past so I suppose that in the future they will be even safer than now. Improvements in producing will permitt avoiding many dangers and incidents,for example using super advanced airbags and staff like that. 
 Furthermore I can say that the increasement of population could be another good reason. I remember my grandfather's stories about cars. He used to tell me that in the past not many people could afford a car so they were fewer than now. In our society many people can afford a car, also using strategies like leasing or renting. The population has expanded and migrated from the centre of big cities to the nearby towns, like countryside or small towns. More people now need a car to go to work in big cities or even in another city. 
 Another important reason is the bad quality of the public transport.
 Often it is difficult to move from town to town using public transport because trains are delayed or the station is far from home. The subway also is not so efficient. Sometimes it is even unpleasent to use public transport because it is dirty, or broken in many ways. 
 For all these reasons I think that in twenty years there will be more cars than today. I think that almost everyone thinks that driving a car is much more pleasent than taking a train. Population will continue to grow up, and in my opinion more people means more cars, with all its implications like traffic and pollution.
