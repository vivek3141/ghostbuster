There are many kinds of people in the world, some are trying to be in better place and other who accepting there life as it is, what makes the diffrence is the person him self and the dreams he has for him also the future he pictures.
 We often hear successful people when they talk about there experiance talking about the obstcles they faced and the risks they took to acheive what they want, so its not an easy thing to do , there are so many reasons shows that success is not an easy thing to acheive.
 First, you have to try new things and the more you try the more chances you get to succeed, for exampel not all atempt succeed from the first time but it could hapen in the second or third time.
 second, as every one knows the global concept that says "the more risk you take the more binifits you get" so in order to be success you have to take the risk like taking big amout os a loan to start a busines.
 in my openion, i think that being a successfull person need much effort than every one thinks and in rder to be success you have to take more riks than ordinary people.
