Although I can understand people, who think that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, I think that speacializing in one specific subject is better. I want to point out my opinion with the following 3 arguments. First of all, in ancient time, the greeks and romans needed manz academic skills. For example, Aristoteles was a philosophist, mathematic and a astrophologist. They needed these many specialisations to earn money. But since Henry Ford invented the construction band, the specialisation expanded.
 Secondly, you have to be a genius to have a broad knowlodge of many academic subjects. For example students need three or four years to study only one academic subject. So it would cost the person a lot of time to get a broad knowledge. Furthermore studies are not for free. The person would also need a lot of money, and this is not very effective, as he or she don't earn a lot more money, when they start working. So in fact, you should study two things side by side. But this request a high IQ, which only a few people have.
 Last but not least, as mentioned in the beginning, specialisation is needed today in every work. Today companies search for specialised workers in only one specific subject. The work does not require other academic subjects. So a person with a broad knowledge would propably be annoyed, doing this job. So the company will propably prefer the specialised worker. 
 I study business, this is already a specialisation, but i have to pick out only one part of business. For example, controlling or finance management and when I work in a big company I even have to go deeper into specialisation in one aspect of controlling or finance managment. And by doing this I have to learn every day new things, so I will never have the time to learn other academic subjects.
