We can say the most of the young people (not all of them) enjoy life more than older once. The causes of that is that they do not bare big responsibilities on there shoulders, they are only responsible of themself and most of the time they can rely on the help of the parents if they are in trouble; This category is composed mainly composed of high school or university students. And an important factor that young's tend to explore life more, try new experiences, go places they never visited. An important factore also is the biological factore, young people have the energy to try new stuff and enjoy there life to the max .
 
 In the opposite, old people mostly have big responsibilities. Most of them have children who dependent of them. They have to povide stability inside there famillies; financial  and psychological. Old poeple calculate more there steps, they cannot take risks because any false step can have bad consequences on them and there dependent. We do not have to forget the bilological factor in here also, old people cannot have the same eager and the energy to explore and they are not vibrant as the youngs.
 
 
 But the last 2 paragraphes do not represent all the population. There are lots of young people who have big responsibilites because they cannot depend on others for help, so they have to work to support themself and sometimes support there famillies. This category of youth do not enjoy its life as others. We have also old people who have financial security and stability, this category  tend to enjoy life more.
 
 Then as a conclusion this statement don't have a simple YES or NO answer. Agreeing or desagreeing to it depends of personality of the person's personality, his environement and his responsibilities.
