Some people thinks that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities while some others thinks that they do.
 For those who think they does give the reason that lots of young people would go out and do free survices for orphanage as well as other non profitable survices in educational commities and etc. For example we can see that lots of students enter clubs or teams that goes out around the neighborhood to help out those who are in need. This can be seen much more clearly at US and North America.
 However for those who think that the young people doesn't do enough survices point out that most young people just focus on their own leisure activities when they have free time or just go and get more work to earn more money instead of paying attention to the communities. For example they give out the fact that young people nowadays spend more and more time on surfing the internet as well as doing sport instead of free community survices since that they don't actually get any benifit from it.
 As for me, I personally agrees to the idea that young people nowadays don't spend enough time to help out for their communities, on the conditions that they are living in Asia or non English speaking countries. The fact is that in non speaking countries such as Asia young people tends to focus more on school work and how to get better degree such as master degree or PHD. However in North America, the school requires the student to help out the communities at least 2~5 hours a semester, which means while those young people goes to school they receives the idea of helping out the communities instead of just focus on the academics.
 In conclusion, I only agree to the condition of that the young people are not spending enough time to help out the communities when they are living in the non English speaking countries such as Europe or North America
