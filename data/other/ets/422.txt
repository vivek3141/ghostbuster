There are many differences in the world from the way it was in the  past , young people are one of those categories which were effected by the changes. I completly agree with the statement that young adults do not give enough time to help by giving  a helping hand in  their communities. There are many reasons for this thought, first, the young adults were not raised by their families to carry out the responsibility of a person other than themselves,food is provided to their tables, plus as much money as they want without any kind of work no matter how old they are!  And as a result there are some who can't be responsible even for their ownselves let alone contributing to their community!. Also, we can't deny the many attractions around  young adults, which makes it impossible for them to be part of any positive community work many movies, gamesand other attractions which had made them forget any kind of resposibility. Finally, some young people have a very negative ideas about themselves, and they have no positive feedback from the elders of their family or community, they always procieved with coutions from people around them. All that and much more could be the factors behind the low number of young people participating in community services.
