Many people like to go trip. Nowadays peole can go anywhere they want by air plane or train, or even car. When you plan to go trip, which do you prefer taking part in tour guide, or traveling yourself? In my case, I prefer second one. I want to go travel with my plan because of three reasons; do not have to follow dislike plan, can meet a lot of local people, and can save money than tour guide. 
 First reason is that I do not want to follow some dislike plan that tour guide planned. Sometimes I try to take part in tour guide travel, however, many times I find my dislike plan. If you take part in a tour guide, you have to follow all thier activities whether you like or not. On ther other hand, if you plan your travel plan by yourself, you can plan activities that just you like.
 Second reason is that I want to meet a lot of local people. If I travel with my tour menber, probably I never try to meet, and talk with some local people because I would think that it is better to enjoy with my member than local people. Although it is good to enjoy travel with tour member, my porpose or travel is meetting somme local people, so I want to travel with my plan.
 Third reason is that people can save thier money if they decide to travel with thier own plan because if you want to take part in traveling tour, it is necessary to pay money, and it is more expensive than plan of yourself. Nowadays people can find cheap tour guide plan, but if you can go to travel company or can use the Inter net, you can find chear hotel or transpotation. Therefore it is better to plan travel plan yourself.
 In conclusion, it is better for me to go trable with my plan than taking part in tour guide because it is not necessary to follow some dislike plans, can get more oppotunities to meet and communicate with local people, and can save money. Of course, tour guide also have some good points, but it is more suit for me.
