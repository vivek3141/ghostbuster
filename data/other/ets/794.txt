I agred by following statement that is young people enjoy life more than older people.because the old people dont have  that much intersted in enjoying the life as well as they dont have engry also.In young people engry is more and they want to enjoy a life.
 the old people have lot have tentions and they dont have  a time to enjoy.and they are busy with they works and they also have more responsabilities than young people.
 young people want to enjoy the life.these people dont have tensions so they enjoyd alot.and no body will scolld them.and  the young people thought that this is the wright time for enjoing so they dont want to loose it.the old people also enjoyed at the time when they are young so after they becaome old they dont have a interest to enjoy. they have intersted in how to improve their  devolepments.
 the young people enjoy a lot .for example on new year celabreations or on any birth day parties  they have played  with friends.
 and  the yong people have more number of friends rather than old ones. so they enojy with friends.and the young people have new thoughts for how to develop  there career.  
 Young people do any thing but the old people are not.
 for example the young people play cricket for long time and they also swime for long time  etc. but some old people have that much strength.
 In young people the stamina and engry or strength  is more rather than old once.
