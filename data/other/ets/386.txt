I personally believe that the number of cars will increase in the following twenty years.
 The only thing that may inhibit this trend is a strong committment, supported by all the important Countries, to the safety of the environment.
 
 I will try to support my opinion considering the following arguments:
 - urbanistic patterns; 
 - "car habits" evolution;
 - the distribution of wealth;
 - other means of transport's trend;
 - purpose for which people move;
 - last, but not less important, individual economic conditions.
 
 Urbanistic patterns
 Cities are changing shape and numerous studies and researches state that in twenty years nearly 90% of the population will leave in city areas. This might increase the need of cars. A limitation would be given by local laws intended to manage the trafic, for example inhibiting the access to downtown.
 
 "Car habits" evolution
 Technology is helping to make cars into in more and more efficient means of transport, with lower cost than in the past. This might increse the number of people who can afford to buy a car.
 This point is strictly connected with that of the "distribution of wealth".
 
 The evolution of the other means of transport is strictly linked with politics and the big issues tackled by governaments. If Governaments choose to enlarge public spending supporting the constructions of trains, subways, and all the other "public" means of transport, people will be offered an alternative to the car, but if Governaments miss this point, cars will still be used as a preferential way to move from one place to another.
 
 Another point is the reason why people move, that might be business, leisure, etc..
 In the last few years the number of people moving for leisure purpose is increasing and this, combined with the fear to move away from home due to recent terroristic attacks, may increase the use of cars.
 
 All of this is true only if individual economic conditions remain those of today (or even better). But if this doesn't happen, there will be no money for cars. Perhaps no money for anything!
