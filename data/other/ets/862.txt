I don't consider myself as a successful person. However my brother do rather well in a specific field that is gymnatics. And I have noticed that he  has recently    started  playing tennis. So I have had the opportunity to figure out that  when  people are fairly good at praticing an activity, they often   try  to do different things. There are two main reasons that support my viewpoint.
 One of the reason which support this statement is that when one is successful, he often wants to explore other fiels to figure out what he is worthing. Taking risks, having an other kind of experiences proves to be beneficial in that it  enables you to know what you can do, what your skills are . Trying news things is a kind of challenge to yourself. for instance , i am quiet sure that my brother decided to start playing tennis because it was a way to pushing out his limits. He probably though that since he was very good at gym, what he won't be as good at playing tennis!
 However, trying to make different things to those that you already know how to do is not only motivated by  personal reasons. Taking risks is both a personal and a public achievement. As a matter of fact, i imagine that successful persons are also tempted to impress people around them. Friends, family are conducive to improving their skills and to be even more talented.  Successful persons are probably prone to increase the public recognition they already have. trying new things is one opportunity to do that and to be even more acclaimed.
