There are two different aspects which makes the question difficult to answer if it is better to have broad knowledge or to specialize in one specitic subject. 
 At first if you study undergraduate it is neccesary to get a lot of information from diffrent academic subjects. Because you do not know anything about that subject you study and so you have to lern a lot. You have to learn practical things like how to prepare an essay or how do i have to work out my letters for the proffesors or maybe how can i regestrade me in the system at the university. Also you have to learn a lot of stuff to get the ability to talk with someone around your topic.It is necessary to know the topic.I will give an example if you are studying architecture you have to know how to build a house if you do not know this it makes no sence to learn other things like interior design.So  If you do not kmow basics you can not go on futher. Therfore i found it very importent to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects.
 Second if you are a graduate student who know the pasics he can consentrade on speciffic subjects. Maybe for interrior design or special concrets. In the upper classes i would say  you have to specifies your topic.
 However at the end i have to say that it gives no genuraly answer on this question. It depense on you life situation.
