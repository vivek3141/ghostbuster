It's very much interesting topic to write on.Yes i agree with the phrase that the successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.The people who are successeded know the formula to achieve different goals in life than the unsuccessful persons.when the people get success in doing things they get more confidence and try to do different things to get more money and fame.
 At present the successful persons are taking huge risks to attain more money and name,this is because they have the strength in manys ways like money,confidence,faith in the other people also.The person who is not successful cannot do any risks because he is not having enhalf money,confidence,strength in mind,and also faith in the other people.
 Just see now,we have many examples in this world of successful and unsucessful persons.Just take a month back TATA company chairman Ratan Tata buyed the stakes of steel company for much high price in the world.He is having the confidence and he is the first person in india to buy the stakes for such a high price.He knows the way to grow the bussiness, and an unsuccessful can he buy the stakes for such a high price.Take another example if once a person takes a picture which is a variety one and gets succeded and another takes a regular film which be flop,who again take the risk of the talking another variety film,definetly the successful one.
 So I agree that the successful persons take risks rather than only doing what they already know.I hope most the persons agree with topic because every one know the value of success in life.
