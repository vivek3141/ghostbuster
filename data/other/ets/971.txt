When people travel, some people visit a place with a group of people led by  tour guide while others travel by themselves. People who travel in a group might have their reasons for doing so. However, I think traveling in a group is bad.
 Fist of all, traveling in a group led by a tour guide does not usually fit your favor. During the journey to China with my school friends, we were led by a tour guide. From the beggining, there were many discontents between students. All of us wanted to visit super famous market in Shanghai but the tour guide didn't let us. He just said that he can't let us because it was not the part of the plan. Following the schedule, we just had to see many similar boring temples for three days.
 Also, you cannot get to know the place really well if you travel in a group. You won't have many chances to enjoy the place. You'll just have to stay awake following the line. Again, when I went to 
 China, I really wanted to have an experience of using Chinese. But once when I was trying to have a talk with Chinese, I got reproved from the tour guide for not following him. It made me feel bad not to have spoken Chinese even once, though I stayed there for 5 days.
 Some people might argue that trying by yourself can increase the danger of yourself becasue you're not used to thet place. But this is the thing that I want to point out for the last. As you don't know the place a lot, you might do more research for the place you are going to visit. Eventually, you will get more amusement when you actually arrive at the place. Furthermore, you will prepare some solution in case of danger. Nobody can be so sure that traveling in a group is safer. Rather I think there will be more danger because there is almost no solution in case  you get lost from the line.
 For these three reasons, I strongly suggest that traveling  in a group led by a tour is bad. I really do want to recommend traveling by yourself or just with your family.
