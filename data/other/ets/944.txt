Is it better to have a good culture in a lot of subjects or to know only one of them but deeply? There could be a lot of opponent opinions about this topic and it isn't easy to make an accurate response without studying the real needs people.
 
 Having a knowledge of many subjects usually implies that none of them is known accurately. Maybe, a person that chooses this kind of education will increase his or her ability to understand concepts from many areas of knowledge more easily than other people. For example, it's obvious that a student in Information Technology engeenering have to receive a lot of information from a lot of materias, from Maths to Physics, from Electronics to Computer Science and Automations, that will help him to improve his knowledge in a specific technical field when he will need to.
 
 On the other hand, the impact with the real working life can be require a specialization in a specific field of knowledge, so a person that studied with this in mind, maybe will find work more easily using his specific attitude. The problem is that if it will be the need to make a different job, a person that concentrated his preparation on a topic only could be find a lot of difficulties. For example, talking about a student in engeenering again, we know that technologies may change very quickly, so someone that specialized him or her in a field that maybe won't exist tomorrow could will find a lot of problems in the working life.
 
 Maybe there is not a better solution. I think that schools have to help students to improve their capacity to learn new concepts more efficiently and rapidly is possible and to show them more topics is possible about many areas of knowledge that they will study more deeply when there will be the specific need.
