I totally agree with the given statement  "It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts".  Facts are there to remain, but the knowledge would create directions for a new creation or new development and a new mindset . 
 
 As a student is young and has lot of capability to think, he has to capability to invent. Inventions happen where there is complete knowledge and understanding of what you are thinking of. Once the student understands the ideas and concepts, he starts visualizing them. The understanding of one idea or concept would lead to understanding many more concepts, because everyting is so inter related . The ideas would give the student a direction in which he can think and develop better ideas. He has the authority over the subject and ozzes with confidence and makes him a wise person.
 
 If I were to compare two people who have read a particular theory and one of them, say person 'A' has thouroughly understood the whole concept and person 'B' has not understood the theory at all but has mugged the whole theory, then the person 'B' according to me is no less than a computer, knows everything but has no knowledge whatsover as to what he has read. And person 'A' is human, the most intelligent animal. Person 'B' cannot put into utilization what he has read, just like how a computer can do nothing on itself,  because he has not understood anything whereas, since person 'A' has understood the concept he can research and develop in that area. Facts are important but understanding the ideas and concept is most important.
