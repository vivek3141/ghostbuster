Although a lot of people believe that young people enjoy life more than older peolpe, i strongly disagree this belief. Enjoying the life doesn' t depend on people's age because it depends on people's vision, expectation from life, and spirit.
 
 Even though  some people become young and, they aren' t happy with life in that their vision is not enough to be happy. They think that some small obsctacles prevent them to be happy. For instance, I know a lot of old people they try to enjoy the life though they have some disablities. They are attend many activities to learn new things and have a good time. These are normal for them because this is their vision.
 
 People expectations from the life change when they are different age. Older people believe that the most important thing is in the life is to be happy and they try to be happy during their older age on the grounds that they know better than young people that life is really short and they are doing their best during this time unlike young people.
 
 Lastly, people's spirit is the other essential factor in people lives. To be younger person is not important. This only provides people some advantages. For example, to  spend more energy and do many things in a short time  but  old people organize their lives to do  more things (like trip, sports, etc..) to enjoy the life. 
 
 Consequently, to be happy is not really related with people age. There are other significant factors affects
