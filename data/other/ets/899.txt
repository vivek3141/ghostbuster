In my opinion, succcesful people try to new things while they are  with many mistakes,and they will keep until  it  will be  success what  they  want to make somothing .For example,Egyison Tohmas who made a electolonic things.He is familier with everyone and he is popular person for successful.So I agree with successful people try new things and take risks.There are  two reasons.One reason is seccess and failuer are conected always.When i learn cooking first time.I couldn't cook anything even though just cut foods,at that time I cut my hands,yet when I cooked a food second times,it was a success.Another reasons is try new things are discover somthing new ever I haven't knew things.I like to know new things and I don't care what kind of risks.Thus I think It is important to try new things and take risks for successful people.
