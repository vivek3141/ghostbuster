The travel is in a group led by atour guideThat is good thing. For many people and i,one of them it is good. In my opinin i have many reason to travel is in groupe by the atour guide. 
 One of these reason it if i travel with many people that means many different iead to visit diffrenet places.Scond reason it is if i go with group we need somebody to explaine for us about new things which we can see it. Many times different opinin between people make big problem. So for nice trip wondrful trit we need leader. forexample, last summer i went to visit old city in my country.This city had long hoistry. It is amazing city.I and my friend desaid to get  atour guide and it was perfect ieada. We go to visit all the old plaeces and we got alot of information about this city. this city called Alall. The atour guide who went with us is very friendly person.He showed us many interesting thins.He helped us to understand what the big pictrue about  Alall.
 We can consider the lost or the fread from the lost strong reason to get atour guide.He can make the trip easy and more save.More save because he know more than the visitores about the pleace.
 I think the atour guide help people to make good plan for the trip.The  people can take good experarince from him about the places or about the people.The smart atour guide can make all the people with him remmber her when the tripe finshe. Many people think this job easy but it is not. It need profisional people.
