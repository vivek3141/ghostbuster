I agree with that "The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide".	
 The great oppourtinity to go to some different places comes.It's better to go by group and with a tour guide.Because,we don't know the history of the places and we don't know the manoments of  the place.If we have an tour guide,Then he knows all about the history of the place.
 While we are having a tour guide,we have no worry about to plan a schedules for were to vist.Because,the tour guide knows all the places in perticular location or all.He may planes the schedules by our requirments.Generally,he knows all places and moreover he is having myraid collection for the historic events which we have to know.Which is the best place to see first and which is the place to see last.
 The tour guide guides where we have to  stay,approximate budget  for the planning of the tour.And he may knows the shortcuts to vist more places and bording and lodging facautilies.He explains about the places with there people cultures,behavoiurs and historic events of that places.
 We may save the money while we are having a tour guide by his right direction  about the shopping,lodging,boarding etc.Because,he is having lack of experiance in travelling and in demonistration different places.
 If we are able to go without guide.Then some of the problems will occurs as,we don't know the specific location correctly.We don't know where we have vist moreover we don't know the historic events of the places.We may have a chance to divert the root maps.
 So,It's better to go with the tour guide who is very helpfull in all different angles.
