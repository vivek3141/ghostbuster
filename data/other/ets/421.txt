I totally agree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time for upliftment of their communities. The reason behind this is that this young generation do not have enough time to devote it to their communities because of their busy routines and immense pressure of work.
 our society has changed dramatically in last couple of decades with growing population and increasing pressure on our existing resources.  This growing population has implied immense pressure on young people for their survival because there are limited number of jobs available which are very less than required, so what happens is that these young people devotes most of their time in studying and competing with each other.As a result there is no time for them to think about the community they live in. For ex: a person looking forward for his bright future will be more interested in his education & job opportunities and will not be much concerned about his community.
 I personally think that our community has changed to such a point which is not much suitable for young people. Earlier there was less competition and less pressure as compared to now, so at that time people were more concerned about their community and had the time to devote it to for the upliftment of their society.
 Secondly, in today's context everyone is looking from his perspective only and care a damn about their society. There is a lack of interest in public participation from  young people. For ex: young people prefer watching a movie whenever they get time instead of helping for a social cause like awareness camp for AIDS, which will benefit their society.
 So I think time has changed, conditions have changed, mental perspective of an individual has changed which has  resulted in this situation.
