It is really hard to say if young people enjoy life more than older people do, because, I mean, they probably could both enjoy the life in different ways. However, I will try to give different reasons to support my opinion which is that young people enjoy life more than older people do.
 First of all, young people have less years that the old one. Is it important? Well, my answer is yes. Why you do not think from a physycal point of view for example about the strenghtness? Young people can do lots of physical exercise to keep their bodies in shape and do sports having fun. Unfortunatly, fun that older people can not have because are weak or they have diseases that make their body prone to trauma.
 Secondly, the soul, the spirit of young people has a positive attitude toward the life. Why you do not think about the lackness of experiences of young people, expecially the negative experiences of adults or the consequences of certain bad behaviors? Young people have this advantage to explore their life without basing on the past and doing so they can enjoy life more and better. Therefore, young people can program their life to have success, and when they reach success they really can enjoy their life. 
 Thirdly, young people have the possibility to build a family, having kids which are I think the best part of the life of a young person. Kids really give you the force to enjoy your life and to go through the different problems that you will encounter.
 In conclusion, for the above mentioned reasons I strongly believe that young people can really enjoy life more than older people
