I'm in complete agreement with this sentence, because I can experience this problem in the city where  I live.
 Nowadays young people are too busy in school and afternoon activities like sports and music, so that they haven't time (and sometimes no desire) to help their community; it was different not so many years ago, when boys hadn't the same opportunities to keep their life busy with enterteining activities; for this reason, although many of them had to work hard since their childhood, they tried to spend their time with some friends in activities which helped thier communities.
 As I said before, I can experience the lack of children's partecipation in the life of the community in my own city.
 For example, in occasion of the annual festival for the saint protector of the city, each year the inhabitants of my city organizes a big festival; actually it's a good one, well organized and joyfull, but the problem is that since I could remember it has always been the same, each year the same kind of festival as the previous one; well, I address the cause of this "routine" to the fact that no young people join in the organization of the festival, so that a great source of ideas and renewment aren't used.
 But it's only a small example belonging to my own space of life.
 Anyway I could find more significant ones; I mean a bigger problem of distrust that young people feel towards society and a consequent absence from its life. More and more people aren't interested  in political life of communities anymore; and a proof is that the political class of today has an average age very high; there are no young boys who has the fervour to enter the political life and bring a new young fresh air of renewment.
