The issue at hand, is who does enjoys life,  young people or old people??This subject is an interesing one, because it challanges all ages to enjoy life regardeless of their age. From my point of view, I believe that younger people enjoy life more than older ones because they have all the capabiliities, health, and energy to enjoy life. 
 
 The first reason I believe that younger people enjoy life more than older ones is because they have the motivation  towards life, and life without motivation is like a car without oil. For example a young person will work hard towards improving his job description, or his capabilities, and from my point of view this is an ejoying experience. Wheras, an older age person does not have the motivtion nor energy towards achieving any of his remaining goals. 
 
 Another reason I believe that young people enjoy life more is that they have the facilities to face all srrounding problems and obstacles. Obstacles that affect in daily life, obstacles challanges the younger peolple, and thus makes life more enjoyable rather than depressing them. However, older people will be depressed while facing problems, and they might not be able to face such encouuntering problems.
 
 Furthermore, young people are healthier than older ones, so they can move easily, and enjoy all the entertainments in life, such as travelling, swimming, practice sports,....ect.  Wheras older peope do not have the capabilities to enjoy entertainments in life.
 
 Finally, for the mentioned points, I believe that younger people enjoy life more that older ones, because they are the ones who accelarates the life process, and they are the ones who enjoy this.
