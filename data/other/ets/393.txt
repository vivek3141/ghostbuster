I don't agree with the following statement:"Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well". I think that the correct statement will be the exact opposite. I'm gonna defend my point of view first by prooving that to success people need to study, then the success need to been build step by step and finally the success is coming from others trust.
 
 Fist of all, I personnaly think that to succeed, studying is needed. Going to college is not a risk but the opposit, an insurrance in life. That an invest in life to a better future and and a secure one. Of course going to college can be see as something new at the beginning, but it's not exactelly like that. It's more like a continuation of a reach to knowledge. By having a degree, people learn how to do something good.
 
 The second reason why I disagree with this statement is because I think that success is something which needs to be built. It's not coming easely and fast. That's a long daily work and to increase chance to achieve it, stability is requiere. Runing and rushing from one plan to an other one won't lead no where.
 
 Finally, I think that to success in life trust from folks is a must have. Without trust there is no possible real success. And taking risk is the worst way to reach that trust from people around. Again, the trust is something to build day after day. And to get it a knowledge in the activity is also requiere, nobody is gonna trust somebody new in a realm who doesn't know what he is talking about.
 
 Of course success can come to someone who is taking risk, but it's like the lottery it is happening to one in a million. I think that knowledge, stability and trust are the keys to success.
