It is important to have a good background and have a broad knowledge but there is a point when specializing in one specific subject is needed.  
 
 There is no doubt that a proffessional needs a broad knowldege of many diffferents subjects to build a strong background. For example a petroleum engineer, like me,  must take a lot of subjects which could appearently not be related to what a petroleum engineer needs to learn in order explore, exploit or process oil. Such is the case of subjects like learning techniques, computer programming or environmental education but those subjects definetely help on the way you learn the specialized subjects as in learning techniques, or how a program can be used to solve a problem on computer programing or even how to prevent an environmental impact during any stage of oil process.
 
 Although all those subjects mentioned before and others, can give an engineer a good background, after that point an engineer must specialized to focus the atention on a major in wich, as I can see, the more work an attention you pay on the more you will be able to succed on. Continuing with the example, on petroleum engineering,  there are three major specifique branches: reservoir, drilling and production,  acording to wich the attention will be focussed on find and characterize the location of the place where the hydrocarbon is, to create the conditions to bring the oil to the surface or to handle it when it has reached the surface respectively. In order to specialize on one of those field or branches, specific subjects must be taken.
 
 According to what I've previously pointed, I think that is important to specialize, as in the example mentioned above, in one mayor field wich can lead to an focused attention environment in a major that would be studied and researched resulting on an improved and focused knowledge.
