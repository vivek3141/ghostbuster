Nowadays, there are so many ways to transport from one place to another. There's the airplane, the train, the subway, the bus, the car and etc. And still, people are thinking up new ideas for transportation. As more and more methods for getting around are created, maybe the old methods, like cars, will sooner or later decrease. Well, it could happen.
 An example of my family might as well give you a view of what I'm trying to explain. One day, my family and I were going to go downtown. After thinking about all situations, my parents decided  to take the car and my sisters and I decided to try the subway that was made recently. Later on, my sisters and I had to wait 30 minutes until our parents arrived! The subway was way faster than the car and they had used 60,000 won to feed fuel to the car. They indeed regretted their decision.   
 As you can see, science and technology has made a big effort in inventing different ways of transporting. In my region, Dae-jeon, for example, recently subways have been made in order to tranport throughout the rather large city. Many people are using this transportation method and are pleased with the convenience and speed compared to the buses or cars. Also people use the subways because it's more cheaper. Nowadays, in my country Korea, the gasoline cost has risen so high that having a car means paying almost 15,0000 won per month. Not to mention the other costs that you need to pay while maintaining a car.      
 Therefore about twenty years later there will be fewer cars in use than there are these days. As the era develops rapidly, people prefer the faster and more convenient methods. And cars don't fit with these factors that well.
