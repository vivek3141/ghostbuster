Intelectual or practical what will be the best for us? about if it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts that is for them to learn facts, i believe learn facts are more important than memorice and idea or a concept because about a fact you can develop and idea or a concept. 
 When we want to develop or introduce an Idea or concept we have to demostrate we are in the right position with a fact, without a fact the idea doesnt works.
 For an example: In some forestal and agricultural schools the students learn making with their hands what they should learn, they go to the feels and work that is the way they learn, this is a very way to teach.
 another example: when we are kindergarden students the persons whos taking kare about us do not teach us first a concept, they teach us first how to make the thing.
 In ciences for scientisfhics or a manager in a bussines the facts are more importants than concepts, that doesnt mean that concepts can not help us, but all we learn at school be really helpful to us just in the time we use this in the real life.
 so that way i believe that facts are more important that concepts and ideas, because you can infer and idea because of a fact.
 How i believe that in some schools should be more practical, this way the ideas or concepts that the school or teacher want we learnd wont be so easy to forget, because with a fact we can remember and important idea, and another thing is having a fact in a class will be make us more interesting the compreention or even teachers can atract the students more than a regular class.
