I agree successful people will try new things and take the risk. First of all, When we were young, we try lots of new things because we have to, but sometime, we take risk to be successed. I believe successful people are different than normal people, They will not scared the risks so they try the new thing. Therefore, we always enjoy new high technolgy product because they try.
 
 Secondly, if people just do they same thing over and over, they willnot know what the good at and they will never improve themselve, they should try new things when they were young, to tell yourself you can be do what another people did, even better than them.For example, you are vice president in company, because you did a good job in the company, but the president get fired, you want to keep your position or get the highest position if you take the risks which is get fire from the boss. You never know if you don't try. 
 
 Thridly, since we already did well in something, why you don't chanllage high level to widen your eyes. If you know the mistakes you have made, you just don't take the mistake again, and then next time you will do better. so on you will be successed in your job. For example, you work in one store for a long time,you already  tried lots of things, learn a lots in the store, you knew how to run a company and do well, and now you want to open your own store, you just need to take risks and make yourself successed.
 
 In couclusion, it's because lots of people try new things and they were successful, so that oue live standand is getting mych more higher, we can't stop all the time, otherwise, our live never improve.
