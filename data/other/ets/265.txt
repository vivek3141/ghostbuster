Succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.
 
 
 In first I think who it' s very important to take risks or try new things because the innovation it is the best quallity for pass in the life.
 For example if I open a restaurant i would like who he is different of others restaurants. it is very important who are difference between my restaurant and the others.The most quality of one cretors it is a innovation.
 
 In second it' s true who take risks and try new things it's not a good idea because it is very dangerous . If I open a restaurant with a new concept it's not mentionned that I will have a good results at the begining. It is a risk : we take it or we not take it.
 
 I understand that people try new things and take risks but I think who it is very dangerous but we must try or take risks for pass in the life.
