First I am going to examine, why people are successful. From my point of view people are often successful, since they first tried to do new things and took certain risks and, second, they did one thing for a long time. If people do one thing for a long time, they should get better and should know how to do it well after a time.
 For this reason people often do what they already know how to do well, when they are successfull. But they often also tried new things and took risks. Therefore I cannot really agree with the statement, but I also cannot really disagree. In contrary to the statement there are people who even do both of the alternatives. For instance, my teacher of martial arts tries always to do new things, but also stays doing things he already knows very well.
 That is why I think that successful people neither try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already nor do what they already know rather than trying new things. Another reason for not being able to directly answer the question is that there are also people who are successful, but neither ever tried new things nor really know what they are doing. For example, a friend of mine only had to take over the company of his parents to succeed. He makes increasingly much earning with his firm without really knowing what he does. And moreover he never had to try new things and he did not even take risks.
 To put it all into a nutshell you are not able to make such general claims on successful people like in the statement. Nonetheless if I had to choose whether the statement is right or not, I would finally agree, since successful people could tend to try new things rather than doing what they already know. But that cannot be generalized.
