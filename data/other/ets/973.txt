In the learning phase student will come across many subject wich are useful in his feature, so  some body think that these unnessary subject included in the education few students are facing some difficulties but this not true, for suvival of present situation there is a need to come across variety topics.
 In the graduation program an student will take only few subjects for the specilisation purpose  for example, for the specilgaton power system stability in master of sceience in electrical engineering, for these specilisation there is lot of maths i required, for doing project also we requre lot fundamentals in other subject also.
 Including the diffirent topics in education is also problem to the student, due to incrising the subjects the mental stress also incrises, due to this additional burden he may not concentrated on hisintrsed fied of subject.
 By simply learning few subjects is actually not sufficient for higher studies while the phase burden was incriseeing on the students keep in mind these effects on the situation the governament will plan  for the requirments.
 So finally my openion is knowledge on subejects is depends on the level of study, up to undergratuation level it is better to have brod knowledge of many academic subjects and in gradutation level it is better to have brod knowledge on any one speciligation.
