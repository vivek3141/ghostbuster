I agree with this statement.  advertisements only state the advantage of products.  If the products have bad point, we can't notice it, because advertisements can hide the problems of products.
 There are many advertisements in our life, for example firstfood restrants, newspaper, magazines and so on.  Advertizements appeal the many good points of products to attract customer.  If the products don't have any advertizements, customers can't notice the existance of products even if products are new one, customer may be not able to recognize it.  It is the big problem for the seller to sell the products a lot, so advertizements really affect the products to seem much better than they are.
 Advertizements appeal the good points strongly, so they don't state the bad points, even if the products have problems.  Many customers often see the good points of the product when they buy something,  so they don't take care for the bad points.  Therefore, if rthe company appeal the products with advertizements, customers can't notice the problems more, and customers think that the problems seem much better than they really are.  Advertisements really affect the products to be seen much better than the real.
 In conclusion, advertisements are the good factor to make the products seem much better than really are, because they can appeal the good points of the products, even if they don't have.  Also, they can remove the bad points of products when they states, even if the products have issues.  Therefore, advertisements make products seem much better than they reall are.
