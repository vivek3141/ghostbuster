I clearly contradict the statement "It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to speciaslize in one specific subject".It is better if we specialize in one particular subject as we can gain the complete knowledge about that particular subject rather than knowing inadequate small amounts of knowledge in various subjects.To have complete grip on one subject one should  put his complete concentration in one subject,but if we try to gain knowledge from every other subject the concentration gets distracted.
 
 It is better to be a king of one subject than being a jack of every subject.As an example if we take a doctor,he has complete knowledge of his subject,but if he studies other Business or Art subjects along with medical subject he can never become a succesful doctor,same in the case of a Bussiness Administrator,if he concentrates on other things his business may suffer a loss.So,it is always advisible to gain complete knowledge about the particular profession or subject.
 
 One of my uncle was interested in learning all the subjects which he came across,and to fullfill his interest he didnt concentrate on any one subject but tried to master all the subjects and was finally left with inadequate knowledge about each of them.As a contrast my father was interested in being a succesful bussiness man and from childhood concentrated on his subject of interest and now became a famous business magnet.This clearly depicts the advantages of speacializing a particular subject and on the otherhand disadvantages of trying to gain knowledge from all the subjects.
 
 Thus I clearly want to state that one should master in one subject which can give him a great monetary or social gains rather than trying to master all the subjects and ultimately fail to do so.
