I think that young peopledo not have to enjoy older people do. 
 Nowadays, young people get to forget gladness for older people. 
 There are mother, father, grandfather, grandmother and so on in older people. They hade made our country and era. We do not have to forget that. Therefore, young people have right to enjoy our life, but it is bad that they enjoy life more than older people.  
 For example, we have known that father and mother had taken care of us since we had been born. Moreover, grandfather and grandmother had done the same as our parents. Therefore, we have to show our appreciate emotion for them. 
 There are older people who experiment war. I think even if young people do not try to enjoy their life, they can enjoy life more than them. And now, young people can go school, play with friends and eat good foods own older people. 
 Therefore young people must think over that what they shoud do instead of older people more than eonjoying life. 
 And this action will make our countries and world. Our lives connect each other. Life of grandparents connects parents, and life of parents connects their children.
