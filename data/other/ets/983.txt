As my opinion, learning fact is more important than understanding concepts.There are some reasons. 
 
 First, the fact can make people have deep impression. Everyone will have a deep impression when he meets the difficulties. As you solve the problems, you will undersdtand more about the ideas or concept you learned. Solving the difficulty is also the energy for learning. You will be confident after you solve it.
 
 Second, the ideas we learned in school are conceptional. They are the conclusion after experment or research. They are the base of knowledge. After school, you will have basic knowledge to face the fact you will happen in the future.Although ideas are the parment elements in your study, you have to face any difficulty in your career. 
 
 Third, faceing difficulties and solving them will make you more completely. You have lots of experience that you will have a high position in the company. The experience will promote you to have a higher level.
 
 When I graduated from school, I found a job in bicycle industry. At the begining, I faced a lot of problems that I don't know what to do.
 So, I tried to ask my coworker and found solution in the text book.

After that, I enjoyed faceing problem no matter how tough that is.By this kind of experience, I discover that I learn a lot and more mature.That made me more satisfied about my work.The company also gave a promotion and looked forward to another improvment.
