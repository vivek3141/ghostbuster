I think that there are a lot of young people which give a lot of time to helping their communities and therefore I disagree with the statement and I can give some reasons and a lot of examples.
 Nowadays in Italy there are a lot of people which do civil service. It is a public no-profit organisation that does a lot of free services for the community and the people ,which work in it, are often young men or women. In addition there are many private organisations which do not have financial aid from the state and where people work without any wages. In these organisations there are also a lot of young people.
 I can state this because I have some friends and my girlfriend too which do it and I admire a lot for their choice.
 For example my girlfriend works as a volunteer in a first aid organisation and I know that a lot of services are done by it as healthcare to the elderly people or first aid when an accident occured and wounded people must be saved. 
 Furthermore it is very common to view young people in these organisations when there are sport or music events. In fact, when there is in my city a football match, there are very often young people in first aid organisation ,which is always present in these cases.
 Although I admire this choice and I would like to do it I cannot do because I have a very hard university and so I do not have much time for beginning this activity.
 In conclusion because of many examples that I did in this essay, I can affirm that I disagree with the statement of the question and I can state that a lot of young people give time to their communities.
