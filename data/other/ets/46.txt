Some people like to try new things and aren't afraid of taking risks. But taking risks and trying new things make people succesful? In my opinion the key to success is to take risks and try new things which doesn't exist. 
 First of all, without taking risks people can only remain the place where they are. Only doing what they already know how to do well helps them to stay where they are and doesn't give any opportunities to make a good career in their life. I claim that taking risks is a very dangerous way of being succesfull. Because there is nothing guraantied after taking the risk and trying new things. The ending could be very miserible. But considering the benefits and the awards of taking risks and trying new things, taking risks are preferable than doing always the same things. 
 Secondly, taking risks can give very good vision to see the world in a different way and affects the culture of people in a good way. As a simple example, trying a new kind food is very hard thing to do  for most of the people. People would prefer eating the same kind of food all the time. But one who tries the new kind food gains a knowledge about this kind and his culture about food increases. To think taking risks in business, for example,  thinking about a factory which is producing the same kind of product since the first day, can only earn little amount of money because the product is old and could be produced by other factories and the demand is reduced to this product. But a new factory that tries a new product and takes risk by making an investment to produce the new product can be very profitable and earn better than the other factory.
 In conclusion, if people want to be successful in any area of the life should not be afraid of taking risks and try new things. This will bring the succeess to them.
