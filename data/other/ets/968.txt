"Successful",how does one relate to this word.It basically means someone who has attained adulation and appreciation for a certain something that he or she has done.It can also be described as a way of getting acceptance from the society for an idea that you believe in or u have faith in.
 Thus a successful person would obviuosly be someone who belives in  and is not  scared of exploring his ideas and trying to attract acceptance for the same.Inorder for a person to gain success a  percievierence,determination and hard work play key roles in a person's life.A sucessful person thus takes  risks and tries new ideas and differnt ways of doing things. therefore success only knocks on those peoples door's who beieve in themselves and dare to walk into unfamiliar territory.
 Take for example Mr.Dhirubhai Ambani who started off  with a  not very well off chidhood but with his grit and hardwok turned his dreams into reality.From a small scale industry his company today is one of the biggest and most important company's in India,Its play's a very important part in the commerce of our country along with helping in buliding some highly complex and neccessary equipments. His initial success gave him the confidence to go ahead and bring about new innovative plans and his hardwork and vision changed them into a successful ventures,Thus successful people do try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.
 Therefore sucess is not only related to doing the same things over and over again but also in trying newer and better ideas to make a large enough  impact in society inorder to carve a niche for yourselves and then work upwards from there,
