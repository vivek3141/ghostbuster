I would like to go against the statement that "there will be fewer cars in future than they are today".I have many facts to support my view.
 Firstly,according to the news promoted by the news channels,the number of cars that are being purchased is increasing day by day.This,clearly shows that more and more people are willing to by cars.
 Secondly,the number of new models of cars that are being introduced in the market is rapidly increasing.We have a new model of a car in every month (approximately).No company will waste a huge amount of money for their reaserch and development,in order to design new cars,if they feel that the usage of cars is going to decrease in the near future.
 Thirdly,the two-wheelers can carry a maximum of three people,provided the third person is an infant,or is unusually thin.Therefore,for families with four or more members in it,there is no other means of transport except for the cars.Ofcourse,the trasportation provided the the government will do,but most of the people do not prefer to go in it,becaue,having a vehicle of their own is a matter of prestige and  to them,and is definitely more comfortable.
 Forthly,the cars are useful in long journies,unlike the two-wheeler.The other sources of transportation may be the aeroplanes and the trains which are more costly.Therefore,by travelling in cars we will be comfortable,and it is cost effective also.
 In the busy life of metropolitan cities,the cars can be used not only for ourselves,but they can also help an individual to make money for himself, by making it a taxi.He can drop people at different places and make money for himself.
 Unless and until an other vehicle is discovered,which can satisfy all tha points mentioned above,the demand for cars will not reduce.Since the probability for such a vehicle to be discovered is very less,we can say that the number of cars being used will not  decrease in the next twenty years.
