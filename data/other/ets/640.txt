I agree with the statement because I believe, that we would not live in the world of today if it weren't for men and women who had the courage to leave their old jobs behind and start something new.
 
 To begin with, we all profit from those extraordinary men and women who have dedicated their lives to try new things and take risks rather then enjoying the merits they could have had by doing their normal jobs. Every successful woman or man today could not have been that successful if it wasn't for the pioneers in the past. Although it takes a lot of courage to take a risk, the chances of being really successful are much higher too. If one is dedicated and puts all his passion into one idea or thought, the chances that he might be succesfull will increase a lot.
 
 This point can be illustrated by taking an example from history. In todays world we all profit from the high mobility which is made possible by cars, and even more so, by planes. But it took two brothers in 1903 all their courage and money to construct an absolutely new type of vehicle and to test it themselves. Their risk was a high one, but their success was even higher and can be seen everyday in today's world. 
 
 This is only one example of how we profit of those people who chose not to live a cozy and unspectacular life, but to dare something. I am not saying, that everybody needs to try to invent something new and be innovative, but a certain percentage of those pioneers is needed to  strengthen the innovative process which underlies economic growth. 
 
 In conclusion we can see the enormous importance of pioneers and how no country can go without them. Everybody will profit from the advantages those innovations will bring for a society. Thus, a government should always support those people who take risks since their innovations are the basis for a better world tomorrow.
