I agree with the successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.I know and heard many examples about this kind of things.I think a really successful person must be smart and honest.They can be successed in this area,because they know how to be successd in this area,but a man can not always stay and do now go forward.Successful people always want to be success in diffrent area,so they can prove themselves that they are really should be successed.
 First,I think many peple heard that some popular movie stars or singers also doing their own business,such as have a resteruant,clothes stores,hotels and so on.Movie stars and singers they earnd too much money than others,why they should do these things ,they need more money? or  they have too much money so they just do it for fun?I think they just want to show people that they can do everything like a regular person,they are not only have good looking or beautiful voice,they can also be succesed in other area.Actually,many of them also did very good business.So i think successful people try new things and take risks can prove themselves that they are not just lucky,or maybe they need more money.
 Secondly,i readed in the newspaper,a man he  is really a successful business man,he is so rich,but he always try the new things.The man had many hotels,these hotels are all five stars hotels,and they are so famous all over the world.But the man open a  travelling company,this is a really good idea,because first of all he can let the travelers live in his hotels,and the secondly he can earnd more money from the travelling.Now he did very good job in travelling company.After i readed this new,i really think the man is so smart,there are many travelling company and many hotels,why they can not be success but the man did both.
 Last but not least,people can be successed not because they are just lucky ,because they work more harder than others.A successful person can always be successful if he can catch the good chance,and use this chance to be successul.
