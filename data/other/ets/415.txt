I agree with this statement becouse a succefful person wants always to increase own experience doing something different as what it usually do.
 Moreover doing different things could takes certain risks, and a successful person know that but it isn't worried becouse he wants only to improve itself and its experience.Moreover a successful persons isn't worried to be judged by the others becouse it is very determinate. The are a lot of risk such as to fail, but I don't think it's important. obviously trying new things is possible when you are young and you have much energies and willpower, when you are older you don't want to do and you are not able to do such experience.
 For exemple a friend of mine is english and she came in italy when we was 13. She decided not to study only english as foreign languages at school but she studied also French. She wasn't good in French and even if she usually took bad marks she rappreents a life model for me.
 She allways advice me to try with new things and not to fear about them.
 I have followed her advice when I moved from my small village to Milan. I would have had the opportunity to work in my parent's factory if I had stayed there but I decided to study design in Milan and to be self-supporting. An experience like this make oneself feel more mature and responsable even if it's a bad experience.
