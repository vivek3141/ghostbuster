People have different opinion whether to have broad knowledge of divers academic subjects is better to specialize in one specific subject. I firmly believe that having broad knowledge is more beneficial for two reasons.

Instead of surgery, he asked for his brother, the priest, to give a good tutor for her with offering mild pills and orient pills for her. this greatly worked out. He insisted that it is important to have different point.
 Second, today's job market requires people to be flexible in using their knoweldge. Modern society is different from the age when people are based on the agriculture industry for living. With the advenced in technology and globerization, Today's job market has much diverse kind of jobs and these are rapidly chaneging, emerging new job, and falling down old ones. Nobody can't make sure which job will be promising in the future. To demenstrate, according to the recent economical research, people predict that  tomorrow's people will have at least 3 and more jobs in their entire life. Consequently, This require them to prepare many jobs. In this sense, people need to have broad knowledge to survive.
