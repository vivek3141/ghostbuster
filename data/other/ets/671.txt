Advertising campaings, to my opinion, are most of the time filled with unreal information about the product they are trying to sale.
 
 For example, I always see on tv advertising about loosing weight  that they try to sale a type of medice or lotion that make you loose weight, and then they first show a woman so fat, and on the other side of the screen you will see such a beautiful and skinny lady, that anybody, or, at least, an intelligent person can realize that such a change is not possible that easy.
 
 I believe that those advertisements always say what people want to hear, but they do not usually say the truth, but the only purpose of this is to sale the product to be able to make money, despite of what the consecuenses are. That is why advertisers make this products or items seem way better than they really are.
 
 I can also mention some others examples, such as food, clothes, medicines, even cologne and perfumes, that can change your live for ever, and make you the perfect person of this world, but unfortunaly, I do not have enough  time to talk about all of them, but what I can say is that, at the end, these campaings have the same meaning, and result.
 
 There is no doubt that advertisements, and I strongly agree with that statement, are a good invention for those who want to make money out of people ignorance, and common sence; and advertisers also know that, in some occasions,  people like to spend money even thought they are aware of those products are not really good, and that they hide something behind the image the advertiser creates.
 
 All in all, my advice, do not buy everything you see on tv, magazines or other places, because they do not usually say the truth.
