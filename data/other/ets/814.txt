Being old is often called a burden, but that is no true, To be old in the modern time is not a burden,  it has many great advantages. Being experienced, having a secured financial situation are benefits besides having a lot of time.
 
 Old people  are more relaxed  than young people in most situations. The fact that old people have  experienced  very much and especially a lot of not so nice things, lets them be very relaxed even in situations that are totally stressing young people out. For example a young person misses a very important test, a final exam. For the young person this is really hard to take because in his world taking a class one semester longer seems very long. For an old and ex person the fact of missing an exam would be hard too, but the old person knows from experiences that worse things can happen an one semester would not seem so long afterall. In this situation it would be more enjoyable to be old.
 
 Many old people have a secure financial situation. This reliefs older people from worrying about the financial future. Worrying about the financial situation in the future is one point why many young people can't enjoy being young.
 
 Old people don't have to work any more. This gives them time to travel very much. It is very enjoyable to go travelling all the time, many old people do that. For example my grandma travels the whole world, while I have to study. I think she enjoys her time more than I do.   
 
 
 As a result, especially looking at my grandma.  I can say that I do not agree with the given statement. In my opinion old peolple don't  enjoy life less than zoung people.
