I`m not so sure that is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn fact.
 I think that this statement is quite generic and incomplete.
 if it is referred to  historical studies, it could be accettable. for example, it is more important for a student tho understand why the world wars had occurred than the specific facts and dates linked to war`s history. and this example could extended to the general comprenshion of the actual world`s politic situation. But without knowing facts it`s difficult to make a personal idea on an argoument.
 if we take for example scientific fields we have to refuse this statement, it`s impossible to discuss about a scientific idea without knowing the specific facts (rules, laws, properties) connected to this idea.
 so, my personal opinion is that there isn`t a division between facts and concept, they are strongly connected. (here we could open a philosophical discussion about facts and judments in kant`s theory)
 i suggests to the other students to make sure to know very well a fact before giving an opinion, and to investigate a fact before accepting other`s opinion. this problem involved the eternal problem of the historical founts: scholars have to believe in historical narrations whithout the  real possibility to control themselves the truely of a fact
 on the contrary, the figure of the critic should be an example of a person who can see and study a fact and than give his opinion about that fact.
 so, in order to give a correct and credible opinion about something, is very very important to study the facts themselves.
