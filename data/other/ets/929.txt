This essay is about products and advertisment. Do most advertisments make products seem better than they really are. 
 
 First of all we should think about advertisment and its goals. Nowadays, advertisments are used very commonly to support the selling process of a product. There are advertisments on tv, in newpapers etc.  Advertisment is a special part of Marketing and it gives the possibility to show a new product to possible customers. Its main goal is to attract new customers for a particular product. The customer should think positive about this product and buy it.
 
 As I mentioned before, the customer should have a positive impression from the product. To reach that goal, the advertisment will of course just show  the strengths of this particular product. 
 
 However, some advertisments may not really show  the truth of the strengths and weaknesses of a product.  I think that these advertisments are a few negative cases. 
 
 Another point is that the people from the marketing agencies, who design the advertisments, cannot tell the lies about the product. People would recognize that lie just after they both the product and they would never buy a product from that company again. 
 
 Companies want to satisfy customers and that wouldn t happen if they show advertisments who are not true. 
 
 As i mentioned before, I think that advertisments show the best part of a product without showing the negative parts. However i don-t think that advertisment make products generally better than they really are.
