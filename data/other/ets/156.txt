From my personal experience and those of people around me, I strongly disagree with the opinion that "young people enjoy life more than older people do".
 First of all, in order for one to really enjoy something, such as life or any kind of sport, he/she must first know what it truly is. When people say that they really enjoy doing something the first time they are doing it, what they really mean is that they like, rather than enjoy, doing it. When people getting older, they see the rise and down of the life, and they have a better idea about what life is and what the most important thing is in their lives. I think such a deep understanding about the life is exactly the prerequisite for anyone to enjoy it. After all, how can one really enjoy something when he has little or no ideaabout it?
 Secondly, when people become older, they have more things to appreciate and enjoy. For example, family might mean much less for a young man than going to the party and hangging out with friends. However, as people mature, they see their responsiblities they owe to people around them and those they love and cherish. They could still go out to the party and play with friends, but they also have some truly enjoyable thing that most young people do not know to appreciate, such as family.
 Certainly, there are many interesting things that can said to be franchise to young people. For example,  while many youngsters are fascianted about the extreme sports, there are a significantly lower percentage of older people who would dare to try. Their health conditions might not allow them as well.
 In conclusion, I disgree with the assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people do. I believe that the following modification would be more appropriate:  " Young peple experience life, but older people enjoy life."
