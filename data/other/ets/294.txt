In my eyes it is wrong  to say that young people enjoy life more than older people.
 Obviously, one could state the fact younger people are healthier and that they still have to make all their important choices in life, they have no regrets. Furthermore they can try a vast range of activities. Because of their youth and health they can do various sports, learn how to play muscial instruments, travel spontaneously to dangerous places and if they have not started working yet, they have a lot less responabilities. All these choices might be out of reach for older people because of their health and social status.
 In addition to this older people could be in a worse emotional state than younger people. With increasing responsabilities such as bringing up a family, paying for their children's education, they are less carefree. Health issues, e.g. age related illnesses such as Alzheimer's or according to age impending death can turn life itself into one long hardship for older people. Also, they might have lost a loved one such as their spouse or siblings.
 But nonetheless one has to take into account older people's life experience and what they are looking back on.
 In the course of their life older people have experienced all kinds of emotions and things that turned them into the person they are. This could be a marriage, the birth of a child, the further extension of their family or a huge succes or achievement. They can alsways look back and relive the most wonderful moments of their life, something younger people have yet to experience. 
 And finally, older people are in a way the foundation of their family. To know that one is appreciated, needed and relied upon is something that makes life very special.
