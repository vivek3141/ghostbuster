I agree this statement.There are three reasons for this.
 First of all,the conversation in familly is declising.Most of young people do not talk their happenning in a day,and they also do not ask their family,especially their parents,about their job or happennings.This causes the problem that they cannot commmunicate each other,so young people are likely not to be interested in the nearest comunity.
 Secondly,'Mura Shakai' disappead today in Japan.'Mura Shakai' is local town in Japan.We had many relationship in our town and we everytime helped beween neighborhood.However,young people do not even greet to neighbors in the morning.Some young people may not know who is living in the next door.
 Finally,but  this is the most impotant,the comunicating skills of young people is going to bad.Every young people tends to e-mail and mobile phone in communication so they have less oppotunities to talk with face to face than before.Our foundation of communication is talking,but we can't.
