I do not agree with the statement " the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide". 
 
 Firstly, because I do not think that anyone could pretend order travel either alone or in a group. Traveling is one of the pleasure that is generally at  your own discretion. If people does not feel comfortable to travel in a group, it does not means that they are not going to enjoy their trip. For them, traveling in a group could be the best way to waste your money and time. One  are not going to be able to do everything one wants.
 
 Secondly, for people who like traveling in a group, they could like to travel with people they know. So they would have somewhat the same interest, and will be most likely able to do the same thing. In that case, they could want to  prepare their trip by researching all the information they need before leaving. For example,  they would looking about the hotels, where to eat, what are the attractions, and so on. Thus, they  will avoid the need of a tour guide. They will ends with the satisfaction of planning their trip, and seing only what they wanted to.
 
 Finally, travel in  a group led by a tour guide could be expensive. A tour guide usually also has his "own path". It is a generic pathway made for everyone. It usually have a lack of flexibility. For instance, with a tour guide people have usually a tight schedule. The tour guide tries to show everything in a very short amount of time. Therefore, one has to be in good health condition in order to accomplish what could be viewed sometimes as painful path.
 
 In conclusion, I personnally believe that the best way to travel depends on individuals. One could be a solitar ,and enjoy the pleasure of traveling  alone. Other people  enjoy just the fact of researching , planning to  travel with friends. And finally,  the fact that a  tour guide is not personal and only show what it wants to shows, are the three  main reason what I do not agree with the statement.
