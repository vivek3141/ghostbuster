There are many ways for young people to help their communities.  I personally disagree with the saying that young people now are not giving enough time to help their communities.  As a university student, friends around me has joined some charity project and I myself also go to the children near my neighnor everyweek to take care of the children.
 First of all, there more and more clubs or student societies established in schools to help the deprived people.  For example,  my professor told me that there were only one charity society formed by students ten years ago, when she studied in our universuty . However, there are more then eight student societies which help people who need help. 
 Second, more and more people are associated with helping the communities.  While there are more and more charity societies establihed, that means there are more and more people involve in this kind of activity.  According to my own experience, this is true.  During my freshman year in university, there were only three people in my class joined the group which do charity.  But in my junior year in the university,  there are more than ten of my classmates devote themselves into community service.
 Last but not least, this summer when a work as an intern in Citi Bank, they have a poject called "Read For The Future".  This profect is to gather university students to let them read stories for the children in the less developed areas.  Citi Bank counted the amount of time they read for the children, that was more than a thousand hours in three months by only a hundred students.  
 As a society developed, there might be more and more problems appear.  On the other hand, there are also more and more hot-blooded young people are welling to spend more of their time devoting themselves into helping the society.
