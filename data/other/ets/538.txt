Many people believe that young people nowadays don't give enought time to helping their communities,other people, instead,say that the young people are nearest than the old people,at the their communities problem.
 
 On the one hand, the younge people have most problem nowadays. In fact, in this years the world is change, because there so many criminals and the cities aren-t safety as twenty years ago. I'm a young boy, and I can see with my eyes the change of my city. For the young people is not easy to live in this jungle...
 Secondly the young people nowadays than twenty years ago, going at school and at university and the time are so little..
 in fact, I'm a student and when I come back to the university I haven-t many time to dedicate for my hobbies...or other job.The new young people spend most of the daily time at school!!
 
 On the other hand, is true the fact that more young people, often, when come back home, play at videogames or speack between other boys and girl,with internet...instead can use this time for help their communities. But this new generations, is the generation of internet and is more difficult to teach the importance of the community.
 
 To sum up, the young people have few time to dedicate at their hobbies, but when they have a free time, their use this precious hours for videogames,internet...and other hobbies. 
 
 In my opinion,I'm a student and I attend at University of Milan, I have very few time...but at the week end, when I return to my house, I think at my community. At Sunday I organize with my friends, the games for the children of my town, and I'm happy because I see the smile on the face of these children. Is in these moments that i can say that I have do somethings of good.
