I agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, but the fact is that people is afected when is not aware of this. Also I understand that although there is some regulation obout this topic the means to make it work are not as hard as they should.
 Is truth that marketing uses strategies like give misinformation about a product or try to convice us that their product is what we need to solve our problems or just to make us happy. But it could be a real problem like in a medical example, some vitamin suplements are announce to be all we need if we feel tired or weak, but the people who make the publicity do not care or inform consummers about the risk of do not go toa medical check when these synthoms are present. Also there are docummentated cases of people who stop taking their medication or cutted their medical treatments because of using a new product seen on TV.
 Another example could be the resistance of a ladder or a new kind tool, because the client could be expecting that this tool or appliance has a certain lasting, when the real thing is that it is going to break even putting in danger his life.
 As a final conclution or a personal peace of advice. I think that even though companies have the necesitty to increase their profits they also should have a social conscience. That is to say be more concerned about the responsability of lie or misinformate about the features of a product. And this does not mean that the client should leave everything in the hands of the enterpices, but be more concerned about the posibility of being buying something which is not what he is expecting.
