The issue at hand is whether to succeed in life is it worthwile to take a risk or continue with routine standardised pattern of doing thinks.The issue is important because it directly relates to how does the behavior  of humans may effect in their being successful.I believe that by trying out new things  and taking risks there are more chances to become sucessful in life rather than doing a routine task or repetitive task at which a person is good at.
 
 The reason which makes me belive that taking risks is essential for succeeding because by trying out something new we come up with new set of results which can be helpful if we comprehend these results properly .In past people used to belive that earth was the centre of universe and all bodies like sun , moon revolve around it .If Copernicus would not have thought the idea that it is sun which is stationary then people would have continued to live in ignorance and no major astronomical discoveries would have taken place.Thus thinking in routine way or doing things this way present serious obstacles to development of man kind.
 
 Secondly by doing things which we already know how to do we are wasting the immense power of human mind and its creativity .Suppose if a student is thaught in class to draw lines , boxes after sometime the student will probably would have learned it well so there is no new thing which can be done but if student tries to experiment with different patterns , curves and probably using different colours he may come up with a new kind of art form , doing things like art require people to use creativity and think out of the box rather than routine tasks. 
 
 Furthermore i feel that by doing some experiments and risk taking behaviour is essential for new scientific discoveries.The basic aim of practical sessions conducted is to prove that the practical results  comply with theory. When Dunlop was working in his lab  with rubber tyres he mixed some sulphur while heating the rubber which led to invention of vulcanised rubber , although not sure about toughness and properties of it he fitted these new tyres in his sons bicycle, thus he found out that new quality of rubber was much better than old rubber and hence he used his idea and thus wa able to esatablish new company with his new invwention.Thus his risk taking behavior had truly paid off , had he been doing same routine taks he would have never succeded.
 
 Thus taking risks and doing experimentation to challenge established theories and rules play a pivotal role in success of human beings rather than just doing routine things. I believe that success will follow those who challenge the established things rather than those who like to do only same things and are unidimensional in their appraoch towards life and work.
