The understanding of ideas and concepts together with the ability to reproduce them correctly is the best way to learn something new. But the more important part from the learning in general is definetly the understanding, because only if a student understands the idea or concept, he/she will be able to use it successfully.
 To explain my point, I will try to give an example, where we can see that just learning facts doesn't help in real life.
 Let's assume that a business student, who always had good results in college, starts working in a big company and has to work on a very difficult case. This task includes a number of problems, which seem familiar to him, but he can not use the results he had learned from university, because they don't fit in this case and he never really understood the concept. He has never done it before and has to solve this problem by himself, because otherwise the senior manager will recognize that he hasn't got a clue about the topic. Now, he will recognize that the stuff he had learned without understanding it, doesn't help him at work. Which might lead to a lot of problems for him.
 I think that we can obviously see on that example that learning facts can't be more important than understanding the idea. And even if someone can probably pass college or university without realizing this statement, he will do, when he starts to work.
 And do we only learn for good results in school?
 I don't think so, and that is by the way what all the teacher in my school tell me as well. We have to understand what is behind the facts, so that we can use the concepts. And for that, I would like to mention that a student have to learn the facts, which is also important. 
 Only when these both factors of learning come together, we will be able to learn for life and use what we have learned successfully.
