People has differnts ideas about successful whether it is to creat a new things or to do usual work. Doing what we already know how to do well doesn't make you different and does not make happy comparing with creating new things. In my opinion i stongly agree that successful is to create new things and take risks for several reasons.
 First of all, it is a great thing to be promenet and different than others. For example, if some body creates a treatment for Canser and another one does his regular work who is succeede?. Ofcourse the first one because he creates new things which helps sick peapole. So this person must be famous and every body wont to work with them.
 In addition, you can tase the real successful if you took risks and adventures. Person has to love his work to creat new thing and to be succeede indeed. By taking risks you learn new useful things that helps you in your life. My brother was in running race and he not only won but also created a new recorde number. He was very happy to take riskes and score new number.
 Last but not least, trying new things helps you to get more expeirnce and self-cofidence. By doing this new things you well be proded and every body loves you.
 In conclosion, i wiil be a dentist and i will create new things for my world because that's the real successful. I hate to do my regular work without trying to do new things.
