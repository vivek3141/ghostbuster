It true that young people have the abilty to take part in different kinds of activities, especially some exciting ones.  But at the same time some old people can not enjoy them.  However, it is a little bit haste to say that young people enjoy life more than older people do.
 
 Faced with the working stress of morden time, young people seem to have much more pressure than older people do. Young people have to get up early and go to work in an rush hour.  And if there is traffic jam , which is common in big cities, young people will suffer more from it , both physically and mentally.  Moreover, young people have to breed their children and also take care of their old parents, and therefore they will have less time enjoying the nature,  having outside sports, and even breathing the fresh air in the countries.
 
 However, old people have more leisure time as compared to young people, and therefore they have more access to enjoy the life .  Because old people do not have to endure the working pressure, they have various kind of activities.  For example, they can plant trees, raise their beloved flowers as well as taking care of their grandchildren. Also, they can travel as far as they can because there is no time limitationfor them.  They need not to go to work on time , and they do not have mountinous workings to do . Enjoying the nature not only do good to their physical health, but they are even good for their mental health.  
 
 I think the only difference between young people and old people is that there is a splendid future waiting for the youngs, while there is a glorios future behind the olds.  No matter young and old , they have the same right and responsibility to enjoys their lives.
