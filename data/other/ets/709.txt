Who cares about young people care about who ?
 
 Nowadays, young people do not give enough time to helping the community which doesn't give them enough time to be young and happy !
 Young people are becoming unhappy day by day by unemployment , lack of money and lack of care in the COMMUNITY.From the past years this community is growing the youth who doesn't  like to help the community.The answer in the minds of the youngs is the same : 'Why should i care to help the community that never cared to help me ?'
 I'm one of these young people.I have a grandma and aunt both are living with us and both has cancer.For helping their house economy i have to work.I know 3 languages and i am unemployed over 2 years.
 Now i am having that test to be accepted for a job.All these years where was the 'community'? Did all the people in the community think like me ? :)
 I have no time for community as all young people in my country.I have to care to help myself and my family.
 
 What can young people do for community in that huge lackness hole? 
 May be this is the result of past generations' behaves to us.They behaved to their children as they have been behaved by their parents and time shows the result : A community divided by millions of him or her'selves'.These people cannot even be a community member in the near future.
 Loneliness wins the game against happy and cared communities by the help of lackness.
 
 In my opinion our youth first be helped to find their ways and their life then be asked to give enough time to helping the others and the community structure.Community create new generations which will create new communities.
 A desperate circulation.
