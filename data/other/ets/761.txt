Although it totally depends on how a person looks at his or her life to say he or she is  enjoying his or  her life, from my experience as a man who just turned 31, I disagree with this statement. As far as I am concerned, older people can have more chances or times to enjoy their lives and more of them might already have got great memories that can last until the last day of their lives. I believe that older people enjoy life more than young people do for the following a few reasons.
 
 First of all, most of those 'older people' are assumed to have retired or to be in the near future which means they already have enough money in their savings or other investments portfolio to live without working for the last of times. It is not unusual to see those older people who are doing all the fun stuff they could not or have put off for a long time. It is possible for them to enjoy their lives because they worked or have been working for such a long time preparing for retirement.
 
 Also, since mostly the older people do not  have to work to support their own family by the time around retirements, there are not much  time for them to get stressed. It leads them to more enjoyable moments they have wished for.
 
 At last, the older people can finally have their own time spending more time with each spouse and other communities and so on assuming all the children are independent of their parents financially and economically.
 
 In conclusion, as long as heath conditions for both young and older people remain quite same, the older people have better chance to enjoy their lives than young people in many ways including financial and ecomical reasons.
