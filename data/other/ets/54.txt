all peoples can enjoy the life if they want to also older peoples still can enjoy the life  however not as much as  younger peoples.but its in nature to enjoy the life while  you are younger becouse you  are exicited , full of ambition,active and less responsible.
 
 while we are young we dont have so much responsibiltys but we have lots of things to do for having fun.for example hanging out and  doing sports with friends.young peoples are learnin lots of new things every day  and the first experiences  is the best  second and third cant give joy like the first one. in addition older peoples have  lots of healt problems and becouse of this condition they are not allowed to do tones of intersting things
 
 I think that the most  enjoyable  part of life  dreaming and waiting for the day you will reach your goals.young peoples have this ambition
 its the worlds nature best time of our life is youth time. you can always see that the old peoples are complaning about  their ages and how badly they want  return  to their childhood .i think after a while old peoples are starting to live their past and beutiful memories.in contrast we see that young peoples want  to grow up quicly but after they grow up they see the  truth that  being young is so much better
 
 in conclusion i d liek to say that m so happy ith being you
