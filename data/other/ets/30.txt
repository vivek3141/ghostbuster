Yes,i agree that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for themto learn the facts.any country growth is depends on the student.Student can act the majore role in the growing of any country.So there is a nessecity and importance for the students to understand ideas and concepts.if they are not understanding the ideas which are implementing to develop it wil more effect on the nation and all the requirements for the development of the country.
 
 For example,if anyone can give the ideas for the development if the student is not understanding in the right way so there no result will appear ,so for good results every student can understand that what they are oing and what they have to do because of if they think right way it is good if they think in wrong way the result will be effortend on the all of the people which are leaving in the country.
 
 If the problem will occure at that time they solve the problem by thinking in the right way so it cannot create the some more problems
 if it not solving the right they can creative the more problems and it wil effect on the nation.the future of the country or nation is purely depend on the students,how they can approch and how they can get the good position.And also there is a need of learning the facts.
 
 Most of the students can not understand the main ideas and concepts for the development so they will effect more so this problem can be avoid by some other student who can having the good knowledge and who can understand the things easily that means the ideas for the development.so there is need of understanding the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
 
 Some of the students can not agree with the facts and also they are neglegible for this facts so that people can lose the good quality of the understanding power so i suggest that every one can get the good understanding power and every one know that how they can understand the things for the development of the nation.so it is more importent for the students to understand ideas and the concepts than it is for them to learn facts.so the nation or the country can develop more and acheives the good position.development is inthe students hand.
