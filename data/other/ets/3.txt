The world is becoming a small village because of the technology. every year a new discovery and a new invention is found . long ago the cars were one of these inventions which made our lives much easier and made us able to go where ever we wish to go in no time or in less time than the time we needed to transfer from a place to another in the past . 
 Of course in twenty years the technology will grow rapidly even faster than we can imagin and that means more ways of transportation that may cancel the cars or make it a second way of transportation i really think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars for several reasons .
 first of all we are all facing a great problem with the crowd so poeple are trying to find a better way to go where ever that want to go by using another way of transportion like the subways for example which means that people are trying not to use that car as much as they used to in the past to escape from the crowd so the cars will be fewer 
 Second of all i'm sure that there will be more inventions that may be better than the car and faster and so people will rely on the new invention instead of the car as a way of transportation so the cars will be fewer.
 Third of all we all know that the cars are actually pollutiing the nature and has got many bad effects on the environment and on us therefore the scientists are trying to find ways to solve this problem which means that they will find a better way for transpotation which will be faster , safer and that will not pollute the weather . 
 For these three reasons  i strongly think that cars will be fewer in the futur and new inventions will be invented to save the world from the crowd which is every where and to save the world from the pollution .
