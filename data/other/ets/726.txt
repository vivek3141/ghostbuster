I agree that the successful people will try to do new things rather than doing what they alredy know.if this not possible there may not any new inventions for defence ourseleves in any case for eg;  medicines,computers,hydrogen bombs ets., 
 The successful people are well aware about their things eg; in case of a doctor particularly cardilogist, he may diagnose the problems of heart and treat it only the diagnosed diseases but if he try to success in new things like heart surgeries that may increase the life of a man.Another eg is invention of drugs to treat the AIDS,it one of the major problem in our country.With invention of Antiretroviral treatment the decrease in morbidity and mortality 
 For example if a scientist is expert in television he may invent the differnt forms of the television.if he started thinking better then telivison he can invent various technological tools like computers.tody we are using  it as a important tool for not only commuinication but also for the discoveries. 
 To defence ourseleves with other ones we should able to protect,this can be done by inventing   lot of tools like hydrogen bombs,weapons,etc.historically the way of defence mechanisms were improving by inventing new things by the successful people.
 With inventing new way of tranportation like areoplanes.ships etc; there is decrease the wastage of  time in all aspects.eg; to go to mumbai through bus it may take 20 hrs from hyderabad but inventing the aeroplane it decrease the time such way that we can go with in 1hr.this shows how much important in inventing the new things by the successful persons.
 Finally, my conclusion is better to try new things by the successful presons that may change not only the way of style of a person but the culture of the nation.
