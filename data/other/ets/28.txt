Nowadays mostly people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do. 
 I totally disagree with this statement. 
 There are three reasons why I have this preference.
 
 For one thing people who are young have to spent their time with working and learning in order to get a job in the future.
 I am student. I have to study the whole day. And when I have finished my semester I have to work at a shipping company in order to get money. I have so much work and I have totally no time at all to see my friends. Only a few times I try to go out to enjoy my life.
 
 Furthermore many young people are in concern about their future.
 In consequence they do not enjoy life. There is a great competition surrounding the young people. Many of them have no work, they do not get a traineeshipment or they are not admitted on a university.
 I have to reach 90 points in the toefl test otherwise I will be exmatriukulated. If I fail I have to find out another way how to earn money in the future. I am really frightened about this case.
 
 A next point is, that I have not as much money as the older people have. I get only some money from the company at which I work within my free time. Because I do not work full time I get less money. From this money I have to pay my appartment, the university fee, the ticket for the train and I need money for food and clothes. There is no further money which I can spend for fun like for holiday trips.
 
 In conclusion you can see that young people do not enjoy their life as many people do believe.  The majority have to spent their time on working and learning, they are more in concern about their future and as result they less enjoy life. Finally they have less money which they could spend for having fun. Only when you are old and you have reached something wthin your life you will really enjoy life.
