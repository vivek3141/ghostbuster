It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialised in one specific subject . I think  , that  broad knwoledge is good as this can provide with a lot informations ,  a job opportunity and make the person to be well known as discussed in the paragraphs below.
 Broad knowledge can provides with a lot of information in various fields .information which will be used as an assets and help the person to be aware of a situations . this awarenes will help the person to know how to solve problem and to deal with any particular situation which may happened .the situation can be worse as for example safety which demand quick thinking ability and action . a person with a broad knwoledge will be helpful to others during the time of distress as well as in time of succes .
 In addition to that , this ability of knowing many things will provides with a better chance to be ready for any job opportunity . the more the knowlegde the better the chance of  getting employement . 
 Furthermore , people with broad knowledge have a less chance to stay jobless as they can fit in any filed provided that they can do something which help them to sustain their life.
 However ,specific knowledge help the person to sustain his life and get a good job but it does not unsure that if the person is given another job if he will fit in .
 Therefore , broad knowlegde of many academic subject is very helpful as thet can provide a person whith a good opportunity for job search ans well as wide knowledge in his life which is like an assetsto use if thing get worse without expected .
