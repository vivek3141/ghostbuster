Most advertisements make products seem better than they really are, I am agree this stamente.
 In  my expericences ,  I bouth  products that seem  to be---
 really good  , but threre not,  The kind the publicity seems to looks 
 to good,.
 One example the this is the hambuger ,when they advertice
 looks so delicios, and when you tested is not to good.
 One another exaples is the car the advertise  with a lot ---
 speeds this right , but you can not use this speed in  the regular
 time , for my is better when adverse about the gas.
 An another examples the services advertise, sometimes
 you went to companies to have a services , and  you not have
 the quality the services that you pay.
 In conclusion the advertisements  play a big  situation to sell
 products in the market.
