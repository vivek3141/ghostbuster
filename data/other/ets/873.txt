My classroom teaching gives me several evident to agree upon the statement, that it is important for the students to understand ideas and concepts, although learning facts are also important.
 As in my case, I learn well when I understand the ideas and concept. This helps me to learn faster and to retain for a long time. Facts can be forgotten when some other important information enters into the mind
 Understanding is the key factor to learning. Students learn better when they understand. In an example, I was teaching to one of my student  about World War I, She is on Georgia Alternative Assessment, I gave a video to watch about the world event. She understood the fact  it is a war, but did not understood the ideas and concept of the World War I. When answered the test she generally answered it a war without knowing it is an world event.
 Today's education system emphasis on elementary education because when the young students understand ideas and concept it is easy to learn the material. It does not matter how difficult might be the task. Showing  fact is an additional information given to the students to understand and remember the work .  fact itself do not help. Projects are well done when they are understood.
 I can take an example of my daughter Shaina . She will not understand the fact unless I give her the idea and concept. I remember her asking me the same topice after days. Example, she learned about the solar system. It took me get afford to make her understand the working of the  solar system. I bought charts and models to give her ideas and concept of working of solar system. She completed her own project and did  received 'A' on it. It take time and afford to do this but learning is intense and last longer.
 Thus I prefer understanding ideas and concept to be cleared to me, to my students. Students does show progress in their work. Learning is more fun. Students are motivated to learn more.
