I agree that it is more important for students to ndertand ideas and concepts than it is for the to learn facts. To tie yourself up to facts, produce facts that alredy existd, therefore it cause nothing else. However, understanding ideas and concepts, you may obtain various ways of opinions from each person. When you analyse cohensive fact from them, you will see several fact. For example, if you think about excution, and you conclude it is unnecessarry from one article, there ought to be existed those who disaree with it reason that they killed humakind and it's obviously outlaw. He should get punishment. Eve if both ideas are acceptable, they're lead through by simple agement. People need to collect those information by not standing by both sides, and find solution how object has to be concluded.
