I agree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Followings are my  reasons and example.
 Social competition is serious today, in order to survive in society, most young people have to spend most of their time on school. After classes, they have to study for exams and work on  term papers. Therefore, I don't think they get time left to help; sometimes it is not enough for sleep.
 Another reason is that young people may think it makes them sound old if they help the community. As we know, most of the work in communities is done by old people who have been retired. In order not to be regarded as one acting oldly, young folks avoid to do so. 
 Take myself for example, I am 21 and admit I do not give enough hours, but I am not like people I illustrated in the third paragraph. Often I go to the community library to help out the librarians. Due to the lack of hours, I can only go there once a month, for I have to prepare for my school work. Sometimes people are just being too  busy to help rather than unwilling.
 In addition to what I mentioned above, there is still a limitation for young people to help their community, that is, there is no pay. It is a of waste of time to doing things without wages. Tuition fee is extremely high today, young people have to earn more money to pay. Therefore, people would rather work a part-time job than community work.
