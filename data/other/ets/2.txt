Sometimes the man needs to know at least a little of everything what happen in his life. For instance, if you go to the mountain and someone hurt himself you should know how to act in this case, I mean, what kind of medicine or method is the most indicated to help him.
 
 But, in the other hand, if you are a doctor you should take a specialization in an specific part of the human body to help people who need, for example, traumatological procedures.
 
 Actually, if everyone will know a little about everything sometimes it will not be great or helpful. How we will do with a child with cancer if does not exist anyone who be able to operate him? Or, in other case, if you will know just how to make a good cake, do you think you have future in the kitchen? I do not think so, you should know at least few things about how to cook fish, meal, etc.
 
 Since your chilhood you are learning what the world and the circunstances put in front of you. All the people is abble to affor a variety of situations wich are present in our lifes. Even so, when you get into college your studies must be directed to make an specific labor. The one you think you have the best development.
 
 I am going to study Computer Science next year, these are general studies about the computers, but I do not want to stay just with this studies, therefore, I will be deligthed to learn about networks and designe through computers software.
 
 In short, for all these reasons, I am not abble to say if I am in agreement or not with the statement. Learn all the subjects you want but do not forge to centralize your interests in something you think is the most important, interesting and comfortable for you.
