I strongly hope so!
 I am rather stuffed by the continous hearing of noisy car, the pollotion they produce and the stress they increase in people all the day.
 
 I think that the number of cars must be reduced for a lot of reason of any kind.
 
 There are too many cars in cityes: I m thinking of all the time i have been blocked in traffic, I m  thinking at the stress that produce a situation like been in a jungle of clacson sound, peolpe that insult each others with no reason, all the important appointed posticipated...
 
 Cars are expensive:since the car has began a status symbol its price has risen enormously.
 And the more people continue  buying the cars at any price the more the price will rise
 
 Air pollution is caused by car: have you ever asked yourself  _"how does it cost all the publics works to clean  the building of the cityes from the thick dark layer of smog that cover them?", or "how dose it cost to restore the streets every two years ?"
 
 The public transport can be more efficiet and less stressing:
 I think that public transport are the ony solution to the problem of the cars. We offcourse cannot avoid  to travel, we need to, we only have to consider more efficient way to move.
 The most importan features of public tranport is that the allow many people to travel at the same time with a grate maximization of the result at the same price.Furthermore there are new technology that use not energy that involve pollution such as solar energy, wind energy and so on. I think that future must go in this direction to have  a safe life for us and for future generations.
