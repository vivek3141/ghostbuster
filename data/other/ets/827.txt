Travelling is an activity that most individuals enjoy, may it be for its adventurous quality, innate curiosity for the unknown or the joy of simply having a relaxing vacation. This leads to the next question: Is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide? Personally, I believe the response to this question depends on the individual, his or her expectations and above all, the opportunity costs that this person is willing to take. Travelling with a tour guide can imply a series of opportunity costs that some people are unaware of, such as the beauty of the adventure and the immersion in the culture. 
 On one side, travelling with a tour guide has its pros. For instance, if there is a limited time to travel this can be efficient, less expensive and in essence the most importante places will be visited. There is no uncertainty as to where to go, what to do or how to plan the day. It simply is relaxing and enjoying your time. 
 However, there are a series of opportunity costs inherent in this decision. For starters, who says that the tour guide will be fun? A couple months ago I travelled to Macchu Picchu with two friends; we backpacked. It was an amazing experience because the spontaneity, the adventurous nature of the experience and above all the liberty to do what we wanted was truly priceless. Not only did we meet a series of travellers along the way, but we also got to immerse ourselves in the culture. I have to say this has been one of the best trips I have taken in my life; I would truly recommend anyone to be brave, take a risk and enjoy the beauty of true travel. 
 From personal experience I have to say that travelling without a tour guide is the best way to go. It is important to go informed, but even the getting lost and not knowing where to go form part of the magical experiences of travel.
