It was five o'clock and I was sleeping on my confortable bed in my home. Suddenly, I woke up crying and screaming. I couldn't believe it, I had had a bad dream. Before, I realized that dream had a profound effect on my feelings. The dream was about a trip where I got lost and there was nobody next to me. I was afraid!!. I agree with the statement that says that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. The reasons why I agree with that are my personal experience of traveling alone and the cost
 
 First, one of the reasons to travel with a group is my personal experience. I went to Brazil alone and I didn't enjoy it so much. I realized that I don't like traveling with no people. All the trips should be done with people who you care alot. Moreover, I would like to visit others places like Bolivia and Chile, both countrys from South America. But, I'd go with my close friends. One who spends with their relatives or lovers have fun more than one who spends time alone in a foreign country. 
 
 Futhermore, the cost is another reason why I think that taking a guide for your group trip is a good idea. Visitors spend more money going by themselves to an unknown place. If you have a guide, he or she is going to tell you where you should go to eat delicious native meals. Also, he or she can tell you the cheaper restaurant in the city or town. In adittion, everytime you travel with a group, the discos and taverns are the favorite places to have fun. There, you can dance and drink all you want with less money.
 
 In conclusion, the best way to travel is with a tour guide. He or she can show you where to go, where to eat and where to have fun without paying big amount of money. Other way to travel is doing it with a group. To be in a foreign country alone is not agood idea because something could happen to you. Moreover, being with your bestfriends or maybe with your family makes the trip more exciting and unforgetable.
