I agree with this statement that most advertisements make products look much better than thier real quality. In these days, a lot of advertisements of products come out through media. As people saw those advertisement they never feel those products are not good, but they feel those look good and want to buy or use it. It is because ads do not show all of real, exist quality of products.
 When people watch ads, they just accept ads by media. All of the media are one-way communication, so people have to accept it and they do not have chance to reveal or ask about the products to media. Moreover, companies, which make products or goods, only want to show benefit of products rather than shortcomings of products. Therefore, people can not know side effects or demerits of the products, and it makes people to belive that products do not have disadvantage. For example, I bought an "i-pod" three years ago with a proud of buying good looking mp3. However, after I had been using that for two years, it was broken. Then, I went to service center to fix that. But service worker said they could not fix that because of it had been over its warranty. It looks very good in ads,    
 Second, when products makers use advertisements, they hire famous people and super stars who are effective to majority to make products seem better. It is due to the fact that people want to be and like to be them. For example, if women watch the Jennifer Aniston uses a certain hair product in ad, that product will be sold out fastly  because many of women want to have hair like Jennifer's. Even though that product do not have good quality, it looks good thanks to Jeniifer, so women feel that product has good quality.
