First of all, most of the amusing, entertaining, relaxing along with learning from the existing or existed cultural peculiarities throughout the world can best happen when more people are involved with the activity. However, this, ofcourse significantly depends onto the personalities and attitudes of the other people which you are travelling with as it is also pertains to you. Usually, these kinds of travelling experiences are chosen to be made with the close relatives which gives the adequate familiarity and confidence to the tourists. However, in my opinion every human being should experience different approaches towards touring with people from other nationalities or even with the people from same nation whom you are not known. Personally, I have had several experiences where I have toured together with an American flutist, an Austrian Clarnettist, a Greek Violinist etc., which are left indispensable impressions on me first of all with the conviviality of sharing and using different ideas that we all possess. Incidentally, I remember an old statement which my grandmother used to say "even the death is sweet with the plently of people in the most entertaining conditions" and I guess this statement suggests that there are things which needs to be done with several people.
