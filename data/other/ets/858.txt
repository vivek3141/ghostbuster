Some people believe that  young people is helping their communities nowadays. But I think those activities are fewer than before.
 My primary reason is that our communications with neighbors are less frequent especially in the urban area. Highly civilization of cities  allowed us to live without neighbors. For instance, when children get injured in the evening, we are able to get some medicine in a convenience store. There are no nesessities to be helped by the community.
 Also, the oppotunities young people make conversations with their community members are gradually decreasing. As they have to study at private schools or in their own room, they do not have enough time to go outside to make communications with their neibors. 
 Considering all the above factors, I conclude that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Although helping their communities are sometimes strong in rural area, those activities are totally getting rare.
