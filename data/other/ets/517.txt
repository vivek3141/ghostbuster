It is debatable whether young people do not give enough time to helping their communities or not. some people say that they can not find the reason why they have to care about their communities. However, I firmly believe that helping their communities is quite important thing in their life.
 First of all, We can not live by ourselves. we have to help each other.of  course that is an option and we can choose whatever we want, but nowadays, It wouldl be harder and harder if people try to live themselves. If we tring to spend our time in the communities, It can be a good way to know many people who can help us when we get into a hard time.For example, I was trying to have a my own piano recitle in my communites. and I heard that is not so easy.but fortunately I was a volunteer in my communities last summer and throught that experience, I had a chance to know lots of people who can help me. so I could have a recitle very easily because of their recommands. 
 Second of all,  we can improve our social skill. nowadays, people tend to be isolated. but I dont think that is the best way to live. 
 For example, I have a friend and she always try to be alon in her room. I thought she enjoyed her time herselfe but onday, she get a disease and It was dipression.If she try to lives out of her room, she woulnt get sick. from that time, I learned that social skill can be the most  important thing in our happy life.
 To sum up, even If we are young and their is lots of things what we want beside help our communities, we would better try to spend more time in the communities. I can say that would give you a great experience you ever had before.
