Everybody needs to be learn.
 
 Learning makes  better people and lives. 
 
 During the many times I've been learning many ways and practice since I were born.
 That reason I really became a people of this society of this generations. As I start to my first learn from the school, I had confused a lot of defferenties with I've been knowned.
 For example , my mom teachs me " Be nice to the friend. "
 But the friends are not be nice to me eventhough i was niced to them. I should be overcome this problem between I've learned.
 many years later, I learned about " Matter of Fats".
 
 People cannot seperate facts with knowned.
 Depands on the how the people can be a better persons  our facts are matter.
 
 Therefore, my opinion is - we can be related well of knowned with facts.
