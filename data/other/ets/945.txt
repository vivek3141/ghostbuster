I agree that It is very important for students to understand ideas and cocepts as well as to learn facts.  They both compliment each other. 
 It is crucial in a students to understand ideas, as  well as concepts. If students don't understand the cocepts, they won't learn them. When students knows the cocepts because they understood it, they won't forget them. By understanding the ideas and concepts, the students have the capacity and the ability to explain to others what they know and the area that they dominate. Also, students that understand topics, have more chances of getting good grades in tests, becaus they can give more facts an example of what they understood in class. That is why it is so important for teachers to explain with examples and to give facts and make good points, so that the students can understand the area that they are studying completely. Teachers should make questions to see if all the class comprehended the point that they were trying to enphasize. When students understand the ideas and cocepts the will have better results in their exams as well as presentation, reports and other assigments. Also they will have the capacity to helps others that don't understand the area.
 For students is also important to learn facts because before they understand the concepts an ideas they have to learn the facts of the subject. By learnig the facts they learn the reasons why something happened, where something happened, why something happened and who made it happened. Facts are also really important, and teachers teach the facts so that the students learn them and understand it.  Learning the facts makes students know everything about  a topic or a subject.
 After the students have learned  facts and understood the cocepts and ideas of a subject, they can have great results in their tests, and in addition, achieve many goals in their carreers.
