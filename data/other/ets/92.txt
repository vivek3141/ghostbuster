I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
 
 First, the motive for producers to make their products seem better than they really are is that producers want to convince consumers to buy their products. Today's competition among companies in business world is like wartime. For a company to survive and make profits a company needs to sell as many products as possible and raise revenues.
 
 Second, a company can make products seem better than they really are because consumers do not have enough information about products. Even though companies makes false comments about products consumers cannot tell comments are true or false. Some consumers may be too busy to look for information to judge whether comments are made correctly or not. Also, the fact that the functions of the products in market are not very different plays a role in making false advertisements. Since the functions of the products in market are so similar to each other consumers will be easily convinced to buy products if consumers hear comments by producers that point only to strong points of products and exaggerate the features of the products.
 
 Third, people are more easily convinced by visual images than other types. If  a product looks better than other products, a consumer might want to buy that product even without obtaining information regarding fuctions.
 
 In conclusion, producers make products seem much better than they really are through advertisements because producers want to survive in competitions and consumers do not have proper information and are more susceptible to visual images.
