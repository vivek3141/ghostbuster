I strongly agree with latrer statement that it is better to have knowledge in a specific subject. My reasons for the agreement  for specilization in a specific subject are as follows.
 It is a compulsory required for every one to get well skilled in any field for their survival. For this every one  must study a particular subject of their interest. For example ,a computer programmer,a surgeon, etc,. These people who are well trained regarding to their field subject can survive better by serving to both companies and public. For example a specialist in heart surgery may serve people and often will bring a good name for his hospital. Like that an economist can serve better for his country.
 Onthe other hand  if one have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects like Maths, Physics, Chemistry, economics ,etc.,it seems great of his knowledge, but it will become difficult for him to choose in which field he can serve better. Obviously, he can not able to choose any two options .If he chooese any one, after a short period his mind may think of another field that he is familiar with and surelyhe might be confused.
 How ever it is better to have askill on one subject that we are familiar. Even the great scientists also specialized in one specific subject only. For example Late Sir Newton. Heis a very great scientist who was familiar with Physics. His major works in physics  brought a new revolution in the field of physical science as they solved many problems.
 Finally, I strongly believe in that the person must be specialized in only one subject rather than having broad knowledge in many subjects.
