The claim of the question is that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. I strongly agree with the claim since the following reasons.
 
 To begin with, the government has begun to develop some rules and laws to encourage people to use mass transportation. The government has some advertisements on TV to promote usage of mass transportation. Through the activities, people would change their minds. Besides, the government has raised taxed for people who own cars and increased the burdens of these car owners. For example, in Taiwan there has some laws to raise taxes of car owners.
 
 Second, it is harder to find parking spaces for car owners, especially when people live in a big city. Besides, it is expensive to rent a parking space in a big city. Let me take Taipei as an example, the car owner should pay at least 6,000 NTD to rent a parking space a month. Some people may argue that they can affort to pay the money. However, some people jsut can not find a good parking space even they want to pay the money. Since the all parking spaces in Taipei are not enough for all cars. Hence many car owners begin to consider the mass transportations, such as bus, taxi, and subway,
 
 Third, people have concensus that too much cars would pollute our environment. Now some families may own more than one car, but actually they just need one car. Under the strongly environmental pressures, people start to know the importance of environmental protection. Too much cars will pollute the earth and endanger the existence of human beings. Therefore, it can be predicted that more countries would cooperate to decrease the pollutions through some contracts or rules that limit the cars owned by each country.   
 
 In summary, considering the aforementioned reasons, I strongly agree with the claim that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today, since the environmental issues and the efforts from the government to limit the quantity of cars.
