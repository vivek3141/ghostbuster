In my opinion, young people do enjoy life more than older people do, there are many reasons why I agree with this statement. I will mention these reasons in the following paragraph.
 To begin with, for health matters, young people have a smaller risk to have physical damage, in contrast with older people, therefore they can allow themselves to do crazy experiences. Of course this does not mean that younger people are free from health problems. 
 In addition, young people are not yet aware of what life is really about or the outcome it will take.This way, the sensation of an excitement of discovering its meaning is provoked in these youngsters. 
 Moreover, older people are known to get sceptic due to the troubles that they might have faced during their early years of their lives. Therefore, they cannot enjoy life as much as the younger people do because they already have done all their great experiences. Usually, during the early years of one's life, it is the time when one meet its first loves, which completes a life leading to pure delight. Although, elderly people can have a love in their life,their marriage or having children already belongs to the past,for them. When one enters in the older years of one's life, a sense of tranquility is felt meaning that life is not enjoyed as much as the previous years. For me, one enjoys life when one remains in constant activity because he can feel he is alive.
 In conclusion, young people enjoy life more than older people mainly due to the fact that older people have already had their time of real enjoyement in their lives and their nature is to slowly fade due to the fact that their life goes at an end. Of course, there are some exceptions where young people do not enjoy their life fully and older people do.Although, this is not the common behaviour known today.
