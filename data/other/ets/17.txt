The aim of the modern education is not making the students learn or memorize the facts. Instead, it is introducing them ideas and concepts. Teaching ideas and concepts will make the students understand the underlying reasons behind the facts. They will gain a broad vision which is based on ideas and concepts. Through this vision they can understand and eveluate facts in a more comprehensive manner. It is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn the facts because it is more meaningful and more practical. 
 First of all, without ideas and concepts facts are not meaningful. The ideas and and concepts make the facts meaningful. For example without knowing the ideas and concepts of early twentieth century it is not possible to understand First World War. The dominant political idea was nationalism which resulted in the deep hostilities amng the nations. There are concepts such as imperialism, struggle for market expansion etc. Without understanding these ideas and learning these concepts one can only memorize the chronolgy of the war but can not understand it properly. 
 Secondly, it is much more practical to make students learn concepts and ideas rather than facts. It is impossible to make a student to learn all the facts. But if he or she is given a theoratical perspective based on ideas and concepts, he would be able to evoluate facts that he faces. Ideas and concepts would turn out to be useful tools in h's hands to interprit the facts. The facts are written in the books. If one needs to use them he can open a book and read it. It is very easy. For this reason it is not practical to learn them by heart. 	
 In conclusion, It is more important for the students to learn ideas and concepts than to learn facts. It is better first to forge a theoratical framework with ideas and concepts then evoluate events in this framework. It is both more meaningful and more practical.
