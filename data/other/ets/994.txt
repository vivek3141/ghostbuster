It has been long discussed if it is more important for students to understand ideas amd concepts than it is for them to learn facts.I disagree with the statements that it is more important for students to understanding ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
 Facts are the things that we seen that is virtue and used as the basic of the ideas and concept.You can hardly tells weather the concepts and the ideals are true or false,because everyone had his or her owe observations.We know know that neithergh the Earth nor the Sun is the certal of the universe,but most of the people believed that the concept that the Earth is the certail of the univese.
 Also concept s and ideals always determine our own thoughts and lead it to the wronf or even opposite way,and take us far away from the truth.It is widely known that the reaserches of the brain cells had not made any progress for years since the sicentists use their concepts and ideals out of date to anylses the brain cells.This concepts that every kinds of brain cells use the electrocity to transfer their signals made them totally ignore the importance of the other cells.
 The last but not the least the facts not only provide us the matereals to observe but also functioned as the inspiration of the sicentists.By learning the facts we can thinking in our own way and then leart to select the best way of thinkin.As we know that men must suffer to be wise.If you suffered from your own thinking and figue out what the facts reflected,you will finally be able to handle the problems that you will face.By this way people became much more matrue ,and knows the essential of life which do not had the concepts of how to live in a good life.
