I do agree that most advertisements are some times misleading to the customers and the customers end up spending huge amount of money.
 
 Although there are laws which will take in to consideration about the products which are misleading and in bad tastes, there are many products which are coming into the market.
 
 for example in the  E commerce, the customers rely on the perticular supplier and some times the customer recieve an inferior quality product and it is time consuming for the customer to return back the product as he has to follow the procedures.
 
 advertisements should have a proper information about a product for the layman to understand .  the advertisers should act according to the law and the customers should have a easy accessiblity to return back the product if such product is not how it is described in  the advertisement.
 
 There should be  customer line for every product for the customer to explain how he feels about the product and whether there any  suggestions  on the product. In the third world countries customers endup in paying huge amount of money relying on the advertisement and they hardly have customer lines.
 
 In my openion there should be proper information about the product  and the product should give information in cases where  the customer is not fully satisfied about the product and the consumer care line should be there wherein the customer can complains about the product to the specific authority.
 
 Lack of customer care line and not having a check on the bad advertisers, the customer will be in loss. the laws should be strict and customer should be informed where to complain and whom to approach  to give a complaint.
 
 there are so many products which are advertised but dosent give clear message, customer often get confused and mislead with the advertisements.
