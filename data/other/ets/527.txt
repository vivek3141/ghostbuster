Nowadays most products are advertised in order to be well selled. But do advertisements make products seem much better than they really are?
 First an advertisement is made to sell a product that could be brought back to the shop if it does not suit the customer, who might dispise the brand and not only the products if he is unhappy with it. Therefore it has to aim at the good buyers. It needs to describe the products in a positive way, of course, but in a honest way.
 But many people do not really care. And as some advertisements make a hole story about a useless tool, its competitors have to go further to make their product looks better. For example, we first got "the wash powder that washed white". Then a couple of years later as people got used to this statement, we got "the wash powder that washes whiter than white", whitch does not mean any thing at all. What is whiter than white? Coluche says, in one of his scketchs, that  he was afraid to use one of them because he was afraid it would make his clothes disapear! But as people buy products with such an exagerated advertisement, i think it encourages the brands to make them.
 Another thing that makes advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is that everything about the product that is not good, all its downsides, are only written in so tiny letters that nobody can read them. That partially hides the truth about the products and, of course, makes it more attractive. For example, when you see an advertisement about an internet connexion for 19 euros a month you are happy. But when you sign in and you notice it is 19 euros a month only for the first three months and then the price double, you are disapointed.
 That is why i totally agree with this statement : "Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are"
