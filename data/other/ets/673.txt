We can see that nowadays young peaple do not give enough time to helping their communities. Nowadays the lifestyle of young people is very different than earlier.
 Indeed with the emerging of capitalism young people are less concern by their communities, they learn to be more individualist. Also with the emerging of new technologies, youmg people are less interesting about their communities and they prefer playing video games, go out with friends . 
 An important point is that we live in an individualist society, I mean a capitalist society where people are not intest about others and where religions take less place than before, people meet less togather around ceremonies or thimg like that. Moreover people travels more and more and are often far away from their familly. the communitie spirit disappear slowly to let palce to individualism. 
 I think one of the more important reason why young people does not give enough time to helping their communities is the role of the familly. Indeed the familly do not have the same role then before, for exemple few parents stay married nowadays, women and men work hard , young people are often between father and mother and are more and more abandonned by parents , it means that parents do not have enough time to learn to their children to give time to their communities. Therefore young peaple are alone at home, in front of TV or in front of computer and use all their free times in watching TV and in playing video games. 
 I think the community spirit disappears to let place to the individualism but only in developped countries, we can see that in emerging countries the community spirit is still important , the man is less individualist and young people are more concerned  by their community.
