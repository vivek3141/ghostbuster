Fist, I don't agree with this statement, because If you would like to go a place where you are in a vacation in there, you may want to be a free person. On the other hand, you can't do everything what you would like to do in that time and in that place. But, sometimes we need a tour guide who introduce us the place or city where we are in vacation there, because some places where we don't know howmany historical places it has. 
 Besides this, If you go to travel with your tour guide you may have some problems. For instance, when you would like to visit some historical places you can't choose where you want to go. So, your travel guide may affect to you. Your travel guide everytime stay with you. You couldn't have a rest with your family. The best one is, travel only with your family. 
 Next, There wiil be many people in your vacation. And most of them who you don't see in your life or you don't know how charecteristic person do they have? This point is very important because, If you don't know a person or people, you shouldn't go to vacation with them. Maybe some of them are guilty,  we don't know eachother.  And there will be a lot of problems with your group, If they aren't nice people. 
 Then, you couldn't have a chance to choose them. I think if we could choose which person can go to vacation with us, it maybe possible to think go to vacation with a grup and a tour guide. But I never heard that you could choose your persons of group. 
 
 After that, maybe in your vacation, some of your group's member would like to go to other places or would like to do different things, but you don't.
 
 Finally, the best one is everytime you should go to your vacation only with your family.
