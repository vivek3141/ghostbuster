Many people are convinced, that the last universal genius died with Humboldt, or even earlier with other great scientists, philosophers and  thinkers. That would mean, that today every academic field is only teaching a specified knowledge. I cant't share this opinion. As a student of political science, i consider myself as a person that is accumulating knowledge in various academic subjects, not only in one specified. So an answer to this question, the old question of "generalization" against "specification".  is not really difficult to me.
 The most important argument in this context is large range of possibilities of where you will work in future. People that study only a specific subjectonly have few varieties of what to do in future. But on the other hand they are the one with the, I think, better chances to get a job anyway. It is so to say a risk to persue the path of generalization" in job perspectives. But Having a broad academic background makes it much more easier to handle a problem, because you will be able to make use of very different problem solving strategies, which only specific knowledge, this won't be that easy. But not only in carreer issues, generalization is more comprehensive. Experiencing already at university (by studying a broad variety of subjects) that life is much more than what you think it is, is a great addition to life quality. I'm thinking of a person that is sophisticated, with good manners and that is interested in the world and the people living in it and especially in those living close around him. To come to a conclusion, generalization could play an important part in creating a better world.
