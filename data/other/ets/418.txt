I agree to the opinion of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects than restricing yourself of having knowledge of a specific field of interest and area.I believe that one should be well  informed and aware of whats happening outside his domain and specialisation.Its primarily because of three reasons:-
 a)Competitiveness:-
 The society we live in is a very competitive society..So when you are not well informed about whats happening outside your field of interest;then you are seriously in trouble and indeed are lacking behind people who have a competitive edge over you.
 Ex:-Being a software Engineer;if you dont have the knowledge of whats happening in the hardware industry or for that matter in the electronics industry in general;then you might not be able to keep up with the information on latest gizmos and technology.Moreover others would have a competitive edge over you.
 b)Uncertainity:-
 The second reason is uncertainity of the current field you are specializing to sustain  itself;say 15 years down the line.
 If you are talking about a technolgy which is being used now;there is no guarantee that it would be there after few more years.
 Ex:-Everyone is behind java and some other programming languages..now no one is sure that java is going to be there in the future;say five years down the line.So its better to have a backup plan ready  for now wherein you are constantly updating yourself with other subjects.
 c)Organisational needs or Industry requirements:-
 Now-a-days large organisations do offer interdepartmental transfers by cross-training on different products thus giving a chance for the employess to move on to a different vertical altogether..If you are just informed about a specific field and are resistant against the inter-departmental transfers.It can really hamper your chances of moving up the ladder in the corporate field. 
 Thus I believe that you need to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than just a mere specialisation..
