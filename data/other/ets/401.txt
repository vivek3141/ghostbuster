I agree with the topic given in some cases . Because of the following reasons.
 
 Firstly student should understand the concept and ideas. So that he can remember for a long time . And explains whenever you asks a question about the topic which he had understued .For example a student is listening ti maths lecturer with interest . He can able to solve the problem whatever you give to the student if he understands the topic only . 
 
 Another reason is that if the student understands the topic then we can say that he is listening with concentration. So concentration makes student to understand any thing from the lecture .
 
 Anoter example is that If the student is learn or just read about the topic then he may or may not able to grasp the whole thing in that topic .For example if the student is learnig that is he is just reading or something like casual reading will not understand the main topic or the main idea of the topic. For example student is reading the magazine or the newspaper he will not concentrate to remember the whole things just he reads the paper and throws it out . If the same thing happens in the class room topic the student will not understand the main idea of the topic . 
 
 I disagree with the topic given in this case because of the following reason if the student is child student he may not understand the topic of his class the teacher may teache him in different way that he will not understand the topic so teacher may tell to student that you byheart the question and the answers which is related to topic .
 
 So i conclude that childrean student can able to understand the topic by byhearting that and adult students will understand the topic by themself by concentrating on the topic .
