I agree this opinion and think there are some reasons for it. 
 Before I state possible reasons for that, I explain why I think young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communmities. In my own experience, I did not attend community activity like cleaning or helping older people very much. I think it is not only my case but it hold true of other young people around me. Therefore I feel this opinoin is true.
 Then why this happen? It is often said that local community bond was much tigher before and people help each other and give much time to helping thier communities. For example, if it is hard for a family to take care of their children or elderly people, other families near the family help them. Opposite is also done. If there are some problems,  local communities helps each other . I think  it worked well before. That is so-called give and take spirit. Moreover, there were not TV games or computers, so children played with neibours. That helped children to mede friends with other children or communicate other adults members of the community. 
 However, thesedays such community bond bacame weaker.  I don not say it does not exsist at all, but few community works well. Because society bacame rapid and young people busy with their own work and prefer to do thier own things.  They lacks time and also lacks effort to join. That is a problem.
 Therefore if this tendency continued, it would cycle generation to generation. I think we have to see our comunities more and engage in helping.
