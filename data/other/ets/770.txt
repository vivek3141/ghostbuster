Advertisements are a source to reach out to the people and to pass on a message that one wants to say.People are influenced in a wide range on watching these advertisements.Many products are marketed through this procedure.
 Most of the products are not as worthed as they are shown in the advertisements.Marketing personals do not actually show the reality but try to convince the public that their product contains good quality and quantity:but they dont.
 For instance,the advertisement of a beauty cream or a face pack is marketed with an attractive presentation but that product  actually doesnt show much effect on anyone and the side effects will not be mentioned in that advertisement.Similarly,the products of food and snacks also do not show any growth regarding health but are shown in such a way that they can produce lots of energy and strength in a person.Offcourse,one cant find the clothes shining so brightly forever, with a detergent or wash powder as it is shown in the advertisements.Its all about attracting people in a false manner towards their product.It would be fare enough if the real quality of the products are shown in the advertisements.Only few products do effect on the people as the way they are displayed.
 In conclusion,I do agree that  the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
