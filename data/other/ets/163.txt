People have their own ideas about whether young people give enough time to contribute to their society. Some people might say young generation would like to help their communities, since they can experience a variety of things. However, in my opinion, it seems clear that young people do not give enough time for helping their community; they are too busy and they are affected by biased information.
 First, young people has too mush work to do. It is generally agreed that as society is getting compex,  young people  are too busy to develope themselves. Therefore they would not have much time to care for their communities, For example, one of my friends likes to do a favor to others so he got a prize from the principal of his school. However, since he has to prepare for applying to the university he wants to go, he cannot give enough time to helping other people. In this way, being busy is a great obstable to helping our communites.
 Second, as far as multi-media is concerned, young generations are only concern about themselves. Some people might say the multi-media has nothing to do with being selfish. However,  through the multi-media such as television, students are informed that most of people in our communities doesn't need help, so they do not bother to do a favor to our communities. For instance, the TV dramas nowadays tend to show us only the partial weatly class of our society to get our  attention, making young people think most of people do not need any attention. Therefore, the influence the multi-media prevents  young generation from helping our communites.
 To sum up,  young people nowadays tend not to help our society in that they has too busy to qualify themselves and they are getting distored information about their community. All things considered, I think young generations tend not to do a favor to our community.
