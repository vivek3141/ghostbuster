I think that are both important for the knowledge of the student. But exist different way to applicate them: for example for a kid at the primary schol, maybe it's better to understand ideas and concept, because he is at the start of his study career, so he need every strument to grow up well.
 With my personal experience, i think when you arrive at the university is important to understand ideas as well as learn facts. I'm studing design, and how can i learn the topics of the projectation without testing on my skin how project work?
 I'm really convinced that theory without practise at university it's not so good, the same for practise without theory. I think like this because when you are graduate there isn't anything more between you and you work life, and work in general is more about facts thant theory. so if a law student will be an advocate, it's better for his career to star to comprend what the worker life will be. But at the same time students have possibility to learn ideas only at school, so it't really important to combine a good theory with a good practise.
