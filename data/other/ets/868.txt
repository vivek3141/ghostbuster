I agree with this opinion : Most advertisements make products seem much better thant they really are.  There are 3 reasons why I think so.
 The pictures of advertisements are usually very attractive.  For example, the picture of the apartment's part of the room.  It always seems larger and brighter than they really are.  However, the customer actually visit the apartment, they say the room is not as good as they expect.  Also, sometimes it is not as clean as the advertisement picture.
 The goods which the company sell are also more simple than the company says such as music players.  The company sings the productons of them can record and play more clear that what the productions used to be.  However, sometimes there is a no  differance between the new ones and the old ones except the price.
 There is one more reason here.  Our imaginations help to think better when we see the advertisements.  If we watch the commecial on TV,  we get the good impression at first even thou we don't know how the products really are.  Then we think we want it, but when we see the products with our eyes, we disappointed with it.  It is because the products are not as attractive as our imaginations.
 Because of these 3 reasons, I think most advertisements are not as good as than they really are.  They commerce just good point of the products, but we need to have critical thinking.
