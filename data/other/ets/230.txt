There is an increasing number of travelings per unit person from the years of 2000 to 2005 although the event of September 11 happened in United States in 2001.  It may due to the fact that more people like to travel outside from their countries in order to acquire knowledge of cultures and values from other countries.
 
 From my point of view, I firmly believe the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. First of all, I dislike the feeling of being alone. I would even invite a friend or colleague being with me in the journey from school to home. As a reult, I surely suggest the best way to travel , especially for the long trip, should be in a group. 
 
 There is a sentence I read from an author, 'The shortest distance to go to USA from Hong Kong is any route you chose but should be with your best friend. It is because the time goes the fastest. ' It surely indicated that the happeness to travel with a group of people. Moreover, travel in a group can faciliate the interaction between friends. It is because the whole trip will bound all the people together in a certain period, the relationship will become more closer.  
 
 Secondly, most of people go to travel solely want to have more knowledge in  history, culture and living style of other countries. If there are no experts from your friends in trip, a tour guide is very important. The tour guide no only can be the dictionary for certain district area, but also can be the helper for you to understand the culture of a country since most of them are native person. 
 
 Thirdly,  the cost will be much cheaper to travel outside in group than individual.  In many cases, the cost can be shared by friends. For example, it is very usually to hire a taxi to go to different locations including those of art gallery. football match pitch or other scenes. A taxi can accommodate four persons and the cost can be shared.
 
 In conclusion, it is wise to travel in a group led by a tour guide.
