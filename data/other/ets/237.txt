I`m not agree with the statement, at least i`m not agree if it`s a general statement.
 I think that a general knowledge it`s important because allow people to be able to do so many works, or to be informed on the topic argoments of aour time. But a Broad Knowledge at our days is not required from the market.
 For example: in my future work like an Architect, the market ask for people that have a general knoledge of the complicated world of architecture, but at the same ask a specialize Knoledge on one subject.
 This is the reason why the italian University, like the Europeans University, changed the ordinary study course from five years to two kind of courses, from three and two years. This division allow the students to have a general Knowledge in the Argoments in the first part of their studies and have a Specific Beachelor in the second part of their carrer.
 The most important reason to prefer the specific Knowledge is that Specialize ourself on a specific subject, argoment, course or everything else, can introduce jounger people into the  World job  and this is positive for a nation that need to increase is product.
 In our situation, during theese days of changing,  this way of thinking is important because i think that the age of general Knowledge it`s ended! We must be specialized in something , first to be early a worker and the specific knoledge can be a strument to find a different work in another nation or country too. 
 Theese are the most important reasons to prefer a specific knowledg to a general one but i thik also that we see this important changing in the world of work only from some years, because it`s an hard changing not also in the school and in the market, but in the people ay of life!
