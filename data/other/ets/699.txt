Advertisement industry has marked a great change in last few years. People all over the world see advertisments either on television or read in news papers because they come to know about the new and latest products  through advertisments. There is advertising for each and everything you name, computers, tours, kitchen appliances...etc . The advertisment either market the product or the supplier. Anyways...i agree that most of the advertisement make procucts seems much better than they really are for the following reasons.
 
 Firstly, Advertisers fool people by making there product more attractive and by presenting their product by a famous personality.
 lets take an example, lets take an add of a tooth paste. we all know tooth paste is used to brush our teeth and the advertiser makes it attractive by adding some beautiful colors ,some flavour and inaddition the toothpaste is advertised by a foothball player. What happens next? We the fans of the football player think that if the player is using that tooth paste than even we should use it. we dont even think what is so good in that toothpaste, its just colorful and attractive.
 
 Secondly, sometime the product is not worth the price it is named.
 Big company products have big price tags. Lets look at this example ,there are two company which are manufacturing jeans, both uses same material for the jeans but the brand names are different. say one is LEE and other is some brand. Now when you go to a store and you want to buy a jeans, which one will you choose? I know its LEE because it has a brand name and its with a greater price.
 
 Lastly, People are just attracted to the fancy and big thing. people thing that a more meet burger good than the  same price as the veggie burger but here the qyantity differs.pay more and get less.
 
 All in all. It is all about business, all about money.
