We all are aware of the fact that  "Knowledge of Divine". By academic studies we gain some knowledge to prove ourselves in our concerned fields.
 
 I disagree with the statement "it is better to have broad knowledge than to specialize in one specific subject".  As we know "Rolling stone has no moss", similarly the man with interests in many subjects is not worthful.   
 
 The reason for which i disagree is that a person with specialisation in one specific subject will have more demand than a person with knowledge of many academic subjects. As we see people in our daily life, a lecturer, a draughtsman, a lawyer, etc. these are all specialists in one particular subject. 
 
 The second reason is that as we know  that this world is full of competition. Everyone faces competition in his field. If we are specialised in one particular subject, we can thrive hard and we can get rid of this competition, by having immense knowledge of one subject. 
 
 The third reason i would like to present, is that a person's ability of learning may be more , but it is limited to a particular filed or a particular subject. If anyone wishes to have broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects he may not be able to grasp all the stuff from the subject. Its not just the matter of possible or not , its just impossible to anyone to have such a memorising or knowledge accumulating power. 
 
 The last and final reason is that though having broad knowledge of many academic subjects, he will work to a filed or organisation where he uses the  knowledge of one particular subject. But not all the knowledge of his all subjects. If he wants to switch over to other filed, he has to work from the begining i.e. like a beginner.
 
 So i prefer to have broad knowledge in one specific subject to having broad knowledge in many subjects.
