Yes, I agree with the following statement.
 It is more important for student to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn facts.
 Well, I am a student, I study architecture and for me is very important to understand that I study. 
 Infact if I do not understand I do not know how many important  things.
 When my professor talk about a famous architecture I like to listen him and I like dream about this things.
 If a student do not understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn facts...well, he or she do not learn anything. 
 I think that if you can learn more things about you study or not, your mind can learn much more.
 Well! I think also that if a student do not have a good theacher he or she do not like understand that he or she study.
 However, there is must a good collaboration about a professor and a student. I do not talk about complicity, but I talk about a good abient where theacher and students could be to learn. 
 If a student do not understand that he or she study I think that he or she do not have more things about tell. 
 In conclution, I think that If a student have a good teacher, he or she can understand everything he or she want. 
 Infact, I understand more that I study because I love that I study. I love architecture and i like see, touch, and talk about it.
