There is no doubt that advertisements plays a very important role in our daily life.Advertisements main role is to attract people to buy a certain product or to go to a specific place;moreover,advertisments helps a person to choose between two products by showing for example that this product is for high class people, it makes you a good mom or even telling you that this product will attract you to the opposite sex.In fact advertiments really make the products seem much better than they really are.
 
 Frankly speaking,advertisment is very effective esspically that it can spread over different medias.TV is the number one advertisment media.Because the contiously increasing number of people watching TV,most firms uses this advantage to their own benefit by putting out advertisments during the matches,entertainment programs or even news.Another medias for advertisment is the radio,newspaper and others more
 
 No one can denay the fact that,advertisement can control us(persuade us)to choose the product we want to buy.Firms uses this advantage by making a highly effective and costly advertisement that makes the products seems much better than they really are.For example,a car advertisement in an news paper showing the picture of the car from the inside,the first impression that a person feels is WOW that car is really big which is in reality not true it is just a picture that it is modified to make the car looks bigger.Another example is toothpaste advertisement,in the advertisement it shows that this type of toothpaste will clean your teeth 100% and make them white and shiny like crystalls which will make you more attractive to the oppiste sex or gender.As a matter of fact,advertisement is becoming a very big lie.
 
 Finally,no one can refuse or reject an advertisement.Most of the people and even ME beleive in some of these lies and I go and buy this "GREAT" product and after I try it I realize that I have been riped of by the advertisement company because they made the product seems much greater in thier advertisements.At the end I would say that I completely agree with the following statement:MOST ADVERTISEMENTS MAKE PRODUCTS SEEM MUCH BETTER THAN THEY REALLY ARE.
