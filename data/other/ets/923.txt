I agree with the statement. The human beings natural ability to think and to develop new ideas in their mind, is a characteristic that cannot be isolated for themself, and for this reason, persons cannot use their minds it could have an unsuccesful way life.
 
 The history of the world reveals that since the ancient years, the human was always trying to develop new ways to get food, to build a comfortable place to live and to be distinguished than others of it's kind. By now, the story is the same, we all are trying to improve in at least in something in a way to be different than others.
 
 Nowadays, the technology and the discoveries made by some humans, are in some ways taking out of the mind of the people the ability to try new things because of the fear to lose what they have or because they feel good with which they have, people feels they don't need any more. But at the same time, when humans are enjoying what they have, starts to feel they need more and more, and in this point the human start to develop new ideas in it's mind.
 
 For this reasons, the human being have to take risks on life, otherwise he cannot be able to improve on something. Doing what he learned to do it's a good begining, but in some moment of their lifetime, they will start to take some risk, not only to feel distringuished as I said before, but as an impulse of the mind created by the insctint to "think" and "develop" new ways to live. We humans can live doing the same thing much years, repeating the same, but we always going to find in the very deep part of our mind a good reason to do that, a reason about improving, creating or making something new.
