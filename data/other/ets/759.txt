I thinks that a person must has a broader knowledg, that means that you know something about every thing, but also he must to concentrate on a specific subject to know every things every problem that this subject could have. when somebody starts going to school he studies different metter, and his theacher theaches you someting about that but not every things about that matter. I thinks that this first step of child studies has a lot of importance becouse he can listen and study different lecture and after that he will decide what he will do in his future life. For exemple in the past when I went to school I studied different matter such as philosophy or latin that somebody could say that are futile matter.However I  disagree with this statement, in fact ,even if  now I am studing architecture , this matter  helps me in my work. If somebody  studied phiolosophy he reads easier an architectural book because in some book you can find some  concepts difficult to understand.However it s also important that somebody specializes in one specific metter. In fact if you know every things about a subject you can foretell the problem or the effects of something. this will became important in the future work where a person will have to decide himself. In particularly she will  consider her konowledge and if she has not  the specific knowledge she could only fail!. In conclusion I can say that the both tipes of knowledge are needed in our society and
