I agree with the statement but I have to point out several issues.
 
 I believe times have changed therefore we cannot expect young people to behave in the same way as young people from the past did. They might not give enough time to helping their communities but this could be due to a lack of time and different targets. 
 
 Nowadays young people are individualistic because we live in a society that focus on individuals rather than on communities. By the same token, young people focus on themselves and they prefer to invest their time in selfish activities instead of community services.
 
 I consider myself a young person and out of my experience I can say that I am not interested in communities at all. Furthermore, I have lived in several countries and what really strikes me is the fact that young people behave completely different depending on the country that they live in.  For instance, in Sweden guys are extremely independent whereas in Spain are much  less independent likewise Spanish guys might care more about communities than Swedish guys do. So in order to understand the question it is needed to place it in a specific context. 
 
 The responsible of such situation is the society because society is constructed around individuals, rules are made according to what is the best for individuals thus they became the most important thing. Nonetheless, it is possible to notice strong nationalistic movements in Europe that emphazises on communities. If European communities become strong, it would be a change regarding young people's attitude hence they would give enough time to helping their communities.
 
 To conclude, I agree with the statement but some aspects need to be considered before talking about young people and their attitude. Young people behave completely different depending on the country that they live in and their culture, however,all in all it can be said that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.
