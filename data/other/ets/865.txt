'Everything that glitter is not gold.' summarizes my feeling on the subject very well. This statement can not be more true in today's world where advertisement makes every thing look so good and glamorus to intice people to go and buy them only to realize latter that they have been tricked and fooled.
 Advertising is an art of selling things or rather presenting things to the customers, that is us the poor gullible people, in a way that makes them irresistable and desirble, larger than life, so that we will be compelled to buy them.They, the advertisers stop or rather stoop at nothing to do so, at times even relying on little white lies, its only after you get the product and try it that you realize that it is not all 'gold'.
 The best example of it is the weight loss products that are there in the market which claim to make you lose weight in matters of days, they also have celebrity people vouching for the product, its only after you get them that you realize how dificult it is to lose weight as those products do not do the wonder trick they claim on you. At times you would realize after buying those that they contain substances which are infact harmful for your body.
 The other ones which particularly infuriates me are the cleaning supplies product which claim that they can remove any stain from any surface without any effort "just spray and wipe",you buy them get home hopeful to see all the stains dissappear from your carpet but lo and behold even after half an hour of intense scrubbing post spray those stains are still mocking at you.
 The other are the products which make you look younger more beautiful, restore your hair, teach you new skills in no time.The list of such advertising can just go on and on but I guess they have their reasons for doing that but wish it was not at poor customers expense and that they could present things in their true forms.
 But then wouldn't the world be perfect hmm....
