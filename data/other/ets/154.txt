Basically I do not agree with this statement.
 Actually, travels with a tour guide are confortable. The reason comprises the following two facts. First, most of tour guides usually know and provide a lot of useful information, such as good places for visiting and viewing, delicious restaurants and dengeours areas. The other reason is that we do not have to care any problems related to speaking foreign languages e.g. reserving hotels, buying tickets or ordering in restaulants.
 However, guide tours have a serious problem, at least for me:  we cannot arrange the schedule as we like. Tour courses are strictly determined. This implies that we cannot take a rest even if we feel very tired, and we have to go to places where we do not want to go. We cannot get up late...
 Another reason why I do not agree with the statement is that we are not able to have private time due to the group travel. Private time is quite a precious for eny situations, especially for travels. We must always go with the group and the tour guide.
 On the other hand for the private travels, we can go anywhere we want to go, we can have a tea for a rest, we can stay for a long time as we like. If we want to know some useful information, travel information centers will be helpful. We may apply half-day or one-day tours found in the information center.
 In summary, I prefer private travels. If I need some useful information or some optional tours, I will go to travel information center.
