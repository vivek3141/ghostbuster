The concepts of learnig from facts is moor importent than understanding thing.practical observation is moor importent than theoritical knowledge.byexperiance we can learn moor.
 
 we can lean driving a car bu practicing not by understanding ideas how we can stsrt and how to use tha breaks etc.,not only in driving a care riding bycical.
 
 one of the most importent thing is how learn maths with ideas or else with  facts.without understanding ideas we dont ge maths by practicing thigs that have more and more.By learning facts we understand the depth of maths.some time we can use tha ideas.for example in my school days my teacher gave one priblem to find out the area of our class room i know tha formula for thar but i dont know no how to use that one.After that my reacher lear to me how to calculate of our class room by taing its lenth and breath.finaly i thought that with only knowledge of ideas u dont find any use. 
 
 when we are  learning  computer subject the manual give some information abouthe the computer and we can aderstand the basics of the computer.at that time we have less knowledge about that but we learn from practies this is the keyboard and this is the monitor otherwise we have some confussion about that.
 
 
 Thus we can undrestand the conceots of anything notonly driving acar,riding abycical,learning maths,and computers in our life everything is understood by facts or by practical.
