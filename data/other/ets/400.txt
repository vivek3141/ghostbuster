Even though joung people usually like enjoying themselves more than older people do, this is not necessarily true.  For exemple, you could meet a really cool 60-years-old man that does everything in his power to have fun and make life worth of being lived, and a very boring 20-years-old boy who will never step out of his house except to go to school.
 On the other hand, iif it's true that joung people do enjoy life more, it could be because of the belief that one would better take advantage of its youth before it is too late.
 I do not totally agree with that statement, in fact I think that people should have the courage of enjoy their whole life, without wasting all their chances while they are just teenagers or waiting too long to start following their dreams.
 Talking about real facts and people, I could nominate as many teens as older people that are enjoying their lifes. Today's world offers chances to have fun to people of all ages: there are a lot of parks and resorts where a child can go and enjoy a few days and where its parents would have a great time too.
 Holiday resorts where my grandparents would love to spend a few week can be found almost anywhere, and of course there are a lot of structures that offer amusement to teens between 15 and 30 years old. So, if a person wants to "enjoy its life", there is nothing keeping him from doing that.
 Nevertheless, we will always meet someone who is not wanting to do any of these. And if we really pay attention to it, we will find out that this kind of behavior is present in people of all ages, there in not a real average. If one wants to have fuun, he will do it, and if he doesn't he will not. Maybe it's just another way of enjoying life, even though most people consider it boring and worthless.
