There are a lot of successful people around where you live. Some people can think successful one takes risk and other think they do not take risk. In this case I agree successful people inspire to do new things. 
 
 To begin with, they usually try to do new things. They do not want to do the same thing people always do. For example, in growth, people usually go to school when they are young and step to a next stage which is high level school. Then they go to college to get a great education to have a exellent job. But succesful people do not go to school if they do think it is un useful. Thomas Edison is the one who did drop school. 
 
 In the same way, after growth, some people just go to work and go home. They would not like to change their life in the better way. But  other are trying to do get another education to get a better job. To give you an example, there are many people to think successful life is having a professional job like being a doctor, lawyer or politican. They try to get in school. That makes them special and successful.
 
 In contrast, there are still many people who give up what they want. Maybe it is difficult to do in their lives because of money, kids and a various kinds of problem. That does not make them unsuccessful.
 
 To sum up, we could see succesful people have risks. But it is true everybody can be successful. In realy, there is still question that successful people is the best noe in our world.
