l do think the route to success is by continuously trying new things and taking risks. l still remember what my mother had told me "failure is the way to success". 
 A lot of great invention were created because the inventor willing to take risk, for example the airplane. If the scientist didn't try to fly over and over again, we will not be able to enjoy the flying nowadays.Or if they were not that enthusiastic about trying new things or new technology we will not be able to use computer now while we are doing the tset.while we are talking about new things, lets explore them a little bit.According to my dictionary,news are advice, environment,group of people, whichever can lead me to success if l know how to handle them appropriately.
 By saying new thing to successful people, of course, we are talking about taking risk, doing something that we may never do before, trusting people we might not know, taking advice that we might not accept or even not possible to happen in the real world.
 l think keep onces mind open to new things is very important.And never confine yourself to the old school.Don't be nervous of taking risk ,neverthe less always prepare to fail then one day you will successful.
