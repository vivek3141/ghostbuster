Well according to me, for students, understanding ideas and viewpoints is a pre-requisite for any further studying.While on the other side mugging up of facts is a temporary solution.
 When a student listens to a teacher in a classroom  attentively then he would definitely remember his\her words for much more time than after reading the same thing from a book..Its correctly said that a teacher is a student's best book.If a person implies the situation practically then he will remember the thing his whole life.
 "Ideas are understood more efficiently though ears than through eyes", with which i agree completely.Understanding something gives a more permanent stability in mind rather than reading it once and forgetting it after a few seconds.Take for example,if you learn a lesson from your history book without understanding it u would just get yourself into trouble and confusion.On the other hand if you yourself or one of friends explain the concept, that why this war was held,or relate the date with something,  then u would remember this war your whole life without even looking into your book once.
 So the gyst of the concept is that mugging up facts is no solution to your problems.Its intrinsic to first understand the ideas,grab the main point and then paraphrasing of the fatcts that you have studied
