I`m agree with this statement because I think that sometimes most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The advertisement is maded generally to achieve the customer`s attention because in this way there are more possibility that the costumer buy the product.
 There are some persons that study for a lot of years to learn the rules of marketing and to learn the right ways to achieve their costumers.
 Today, on television, we can see a lot of beautiful advertisements. We are often intersted and enjoied from they, but when we buy this products in a supermarket often we are not so happy for our purchase.
 I think that often the advertisements that I see on television are really marvellous because they capture my attention. For example next week I saw the advertisement of Barilla, a famous firm that products some types of pasta, and I thought that this is made as a little film. It`s beautiful because it talks about the life, the ways that childrens have to see the world and the love that is between a mother and her baby, through all of this the advertisement speak also of a new type of pasta called "piccolini".
 I think that this is a beautiful advertisement and each time that I watch it on tv I really want to buy the product.
 Few days after to have sought this advertisement I have eat this type of pasta and I understood that it is not so good as I believed, infact I prefer so much the normal type of Barilla`s pasta.
 Therefore I say that often most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are as for example I can understand in tha case of pasta.
