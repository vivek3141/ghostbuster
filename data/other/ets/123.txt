Enjoyment in life is very subjective.What one person enjoys doing in life , the other person might think it to be boring and uninteresting.
 However, the young people have a larger scope to enjoy their lives than the older ones and hence i agree to the statement that the 'Young people enjoy life more than older people do'
 
 Age is always associated with ailments. During the old age , these health ailments refrain the people from indulging in activities they would have loved to do. For example, outings and adventurous trips are not feasible for them.The younger generation can enjoy the excitement of adventure sports , though not regularly , but surely during the vacations. The activities like driving , gyming are not recommended for the older people even though they might find enjoyment in it. The older generation starts looking at life differently.
 They don't enjoy going to movies and plays which is actually fun. They rather find themselves secured within the four walls of the house. 
 
 I have an example of an old man in my neighbourhood.He just watches the young people playing and being energetic about life. He often tells me that he does not enjoy his life, the way he did in this young days. He expresses his desire to get involved in some rigorous physical activity and feel rejunivated.However, his health does not allow him to do so. He just passes his time by listening to old songs and watching the daily soaps on television.
 
 On the other hand, there are a lot of enjoyable activities for the young. If they wish, they can indulge in parties quite often  or  go to the movie halls or watch the plays at an auditorium.They can explore the things which the old cannot. The quality of life is higher when you are young than when old. Hence i believe that the young can enjoy life in a better way than the old people.
