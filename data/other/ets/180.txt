In my opinion its better for me to specialize in one specific subject ,because if i specialized in many academic subjects i'll get distracted and i would'nt manage to pass in all of the subjects for example i wanted to study general mass communication but when i thought about it i figured that i can't manage to to study four subjects, so i pictured my self for future and i thought that advertsing would be very good for me if i passed my toel hopefully, and some of the people have jobs i mean part time jobs so their jobs makes studying harder for them, and am not saying that if people wants to have broad knowlege of many academic subjects is wrong, half of the people can manage and the other half can't ,thats why people should know thier ability of understandig and wroking hard unless they should specialize in one subject , but i dont mind trying to study more than one subject and if i do handle it i will continue its very good to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects ,it is very usefull for future and for your future job and you will have the apportunity to work in so many fields if you didn't like a job you can move from it and go work in other job but as i said people should know thies ability if they can or if they can't so they could manage themselves.
