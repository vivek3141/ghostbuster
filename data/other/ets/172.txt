People make new things, invent new things that may become popular but if they don't improve their things or try new things somebody do a more interesting than theirs and people forget the success that they give earlier times.
 As a result of it Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, will be publishing new types of programs every month or every two months. Because he doesn't want to lose his reputation and there are so many companies that want to see their programs make a better profit than him, sell more copies than Microsoft, Bill Gates' company, does. So he wants his company to the keep improving and to make new products to the computer users.
 Also a basketball or a soccer player needs to improve himself and try add new things to his playing style. Because if don't try new moves and make regular moves that they are doing all the times, the opponent can control them easily, defender can defend them easily. And if they keep playing in the same way they can't have an effect on match so even they can be cut from the team and broke. In soccer, Ronaldinho who is the best player for this decate for a lot of people says that he is so successful because he improves himself everyday and keep looking for new dribling skills that when a defender will see them in a match defender will be suprised and he get passed of defender easily.
 In conclusion, i think that successful people should try new things rather than doing the same thing over and over again. So that they can't be just wannabes and people love them and love what they done. As we can see many real examples of this.
