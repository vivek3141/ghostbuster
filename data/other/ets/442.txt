Nowadays, a lot of businesses are growing and developing. As far as business is concerned, people who have started a new business want to succeed. In my opinion, the people who want to earn a lot of money have to try new things because of following reasons.
 
 First of all, if one has a new idea, it would provide people interested. The most important thing of success in business or earning a lot of money begins with people's interests. People do not interest what they already know. In contrast, upon seeing a new thing, they interest about the thing and buy it. Thus, an interesting idea or new thing which are never known to people could succeed one's business
 
 Second and last, the world is changing rapidly and variety. One who knows how to do well and does the same thing, he/she is never  going to be succeeded because the world is moving fast and requires new thing everyday. For example, one of the camera company 'Canon' has changed new way on digital camera. The cameras of Canon has 'CMOS' censor which is the heart of camera and in the past, 'CMOS' is the worst and cheapest chip. Canon, however, has developed this censor new way that is totally different way than before. 'Nikon', one of the rival company of Canon, was tha best of camera in the film area. In contrast, Nikon uses 'CCD' which is sharper than CMOS but expensive. The censor has given from 'Sony', hence, it is expensive and it is not their own technology. Through Canon's new trying and developing its new censor become the best camera in the digital camera. In the past, film is the only method of taking picture, however, the world photography market has changed by digital and Canon tried a new technology and finally succeed. 
 
 In conclusion, the world needs new things and people need new things as well. Therefore, if one wants to succeed, I would suggest two things. Be a creative to make a new idea and try a new way to succeed.
