Some people keep enjoying, sometimes indulging, their youth. They believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do. So they have to consume their limited youth for enjoyment. I have to say such idea is inappropriate since enjoying life is not a previliege of young people.
 
 There are many types of enjoying your life, no matter you are young or older. Everyone, at any age, can find his or her way of enjoyment. Young people are physically energetic so that they can climb moutains, play Internet games, play basketball and disco dances. Older people can travel in more peaceful ways like trip on a cruiser, playing chess and gathering to watch basketball matches.
 
 Some enjoyment are just mission impossible for young people in the sake of age. Family gathering, marriage and retirement are just patents for older people. Imagine that sitting arounded by children and even grantchildren and enjoying a candle family dinner? Children certainly can enjoy much from it. Meanwhile older people enjoy with another kind of happiness. They may even enjoy more than others because of more memories of the family.
 
 Sometimes, financial condition may also provides older people better chance than young to enjoy the life. Owning a dream house is just a dream in short term for young people unless they got a sudden fortune. With more money after many year of saving, older people can enjoy having a house, having baby, gardening the backyard.
 
 Generally, no matter your age, or even gendar, career, etc., different people always can have different options to enjoy life. This is variety and colorfulness of life.
