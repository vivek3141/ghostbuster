I agree with the statement that successful persons try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already learnt. I go with it because I have  many illustrious examples which out weigh the statement.
 
 Firstly, there adage that successful persons does things differently but not do different things. They analyse the scenario by laying out previous experience and change them for better results. For example Deerubai Ambani who  brought new revolution in many industries as he developed . For example let us take his Relaince Mobile, he used CDMA techonology  and reduced prices of the other merchandise products. Though the reduction in price he got many profits.
 Another, Consider great Mahatma Gandhi , he is known by his priciples  of non violence. His new movement of boycott bring freedom to many countries. There is a lot of risk and pain in that way but he never wavered , continued to bear the pain and won the battle.
 Another , can you imagine same art and architecture around the world ?. Can you imagine same work every one do?. If they go with the old established principles now world can not be improved and there is no new technology. Unless we go and try new benifts and innoate new ideas we can successful in present world. Example , In my school age I was used to mug up all the formulae for the maths exam and used to get low scores. I used to face this problems because that time I dont know the derivation, after recognition of this I  tried to find the derivation of the formulaes and that was my great success when I was child. Here I want to give example of Newton who wanted to know why the apple is  fell down from tree? .
 
 From above mention points can accept that Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.
