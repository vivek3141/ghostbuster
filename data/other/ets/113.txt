There are a lot of products in the shops and it doesn' t matter what you want to buy, you have really a lot of choices. In order to convince the costumer of a special thing, there is advertisement almost everywhere. I agree with the statement and think that most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are.
 
 The first example is the TV. When you are at home and want to watch TV, there is shown a lot of promotion. This shall convince the person for the product and leads him automatically to the next shop to buy it. And because we live in a modern world, you can phone a number and they' ll send it with the post. So the persons things, he bought the best teeth brush ever. And when he wants to brush his teeth, it breaks. So you see, that the advertisment makes the product seem better as it really is. 
 
 A second example is buying a new car. You saw it in a newspaper, the TV and want to buy it, because it shall be modern, fast and the best ever. After a few months you have a breakdown on the highway and have to call the garage to repair your car. So you learn that it' isnt as good as the advertisement said and showed in the newspaper and TV. You better think about buying a new car and ask a person who knows cars from his job and who could give you tips.
 And not only see an advertisement and buy immediately!
 
 Products seem much better as they really are because of advertisements.
 In general, you can buy all products you want to buy, but you have to be careful about the advertisement. Better try to find out on yourself how good the product is and when you thik it' s good - buy it!
 The world of today is full of advertisements and so the people have to be more and more careful about what they buy!
