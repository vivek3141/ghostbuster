In life there are situations for everything. In case of this statement I belive that there are certain times when the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide but there are also sometimes that you want to travel with your family, friends or by yourself. It depends on your expectations of the trip and how you like to travel.
 
 Traveling with a tour guide is always much more practical and easier. Here, most of the time things work as they are supposed to work. Flights are booked, hotels have reservations, restaurants are good, times are scheduled and things just run easly. This is a perfect choice for a first time visit to a place. If you only have a couple of days, and want to get to know as much as you can, a tour is perfect. It will show you all around, the most interesting sites and what everyone talks about. 
 
 In the other hand, traveling by yourself is completely different, here you get to make your own choices. You decide when you want to wake up, at what time and where you want to go to dinner and what museums you want to go visit. This is a much more relaxing time. It  is a perfect situation for a second time visit, here you get to go to the places you most liked the last time you visited and do exactly what you want. It requires much more individual planning, well no one is going to to that job for you, but it also has certain priviledges. 
 
 I also belive that a group and a tour is not a thing for everyone. You have to be tolerant with the other people around and you have to let people boss you. If you are not a type or person that likes to rush and be with a lot of people, traveling by yourself is the best choice.
 
 i dont think you can say what is best, you just have to consider the type of trip you want to have and the type of person you are. then you can make the right choice and enjoy a perfect trip.
