I disagree little time that young people nowadays help their communities. There are two reasons I think so. 
 One reason is that  it is important to think what others do think. Communities consists of many people. If people participert their communities, people can talk with others. So,people think of others.
 If people do not pertisipert their communities, they do not think of others. So, people think of theirself. What people do not like happens, they quarrel .But, people cannot live alone.   
 Two reason is to accept many people's idea. So, people can think many idea. When people dissolve their problem, they might be able to solve them with other's idea. 
 Therefore, I think young people shold help their communities.
