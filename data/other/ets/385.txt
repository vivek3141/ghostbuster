I agree with the following statement. In my oppinion successful people are successful only because, at one point of their life they were faced with a chalenge and they had to take a risk in order to succeed. People that only stick to what they are good at will only be 'good' yet they will not succeed if they do not take risks and face new challenges. 
 Trying new things, ideas, and being able to overcome new challenges is what defines a succesful person in my opinion. For example, if a person is quite gifted at a certain sport and is considered talented, it is still not enough for him to be 'labeld' as successful. This person will have to test his abilities against other people, try improving these abilities, and risk injury or loss, and improve even more in order to move forward and become successful. If this person did not risk losing to people better than him and overcoming them, he would never know how good he actually is. Another example could be opening a new business. If a businessman does not risk losing some of his money while starting the business, he would not be able to make-up for his loss and gain even more money. Not only is it important for a person to face new chalenges  to imporve on himself, but it is also important to proceed forward, and see his level compared to other people or any other competition around him. 
 Facing new challenges, and taking risks is the only way a person would be able to succeed in life overall. Talent is important yet it's not the only factor towards success. All the famous athletes, business men, superstars, etc. have faced many challenges and were able to overcome them regardless of how talented they were, and that's what makes them successful.
