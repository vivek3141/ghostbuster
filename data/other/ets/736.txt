The society we live in is based on consumption.  I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In the contrary, nobody  would buy these products.
 
 I think that nowadays, people really need to be sure of what they buy. They want to make sure that they buy the best product. So, the only way to ensure them is to create the advertisement they want to see, even if it is not true. It is the case, for example, for the solutions which make you lose weight in only two weeks. Most of the women know it is not true but as the advertisement  shows faked benefits of the solution, women want to try it , and so, they buy the product.  Women finally notice that the product does not work.
 
 It is also the case for the children. They often see toys they have ever dreamed of on television. The advertisement makes them believe that with this toy they will be the strongest, or they will be the best. As children still ignoring the principle of this consumption society, they believe what they see and they want to buy the toy. But once they have got it, they become aware of the truth and see that their toy will never give them what they were told.
 
 So I think that, indeed, most advertisements make product seem much better than they really are. It is one of the most impostant rule of the consumption society. Produces have to always seem better than what they really are. People only buy what they think to be the best for them. 
 
 All advertisements have to lie because if they do not, the advertisement for another product would and so, the true advertisement will not have success. It seems that there is a tendancy nowadays, people prefer to be told lies to feel more confidant than being aware of the truth. That is why I think that only the advertisements whicg make product looking better than they really are are more succesfull.
