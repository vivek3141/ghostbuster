Humanity never found out the response of this question: 'Is it more important to see the ideas and concepts or to learn facts for new brains?'. Both of these two poles have their proper advantages but is one of them more essential than the other one? For students which one is more efficient?
 Ideas are always needed and as a result they are important because they are the starting points of all developpements, of all achievements. Students have to understand these ideas and concepts because they are in a great thirst to knowledge which is leaded by these abstract forms. More precisely, a student must see the meaning of the ideas and concepts to go forward, to have new visions, to develop his creativity. Thus, understanding ideas and concepts are really important for students which are this world's future.
 On the other hand, students can not do without facts because these show the results of ideas, these clear the reality for us. Students can not continue just by using ideas and concepts, without knowing facts they won't be able to corporate their abstract views. Moreover, facts are the light of the past,of the present and with them of the future because as in history we can not go on without knowledge of the realities in this world and for students' education reality passes by facts. Also students will encounter facts to test their ideas and concepts, ifnot thay can't know if they are correct or not.
 In conclusion, with these advatages showen, it's impossible to say either learning facts or understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students. In my opinian, we don't have to compare these two sides because they are going always together by completing each other and both of them is really essantial for students.
