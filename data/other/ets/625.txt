Whether it is more important for students to undersant ideas and comcepts than it is for them to learn facts ? When facing with this questions, different people may have different opinions. In my opinion, to understand ideas and comcepts sometimes is more important for students than to learn facts. My reasons for this are as follows.
 Firstly, many knowledge in our world are the ideas and concepts of things. Sometimes it is difficult for us to reach to the facts because the technology we've got today does not have the ability to do it. For example, when we study biology, there are many things about our human's body that we can't explain how do they works, such us the memorial system in our brain. We can only guess it according to the  limited consequences. So most of the time we only have ideas and concepts on these things. Students who can understand the ideas and concepts can help them develop their ways of thinking and proceed their reserch.
 Secondly, the knowledge in some scientific areas are very abstract. It is very difficult or sometimes even impossable to learn the facts. The art, for instant need us to feel. The ideas and concepts of an artistic work is the only thing we can use to understand it. They don't tell us the facts.
 In addition, to understand ideas and concepts helps us to posses the ability of using the knowledge. If a student only knows to follow the facts and never thinks about it, he or she probably don't know how to use it. Their mind will be stucked with no personal opinions and wide imaginations.  
 To sum up, nowadays, the most important tallent for a student I think is the creation. And if we always think of the ideas and concepts of the things and try to understand them will help you a lot.
