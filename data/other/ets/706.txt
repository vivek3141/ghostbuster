Most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are, and i think this is cheeting on pepoel , its like covering a book from its titel .
 
 I disagree with making product look much better then what they really are ,firstly is that  its cheeting on  pepoel from buying the product on what they think it is by looking at it for example I want to buy a table its cheap and in good shap but after i use it, it doesnt continue one day and its broken . Althought it might be danger  for pepeol using it , example buying a chair wich looks graet and strong  and an old man sits on it and sudden the man falls down  he will get heart , so sometimes it could cause some dameges because of what it looks then what it really is. Another thing is that these products wont be usfull for nothing just will be bought and thrown away the next day because its of no use so why wast these thing and try to make products more usfull then on how it looks .
 
 In my opinion i think the advertisments should make the product more usfull than what it looks instead of making it much better than what it really is because at the end the product is made to be used not to look at only .
