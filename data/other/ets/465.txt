What is advertisement for? Selling a product.
 Commercial are built for the only purpose of finding clients that will buy a certain product. How many common mortals can develop a sense of criticism looking at a well cooked and decorated dish of a new restaurant opening in the neiborhood or resist the temptation of tasting a chocolate mousse cup as soft as you see on the tv spot.
 The range of positiveness that an advertisement send to the public is infinite and for the quality of the product and for the contest where you find it. Happy families and smiling faces can attract more customers for sure. Using design, music and celebrities can contribute to make the rest.
 There is a famous advertisement in The United States about an "Italian restaurant". The music in the background is a typical Italian Tarantella, a big family is sitting around a big table speaking loud, smiling and pouring wine. The picture looks like a real piece of Italian life. Many Americans, with Italian heritage or not, dream of going out for dinner and taste a genuine Italian cuisine spending a moderate price. Who design the advertisement, of course, paid a careful attention to all the details.
 Well I confess that I was also attracted by the genuine Italian atmosphere created in that advertisement. With great disappointment I came back home. Nothing was like I expected: frozen food and butter prevailed, instead of the freshness and the olive oil commercialised. 
 Advertisements are nice and very intertaining, but we always should keep in mind the main reason why they exist and always take them 'cum granum salis'.
