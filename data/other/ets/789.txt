Although my job is a kind of advertiser, I have to say, yes, this problem happens daily.
 
 It's not difficult for us to find some shampoo advertising on the TV,  after used that brand of shampoo, your hair become, woo, shining, beauty and fantasic. Unfortune, when I use that brand, the magic didn't happen to me.
 
 For lots of reasons, advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. 
 
 First important reason is, when the clients believe the advertisement, the will buy the the produce.The producer can earn much more money than before. A little over than fact, nothing big deal.
 
 Then, lack of manage from the goverment.  Some medical and food advertisements,  the effects are different from the advertising, the end-users canl be hurt or even dead. But some product haven't  been challenged yet, still producting without the goverment's control.
 
 As a person work on advertising, I know this situation need to be changed. With my workmate, we always try to persude our clients-the producer to accept the advertising concept "The advertisement, the real fact".
 
 We can believe, with the more goverment's and all people's support, no one buy these products, no benifits, the problem can be sloved.
