I am agree to young people enjoy life more than older peple do.  
 Young  peple have a lot of power and enagy.  If they don't use those for enjoying life, I think that is very wasting way.  They should use those in young age.
 Now I am young.  I am a high school student.  I think I enjoy my life more than older peple. To go somewher with my friends, to go shopping with my family, to chat with unknow people on the enternet, to drow pictures, to finght with frends, amd more whatever.  Some of there are needed to young power.  Some older people can do these.  But when I become older person, I think I can't do these all.  Because I will lose power.  I might be tired early.  I know I will become like my thinking.  So I have to enjoy my life now.
 However, older peple enjoy their life by using money.  They go to big trip,  to get houses, and to eat rich foods etc.  This enjoyment is defferent to young's enjoyment.  They want to relax.  They won't to use such a enagy.  I think our feeling of enjoying and their feeling is defferent.  They are enjoy ther life, and we are enjoying our life same as the others.  If we are enjoying by defferent feelings,  I cannot say which is nice, or bad.  All peple enjoy their life.  I think that's very nice.
 Anyway, I hope to enjoy my older life in the feauture.  And I would enjoy now too.  I should play more.  When I become an adult, I will think "I had to do someting more in the high school!  Why now my life is so busy?".   I don't want to say so. So, now I am trying to search more fun things!  I want to enjoy more my life.
