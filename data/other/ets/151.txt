To agree or not agree with the statement which saying : yound people enjoy life more than older people do , 
 
 From me as a teenagers , I agree with this statement , not because i'm still young and I'm enjoying life right now but I'm going to explain this is some examples , so I'm going to right about my opainons using  some examples :  As we know that old people doesn't like to enjoy life so much beacuse they will start to suffer from a lot of diseases which forbid them to move normal and will take there strength away , I have a grandmother that she had a lot of diseases and beacuse of that she's always slepping and eating and I alwasys ask her to play with me and my borthere's but she can't,  so diseases are one of the main resions that make old people hate life and not to enjoy it .however we should not forget the great benifits that we can get form them , the stories that are full of expeariane and konwledge and wisdom which rarely you find  it with the youngs .
 
 second point that I want to make is  that  the youngs have a lot of ways to enjoy life  like computers ,watching TV , driving cars , chating , make to frined's , swimming , but old people can't do these things so the find them silly and not interseted , so old people have to find some ways so they can feel life and enjoy it , for example my grandmother hates TV and she always want to close the TV beacuse  it's  not very good for the childern . 
 
 
 At the end and according to the reasons that I gave and the reason that other will carry , I see that young people know how to enjoy life and beacuse of that the are enjoying it everyday , but for  the old people it's so hard to understand those ways .
