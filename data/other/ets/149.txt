Nowadays, knowledge has changed, methods of approach are different, concepts has become more difficut to master, students have different abilities, there are students with limited abilites and stretched to students with overwhelming abilities, this does not put an end to learning experience, as there is a question that is floating  in our minds and leads a person to a deeper thinking and makes him put his knowlege behind him. Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts ?
 To begin with, I surley accomodate this, and it is more influencial for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts, for example: what would it be better if a student knows that the sea is deep, or learns why its deep, that will give student a deeper, wider, and a variety of ways to think, students will be more efficient in their life,thus leading to better study and a safer vision to their future, and start thinking in a convergantly more significant way.
 In the past, people had limited recources, no computers, no television, and it would be good if they had books with a quite limited explanation, so our past ansistors depended on their logic, religon, and the scenario that they pass through everyday to learn facts, which lead them to a succesful life that we live nowadays, inventions and innovations passed through, so what is left?
 Its more important to understand ideas and concepts, as I have mentioned that all facts have been produced, so what is left for a student nowadays is to dive deeper in ideas and concepts and try to get out with a sucessful summary at the end of the day, because one day he will be tested with the facts in front of him. Example: in a math exam a student gets all rules that he might need to solve the qustion, but what he needs is the concept of how to solve the question.
 It is not a mirracle for a student to pass his study life with flying coulors, every person owns his own mind, but the secret of each is where when and how to use it. which will result him in his/her desired outcome.
