In my personal opinion its very important to understand ideas and concepts. Nevertheless facts are the basis to really understand ideas and concept. So learning facts and understanding is closely connected to each other. You can't understand for example politic systems in countries, without knowing some of their history. Why the British have an constituitional monarchy and Germans have a federal democrazy. The reason for this lies in their history, and you can learn history only through records from the past, which would be facts(if the source is reliable of course).
 This is also true for many other areas from sport to science. If you don't know the rules(which are facts) of  football you will never be able to get the concept of the sport. If you don't know numbers it will be difficult to become a math geniuses and so on...
 
 Of course there are some areas where not many facts or knowledge exists or still many things are unknown. In this areas like for example in biology and astrology you have to formulate and develop facts through observing and experiments. This is naturally way harder than the normal approach to understand ideas and concepts with the help of knowledge(facts). But this people also had to start with facts until they come to the point where there are no real facts are left, so that they can go on from there.
 
 So my statement is that in general you just can not say that  understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts, because thy are intertwined. Besides some few exceptions in areas where you have still to explore a lot of facts.
 
 By the way. A special exception is of course religion. Since facts are often threatening religion. that's why from a religious point of view it would better not to spend too much time on facts and just go with the concept and idea of the religion, be it Christianity or something else.
