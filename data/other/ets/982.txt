I agree with this statement . Young people can do what ever they want . The old peole cant judje them becuse they are young . They can go to club,date weman, dancie with everyone , and the youn people cant finguer the life in this age . I think when they coumplete 25 years old mybe he can finguer how it the life hard and how can handdle with it . The old people take every things responsblity and they cannt joke in every thing as young people . The old people love quite place and stay alone sometimes . They just talking about the past and what did they do in them life . But the young people can joke in every things and they can talke with you about what ever you want . But if the young people dont know what you aere talking about they will not join in the counverstation . the old people they talking about every things and they think they knew every things in the life . The young people travel to enjoy in their life and they want to know about the others counteres . The old people feel lazy and hate travel or go any where . If you ask any old person about what was the best age you enjoy your time ? . I think almost of them will answer when they were young and when they did every things in their life . The young people know that when they come old they cant do what they are doing in them age now .
