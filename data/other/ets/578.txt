I disagree with the idea that understandig ideas and concepts is more important than learing facts. It is more important to learn, even if you don't know exactly what something means, because if you can learn how to apply what you've learned in real life, then you won't forget about it.
 
 One of the main objectives of a student is to learn, or at least it should. There are several factors that could change the goals of a student, or even the results of what they've learned. In order to learn, you can use real-life examples to understand a concept in a better way, and that's an easy way to learn.
 
 When your teacher uses easy examples in the class, sometimes you don't even realize thay you're learning until you remember that particular example in the real world. And I think that's the best way to learn, because you might not even try to learn and you do it anyway.
 
 In my personal experience, I love teachers who explain something to me in a simple way. One of them is by giving examples you might know, or some experiences you might had. And the best of all is that, one day without any effort, you remember what your teacher tought to you, and the example he/she gave you.
 
 It is very important that teachers try their best to make students consider that is more important to learn the facts instead of memorizing a concept. Because if you do that, maybe you will know the definition during the class, during the week, or during the course. But if you never use that concept again, or if you don't even care about knowing how to apply what you're learning in your real life, then it would be like if you didn't learn a thing.
 
 It is really important to be aware of this important aspect in learning, and it's a homework we all have to accomplish:
 
 - Students in order to be better prepared, and 
 - Teachers in order to improve students' learning.
