I agree. Because if I had many academic subjects, I can become some professoinal. Because I want to be a business man, I need to know many subject. But I don't know about business yet. So I think I should learn about academic subjects. If I learn specialize in one apecific subject, It is a little place where I will work. Because, I have only one soecific subject. So maybe I can not communicate with some partner of other country. In conclusion, I agree about this question.
