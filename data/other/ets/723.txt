With the fast mode of life style, young people tend to be more reluctant to care about the community. They need to accomplish many tasks within a limited available time. They actually face pressures every where. Very little time is spared to look after others. Education, on one part consumes a quite large part of their typical day. Hense, they try to fill the other free time by enjoying themselves and spending the other in different hobbies.
 The advance of technology that has once made the youths' lives extremely easier and more comfortable, adds further pressure on them to accomplish as much  varied jobs as possible at a time. They find themselves divided up between various undelayable tasks. The result is an abandant package of responsibilties and a short limited available time. 
 There is also an important factor that should be considered other than free time in order to do voluntary jobs. It is the financial assistance that youth need. Most of the youth nowadays, rely on their own to support themselves to make living. Thery have to work hard to do this. Not all parents do care for their living needs. Educational fees require them tp provide the necessary financial ability to go to college or higher studies . Not all families support their sons / daughter with educational expenses. 
 On the other hand, the youth have been surrounded by a great deal of attractions, starting from the around -the -clock  access to the internet to the newley invented innovations of technological products that take most of the vailable time of youth. Very little time is then left to be utilized in any voluntary actitivty. 
 The social values are have also changed tremendousluy. People  are becoming mainly inclined  to indiviualism. So ego centrism replaces values of enphlathropics. 
 finally, youth should work very hard to secure their future carees that compell them to show high qualifications and competency.
