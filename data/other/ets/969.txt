I dis gree with the statement. Young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities. some were else very lessly they wont do so.  i had a lots of experiences on this.  In our nature their are lots of communities  the communities are arranging a lots of meetings  in their and almost all young people are attendig them and some them are giving their own ideas to the communities  which are very help full to them.
 Firstly i would like to tell a community that are arranged in some urban areas  the urban young peeople were helping alot to that  community and that is some people are collecting a blood from the others and they are serving them to a bllod donation camps  and hospitals and many others who are in need  and these are doe under their likings they are not forcing them too.
 secondly  when there any accidents happend these young people serve alot to community by helping them in different ways by taking them to hospitals  and getting to them and helping with money if they are poor and many alot like this i told u this because i look this happend in front of my eyes i too helped them  in many ways became the part of this  and i feel proud  by doing this and makes me inspired alot and very much intrested being I am ayoung person  and many youngsters are stepping infront for this sort helping their communities and others. 
 by these two we can conclude easily that young people work more in helping others and the communities in many ways to plessure they ment to keepb in enthusiasticaly . So  its clearly announces that   clear explanation about this. I DIS AGREE THE
