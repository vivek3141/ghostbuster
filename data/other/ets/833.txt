Though some people might think travelling in a group arranged by the travel agent is the most suitable way of travelling, I strongly disagree with it and I consider the best way to travel is by individuals.
 In my first place, the cost of travelling by individuals is significantly lower than by a group. You need to pay more service charges to the tour guide, to the hotel, or any additional charges when travelling in a group, You may have a question in mind, "What is the cost difference between them?" From my experience to Boston in United States, travelling in a group would cost about HK$ 10,000, while travelling by individuals would cost about $HK 6,000. It is only two-third of the cost by travelling in a group.
 My second reason is that travel in a group is not flexible for the schedule of your trip. You need to follow a standard schedule to eat, to play or to wake up at specific times while it just likes working.
 The main purpose of have a trip is to relax while the tight schedule would not make this original goal effective. For instance, if I want to stay a place for a longer time and enjoy more there, it is up to my decision by travelling alone. I can manage my time in my own interest instead of following a standard time schedule.
 Finally, I consider that travelling alone would explore more than you expected. You can decide to go to any places to learn the different customs where it would really broaden your horizons and make you become independent. You can obtain any kinds of information by finding them out yourself and get a deeper insight on them. For example, you can live in a host family for a couple of days to experience their culture. This would be really beneficial to you.
 To conclude, I love the experience that only travelling alone would give me.
