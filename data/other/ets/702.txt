Broad knowledge or specialization in one subject,  which of them are important and valunable in our contemprory world? if i forced to held a position, i would stand behind the latter, being specialize in one specific subject.these are my following reasons
 
 in the first place, i strongly believe that special knowladge in one crutial subject is the foundation of being valunable or scarce in our merceless compatative business world. Knowledge is accumulating and nobody can reach all of them in one life. different positions require different kinds of workers.therefore having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not logical becase of demand of special members from campanies.for example i am studyin economics and my school is providing significant skills to me  that will be helpfull on my business life. as a consequence a secrutiny of this education syllbus will  make you understand the importance of my coise.
 
 secondly, besides requirence special individuals there is one more significant aspects that make my choise sagacious. while you are for example trying to gaining many information about academic subjects you may loose your time and energythus focusing different things and seperating different subjects may decrease your enercy and the most importantly your success. as a result having broad knowledge may bring bean than boon. 	
 
 to sum up, when we consider in detail it will be apparently seen that specializating in one specific subject outweigthing to trying to obtain different and wide knowladge of many academic subjects.
