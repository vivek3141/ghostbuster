Young  people usually cost lots of time on computer,cell phone and go out for fun besides school and work time.But I don't think it means they do not give enough time to helping their communities.I think the communities can't separate form the common actives and people.Young people can learn a lot in friends,computer and somthing or someone they meet in life.
 
 For example,I always cost a lot of time on computer and interenet.I met many kinds of people online I will not find at school.I always can find new things from them.And I can aways get the news online when I want.But in the eyes of other people,maybe I just play the computer all dat and do not give enough time to helping my community.
 
 That is why I do not think young people they do  not give enought time to helping their communities.I think they just change their ways to do it.
