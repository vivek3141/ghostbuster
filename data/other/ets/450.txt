How old do you have to be to be considerated as a young people...?As an old people...? I do thing that it is more a question of state of mind than a question of age. You could be older than me and live so much more deeply your own life than me, you could be so much more in the present time! Everybody is able to enjoy his life whatever his age. But I agree with the fact that most of the time it is easyer for young people to appreciat life for lot of reasons. Let see these reasons in two points, or more specificaly by analysing both sides: the ''young'' and then the ''old''.
 It is true that the older you are the more your health gets bad too...as a student with a good health I don't really think about the sickness. Everyboby know that the childhood is the best time in a life. You have no pressur, no soucies. It is the time of innocence. I have never met a child who speaks about death! They think more at how to spend all the energy they have!
 On the other side I have to say that older people have experience, the knowledge. They have learned about live, they know what they want, what they expect in live. Usually they are able to do what they like because most of old people have worked for years and years and are retired now. And right now, in our society, old retired persons have more money to spend and so much more time than people who are still working. That is true as long as they are in a good health.
 As a conclusion I would like to say that you need to feel good to enjoy your life, everything is in your head. So many people are young but already old in their head. Enjoy your life!!
