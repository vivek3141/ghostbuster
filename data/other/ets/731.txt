When you are doing studies, you are confronted with a lot of facts, and also with ideas, and specific concepts, either you are studying biology or literature, or philosophy. 
 We could wonder what, for a student, is more important: Is it understanding ideas and concepts or learning facts ? Right from the beginning, we could answer that what is really important is both to understand concepts and ideas, and to learn facts, that is to say learn to understand both to the light of each other. Actually, we could think that  understanding a concept doesn't mean anything if you don't have any fact to link it with. If you just have a concept, but no facts, it serves for nothing to know this concept. Nevertheless, if I had to choose between both, as a student, I would argue that it is more important to learn to understand ideas and concepts, during your courses, at the university. I would say that because in my opinion you have less chances to encounter concepts and ideas and to understand it in your personal life than in university. University is the place you could learn about difficult notions and where a teacher could explain them to you and develop them, whereas you could learn facts on your own, reading newspapers, listening to the radio or reading books. Yet, I would add that it is important to learn facts, so as to improve on your knowledge, which can't be composed of concepts and ideas, since it is always important to know, for instance, important dates of the history, if you are an student in history, or important formule if you are a student in biology, or the date a writer wrote an important novel and the political and cultural context in which he wrote it, if you are a student in literature.
