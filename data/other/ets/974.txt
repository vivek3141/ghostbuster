I am writing this compositon to argue about the statment that says "Is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject".In the next paragraphs I am going to state the advantages of  having broad knowledge in many acedemic subjects and the disadvantages of it.
 Every single person all around the world wants to be a person with knowledge a person who has a good average and all the family is proud to have a person like that.Studying many subjects in school and in university and getting low marks is useless there would be only one advantage and that is that this person will show that he is able to study so many subjects at once.
 On the other hand side.there are many disadvantages of having broad knowledge in so many subjects.First of all studying physics chemistry along with business and economics needs both learning and thinking ,i do not think that there is a person who  is  able to study these subjects together.Studying all these subjects will not make a person work in a company which has engineering combined with journalism. A person can only work in one of these companys.
 Almost all the people who work in companys now graduated from universities and all of these people studied a specific subject.Studying a subject you are an expert in is much better than studying many subjects that you are not good in.Many people who study many subjects are doing that just to get more money,these people should know that money is not more important than having a job which you are expert in,and at the same time you are enjoying yourself in this company.Another reason a person would want to have this knowledge in many subjects would be that this person just wants to show off infront of friends and family that he is working in two companys at once.My cousin was one of those people that wanted to have broad knowledge in so many subjects and he suffered a lot studying in university.On the other hand his brother studied Finance only and now his brother is happier than him in his work and he is also getting a higher salary.
 I disagree about this statement"having broad knowledge in many subjects is better than specializing in one subject".I think specializing in one subject is much better and i advise every single  person who is planning to study many subjects to think before making this desicion because nothing is more important than your future.
