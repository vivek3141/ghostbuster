Sometimes, people likes to be alone and they imagine to go abroad by themselves. On the contrary, I like to travel by groups because it is more beneficial for the novice of traveling. By group traveling, we can save more time and money. In addition, we can gain good information from a tour guide.
 
 The first benefit of group tour is time. We can save lots of time in group tour because a guide knows where we should go next. For example, If I get to a place, I probably waste lots of time to find a parking lot. Last year I visited the historical place of Dallas,TX, where J.F.Kennedy had a shot. I spent for 30 minutes to find proper place to park. In addition, we are to lose directions. 
 
 The second reason is the financial. The group tour does not require gas or parking fee. For instance, my family visited New York and Niagara Fall three years ago when we stayed in Chantly, Virgina. They chareged us only 450 dollars each person. We had great tour around there for four days. Before the tour, I calculated the amount of tour a person. It was 700 dollars. 
 
 Lastly, we can gain good information from a guide. They are well educated about the traveling. When I had a tour New York, a guide showed me that how puritans settled down in Plymouth and how New York became the center of world trade. When he said the life of New Yorkers, especially immigrated from my country Korea, I could understand their pain in lives. 
 
 As I listed above, I prefer to have a group tour because it saves time, money and allows me to have good knowledge about traveling place. Of course, I had a experience about traveling with only my wife to Washington D.C. last year. I think it was possible to have a tour without a guide because D.C. had very good and convenient transportation.
