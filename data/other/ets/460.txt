It seems to me that specialising on one subject is much more important than knowing many different subjects but not being specialize on any of them for many reasons. 
 
 It is clear that having the knowledge of so many different academical subjects is really important thing. By this way, people may gain the speciality of looking at a subject from different point of views and expressing their opinions on many different areas, however expertising on an academical subject is much more important than knowing lost of thing without being specialised on any of them.
 
 In the first place, since the people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects will not be an expert for any of the acadecimcal issues that they know, always there will be someone who are better than them and nobody will require their knowledge about that academical issues. In my opinion, knowledge is to be used and to make it be used, you should know it very well. It is not possible to gain benefit from that knowledge if you just have some broad knowledge about it both economically and personally such as gaining people's appreciation. 
 
 In the second place, the main motivation behind learning an academical issue is improving the current level of society. If someone do not have a deep knowledge on an academical issue, he cannot put something on account about that issue and cannot be a useful for his society. 
 
 It seems to me that whatever someone do, he should do the best. In this context, if someone is not very good on a subject, people will not evalute them according to the other subjects that he know, both the society and themselves will not get a much benefit of their knowledge without being specialized on it.
