I totally agree with this statement, although it is rather simplistic. 
 I think in fact that it is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are, but maybe this is just due to the location of the advertisement (for example a beach or a wonderful house) or because of the short time they have to present the product, so sometimes a thing is shown really fast, when it is actually not.
 Nevertheless I think that these are the only aspects that could be justified, but they are marginal aspects, not the core ones. It is a shame to make something seem fabolous when it is absolutely not or when it does not function at all. I believe that the media companies should avoid this kind of "false advertising".
 Many surround the product or the brand with fantastic characteristics, implying that the people who wear it or buy it are cool and special. I strongly believe that this is extremely dangerous for the young spectators, who are particularly sensitive to these aspects and have not a defined personality yet, so they are easily convinceable. 
 Moreover some could be dangerous even for adults: for example the advertisements on diet products, which are provided with false witnessing and interviews, which explains how many weight they have lost in so little time. I am personally particularly against this type of advertisements, because it is no more a matter of buying a television or a fridge which does not function, but rather a matter of health, which is much more important and has to be avoided.
 In conclusion I think that the only function of advertisement should be that of making the consumer aware of the creation of a new product and not to overwhelm him with false and useless information, although the consumer should be however critic.
