I agree this statment, because if they do noy have a risk.,they won't grow theriself. If they don't grow theriself, they won't success. If you do just what you know now, your skill for everything won't change forever. And to challege to other thing is to make success.
 I think that the successful people took a risk.If they don't take a risk, they don't succseed about everything. 
 In my case, I took a risk of luaguage. I'm studying abroad in Canada now and go to the high school same as Canadian. That was hard for me. I could not speak English very much and was afraid of speaking to Canadian and useing English in front fo Canadian. But I diecided myself to come here and study English. I realized again and I became to try to speak to everyone though they are  Canadian. Finally, I could make friends and got good relationship between my host family. And to try everything was changed my mind like kindly and more positive.
 Second, in my opinion, if somenody don't want to take a resk and challeange anything, they won't grow theriself. To grow yourself, you must do something for you. I guess that something include some risk. But if you do't grow, you can not be successed.Bucause, your mind is same as before you don't callenge anything.
 In japan, i did not take a risk and challenge to anything so i did not grow at all. But I came here i did growed a lot. Bucause I did challenge a lot and to grow myself. So i got a friends,  good relationship and confidence to everything.  
 Finally, I think to challenge is to make success. If you don't challeng, you don'y have anything even gad mark or result. You don't get anything and you don't successed. 
 For these three reason, I agree this statement; Successeful people had a risk for challenging.
