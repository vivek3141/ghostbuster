Young people enjoy life more than older people to a certain extent. In some cases, older people experience a better life, and their level of joy is higher than young people's.
 First of all, it is a physical fact that younger people are more energetic and enthusiastic about their lives. A young adult will have the tendency to enjoy his/her life by taking part in sport activities. In opposition to old peoples, young peoples' bodies are more docile and capable of doing sports. Again, the high level of adrenealin makes the young people feel better about themselves. Especially, in competitive sports the level of achievement is higher. A young person who is taking part in a competition and success, enjoy his/her life better.
 Beside the physical fact, young people tend to have more fun because less is expected from them. Lack of responsability leads to spare times, parties, and hanging around. They enjoy the advantage of being single. They take decisions about their lives more easily because they do not depend on their children or their husbands and/or wives as older people do. 
 However, sometimes being young can also be a disadvantage. They easily make mistakes, or have bad experiences. They do not think about the consequences of their actions, thus, sometimes they fail. Young people are not fully aware of the difficulties of life. Older people are wiser, so they have the least chance of doing wrong. 
 Moreover, older people have a career, better life circumstances, and finance. They enjoy their lives by taking vacations, or travelling the world. Maybe they do not party as their young children do, but they have a different understanding of enjoying life.
 Overall, young people and older people have different perspectives in life. In fact, life is full of joy, passion, and enthusiasm for those who knows how to cherish it, regardless of their age.
