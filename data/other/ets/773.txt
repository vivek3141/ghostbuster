Everyone wanted to be a successful person, right? You and me want to be and everyone try to be. Everyone know that being a successful people need to be very smart and hardworking. Do you have ?
 
 If you really want to be a successful person, you need to try something different between the others. Different things means try new things. 
 
 Be a successful preson should make some products or something can let the people forus on your new trying things. It should be fresh and new for the people. Then the people will disscus your products during their working time or shopping time. Immately your products will be a fashion, famous and everybodys topic.
 
 Of course you need to have a lot of ideas. Otherwise you will out dated in the whole world and need to think a lot of new products pre year. So be a successful preson take risks is very important for the new ideas. I think they need to go somewhere travel and learn mor different culture. It should be suitable for them.
 
 I don't think successful preson only doing what they already know how to do well. If you only do something you already know well it is improssble to successful because may be a 1000 people have the same company as what you already know how to do well. It is hard to show up in that much company.
 
 To be a successful preson is really hard.
