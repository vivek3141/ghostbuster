yes for some what reason it may  be true because from one point of view  young people will be strong ang will have enough stamina to enjoy by going to trips etc.also they will have no family problems to bother about.while in case of older people they cant enjoy as much as the young people did in these cases. 
 While from the other point of view older peole who got retired will enjoy  more than the young peole by passing their time with small kids.In which the young are busy with ther works and will have no time to do this.
 Also the reaon may change from one place to another because in western countries like uk,france etc.the way old people used to enjoy ther life is different from those old people who are living in eastern countries.
 Also the young people in north america the young stars will always look to enjoy ,ofcourse there  majority of people doing this.While in eastern countries most of the young stars are looking to get be in the higher position rather than to enjoy.also young people will have more problems and tensions than older people.
 In developing countries the most of the older people facing more risks than the younger people.but in developed countries they also enjoying with grandsson and grand dauthers.
 From the above information it could be concluded that it is difficuld to say whether young people enjoy life more than older people do.it may change from one place to another and also by the way the people likely to behave.
