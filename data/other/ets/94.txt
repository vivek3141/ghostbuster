"It is better to have broad knowledge of subjects than to specialize  in one" the above statement explains that the knowledge about all subjects is better than knowledge about a perticular one. I think that the blend of the knowledge about all the subjects is helpful in general avairness about all the subjects to the person so it will be helpful for certain level that is it should be kept upto schooling and the specialisation in one subject will give rise to new inventions,so both have an equal importance and the bleand of both in correct proportion will give success to a person.
 The knowledge of many acadamic subject will influence a person and give overall general idea about all the subjects as he needs to get allround development so this study will give the person the culture and the path to be followed in his future and the person will be having the basic knowledge of each subject and its importance,so the study of all subjects helps in allround development. for example the person will be able to understand the working of politics and his responsibilities if he has some basic knowledge  about politics or civics.
 The specialization in one subject plays an important role as it leads to invention as the specialist in science led to the discovery of electricity.for example the invention of laser printer has helped us in producing print outs of information in more faster and easy way.The specialization in one subject may help in the interaction with the people in the correct way ,for example the specialization in english will help him to use the english in more correct way and can express his views easily.
 The bleand of the both knowledge about all subject and specialisation in one subject plays a major role for the success so the correct proportion of both will develop a person into allround and will help the invention of new products which will make the life of the people more comfort and leads to the development of the country.
