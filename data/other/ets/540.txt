Nowadays, life is much more fast-paced than in the past: with the long working hours and the many activities that one single person carries out, taking some time to help out in one's community does seem a rather difficult task. These factors, however, tend to be overlooked when analysing why people, in general, are much less devoted to their community: this debate usually singles out young people as being the most selfish group. One that does not get involved and where each individual fends for his own.In my opinion, this statement is too simplistic and I do not agree with it.
 First of all,although we cannot deny that life is now much centered around individual goals than on community values, volunteering in third world countries has become a standard way for students to spend their gap year, helping out while at the same time gaining knowledge of another culture and possibly another language.In a natural catastrophe,such as an oil spill that ocurred a few years back, I was a witness to how hundreds of university students willingly took time to make the trip to the site and clean up for a few days, sleeping on the floor and with no retribution whatsoever. Some of them even gave up their final exams just to be there. 
 Further on,in a world where consumistic values are the prime source of identity, many transnational social movements are making the difference, and these are mainly led by young adults who truly feel they should make a difference:we could argue that, therefore, the focus is not any more on the immediate community, the one we lived in, but a growing concern for the global community. 
 If we are quick to judge the young's apparent apathy, we can miss out on the many activities that are carried out all in the name of solidarity: we have to look closely and see that all the political, economic and social changes have indeed affected the way people relate to their community, but not to its detriment, just to the adaptation of this realtionship in a more complex world.
