I do not agree with the topic that  "It is better to specialize in one subject only" because in the present computerized world people are expected to do many things at a time.a broader knowledge of many academic subjects will give the person to make himself with any type of environment.The world  is not isolated  every company have different jobs to do.I mean every company is dealing with many activities and expecting people to have the basic skills to perform reasonably good in every activity.
 
 For example take a company say IBM one of the biggest company in the world.There are many branches in the say Hardware,Software and so on.Many times People from one branch are shifted to other branch depending on the work and he is expected to do well in that branch also.Without having the basic skills in other academics he cannot perform in that branch.
 
 But for a department like Research this may not sound good there people are expected to invent something new for the future use of society.In this case the person is expected to focus more on which he is doing research.Even then he need some basic skills in other academics.For example if a person is doing research in VLSI designing,along with Electronics he has to be familiar with Electrical technology,Embeded systems,Computer sciences.This is because every academic subject is  related to other academic subjects.No subject is isolated from the other academic subjects.
 
 From the above points discussed i would like to summarize my topic that it would be better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.Broader the knowledge , broader will be the choice and a better future.
