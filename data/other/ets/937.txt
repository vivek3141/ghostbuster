Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The idea of the advertisements is that the people really want to obtain a specific product even if they have not taken, so in my opinion the creation of an advertisement is a business work, is a marketing job and what the factories want to do is to offer a product that seems great because if the people see something that it looks good  and special is possible  that  they are going to get it and try it .
 In my opinion there are some advantages and some disadvantages of this advertisements .First of all some of the advantages are  that the advertisements reflect what is the product looks like, its a good clue to find people to buy the product, its a good comunication between the saler and the client, is a way to promote a new product,and actually a new way to buy things because  people are very busy and do not have enough time to go shopping  is   buying things that they look in newspapers,magazines publicity, and Tv marketing this  one becomes very famous during the last years because most of the people watch TV so is a medium to have an idea about the products and it has an  advantage you  just make a phone call and you can receive your product back in your home inmediately . 
 But some disadvantages are that may be the products seem much better than they really are , they seem biger than they really are, they taste better than they really are .So its up to everyone if we get or not a specific product.
 In my case I think I am agree with the position that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because today the marketing is the publicity of a product
