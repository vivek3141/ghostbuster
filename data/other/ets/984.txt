I am inclined to support both positions because both have their own validity. However, I believe that, in the next future, there will be more cars in use compared to now. 
 
 I am deeply convinced, in fact, that many development countries, such as China or India, in the next twenty years, will improve their economy. Althought they have different traditions, and diverse ways in witch they move in their country, they will probably start to buy cars.  At the moment,  just a few millions of chienese people have enough money to buy a car, but in the future, they will be able to afford it. 
 Moreover a few days ago, when I was at home, I wacthed a tv's program about this topic. It was focused on the chinese's reality and it tried to explain what are their dreams. 
 I was really surprised because they said that car is the most important dream for this poplutation.
 In fact, they admired our society and they probably would like to have the same "quality of life" as we have. 
 Althought we already known that cars are doing many problems in our earth and plante, in fact, will still using it. 
 
 I am deeply convinced that If you live in a big city (Rome or Barcelona for instance) you will have pollution's problem. 
 
 For this reason when I became older I decide to sell my car. 
 I haven't had a car since 2000. After that my father decided to give me a gift: a BMW.
 It was so nice and I was so excited, but two years later I decided to sell it.
 I believe that car doesn't improve our "quality of life" and for this reason I really do hope that in twenty years the situation won't be different respect I have just written in this essay.
