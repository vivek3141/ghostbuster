I don't agree or disagree with the statement. I think that there are benefits as whell as problems related to traveling in a group led by a tour guide. 
 
 Some of the benefits of traveling in a group with a guide in my opinion are: if you have a profesional guide he might shown you places that are not so common for tourists and that otherwise you wouldn't know of; he could also tell you some history behind a place; and  the most important for me, normally locals know the best places for having a great lunch or dinner.
 
 Some of the problems that one might have while traveling in a group with a guide are: you need to follow a schedule, so there is not to much freedom; the guide will show you what he thinks is the most important sites, but that does mean that you will agree with that or that you will enjoy that; there is also the economical aspen the guide might not be cheap enoght for you to pay and finally there is the group issue, the group may not the type of persons that you would like to share your vacation with and this could make the trip less enjoyable.
 
 In conclusion I thinks that you need to evaluated before getting into a travel group if that is realy the type of experince that you what to get out of a specific vacation. If you are going to a place for the first time or for shorth time a guide could be good idea. On the other hand if you are visting a place for the second time you might already know what do you want to do for the trip and whell as when, so not being with a guide will probably be better then.
