I agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.There are three main reasons of that.
 First of all,to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects increase your potentials.For example,even if you have not decide what to do as a career in the future,you can choose any career.In addition,if  you decide what to do,companies will require various knowledge.A person who has broad knowleds has more ability to work for various sections than a person who has only one specific subject.Finally,if you have broad knowledge of many academic subject, you will get a good position in the company.A person who has a good position have to manage various situation.When he manage various situation,he is needed to have various points of view.Boad knowlede of many academic subject can help to have various points of view.
 For these three main reasons, it is sure that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specialize in one specific subject.
