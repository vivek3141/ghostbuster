The issue at hand is to tell whether there will be fewer cars in use twenty years later than there are today. This question is very crucial in judging the amount of travel infrastructure (like roads, fuel etc.) and car production required in the future. 
 I believe the number of cars in use is going increase over the next twenty years. There are several factors that hint this change, the most important being poulation rise, rise of developing nations, increasing lifestyle requirements of people.
 
 Firstly, the world poulation is on a rise. Human poulation on our planet has shown significant growth rate in recent times and there is no reason to believe this pattern will subside in the near future. So, twenty yers later, there will be more people, implying usage of more cars.
 
 Another important point to note is the present economic improvent in highly populous nations. For example, it is worth noting that China constitues one-fifth of the worlds population and India constitutes one-sixth. Also to be noted is the rate at which these two nations are advancing economically, which is slated to sutain over the next two decades, if not increase. They are moving from a state of high poverty percentages to prosperity. As they improve, more and more people in these areas will be rich enough to afford a car. Thus, we can expect many new cars in these nations.
 
 Additionally, regardless of nationality, the world is getting busier. People are running against time. They do not want to compromise their time for anything, let alone using public transport when they can afford a car. Thus, we can safely assume that increasing lifestyle demands of people will result in an increase in the number of cars.
 
 Thus I have enough reason to belive that there will be a lot more cars in use two decades later than there are now. That could mean that drastic steps will be required for finding enough fuel for these cars, among other issues.
