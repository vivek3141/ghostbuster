Although some people, perhaps marketing majors, may argue that a product consists both of its physical form and of the good advertisements that present it, even if they are not so correct, I do not agree at all with this view. In my opinion, a product must be judged as good and, of course bought,  according to its quality and advertisements should be based on the quality of the product and should not make the product seem better than it really is.
 The main concern of this marketing habit is that low quality products are actually invading the market and the consumers cannot distinguish between a good item and an item which is only well presented. Furthermore, in spite of its low quality, a product of the latter kind is often much more expensive.  
 As an example we can take Timberland shoes. In my country I see a lot of people buying them only because they have been influenced by the advertisements. Moreover, the shoes with that brand cost nearly three times the price of a high quality pair of shoes you can usually find in a shop, the difference between the two is the misleading advertisements. However, I do not mean that Timberland shoes are a low quality product, but of course, the sole difference between these and the ones that are not presented in the same way, is the price. 
 I could also have brought more meaningful examples but the problem would remain the same, we should care more about quality and the quality-price ratio.
