Do young people enjoy life more than older people do? This for sure is one of those questions that bring about so many discussions. When one is young, it is easier to speak, to reach strong judgments. When you are older, however, you get to have a different perspective on life--not that I am one of the old yet, but turning 30 recently has made me see things in a different light. And no, I do not agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do.
 
 Of course, being young gives one an obvious advantage--that of being physically fit and active. When one is young, they feel like they can do anything; they have their whole lives to look forward to. They can try out new things, go see new places, meet new people, and so on. However, as pleasing as this may seem, such an abundance of choices also brings displeasure, unhappiness, and at times, even regrets. Especially when combined with inexperience, one is likely to encounter--and will, by all means--many stones. You tend to make more mistakes and make decisions you later would like to forget. 
 
 Being old, on the other hand, is a whole different story. Yes, it means that you will not be able to jump and run around as much as you would like, you will have to see the doctor a little more often than you used to, and you may have to cut out on certain flavors you are so used to have. However, this does not mean that one cannot really enjoy oneself because they are old. Age means experience, and this experience is what makes it easier to derive pleasure out of life. The more a person has seen of the world--the pains and the pleasures, the easier it becomes for them to make the most of what they have.
 
 In conclusion, being old does not necessarily mean getting less out of life. On the contrary, it provides you with the opportunity to have more pleasure out of it, and what is more, be able to be grateful for the things you have.
