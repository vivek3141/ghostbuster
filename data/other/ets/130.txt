Young people in this moment are the most important thing for all the countries. however, if the young people are well organised they will give more and more better thing to country,so its really important to care about them.
 1st young people dont have to get tired because their mindes are well small for thinking about a lot of thing or get working hard like carying a heavy things or anything like this.young people can be free or they can work hard after the age of 21. that age is the end of season of teenagers to adult.
 Most of the young people in this moment are well organizing their lifes there for they will sort with good thing to the comunities, i mean they give time to help themself and to help their comunities. 
 Every problem has its answer so there is 20% of the young peolp dont give time to study or to do the best to halp the comunity so they can also stop the good onefrom learning and that will difinitly give the opposite to the comunity. Their reason are maybe they have a familiall problems or they have problems with themselfs.
 we all now give our best to get young people work hard and give more and more to get a well reprisented comunity that's the way the comunity can also help em if they need to do something or they need it and the comunity will do the best to get young people give importance to the country and give the maximum to halp the comunity. moving to China who got a population of 2 miliard of people it realise that 1 person in china can do what 2 others from other country do.
 All that i wanted to say is young people are obligated to give enough time to help their comunities
