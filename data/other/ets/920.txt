A universal tendency of human is to prefer the accustomed method of working over the new method. This tendency arises from the fear of risks, specially from the fear on the subject that one do not readily know. However, the successful people are often the ones who adopts new ways of thinking rather than familiar ways. The opportunity given in the known measure is fixed, but it can vary in new venture; in fact, one might find a better opportunity by far compared to the old one. Two historic figures of American literature shows the better chance of success in new things.
 Edgar Allan Poe, an eighteenth-century Romanticist writer, applied many unconventional genres and the measures unfamiliar to himself in the course of success. His fame in the genre of short stories was greatly hindered by the social attitude on the genre. Short stories were considered lower, compared to the traditional style of novel and poetry. He championed the short stories and became a master of the style. In another case, Poe's apparent experimentation with new poetic technique is shown in some of his poetic works. One of the technique he stumbled upon was the use of refrains. In later life, he wrote one of his most famous work with the excellent use of refrains: The Raven.
 Another poet who provided the broad course of American poetry is Walt Whitman, also known as "Good Gray Poet" or "Bard of Democracy." He contributed the influence of distinctively american voice to the later generation's work. His current fame, which was an initial notoriety, came from his advocation of free verses. Style of free verses was largely unknown at the time, and his poems were criticized as "lacking poetic value." However, his constant working with unfamiliar territory of literature eventually brought him success.
 As expressed in Robert Frost's poem "The Road Not Taken," these two literary figures' success was marked from "taking the road that is less taken." \\
