In my opinions, to have board knowledge of many academic subjedts is better than to specialize in one specific subject.
 
 First of all, recently sociaty wants persons who have variety ability.
 for example, when many company elect people, consider leadership, another contry languge ability.
 
 there are one example that my friend major is sound engineering. he have struggled it. He spend all time listen to music works hard.
