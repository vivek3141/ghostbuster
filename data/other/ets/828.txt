i totally agree with this sentence : young people nowadays do mot give enough time to helping teir communities. But why young people don t give enough time to helping their communities?In first, we are going to see that young people nowadays are busier and have a lot a thing to do.At last we will analyze the fact that young people are more concentred on themselves.
 
 First of all,  nowadays, young people have very busy. Indeed they have a lot of thing to do like doing sport, shopping, going to cinema, doing some trips, calling friends, organizing some parties..
 Their life is different today because the generation changed. The society changed too and the mentalites too. That s why the free time that young people is more interested tahn before because they can do a lot of thing, more than before. they are busy to do other thing than to helping their communities.Then, maybe it s not their fault but just a modification of the society(more modern).Before, young people haven t a lot of thing to do that s why there were concentred on their communities.
 
 Moreover, it s not the only reason. Young people nowadays are more concentred on themselves that is to say they don t think to help the others, for example in helping teir communities.
 Because of their eductaion too, they cannot think about the communities.Parents don t learn the real value of communities that s why they don t know what it s talking about.
 Young people complain about a lot of thing but they don t know that nowadays their life are easier than before and funnier.
 According to me, young people should more thinking about the others and should learn how they can share with people and be more open.
 
 To conclued, i can say that this problem could be arranged if parents take care about it. Young people have to make up their minds to be more accesible. According to me, young people should in first be more open and this could changed a lot of things.
