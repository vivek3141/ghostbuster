I don't agree with that statement . 
 
 In my opinion , enjoying life doesn't relate to the age directly . 
 Of course , usually a young person can make an advantage of his youthful and healthy body . He can do more extreme sport activities  , like snowboarding , surfing or bumgee-jumping . 
 But more often young people are not that independent as they wish to be . Most young people need financial support from their parents, especially during the studying time at unversity . That means one has to explain the expediture exactly to the parents every time one needs money . That can be very exhausting and demotivating . 
 After university , financial worries decrease on the one hand , but on the other hand concerns on the job arise . As a rule , the first years on the job are the most stressful ones which are accompanied by immense pressure to establish oneself in the new company. 
 
 Thus , I think that the thirty-somehows can enjoy life better than the younger people. Those people usually have already gained acknowledgement in the job world and in society . Moreover , they are financially independent and don't have to fight for the career that intensly . As a result , that group of people can spend more time for their hobbys and their family . 
 Older people are also enjoying life , because they have more experience  . I think they know how to appreciate the real things and values in life and are more confindent .
