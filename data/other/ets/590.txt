Young people enjoy life more than older people do. Based on my personal experience I would have to agree with this statement.
 Eventhough I am not that old, I am old enough to agree with the statement mentioned in the former paragraph. For instance, when I was younger I use to worry less about everything. As people get older, they get more responsabilities. They get to know more people, in most cases they get their own family when they get merry, and with family usually comes a lot of resposabilities and worryness.
 The younger the person is, the more the person enjoys life. For example, let's talk about a baby. A baby does not have to worry almost about anything, he or she just have to worry about meals ang get change; other than that a baby is just eating and sleeping. A baby does not even have the maturity to know is something is wrong on his surroundings. Now, lets talk about a 6 to 10 years old person. People on this age, in most cases only have to worry about homework. Teenagers, will have to worry about homework and maybe look good for the opposite sex. A college student would have to worry not only about homework, but about getting good grades in order to graduate. As soon as a person graduates from college he or she will have to get a job. After that, must start thinking about getting stablished by getting merried, buying a car, buying a house, etc. All of the previous examples are most likely what a thypical person will experiment troughout their lives under "normal" circumstances.  All of these lead me to the conclusion that the younger a person is, the more the person will enjoy life, and I think this is basically because the younger a person is, the least a person worries.
