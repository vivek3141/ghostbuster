It is a fact that if the students do not understand a concept and do not understand the ideas, the things surrounded by them would not make any sense and there wouldl be a confusion.  At the same time, it is also important to learn facts whihch make the things real to the students and students can easily visualize the things and can develope their own  thoughts and ideas. I had an experence related to how important it is learn the fact than understanding ideas and concepts; therefore I disagree with the statement. When the student can see the fact, they can accept a reality they face, develope their ideas and think deely and as the result, they will be more independent.
 
 Before I had a situation to do a lab experminent in my chemistry class, my teacher taught us what the purpose of the experminet and explained the steps but it was not realy helpful for me to visualize what I suppose to do. The lab was not appeal to me and I found it was boring becasue  I could not use my thoughs to think deeply. I thought It was really passive way of leaning.Then, in my physics class, the other showed me the lab in front of the class and told us the all the facts what is happening in a real life which is realted to this experminent. I could accept the rality of the lab really easily that time. I was able to think beyond the physics experminent. I also could use my imagination and so my thoughs got really deep. 
 
 Form my prsonal experience, I found it was much better to learn facts as  my attitude gets more active and more independent from what the teacher teaches me a concept. I can learn ideas and concepts from text books,so I think it is really important for the sudents to activate their minds and learn the facts.
