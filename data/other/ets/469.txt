I totally disagree with the statement that says "in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today". I have always liked, since I was a little child, all the types of car and now I have a car all for myself I can unerstand the importance to have it. In my life I have noticed that the number of cars in use always increases year by year, and I believe this trend will continue till the end of the world(!). 
 
 In today-world a great importance is given to the safety of the enviroment and , a lot of times, cars are indicated like the first reason for pollution. Someone could think that the number of cars will decrease due to this fact but he does not  consider that there is a great development in cars that do not produce pollution.
 
 Another reason is that, nowadays, the cars symbolize the status symbol of his or her owner. So all the people try to purchase new models of cars for feeling better with themselves. In Italy the business related to car-world is increasing even if the whole economic situation is not good at all.
 
 In addition, people, obviously, like technological and beautiful stuff and I think that cars can belong perfectly to this kind. You have only to see new models of cars for understanding that it is very hard to try to resist to the desire of buying a new car.
 
 It is also clear that people have to move for their dates, for job and often the public sistem of transporting , at least in Italy, does not make us feel sure to arrive in time or to arrive at all. For example today there is the strike of the tube and I have been obliged to take the car for being sure of attending toefl test.
