It is true that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There seems a lot of reseons, I think two reasons are the most resonable; short of time due to studying and selfish minds.
 First, these days young people are usually students or rookies. They have to study and work all day long and even during weekens, so they can not pay attention to their commmunities. Moreover their parents urge them only to make good grades in schoos and make a success in companies rather than mulling over the ploblems of societies or finding the ways to contribute to communities as members of the socities.
 Second, the young people are being raised in affuluent circumstance these days. They are usually the only child or have just one sibling in their homes, so they don't know the poverty or difficulties of others, and they don' t konw how to help others. Almost all parents raised their chidren as "price or princess".  Accodigly, they are accustomed to be treated like that, which makes them have selfish minds. 
 In short, as I mentioned above, lack of time to look around the societies and selfish minds make them not give enough time to helping their communities.
