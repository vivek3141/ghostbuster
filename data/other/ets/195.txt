Some people believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do. On the other hand, some people think that older people enjoy their life more. As far as I am concerned, I am a combination of those two opnions mentioned before. My opnion is that if you want enjoy your life you must spend your life both in a young way and in a older way.
 Firstly, young people are more active and willing to try new things which lead to a exciting life. For example, when there is a kind of new music, young people must be the first group of people listening to it. They can relax and entertain temselves through this new means while those older people keep amuse themselves by listening to traditional songs.   
 Secondly, older people enjoy their life in a more profound way. For instance, an old couple walk along the creek near their home in the splendid sunshine is so lovely and romantic that nobody can deny that their love of each other. Young couple cann't taste feelings like that. 
 Lastly, older people know the importance of reading. Reading is very important for people to acquire more information and knowledgement. Most of young people like traveling. Even travling can give you some information as well, it is not as important as reading because you cann't taste the complex and wonderful feeling of reading. When you read a book, your feeling will follow the author of the book goes a lot.
 I am a young people. That is why I cann't refuse the attractions of new things. I alway try different kinds of new musics and new games when I am at home. I realy feel exciting at that time. However, I know the importance of enjoy my life in a more profound way. That explain why I always visits the libary of my school and read a big range of books and articles.
