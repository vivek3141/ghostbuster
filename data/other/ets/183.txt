yes ,i totally agree  
 
 well,nowadays many people do not give enough time for helping their communities especially the young people,because for example they are always busy going out with there mates ,and going to clubs and malls ,playing soccer,and many other sports,thats why they don't have enough time i guess,thats what a young people at age of 10 to 18 years old people think about most of the time,well it actually depends on which country your'e talking about,because each country differs from the other,for example in this country,young people and old people help their communities most of the time,like they clean the streets sometimes,that's what me and my mates did last week to make our area clean and  good looking.In general,most of the young people don't help their community in everywhere most f the time,well my advice for all the young people is to help their community no matter what situation he's on,even if you helped your community for only one day, that would be really good,and about getting an execuse that you are busy ,well i guess you can manage your time ,like make a schedule ,to know when to play and go out with your mates and when to help your community.It's not a hard job to do ,it will take only one hour or two hours maximum a day, that would be really good.
