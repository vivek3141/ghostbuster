With great sadness i will have to say that the statement that young people these days do not give enough time to helping their communities is absolutely accurate and true.
 The present generation has become selfish and very goal- oriented which leads them to ignore things that really matter such as helping one's community.The chidren nowadays just want things for themselves and forget about the interest of the public in general.Peer pressure and pressure from the society to achieve goals have lead the present generation to forget about helping the society as a whole.
 These days the concepts of family values,traditions and culture have lost their meaning and the young people often end up neglecting these important concepts.Things such as community service,helping out the old and infirm and respecting one's parents have gradually declined and the younger generation has become essentially selfish in nature.
 Young people nowadays value other things more such as spending time with friends,going for movies etc etc all of which have assumed great importance.The selfishness of the present generation is seen in the way they achieve their goals.Most of them are ruthless in their manner and will stop at nothing to get what they want.
 Very few youngsters actually understand the true meaning of helping the community.The community plays an important role in shaping a person-his desires,actions,thoughts,opinions etc.All these are very much influenced by the community to which he belongs.Interaction with members of our community is absolutely essential for us to grow,form opinions and most importantly, to become a better person.
 What is required is a change in the thinking of these youngsters.They have to realise that there is nothing more important than helping one's own community,family and society.Ignoring their responsibility to their community will do more harm to them than good.It is time they realised their social and moral duties and move towards becoming  good and responsible citizens.
