While it is widely assumed that younger people enjoy life more than older people, I do not completly agree with this generic statement. My stand is based on following premises.
 
 It is true that young people have more energy and enthusiasm to enjoy life. The most common means of enjoyment for most young people are partying, movies, adventure sports, etc. However, older people have experienced different aspects of life, and clearly understand what gives them maximum satisfaction and enjoyment. With limited energy they usually tend to engage in those activities that excite them the most. The definition of enjoyment changes with experience. While youngsters may feel that older people can not go out for for sports or parties and therefore are not enjoying, it is possible that older people enjoy the company of their family members than going out for parties. 
 
 Also, many a times, what youngsters define as enjoyment is usually what all people do for fun, and not what they themselves would like to do. Therefore, in effect, they do what society classifies as fun, and not what makes them happy as an individual. Whereas, there are not many set avenues of enjoyment for old people, and hence they do what they themselves enjoy doing the most.
 
 While people are young, there is lot of uncertainity in their mind about their future. Some youngsters may have the resources to enjoy but they are constantly busy in working toward their ambitious goals. On the other hand, older people have their future clear in front of them. There are not many uncertainities in life, and hence they can spend their free time in enjoying life to the fullest. 
 
 Overall, I feel that people who have the maturity to understand what gives them maximum enjoyment, have the required resources for enjoyment and most importantly know how to enjoy, are the ones who enjoy life the most.
