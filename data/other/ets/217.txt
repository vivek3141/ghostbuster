Nowadays, it is known that a lots of cars are being used and that companies are selling a lots of them because people can buy them. Moreover I think that people want to buy them thereforet it wouldn't be a normal fact that the number of cars decreased in the future. Nevertheless could you imagine that it happens? It would be a terrible new for me because I lovew cars! 
 
 First of all I think that cars are very important for us and that everyone would have to have a car because it allows you to drive wherever you want whenever you want. In addition, I think that the number of cars will increase insted of decreasing because some countries had already allowd 16 year-old boys to drive. That means that more cars are going to be bought. 
 
 Another reason why I think that there won't be more cars in the future is because the market and companies are improving their models. That's why people are more interested in cars. Additionaly the market produces what the people want to buy. 
 
 Finally I must say that I have already pass my car exam and I also have bought a new car. I love my car and I think that it allows me to do a lot of things that a couldn't do such as going out at nights with my friends without paying a taxi or going to the beach with my girldfriend. 
 
 In conclusion I don't agree with the sentence because when I wanted to buy my car a recieved a lot of information about the topic and I really think that it is imposible that the number of cars decrease in the future because everything is improving the car-market.
