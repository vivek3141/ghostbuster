what i think about this case is goin for the first choise which is ,its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, because when a person have that knowledge about the academic subjects other than in one specific subject, sure a person would have a job which has a one specific subject for exampel, a doctor,his feild or his main subject that a doctor should be know about it is medican and body since in general , but that dose not mean he only have to know what about his job only, well whats wrong about haveing knowledge about other things for example, a knowledge of art, how great is to find a doctor wich his clinic is full of his art work or some he bought in his own taste of art, a normal person if he walks in a place like that he would say that this doctor is not like any other doctor.
 having a broad knowledge is some thing really great from some to get usd from it, it can be very help ful in some positions, for example some people are siting and talking about some field of studing, and they all have a knowledge about many academic subjects exepet one person whose now interested to have aother knowledge of what he have, what if these people opend a subject far from this person field or specific subject, what his position would be like, and what if some of these people askd him about some thing in the other field of his, after that, that person would think that he was wrong about stiking in one specific subject knowing all about it, from that stuiations people change their minds about what they have made.
 so for not being in that kind of positions i agree and 100% support having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects.
