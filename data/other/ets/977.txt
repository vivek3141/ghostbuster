I agree with the point that is successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do as well.
 Firstly, the people who likes to explore can learn more about something news than do the old things or repite same things people. Though the explore things, you can find the thing which you never have been seen or do it, and you will love to the world. Because you find something which you don't knew. It called knowledges. Yeah, the world is wonderful, if you do not believe that, the only things you lost is your heart. It means you haven't bold.
 Secondly, there was impossible that the people who knows  everything. People is not God, and God will not help the man who would not do anything. You maybe knows one thing or few things more than others, others may know others things than you in truthly.
 people learned things from books, TVs, newspapers, computers,etc. So the knowledges are limits things. You can though you explore eyes, your hot heart, your heathly bodies, to try, to find, to do the things which is fine, is worth to do.
 Last but not least, people do the things and get successful is not easy things. You must try you best to do this. You don't sit a nice place and wish i could be successful. Everyone Wish himself or herself is a successful man or woman. If you are just think about it, and not pay your action, your time, your power, it could become unsuccessful. The man is impossible got know everything, If there is a man who knows everything, it must be from his expriense. Where can we get from? Yap, try your best to try new things, form it, you will be grow up. Let us try.
