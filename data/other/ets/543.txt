the knowledge in itself has the importance. whether it is broad or it is specific, it is another thing. having knowledge in any form is quite importent or the development of the individuals.
 Actually the broad knowledge has its own advantage over the spacific one. taking an example from the madical field. suppose u have problem in your eyes. Now in this case what you do. you go to  a health centre.there the doctor( general one who has broad  knowledge in his field) will check you . if the problem is serious the he will refer you to the eye specilist. or if the problem is not so serious and in his  control then he go for the treatment. thus in the last you have not go to speciatist. so you save your time as well as your money( since the fee of specialist is quite expensive).
 but for the first case you have to go for the specialist who can treat your eye problem. may be he refer the glass lenses for you.thus in this way only he is able to cure your problem since he is the spacialist in his subject or field. thus the specialist have their own advantage which can not be ignored.
 the other most important thing is that for majoring in any subject first you should have the knowledge( may be litte , since this little is quite helpful)  in all the related subject since we know that all subject has some type of interconnection. for example majoring in the oranic chemistry also required the undrestanding of the physical parameter since they will contribute and effect the reaction. so either you have the knowledge of physical chemistry or you have to take the help of some physical chemist. 
 so conclusively according to me,  it is good important to have a broad knowledge even though you are majoing in a specific one. since it will help you in some way.
