Times are changed. People do not understand that young people are not like their fathers. Is true that those young men do not help their comunities in the way that in twenty century we refer to, but is true olso that they have differents and importants jobs. The first think that, for my opinion, a young person must do is study for his future, and, in a cert way, this must be seen like a help for the comunity, becouse a grait education can improve our future, can improve our workers, our economy and our lifes, so this is important not only for young person but collective future too.
 And I see like my family beelive in this opinion, in fact they support me in all of my decisions, they, in ather words,  built my future. And I see always in them a lot of proude for me.
 I know that is important make samethink for ather people, but there are a lot of young peolple that make a civil servise, they help comunity, for example, a lot of them work in Hospital without pay. Probably they are not a sufficient number, but is wonderful that in a time like our there is in them also a sentiment of generocity e charity, and I do not care if sameone think that this new generations is without values, becouse for my opinion a generetion that make in first place their future own and their uman feeling is a grait generation. Of course there are olso same of them that do not want anythink for athers or for themself, and that do not have respect for parent-s sicrifice. But I think that they are a little grup of a wonderful generetion, which I in it and I can tell this with proude.
