Have you never observed general behaviour of a group of people, let us say a school class? If you have, you probably distinguished some particularly shy students, some other more quiet or polite. Among these behaviours, you surely have been able to notest the most brave one, the one who did something that nodoby else did. This is the leader. The leader is, for instance,  the student who have the courage to tell the professor about something inconvinient. If we bring this situation out of the school, we can say that the leader, the successful person, is the brave one. Thi means that those persons who have never the courage to try something hard, different and new, have few possibilities to succeed. 
 
 One reason for wich I believe that brave people are likely to be successful is that they normally love challenges, and challenges are opportunities to learn.  A genuine curiosity also characterizes brave people often. Curiosity means aquiring a wide knowledge, which a good starting point of a successful life.  On the other hand, those who never pluck up the courage to measure themselves against challenging situations have few possibilities to enlarge their skills. Moreover, such a behaviour reveals scarce curiosity and features people who are not willing to learn and improve themselves.  
 
 The second reason is that successful people definitely need to be self confident, and brave people necessarly are. In fact, a successful life is often the result of many successful battles. In order to win all these, people must be confident in their abilities. I consider brave people to have this approach when they chase new challenges.
 
 In conlcusion, I definitely believe that a brave approach to challenges is required from those who want to be successful in their lives. Brave people are not frighten of the events that may occur, and this approach in my opinion is the right one in order to lead the situations.
