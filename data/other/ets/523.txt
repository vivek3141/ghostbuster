I agree with the statement that says" In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today"
 I think that the statemnt is right because of many reasons, one of this reasons is the technology in our life this days, if we talk about the present time we will see that the cars are essenial in our life, before a very long time, cars was not necessary for transportation they can use trains or bicycle and mostly they used to walk , and in near past, everyone used to have one car, a whole family consist of large number of  brothers and sisters, sons and daugther used to have just one car , but in these days every person could have two or more cars, in this we see how technology became a part of our live.
 In future i think  there wont be cars at all or at least not in this huge amount that we have it in this days, i think that the scentists will discover other ways for transportation, they would change the car using petroul by other with different shape using light or using other thing, or even future people could have a bag in their back, and whenever they want to go to some where they just press a little button and they fly  or even wearing a shoes which makes you to jump a large distance or thousand of ideas that will make us not  using the cars and the trains , which makes our atmosphere clearer and better way to live.
 Alhough i think that this step will happen in future, but i dont think it will happen in near future, because this kind of step needs a plan with the risks that could be taken in such cases, with opprotunity for everyone to have this venture,
