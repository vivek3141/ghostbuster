"Knowledge is power", we would definitely agree that the more knowledge people have, the greater achievements they will accomplish. However, as one's life time is limited, he/she is always faced with the choice of studing broad knowledge of many academic subjedts  and specializing in one specific subject. As a graduate student, having a broad knowledge of various subjects is a wise choice for me.
 First of all, the world is ever changing and as an undergraduate student, I cannot definitely decide what occupation I will take after my graduation. I can not specialize in on specific subject too early because doing so will certainly constrain my career development. Suppose I have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, I would definitely have a greater chance to choose my potential occupation; on the contrast,if my knowledge is too specialized, my choice will be limited.
 Secondly, the society calls for person with comprehensive knowledge. For example, a business firm come to my school recruiting employees. The students the favor is those business school students with engineering backgrounds. They think those people can have a more prosperous career future. This is not a rare case, for the compitition in society is getting more and more fierce, so a person with comprehensive knowledge has more chance to succeed. And having broad knowledge of many academic subjects surly does good to this.
 Besices, studing broad knowledge of various subjectsj helps to foster one's interest. By reading books of different fields, you can experience different ways of thinking and find your interest; while concentrate on one specific subject provides you with less chances to experience different topics.
 Though a person should be specialized in one specific subject for survival because only having broad knowledge does not help you stand out among others, studying broad knowledge of various academic subjects is a wise choice for an undergraduate student.
