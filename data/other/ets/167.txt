I agree with the statement that most advertisemens make poeple to think those products are much better than what they are. 
 In these days, we can see the advertisements on the TV about the games. Most of elementary, junior high school, and high school students have a game machine in their house. Advertisement gives an idea that those games really nice and fun, but in reality, they play with that game no longer than three months. Moreover, people spend too much time on the game than school work, which causes the problems that students do not do their homework at home. 
 Furthermore, when we see the advertisement of drinks and sweets, we go buy it, because they are advertising as it will take away our thirstyness and hungry. In reality, it is not healthy and it will cause more damages in our body. which can be very harsh for patients who stays in their home with out doctors and nurses. 
 In my case, I saw a advertisement on the shopping mall about the jean that is really comfortable and cheap. I had no doubt about it because it was very famous company, so I believed what they were saying. Whein I bought and brought my house, it wasn't that pretty that i expected and it wasn't comfortable than what I thought. I thought that i just should keep for the future, but then I changed my mind to return it. when I brought that jean to the mall, they said, its not refundable. I told them that there is no sign about return policy, but it was on the pomplet that i saw before i buy the jean. They put a statement that all sales products are not refundable with small font. I couldn't believe that they didn't put that policy in the front of the pomplet with little bigger font. 
 Most advertisements can't be trusted because they are advertising their products to make more money and profits.
