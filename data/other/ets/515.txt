For my living country, I agree in twenty years there will bd fewer cars in use than there are today.I have two points supports that, the more convenient public transportation and the oil more expensive.
 Firstly, in my living country, Taiwan, there is a smaller place than most of counties.It spends 5 or 6 hours from north to sounth.If you want to around the iland, it just take 2 or 3 days.Because of that, Taiwan have good public transport system.If you want to go this place to another place far away downtown, you just have to check which bus you can take you to the place you want, enev you have not one chooses.You can choose the way you want, like taking bus or by train.If you want to go to this place to another place in downtown, you still not need to walk, you can take MRT.It can take you to everywhere you want.For example, I live in Hsingshin.I must go to Taipen for TOEFL test.All I need to do is taking train and MRT, I can arrive the place.
 Secondly, the oil is more and more expensive.If we have car, we must pay mush money for using oil.The priece of oil will become more expensive in the furture.It will cost lots of money for oil.If we do not have car, we do not worry about those kind of problems.That will help us save much money.For example, many people want to buy the car which can use oil effectivily.If we take public transport system, we can share the rise up priece of oil.That may not cost a lot.
 By those two reansons, I agree in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.
