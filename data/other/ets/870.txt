I disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. this is two reanson.
 First of the reasons is we should learn facts because we have to know what happen in the each country and get a information from learn facts. for instance, when i learned some facts by someting. i got to understand what happen nowaday and if i don't know eveything about facts. i can not explain to people waht happened yesterday or today. 
 Second of the reasons is we do not have to understand ideas and concepts. because we could understand ideas and concepts any time. but facts have to learn than understand ideas and concepts. if we miss to learn facts, we could not learn anymore that happen. so we can get more skill and knowledge if we lerned facts. for examle, when i tried to understand ideas and concepts, it was much harder to understand, but when i tried to learn facts, it was easy to understand and i was interest them.
 Therefore, i disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn fact.
