I agree whit the answer.
 My opinion is that cars is very important for the people, for the live of people, because the moder people use the car for live. Thay use the car for going to work, school, holyday, for spend a good time in the near city....
 Twenty years old ther was less people and the people used other transport for moving, and the prize for buy a car is very big for the normal people. Only few people can buy the car. Today the prize is less and many people can buy. 
 Today the industrian produce a lot type of car for any type people and any type use, thus any people can buy the very good car for yous life / job.
 Now I would also like a draw your attention for the use that the moder people doing of yours car. 
 The problem is not  how lot car there is, but how may using car!
 The moder people wrong using a car. The government give a possibility to use an other instrumen for travele, there is an airplain for the long long travel, there is a train for a long travel or bus for short travel, but the moder people prefore using a car, why? Because the car is more confortable.. but is mor expensive for the people, petrol is carefull, and for the comunity, the heart is ill. When ther people know this the people change the type of yours live, I think that thay continus to buy a car, is important, I think that there is one car for any family.. for the emergence, but if the people using less the car  the cost for the comunity will be lesat. 
 Few people know this but thay, for now, do not change your comportamnt.... I hope thay do this.. in a future.
