SUCCESS
 In today's situation, people are trying to be more successful than any other area since the competition between people has been increasing. There are some different ways to be successful in business, and some other ways for social life. May be some other factors can be explained for some other areas. However, in general, they all have something in common. To be successful in life, people should try new things and take risks. In other words, people should break their limits that surround them. Two main reasons can be explained why people should try new things and take risks to be successful.
 Firstly, people can turn their money into a fortune only by taking some risks, in general. For instance, if there is a businessman who sells and buys cars can do it forever, but he is called only a businessman. If another man in the same business (buying and selling cars) comes and makes an investment on selling trucks by taking some risks, he would not only make his profit doubled but also increse his status in the community unless he loses all his money after that investment. The second man should be considered as a successful one since he tries to make his job larger by investing another service to the community.
 Secondly, some opportunities can be reached only by people who take risks. For example, if a student is involved in a study or project group about his topic. He can give best as he knows which make the project work. On the other hand, if he tries to learn new things, he may be able to widen his prospect about his project. By this way, he has something that he can carry for his future. By this way, he can also be able to another projects that he cannot now.
 As a result, there can be two main reasons to be a successful person. These are basicly about trying new things and taking some risks to be successful in general.
