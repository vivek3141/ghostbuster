Knowing everything is what makes people intellectually perfect! Every human being looks forward to this. But the fact that know body ever fully got to that point, can bring doubts on the possibility of this issue. For some people knowing everything is what they live for. For others limitation to one academic subject is preferable.
 
 On one hand, some people, might get stubborn, and look forword to pass their life trying to answer their never ending questions.They get to a certain point, where they will find themselves unsatisfied with what they already know, because they will find themselves knowing a bit of everything. Consequently, they will continue their never ending researches, and live a stressfull life worrying about getting able to reach the point of perfection.
 
 On the other hand, other people, find themselves absolutely satisfied and proud with the academic subject that they mastered perfectely. Rather, then wasting time trying to learn about many academics, they can become a reference for one specific academic subject that they mastered entirely. This part of the population, will be able to invest its life to its full, because they will not have to live anxiety, they will instead build their social life and be in the main time successful in their professional life. They will, furthermore by having this sense of proudness, be more confident in themselves then a person that works extremely hard but is just never satisfied with what he/ she has accomplished.
 
 In conclusion, knowing everything, can not be reachable, at least not for the moment. Life is too short we better live it to its full, and be proud of ourselves by mastering one specific subject completely and get time in the main time to build memories to remember in the futur.
