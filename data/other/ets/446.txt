Advertisements are made by advertisers that work for producters, it is made to be able to sell or offer a product. 
 Do most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are?
 
 I agree that advertisements make their products seem better than they are in real because it is business communiaction. The better way the advertisement is made the more chances the producter will have custumers. For example, advertisements about cars always discuss about how secure is the car or how cheap it is compare to his concurrents, they explain and show only the positive sides of the products and some time they may exagerate it.
 TV works thanks to advertisements because of the money, it is also a lot of pressure for the the advertiser to make sure the advertisements will have a real impact on the audiance.
 But the product and his advantages may not be the most important part of it, it is also important the way you make an advertisement, for example, the music, the subject, the people that plays in there ... For example, if you want to sell a familial car, you  will use specific characters such as a family, showing how big is the car to take care kids, luggages ...
 
 To conclude, the advertisements is not always based on the products but also how it will affect people that are watching it. To test the product buy it, it might not work as well as  it was it described on Tv but it can also be better and more satisfiable than it was described. People want to buy the product if it most of the time emotionnaly affected them.
