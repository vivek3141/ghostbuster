By this days many TV programs, Shows advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are, and I agree whith this statement.
 
 on my point of view, many factories give a wrong idea about some products, and many people believe that they can said about. this advertisement shows miracle whith those products and the people spend  their  money buying thing inapropiades.
 also goverment dont make nothing for change this situation and permit that continue stolen the people. 
 however exist many websides where you can give your opinon about this situation.
 but the most important is that you think firts were you going to buy something and be sure of the product. 
 as a conclution is important that you dont believe  in enything you can see on advertisements firts meet the object and then buy. or obteing references of other person who  have the xperience in the tipic. and dont think all thath you can see or hear in the mass media. have your own idea and be sure of everything of you want for have or do.
