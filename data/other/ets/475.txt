When we go outside we see lots of cars around and we easily observe that the number is still increasing in a very rapid rate.We usually think that this increase will not stop or slow down but I think there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years. 
 To start with; one thing is very clear: technology is improving continuously. If we had lived 50 years ago, we would not have imagined the level of improvement in the life styles of people nowadays. I do not think that my grandmother would have thought that I can communicate with my friends in United States by simply sitting in front of a screen and writing. Everything is replaced by a better thing day by day, even second by second. I have to admit that cars are the major way of transportation; but for now. In twenty years, by developments in several areas; they will be replaced by other means of transportation like travel by light or by small plane-like vehicles.
 Some may think that these ideas are extreme and will not happen in twenty years. This can also be possible,in twenty years cars may still be the major transport vehicle but again there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Even if the technology will not change our lives that much, we can change it by ourselves. If public transportation become easier and more available, I think most of the people will use public transport instead of their own cars which will reduce the number of cars significantly. This is also about something with the improvement of people. When people stop thinking individually and think more general, they will certainly use public transport more and thereby they will reduce the cars in the roads.
 As a consequence; in twenty years fewer cars will exist in the roads . Of course, we cannot predict the future or say certain things about certain topics but I think I have reasons to believe it. The most important of all, I want to believe it.
