Life is a god's gift for any human being on earth.Its in our hands how well we shape it.Although enjoyment of life varies from various walks of our life i would  agree that young people enjoy life more than compare to older people do.I agree with this opinion because of couple of reasons.As i am a youngster i have full of energy ,energy to play ,energy to travel,energy to work hard.For instance as i am a youngster i can play  different kinds of games (base ball,hockey,football) with my friends tirelessly and enjoy the game by running ,jumping kicking etc which old people cannot perform and they don't enjoy games as we do rather they can only be only spectatures.I can travel to different places which have varied environmental conditions and i can enjoy every minute of the vacations,that  involves a lot of physical fitness and substantial stamina which a probable think older people don't have.I can perform various activities like riding bike with one hand or feet on the seat  with out any pain and enjoy every moment of those .I can go 
 As a youngster i have  the chance  to wear different kinds clothing,eat variety food items,go to parties and more over i can do a lot of regular exercises to keep my body fit and fine such as bicycling,swiming,regular work out in the gyms.All these activities cannot be performed by older people as we  do; as it involves a lot of man and will power.Also we  can participate in every extra cirruculum activities such as singing,dancing,playing guitar, and enjoy the happinies by performing them,but its not possible by older people.As a youngster we have opportunity to meet with different people from different walk of lifes and develop new skills from that experience.
 As we conclude young people has more energy to do things.
