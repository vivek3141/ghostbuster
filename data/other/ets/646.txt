I agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. But it is not so easy to apply this thought to the life that we are in. Because doing something that you know without taking risks has advantages. You may not feel stressed and may feel relaxed when doing the things that you are always doing. As it is easy to estimate the results of your action. On the other hand, it won't help you to discover new things, try different ways or widen your vision. You will stay closed to your surrounding but can not find the ability to try different things, as you are not willing to take risks. So you become an ordinary person doing a regular job as usual. That seems so boring to me that I don't like to be that kind of person.
 Staying away from ordinary life, trying different things, being open to new discussions, taking risks will definetely change our life. Hard things require difficult steps to take and sharp hills to climb. You must tolerate these steps by taking risks, if you want to be a successful person, different from the others. 
 Risk means loosing or winning. Imagining the positive sides of the risk, that can make revolutions and bring success in our life is the key point for motivation. We can see its best examples in business. For instance; Bill Gates had taken a big risk by leaving school and tried something new that was not popular at that time. But now he is considered as the leader. That doesn't mean that he didn't face any diffuculties since then. But he endured the diffuculties and did everything step by step to the way to great success. 
 In a nutshell, I agree with the topic that nothing can be achieved by sitting or doing the usual things. You must try different, new things and take risks, if your aim is to reach up the peak of success.
