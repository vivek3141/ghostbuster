In our world theri are many chances to let the young poeplepartcepeat in our community but there are many caces that let this young people go for another things for partcepet without any effort .In my opion that theri are many young people don't give any thing in theri coummunity . For sveravl reasn .
 
 First, some of these young people have too much work in there study enen that dont have time for there selve . they spend all the day between threi book in theri office , in the liblary or inthe internet do some research  . this is one type of the young people.
 
 another type the preson that set in the house dosn't do anything just eating and sleed that don't have any job .This kind of person should be treated  by someone becouse he had a prpblem that do't have any goal in his life .So he can't help or any one in this life.
 
 Moreover ,thereare some young people really want to work in do some thing for threi coumminty and if you going to give them something they really want to do it but they don't have skills that led them for this .Enen if theri try they will do but they can't complet the work that they try to  do it . So these kind of people we must hold theri hand and try as much as posspile to let them be benefit for our community .These that can be leading our and rise threi community up .
 
 In the end , there are many kind oo young people in our world  .Inorder to we should see the best and the better that can give us somthing that will benefit for all human in the earth.
