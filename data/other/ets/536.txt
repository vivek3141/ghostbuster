 Often i think is better to go now to work,  why sometimes i`m boring to study, and i thinks that these i study is not so important for my work. But my father  always tell me that is very important have the concept`s base of your work [for instance the history of the monuments, sociologie, the tehories of the construction]. It`s true. Sometimes i go with my father [he is an engeeniers] to see the built in construction. So i can understand that all the thinks that i study to the university, i really find in the reality.

The study is the last thinks that you have in the brain. Altough you are
