I disagree about the opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people. 
 I think It is true that young people, like students,  have much time for going out with their friends. But after their graduate school,their  life style are going to be changed so suddenly especialy in Tokyo.
 First of all, They lose their private time. They have to work hard that  they have to improve their ablility in job to earn more money, for the payment for the  apartment  fee,  haviing dating, saving future marriage,  or having holidays. 
 Old people have more money and time than the people in young generation. That the main reason why I disageed to the this opinion. First of all, they have a better experience than the younger people. Fine foods, shopping  good quality funiture, clothes, go abload by cruesing etc.
 From my experience, it could be said, I'm having more better life in my 30's than I experienced in my 20's.
 I could enjoy eating out at good restaurant, going precious classic concert, buying good quality clothing. 
 Only one thing I can said about negative point about old people is, they don't have enough energy physically sometime. For example, my hobby is used to be skiing, but I feel like start losing enogh physical toughness recently,  to keep high speed in the big snow slope, keep moving from mountain to montain. I know it is natural changing for everyone, and not only me to face it, but actually it is kind of sad for me.
 But I'm sure about that people could enjoy better life after getting old thant the yonger generation. They know what they want. And more, they could have enough financial confident and much more free time for leisure to enjoy their life style.
