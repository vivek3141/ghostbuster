Nowadays the speed of development is becoming faster and faster, so many thinks that no more cars are used in the future that are substituted to other vehecles. I somewhat agree that the new device will be developed for transportation but doubt on fewer cars in twenty years.
 First of all, 20 years is not so far from now. 20 years are not enough to invent a new vehecles and replace cars. Air planes that are already developed long time ago but can not replace cars effectively. Even thought they are faster that cars, people do not own planes because they are expensive and huge to keep. In addition current suvery shows that the number of manufacted cars is increasing more than 15 percents each year due to developing country. It indicates that the number of car does not seem to be decreased in the near future.
 On top of that, new ways of cars are researched and developed in order to overcome the drawbacks of cars, in particular air pollution. Various methods of power are implemeted such as hydrogen, water, and electronic power that are not harm to environments. Actually environments argue that use of car is restricted.  Therefore if non-polluted car is developed, people would not restrict the increase in cars.
 Therefore I disagrees that cars are diminished in twenty years because the period is too short to change the role of car and replace to others. In addition  the new method of preserventing air pollution will be developed so people do not need to worry about the use of cars in the future.
