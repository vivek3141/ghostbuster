Group travelling with a tour leader and individual travelling have both their advantages and disadvantages but I favor to go on an individual travel than a guided group vactaion which would like to point out in the following text.  
 The group travels most likely have a worked out visit plan and a time schedule. The people in the group will not have their own choice what to visit and it might sometimes be very intersting and other times just boring. On of the main problems here is to be obliged to follow the pace of the group and not your own. I will not be able to skip a site which is of less excitement for me. On travels to foreign countries I like to stop at certain places for a longer time and enjoy talking to people about their daily life. This way  I might learn more about their life and culture than visiting one church or museum after another. Although I also adore going to historical meaningful places which forms culture and life of people just in my own speed. 
 During a group travel the individual will most likely visit many interesting sites of a certain country or city, which might not accesible for an individual and will obtain a lot of information about them. But as I already mentioned for me quantity is not always quality. 
 I would consider me as a lucky person since I have many friends all over the world. One day I hope to be able to visit them and explore their country with my own private tour guid
