This statement which is about traveling in group led a tour guide has alot of opinions.  Some people prefer to not have a tour guide but also other people like to be eeith a tour giude.  Both of them they have diffrent reasons and its complicated when you want to compare between them.  I think or agree that if i traveled with groupe led i prefer not have a tour guide for two reasons.  First you will be controling by the time and secound you will be in pressure if you have a tour guide.
 
 The tour guide will let you fowling the plans and and it will let youy controled your time and you have to do the plans.  Mabye one day you have a diffrent plans or you disscovered a new place and you havn't saw all the acctivity and you liked this place and you want to go again but, you can't becasuse of the tour guide and you have to meet all your group with him.  So that will cause you to ignore you disire ans go  with the tour guide.
 
 With the tour guide all member in the group will be in presseure because of the controling of the tour guide. With the tour giude you can't do something that you want to do it becuse of the tour guide and you eill fell like you are in pressure.  With the tour guide you will feel like you are in prussere in all the tripe even you are in an excited place and you like it and you want to spend more time in this place but, you have to be carefull on that because of time and you have to recpectthe time so you can't waest the other or the tour guide time.  Indeed the tour guide will let you feel in pressure all the tripe. 
 
 These two important reasons are the most mentions with alot of people when they decided to travel every where.  So i think that the best way its not have a tour guide when you want to travel so , I dissagree with the statement about the traving with a tour guide and its better to you to travel without a  tour giude.
