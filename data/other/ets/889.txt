Today each person can have own car without many problems.Having car is becoming more easy in many sides.So increasing of cars can be considered like a obvious result of modern  society.But if we think about the future furthemore there may be a completely another situation wating for us.There are some elements able to limit the car increasing in future.
 First  of all, the development of telecommunication will defenitely decrease needs to move.All texts,datas,graphics or even sound elements can be transported by internet so we won't need to move out to get our office to work.Payment is also getting informatised because we are using credit cards and telebanking system.All the concepts of our life are getting non-materializing and they exist just in internet's web.Decreasing of transports of materials will reduce the number of cars as a transport way.
 In these times there aren't many private airplanes but in future the airplanes or another system will replace cars.Technology is very fastly changing and progressing.Car will be one of material of last days we won't use anymore.Soon there will be a another system which can fill the lack that a car couldn't acomplete or who can solve problems that a car was provoking like pollutions or accidents.The main reason that I suppose of car decrease is there are a lot of problem made by cars.Most of people died because of car accidets than illness.Certainly there will be a onother way of transportauin that humanbeing will find out.
 Nowadays cars are defenitely increasing all over the world.But i think this is a temporary phenomenon in our time.The decrease of cars may not occur in twenty years but we can expect that will obviously happen in days coming
