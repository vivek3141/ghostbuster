I think it is true that the younger people enjoy more of their life than the older people do.  And I have three points to support with.  
 First, younger age is "free".  Except going to school and doing homeworks, young people have more time than the elders.  Considering "adults" spending time with anything regarding their jobs, such as meetings and getting ready for the presentations or even raising children, it is obvious that young people have more time than the older people do.  
 Second, young people have less to worry about.  New house, paying taxes, promotions, raising children.  These are none of the options that younger people would have in mind to consider.  The few things they might think of would be boy/girlfriends, schoolworks, college or getting jobs even.  Except few groups of peole who take them too seriously, those are not desperately important or I should say "deep" matters.  Comparing to those of adults, young people have less things to concern, which help them to enjoy their time even more.  
 Third, and for the last, young people is literally "young".  They have more chances to try out for many things.  For example, the adults usually don't get chances to try out for musical or sport team if their major or fields are different.  But in middle or high school, or even in college, young people get lots of chance to try a bit of everything, so to speak.  And I think the more you try, there's more possibilities that you'll like, and have a good time.  
 So for these three reasons, I think young people have more chances to, and do enjoy life more than older people do.
