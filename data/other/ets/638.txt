Twenty years is not a really long time for changing things in the history. I think that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today.
 Cars changed peoples life, i can not imagine how ours life will be without having cars, cars help a lot for the human. The reason why i think cars will not be fewers is that people needs it. We need cars to get to work, school, and other places. Well ,some people will think about other transportations. That is ture, for a short distance we can walk or ride a bike, and for long distance we have airplanes and trains. However i think car is much faster than walking or riding a bike, and also cars are really flexable, we can go anywhere any time without a airplane or train ticket. we will have so much trouble without cars, they made our life easier.Cars are really convince.
 The other reasons is as population grows. the number of the people need cars will also increase. For examples. In BeiJing every day there will be thousands of new cars going to the street. This also happening to any other big cities in China. In ShangHai, the numbers of cars increased to fast, and the goverment  raise the price for the liscenes plate. From these examples shows that cars will not stop growing in a short time such as twenty years. There will be a problem for the gas, because the earth is lack of oil now. I belive at that time there will be other kind of car for us to drive. The car will use battery, we do have some cars use battery now, in twenty years these kind of car will be absalutaly advanced. We also can use sun energy for the car. These are my point that cars will not be fewer in twenty years, Cars are our friends!
