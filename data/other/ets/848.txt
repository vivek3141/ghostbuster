As far as iam living in this planet, i can realize that industry and science are growing rapidly in two ways.One is for the benefit of the human being and one on the other hand is towards destroying him.
 Well, talking about the one that is harming us.The increase in number of cars nowadays is actually making our lives more so complicated and difficult .For example,in Dubai, it needs a person to reach his office in the rush hours around two hours!
 So the governments thought seriously about that issue and now is constructing a Sub way that can let you reach any place in the city within few minutes! At that time i think so many cars will be sold because they are of no use.
 And i think one of the most crowded cities in cars is London.And by the 2020`s people might get rid of their cars and go and buy bicycles.
 Science after 20 years from now will be rapidly and increasingly progressed. And scientists might develope some kinds of cars that can fly with their own tracks that they can build over eachother so as to make use of space!!
 Their might also be somekinds of motorcycles that are so sophisticated and secured that can alternate the use of cars.
 Well, by that time i hope that all countries will have developed ways so we can travel by the speed of light.So no gas, no pollution,more space and friendly planet .
