In my opinion, what expressed in the statement is not completelly true.  I think that the fact that for a student, ideas or concept are more important than to learn facts, depends on the different attitude the student has.
 In my opinion by the way, it's really more important to understand ideas and  concepts behind a fact. 
 The best example i can use to add value to my assumption, is my own experience during the university study. I've studied engeneering and for most of the exams i did, to understand  concepts was the most important aspect of the studying. Without that it would have been very difficult to pass the exam. Because you need that to approach to a brand new problem, that you have not seen before. 
 I can study the fact that a construction can collapse if some project aspect are not respected and i can learn this facts. But if I don't understand the concept or ideas behind structure's Phisics I could hardly been able to project it properly.
 On the other hand It is obvious that for someone else  results are more imoportant than the cause that has produced them, and therefor  for those student, facts should definitely be more important than the ideas behind them.
 I'm reffering for example to those students interested to history subject. Those students are mainly interested in facts that are the basis of their study field.
 But even for them I think schould be important to know and to understand what was behind a specific period or event. to better rember what happened due to a logical cause-effect process.
