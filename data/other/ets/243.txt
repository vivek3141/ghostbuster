Every day in every part of the world peolpe have to aks themselves if it is really necessary to take risks to be more successful or if it is enough to stay on a certain level. Every day people have to decide in which direction they want to move.
 My personal opinion was always to take some risks. However I seperate it into taking stupid risks and taking "intelligent" risks. 
 If you want to be more successful than you are, you have to change something and to try out something new. Our society is always on the move - nowadays things change very quickly. I am sure that we have to find new answers for new circumstances. 
 Last year I had to ask myself what kind of university I want to join. The possibilities were to go to a usual university in Austria or trying to get into a special one in Switzerland or Germany. I could have said that I take the easy way out which means going to an austrian college. However I wanted to join a better university which meant that i had to find a job for one year (for practice) and to do exams like the TOEFL to get in. To make it short - I took a risk. Probably the university isn't interested to work with me. 
 But even if they don't give me a chance I could learn a lot in this year. If I had not taken the risk I probably would ask myself for the rest of my life why I didn't even tried it. 
 In my opinion you can't have a satisfied life if you never take a risk to find out how much fun it is if you are successful or if you see a positive result of your tooken risk. 
 By the way I could have a happy life without skydiving. But I did it and it was one of my greatest experiences I ever had. 
 To summerize my opinion: I would like to encourage every one to risk a lot and to take a risk again - also if you had bad experiences with this attitude.
