Young People Enjoy Life More than Older People Do
 
 
 
 From my point of view, I belive the young and old people enjoy they life the same. There is time for everything and a moment.
 To understand peoples behaiviors, we need to see, where are they come from, what are they like to do, social and personal interest.
 For example; I born in Costa Rica , small country where young and old people enjoy soccer, and dancing, and are no different from others people or cultures around the world.  
 Younger people is more active and careless , they no have many responsabilities, so they use all they free or spare time, doing many things , such as : a)- sports , b)- travel , c)- dating, d)- working part time , e)- study. , hoping that something really works out for them and have some fun at the time. Many like my self, take some adventure and leave the country, try to find new horizonts and adventures.
 Older people the still have fun , and they enjoy they life in they way, becuse usully older peolpe have more responsabilities, such a family, childs, full time works or carries, they have less time to do what they really like, but that doesnt meant that they no enjoy they life.
 The meaning of enjoy life is in everyone , we all enjoy our life  in so many differents ways, and as long we belive that is correct , is ok.
 Be young or old is depent in each person, some people young are like old people, and some old people are like young people.
 Enjoy life is a present from God, and we need to be gracefull just for be alive and see as much as we can of this work.
 Enjoy life is no matter to be young or old , enjoy life is live life.
