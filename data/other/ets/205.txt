No i fully disagree, according to my  perception it is important for students to learn facts than understanding ideas and concepts. Facts make life easier for the students beacuse if they know the fact what is happening they can continue living happily in the world.
 Learning the idea and concept is more imagination ie the idea that come in our mind is not always true or fact that it is right. 
 
 For instance, there was a bomb blast in the train and many people made an idea that most of them have injured and fewer have lost their lives but the fact was vice-versa most of them had lost their life, so there was wrong information shown in the television.
 Fact also tells students to believe in the world they are living in. They should not depend upon  the television news all the time  they should see on their own and beleive.
 
 Students should learn fact than ideas because they live in the world which tells that what recently is going on ask them about it..
 Ideas they can apply their own but fact is a fact they can't change it anymore after it had happen. they should be fully known about the fact that happened in the world, not the ideas that what is going to happen.
 
 Students also shouldn't  have to depend upon the teacher or say 'yes' to their 'yes', if the teacher is saying a fact student shouldn't agree until he gets some idea of understanding, after understanding it only he should agree for the fact. 
 
 No doubt they should understand the ideas and concepts that how this fact have come, they should be given the reason that why this fact have been occured, they should understand the reason of this fact.
 Seeing all this i then too disagree with the statement because the advantages of fact carry much more weigh than understanding ideas.
