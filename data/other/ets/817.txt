Some people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Some say it does not. In my opinion, however, young people enjoy life rather than older people do because, they are impulsive, energetic, and creative.
 
 Firstly, it is generally accepted that young people are more impulsive than old people. Therefore, young people use to do things without certain plans. For example, in my personal experience, I had been on trip without any plans with my friends. One day, one of my friend suddenly suggested to go trip and we just agreed to go trip in that day, because we were young and impulsive.
 
 Secondly, it it normally accepted that young people are more energetic rather than old people. In fact, it is hard to enjoy life such as go trip or go picnic for old people because they are less energetic. However, young people are always energetic in general. Therefore, it can be described one reason that young people enjoy life more than older people do.
 
 Lastly, it seems clear that young people are more creative than old people. They always bring something new and creative and move into action. It is a one of way that they enjoy their life creatively. Moreover, in my personal experience, one day, I and my friend were thinking about making fake ID. Therefore, we moved into action and tried it. Unfortunately or Fortunately, we were charged by a police officer lightly, however, it exists as a still interesting memory for me.
 
 To sum up, I can generally state that young people enjoy life more than older people do. In my home country, there is a old traditional song about that enjoying life when we are young, when we become old then we cannot. All things considered, it is true about that young people enjoy life more than older people do.
