I agree with the following statement.
 The young people can have more situation for enjoy thieir life then the older person.
 First of all, to school the young people can meet their friends on day and can play and study with them, two things more funny than work.
 The older poeple probably they must work in a day and don't have the same situation for enjoy thierself.
 Second, the young person has more time to spend in a play then the older person.
 In my opinion an older person don't want play with his friends because doesn't have any time.
 Third,the young person is free to do all thing that he want.
 He is free to jump, is free to smile and is free to follow all of his behavior.
 The older person can't do it because in a particula work situation he must have a particolar behavior.
 For example in office, the worker can't speak free, can't sing.
 That all, by.
