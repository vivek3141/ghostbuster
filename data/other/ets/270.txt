I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts.
 
 Learning is a process of memorizing a given  context or material. Thus is memorizing is usually a short - term, learning facts will be short term as well. Understanding a given context , helps one to adopt to it a something natural to oneself and thus doesnt require memorizing. Understanding a concept or an idea is long term.
 
 In my school time , during the Mathematics class i was constantly told by my professors to understand a proof or to understand a theorem, say pythagoras theorem. He specifically told us not to memorize them. The emphasis he laid on understanding was because even today , 8 yrs after , i am asked about pythagoras theorem , i dont have to struggle to remember it . As i understood the theorm and didnt memorize it , it became natural to me and was embedded in my conscious and thus even today i can recall what pythagoras theorem relates to.
 
 Another generic example that i can state is that India is cuturally diverse. Thus people follow many different cutlures. Its often difficult for children to learn why they should follow certain pratices that their religion demands. For example an Hindu child would question his mother upon learning that his Cathlic friend visits the chruch every sunday morning while he doesnt. 
 
 The elders would then explain to him the reason or a concept behind the inception of a particular religious procedure which helps the child to understand his religion better and ceases the doubts that arise out of learning of a religious procedure. The understanding of culture differences not only would help the child appreciate this own culture but of  others as well.
 
 Thus understanding of ideas and concepts help in clearing out of doubts and foster better and effective learning.
