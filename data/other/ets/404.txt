In general, I agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learning facts.
 To my mind, the idea of school is that students learn for their lives. They should not only learn facts by heart, since it is more important that they understand the idea of what they learn. If they can reproduce a whole text with many facts, but do not really understand the meaning of this text, what did they learn? I would say, nothing. Because then the student does not profit from it. Maybe he does, in an exam for example, because he can answer the questions correctly, when they are superficial. But for his further life and understanding of the world he could not learn anything.
 I think, it prepares them for their future lives, when students are taught in a specific way that they understand different ideas and concepts. This should be the object of a school or a similar institution.
 Still, it seems clear to me that the two aspects have to be balanced. Facts can also play an important role for understanding ideas and concepts. Sometimes it might be just unevitable for understanding a special idea to learn facts about it. The thing is that this should not be the only aspect. While learing them, one has to go beyond the facts. That leads to the better understanding.
 In conclusion, I think one has to do both, learning facts and understanding ideas and concepts, but learnig facts should always have the final goal, understanding something better by doing this.
 From my point of view as a student, I can also say that it is not enough to learn facts without getting the real meaning of it. I think this is good like that. Those guys who only try learing by heart fail in school.
