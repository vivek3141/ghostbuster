I disagree with the follwing statement.
 In fact, i hope to become a person that i'll be specialized in one specific subject. Now, i'm studying mechanic engineering at the university and when i'll be finished, i'm  going to work in an industrial factory. So this is one reason on about i don't agree with that opinion. In fact i have to learn always and always knowledgement about mechanic problems because this is a condition that it'll let me to enter facily in the world of job. So i still have to study more to reach that goal. In spite of this consideration, to have broad knowledge of many subjects is a condition that can also give important results for the future. To know other arguments such as  economy, literature or foreign languages is another opportunity and, with this culture you can have interesting results to improve your career. But i think that it's better to know only a sector of own job. Maybe, one explanation can be given. Until i was a young boy and i was ten years old, i just had a clean idea about what i'be have wanted to do when i'd have became an adult. So i always wanted to be an engineer. My father is an engineer and also my grandfather was an engineer and maybe this can be one factor of my choiche and of my opinion about this statement. So, i went to the Tecnichal School and i receveided a diplome as mechanich. Now i am a student of Politecnico University and hope to have the degree as soon possible.
