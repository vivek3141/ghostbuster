yes i do believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in ur as there are today.the advancement in science and technology will provoke creative minds to introduce new and enhaced ideas of communication.i would like to support my belief by taking examples of other means of communication,and an extra regard for the environment.
 taking into consideration my first example,i belive that the world is always developing and advancing and looking fer newer and better techniques to move towards the future.human beings as social individualsa liek chnages.therefore, there will be certain innovative minds that will bring up advanced and more practical means of communication in later stages of the generation .peoples concept of communication will change as whole .they would want to experiwence and create new modes of transport that will make their life easier and much more comfortable .in the monotonous and hectic schedule of everyday life ,people would prefer better means of trasportation to relive them of their stress of travelling.
 taking my second example ,i also feel that the ucrrents effects of global warming that are threatening the life on earth will be more dominant in later stages due to the reckless destruction and exploitation of our environment.environmentalists will recieve their wake up call at that stage thus provoking them to come up with more environment safe methods of transportion as tranport being one of the major cause of pollution .this will promote the introduction of large modes of transport that will carry mass populations, hence saving money and fuel.therefore reduction of cars will help in preservation of our natural sources and will help protect our environment which turn will benefit us.the alarming increase in CFC'S and carbon dioxide will provoke scientits to come up with solutions that will save us from various dangerrs.
 to conclude, i strongly claim that the reduction in the number of cars is bound to happen .i have proved and clarified my view through my above given examples of better means of transport and protection of environement.therefore i feel that the number of cars will be replaced my the number of other modes of transport that is costeffective and benefial to the environemtn as well as to human life.
