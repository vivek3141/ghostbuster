I do agree with the fact that: in twenty years time, there is
 diffenitley going to be much fewer cars in use than there are today. and the reasons are multiple and very logic, first of all and most importantly is fuel, obviously and up to now every car as any other machine needs some sort of energy to function, in case of cars this main source of energy is oil, and as we all know the oil reserve in the plant is decreasing every day, and the supporting examples in this case is very clear, and it has been proven scintefically that the oil reserve is dramatically decreasing. secondley is maintenance of cars, which is aslo proven to be very costly process. another good reason is expansion of people, buildings and other things, which is making space less available for cars these days. another very good reason is the availability of other ways of transport, which is making it easy for us to commutte with less effort and lower cost, and at the same time giving us other safer ways of transport and the supporting example here is the very bad safety records of cars as method of transport. I personally think  that the most important reason and supporting examples for the above mentioned fact, is the effect of cars on our environmint, the amount of CO2 emmission cars throughs into our environment every day is unbelievable, and i think it is the main reason which is going to make the number of cars is much fewer in the future.
