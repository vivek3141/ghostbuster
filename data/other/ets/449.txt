I think the products we see on TV ads, newspapers, magazines and billboards are usually exegerrated, but this is the point of an advertisment, to make us believe that we really need that product or that product will solve all of our problems about whatever that product is for. This is basically the heart of the capitalism.
 
 One of the examples of  overrated products is the fitness tools, which promise the consumers to have bigger muscles or to lose weight. These ads want us to desire to be like the people we see on these ads and then they convince us that we can be exactly like them if we buy their product, as if that product magically transform us into the person we want to be. The trick they usually use is to show photos of people before and after they used their product but these photos are often fake ones.
 
 Another example for the misleadind advertisements can be the ads that try to convince consumers that their product will change our lives in many ways. This time the trick they use is putting a lot of meaning to one item like that product defines who we are, who our friends are, etc.
 
 As a conclusion, advertisements and are used for two purposes by companies, to make us desperately desire their products and to cover a really bad product.
