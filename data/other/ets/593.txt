I  strongly agree with this statement, everyone who has being successful has taken some sort of risk at some point in their lives. People do not success just by waiting on oportunities to come to them. For example Thomas Edison, Bill Gates and Mark Benz, all of them made their way to fame and fortune by doing things out side the box and using their natural talents. In addition they had to take risks in order to get to achive their goals and dreams.
 
 Thomas Eddison the most successful inventor of all times, work hard throught his live. His main invention the light bulb, took him 30 years to make it work. He had many offers to work for other people,but he took the risk and used his knoledge and intelligence convined with patience to reach his dream.
 
 Bill Gates the wealthier man in the united states, is also an example of someone who did more than what he knew. A brilliant person that could have spent his life working for a computing company making more money than what the average worker could make in all his carrer. But instead he decided to take the risk and start his own company from scratch in order to succeed under his own name in his field of expertise.
 
 Mark Benz the creator of the first car, everybody thought he was crazy when he invented the carriage with no horses. However he followed his dream and taking a great risk. He sold all he had in order to build his first engine took him years to finished, his family stop visiting him. On the other hand he proved people wrong and one day drove the first carriage with no horses thru his town. Becoming the first successful automaker in the world.
 
 Successful people go beyond what others think unposible. They take risks in order to follow their dreams and go the extramile. They try new things and at the end most successful people create things or provide services that are usefull for most human kind.
