Cars are very essential mode of transportation now a days .Its a type of luxury thing in human life.I think every middle class person is thinking of having a car. I donot agree with the statement that in coming twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.
 Firstly, I  want to support my idea by decribing the following things . As world goes on developing in technology, science and many other forms  I think pollution also increases after twenty years .Beacuse of this pollution a person may not able to travel on a mopeds or twwo wheelers.So many peoaple like even middle calss people try to have a car instead of having a two wheeler moped.
 Secondly , I want to support my idea by focusing on living conditions of a human being. Day by day the standard of living of an individual is going on increasing.An individual  thinks of having  luxury goods. Which results to have a car.Its a type of pretigious thing of having a car.
 Thirdly , I think its a safest mode of trasportation like eventhough in the climatic variations like rainfall and snowfall.There is no need of worrying that there is a chance of getting wet.We can confidentally go anywhere at any time wth out considering the rainfall.
 Finally I want to support my idea of having more cars after twenty years with the above examples.Like considering pollution in coming twenty years the number of cars will be increased ,secondly it is type of satisfaction that an individual will get in pursuing a car. Another reason is that at any time we can plan any trip. Here the speed of the car also comes into picture. We can reach the destination in right times at any climatic conditions.Last but not the least an individual wiil feel comfort while travelling in a car.
