I totally agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. No matter if people are successful in their carreer or in sports, they  probably have made the experience that without trying something new and putting something at risk nothing will change. Success is a process not a static thing.
 
 Success will happen just in a frame of time. For example a product, lets say a mobile phone. The first series of mobiles had appeared years ago. They had been a great success for nokia, siemens etc. But if this companies did invest in research to invent new features, better technologies, the product mobile phone would not be interesting until now, because after a certain amount of time everyone would have owned a mobile and this companies would be nor more successfull. This  point bolsters the statement that success comes with trying new things.
 
 That people have to take risks is also very  good shown by people who are very successful in sports. For example ski flyers. They have to improve their techniques every time. Trainers try to achieve better results of them in teaching them new methods, inventing new material. If this sportsmen would just rely on what they did last season how could it be possible that every year the results are new high scores and records. On the other hand trying out new thins also risks their ability to win. 
 
 In conclusion I would like to say that people that are successful are aware of the fact that there is a need for development and risk for every single success. A famous statement says that the success will not come following the mass to the sea but looking for the spring. Thats what the point is, you have to walk on individual pathes and not on the pathes of somebody else.
