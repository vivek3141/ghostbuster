Recently, it is said that the younger do not provide adequite time to help their communities due to the change of the social structure. There are two prominent factors: the lack of building the relationships with others and the increace of the hours for study and work.
 First,  due to the development of the IT industry, people have losed the opptunities to meet  and communicate with people directly and  result in  becoming devoid of the ability to connect with people. People becom to reluctant to work to people positively.  Moreover, people expect to accomplish the deal by phones or internets without seeing each other.
 Second,  belonging to decreace of the birth rate and  the tendency that peole come to work and study for longer time compared to former time, people can not spend a long time to cooperate the communities. People are occupied to work for a long time, even in weekend and also in Asia countries, especailly, students are comped to study harder to enrol the best university. That removes the chance to work for their communities.
 Finally, the innovation of the IT industry change the society disadvantageously. People no longer can understand  the communities and deepen the relationships with them. If young people dedicate thier more time for thier communities, people will be more abunduant throghtout communication.
