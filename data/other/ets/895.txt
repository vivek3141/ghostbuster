I think that will depend mainly on the stage of the students. For primary school students, I think it is much better for them to learn facts simply because students at this stage  will not be able to understand ideas or concepts. Secondary school students are able to understand ideas and concepts simply because they have already background about facts from the primary school. The situation for the students in the college stage is different as well. I think it is much better for undergraduate students to learn facts by taking many courses of different subject areas. That will give them the opportunity to broad their knowledge about various topics. So after graduation, during their graduate studies, they may take courses in only their subject area. By this way, they will able to work in detail on their major area of study and of course learn ideas and concepts in depth. This definitely what is happening in the US Universities and faculties where students in the undergraduate stage are offered to take some required courses and many elective courses. So during their graduate studies, they may take many courses thats related to their major for one year or so. Unfortunately, in my Country we only learning facts all the time. I think thats the main cause of jobless in my country. I hope one day, I can change the way of learning in my country. As a conclusion, both policy of learning are required depending on the stage of the students.
