For beginning this essay, I just want to ask a question. If you win with a game 100 dollars, you will be happy, it's obvious. Now, if with a game, you win first of all 200 dollars, and afterward in the same game you lost 100 dollars, eventually you will win 100 dollars, but will your feeling be the same in the two cases ?
 
 The really thing which is very important, is not a situation at an precise moment, but the evolution which lead us to a situation.
 Thus, even if we are in a very good situation (in work, family or friends), and this situation stays like that for a long time, our feeling will not be the same, because at the beginning there is a changement which do that we are happy, but after there is not thing which influency our life, so we take the thing differently.
 For example, we can quote, Richard Branson, who has a successful life, but he tries new things all the time, like diversify it company (Virgin), or things more crazy like do a turn around the Earth in balloon, travel in the space (not yet do, but maybe soon).
 
 By all means, there is also people who prefer don't take risks and stay in the same situation. I think that there is not many people in this case, because if there is not evolution in our life, it become boring. Obviously, there is some situation exceptional where it is not right. For instance, I don't think that Michael Schumarrer (ex F1 pilot) was bored by the fact that each year during five years he won the championship. But it is a special case.
 
 For me, the most important in the life is the evolution, to come back to my introduction, obsviously I think that we are not in the same feeling in the two cases (besides, some studies show that it is right). So, I agree that people (not only successful people, but in particular) try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well.
