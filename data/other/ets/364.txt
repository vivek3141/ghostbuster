This question is a very important one, since it refers to the entire education system, and how, in our society, people have decided the way things should be teached to others. In this essay, we will discuss the importance of understanding ideas and concepts, and learning facts, and try to determine if one of these can be considered as prevalent, regarding the other.
 
 Learning facts is, to me, the very basis of education, because it allows people to know what happened before them, what important people lived, and may have changed the world by discovering things, writing books, being an artist. It is very important to know these kind of informations, to be able to consider the world outside yourself, and the things directly surrounding you. Plus it is useful in your everyday life, to understand what people are talking about, to be able to discuss with people about various subjects, to simply socialize, and live in harmony with others.
 
 Interracting with people does not only require knowing a lot of facts, but it also demands reflection, understanding of what you have learned. And yes, understanding ideas and concepts is also very important, because facts alone are not very useful, if you don't try to dig deeper, to think about what you've learned. Philosophy is a great exemple of a domain that absolutely needs both : you need to learn lots of things about the philosophers, about there time, what they have said and thought, and then you need to understand all those informations, to theorize them, in order to think by yourself, and create your own opinion, based (but not necessaraly the same) on what you have learned and understand.
 
 To conclude this essay, I must write that I don't agree with this statement, I think that both understanding ideas and concepts, and learning facts, are the key to a complete education. Indeed, I think that one isn't very useful without the other.
