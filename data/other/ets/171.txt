I completly agree with satement about the most advertisements,there are no of things to be consiredered in this aspect.
 firstly to say about the advertising of cellular services like hutch and airtel communication system they advertise they are the best in the market in terms of cost,efficiency and service.once we get into the their services they start leveing all the hidden cost which doesn't appear at the time of advertising.this is really sort of cheating the people.
 
 secondly there are no of products in the market, their advertisment showing the best appearence,which makes us feel like the real one, when we start using them they dont meet the expected levels,eventhough the cost is high,for example soaps, shampoos,and variety of cosmetics avalable in the market, here appearence of the object and the way they are presented make us easil attracted and buy them.
 thirdly the most of the advertisements use the clebrities for advertisements which make a lot of impact on the products,people just buy them only because thier favoutite star has advertised for it.
 in India most of drinks like coke,pepsi are advertised by the famous local film stars,and people started using them,eventhough they are proved to contain harmful residues of pesticides,after a concern of the media they reduced their usage.
 
 in some context they make us feel they are modified products,eventhough in reality they are not done so,the world has completly paced itself to the world of advertisement, a product any comidity can be made success only by advertising,
 
 to sum up, it is one of the biggest magic or thing to the manufacturers to sell thier products or commidites in the market,at the expense of peoples faith,in their products.
