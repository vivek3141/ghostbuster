I think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.
 I think that we have to "open our mind" to everything because we live in a global society, so we should have many interests.
 A broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects could create different interests.
 An interest grows through teaching many academic subjects in schools.
 I studied many subjects in the secondary school, for example latin, math, italian literature, history, philosophy, biology and I appreciated many views of these subjects.
 Now I have many interests and I am able to understand different point of view or discussions.
 I think that a knowledge in one specific subject is wrong.
