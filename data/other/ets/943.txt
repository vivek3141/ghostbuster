In my opinion the staement listed on the right doesn't consider the reality. The world is turning into a medical knowledge world. By that I mean that medication in this year saves thousands of people in the world. The death rate in the world is decreasing time after time. Nowadays we can compete with nearly all infections in the world, accept the HIV virus. But as we all know, also the HIV infections in the world are decreasing. People do care more about their health. The government encourages smokers to quit smoking, the USA helps other countries by providing them food. This all leads to an increase of population in the world. 
 Another aspect is that freedom of opportunities. In our year we don't have slavery or other criminal actions, besides war, that can lead to death. 
 The USA and other countries provide starving African kids with food and medication. They also teach them the knowledge which is general to us, for example using a condom to prevent the most known virus in the world HIV. 
 More High Economic Countries help citizens of countries with lower economy to share tequinical knowledge, which helps these citizens to grow their economy. Thus the people have a longer living time.
 Through all these factors in my opinion people will drive more cars than today. Cars get cheaper, because the production of cars will get easier with new tecnology. Thus people will buy more cars or some might have more than one car for themselves. 
 In short term, when the population of the world increases the more cars we will have in twenty years. 
 We all know that it is comfortable to drive a car to get from one point to another. This will in my opinion not change in the next twenty years.
