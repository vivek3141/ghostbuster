It is a good idea that when you travel  with a group to be led by a tour guide.  There are many reasons which make this issue an important.  On the other hand, there are some people who think that when they travel with a group, they don't need to be led by a tour guide.  
 
 The best way to travel is in a groupe led by a tour guide because it is important to have a leder.  When people travel in group, they mostly can not make the desicion about what to do in an exact time; in contrast, when they are led by one person, they listen to every thing he says.  People always have controversy in many things, if they are not let by one person , they may have disagreement about something which is not important in their trip.
 
 Some people think that it is not necessory to be led by one person because they don't accept comments from people in general.  This think that a leader will be strict, and he will just give orders for the other people.  Some times if people have a trip without a leader, their trip would have a disapointment.
 
 Actually, the best way to travel is in a group  led by a tour guide.  I would suggest every person who wants to go on trip with a group to have a leader.
