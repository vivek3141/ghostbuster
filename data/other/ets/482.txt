Nowadays we live in an era were the use of cars seems to be very useful and that we cannot live without it. In my opinion, I think that in twenty years there will be more cars than there are today eventhough the public transport will develop enormously.
 Firslty, the population of the world is growing considerably, this means that on the next twenty years there will be more people reaching the age of having the driving license. 
 Secondly, as the years go on, the prices of the cars will be lower, the new technologies makes posible to produce cars at lower prices. This will make posible that a major number of people achive to buy a car. You wont need too much money to buy a normal car. Maybe, luxury cars won't reach to accesible prices, but normal cars I think that will.
 Thirdly, it is shown that going on motorbike in the streets of the cities, the avenues, the autopistas is very dangerous. Every year the number of dead people driving a motorbike increases enormously. People is taken conceuous that driving a motorbike is dangerous and that the possibility of having an accident is high. Moreover, people will tend to prefear to drive a car that drive a motorbike. 
 Fourthly, eventhough the public transports are beeing improved in comfort, price, distance, etc. In twenty years it won't have developed so much to be able to not have a car and move around the city, country, world by public transport. Cars will be yet necessary to do day a day things, and to move around the streets. 
 To sum up, I think that twenty years are no so much to decide not to have any car, maybe in a future, if things change, and the public transport improves and makes more facilities to people may reduce the number of cars. But in a deadline of twenty years I think that all the factors that I have mentioned before will make to have more than today.
