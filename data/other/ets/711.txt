 I think it is very important to have the courage take risks in life. But at the same time a person should also be intelligent to analyze his plan of action.For example if a person wishes to start a company he should plan and work on a lot of things.Firstly he analyze the market and see what effect his product has on the market. Then he should take take care of the finances. Starting a company or business or any enterprise requires a lot of courage because it might be work and it might not.
 So one should have the confidence and courage to go out in this competitive world and give your best shot. If you fail once it does not mean that you will fail everytime.One should keep trying till he or she succeds.But it is also important to learn from your mistakes and try not to repeat them. failing once should not stop you from trying new
