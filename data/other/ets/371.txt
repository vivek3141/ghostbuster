I think is very important that the people take risk and try new things if want to have a succesfull life.  There is some people that not are interest in change their life and just want to live without ideals and nothing to dream, that's the difference between good and rich life to poor and sad.  
 
 If you want to try new things you need first a very good imagination and find the way to apply that, is like an inventor, sometimes the inventor can failt in the invention or in the discoveries but never give up, in contrast, he tries not just one time, a lot of times, until he has the thing that he wanted.   It's just persist in the ideals and figth for them.
 
 It's very common that everybody doing the correct thing in their jobs, working in their charge and living with just the neccesary, but is not better if that people follow their dreams? I believe in that is not just work without motivation and make the things well, is apply new ways to do the job with happy and hope in the future, the job can change from borring to peacefull not only the place also the aptitude.
 
 My suggest is not just life with few and the neccesary things, is a call for happy and lovely life when you keept the dreams and take risk for a succesfull life
