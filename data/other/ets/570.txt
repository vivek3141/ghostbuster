It is important to have an idea of many academic subjects, but i think it is more important to specialize in one specific subject, that you can collect a lot of information about this subject ,and you become more efficiant in your work , that you can discover new knowledge about this subject and new field in it, so you can get a good possetion in your work and in your life, and you become specialest in you field .
 That persone who have knowledge of many academic subjects will not collect all the information about the subjects , and he will not become a qualficat persone to work in spesific jobe and to use his knowledge in this job, comparing to that persone who have specialize in one subjct.
 We can think also that the persone who have specializing in one subject should have some knowledge about some subjects , cause he may use them in his life and his job, and he will be more qualefication in any field , at the same time when we think about that persone who have knowledge of many academic subject he can got any job he want, and it will give him more opprtinity in life , that the persone who is specialized in one specific subject may not have a lot of oppertionty to have good job especaly if he has a specialize in a feild which is not populer or an old subject , so he will lose the opertionity to have job , or to work in his feild .
 At these days the life is more developed and thier is a lot of knowldge all over the world, and no one can collect all the knowlege , so the persone should aske about the new specialization and which is effective during a lot of years and become specialized in this subject, at the same time try to collect and read about different issue and different subject to develp his knowledge , and to have more opportinity in life.
