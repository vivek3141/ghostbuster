I totally agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.There are several reasons to support this argument.
 Define Fact?Fact is a statment or theory put forth by an individual or group of individuals or an organization.A student can memorize a lot of facts without understanding the purpose behind the facts.A fact can be true or false but definitely can be proven by an individual if the student can understand the ideas and concepts.For example, in the past people believed that the world was a straight line but couldnt be proven since the resources were insufficient or people were willing to accept the facts rather than spend time,money on it.
 A Greek scholar stated the earth was spherical but was unable to support his statement.
 Students need to spend more time on the ideas and concepts underlying the facts.It improves the students ability to broaden his ideas ,infact could possibly lead to rewrite some of the facts which has been there for centuries.
 Many facts are interlinked with each other.Therefore disapproving  a fact can lead to revision of other facts that are linked to it.
 Understanding ideas and concepts can help the student easily memorize the fact.
 Therefore,it is an important factor that students understand the ideas and concepts.
