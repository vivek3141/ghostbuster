I agree with this opinion that succeful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they arleady know to do well.
 
 The reason i agree with this opinion is that  succcss has something to do with people's mind.  if someone trying to something that they want to it, they can make success someday.
 Another reason is that trying to make success by developing own personality. For example, i usually rode a bike to go to school, once time i trid to drive my father's car, when i first took a car, it is really difficult for me to handle a car, but the more i drive, the easier and more intrested. 
 However, somepeople make their own success by doing only one way because they ususlly do it onething that they already know how to do well. 
 In conclusion, people who try to do new things is good.
