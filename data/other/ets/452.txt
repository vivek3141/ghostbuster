I remember me surrounded by my friends planting trees in the backyard of our neighbourhood. Those days are gone, now we do not have time to plant trees, to organize charity markets in which we sell old closes to save money to decorate or beautify or community. I totally agree that young people do not use time in helping the community. But the question is why ?
 In my opinion young people should be spending more time in the activities that involve the neighbourhood, just because we are young,and with this I mean we are strong, with energy... so we are in the addecuate state in our life to do this. The problem is that nowadays life is really different as it used to be. Today you have to be competitive if you want to have success in the real world, and young people know that. We are concerned about the lacking of jobs so we spent our time studying and learning languages, getting skills and knowledgements that make us overweight the competence. And as a result we don't have time for other leisure activities.
 The other point is that now the neighbourhood system is regulated by the Townhall, now it would be unimaginable for me seeing small children planting trees on the streets, there are laws that regulates the decoration of a city. So that is another reason why young people can not help in their communities, because the system does not allow them.	
 But anyway, sometimes I think we have gone to far, that nowadays we are so worried about our economic future that we do not have time for other important activities. Maybe a cure to this business blindness will be to obliy us to take part in some social work, like a community service, of course regulated by the Townhall. So helping others might open up our eyes a little bit and we discover that sometimes helping people around you provides you more personal benefits than a good job could do.
