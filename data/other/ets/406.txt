I agree with the view that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.
 Of course, I understand that some people think it is more desirable to concentraring on one specific subject. In my opinion, however, obtaining broad knowledge is better for the following two reasons.
 First reason supporting my idea is about practical aspect. These days our society has large number of social problem to solve. I believe that we have to get broader and more knowledge which is required to appropriately deal with the problems. In order to strrugle with the tangled social problem, we must have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. For example, contemporary society has environmental problem globally. When we make effort to find a solution to this kind of problem, for instance, global warming, we have to utilize the knowedge, findings and theory not only in the area of natural science but also social science. In sum up, we have to study biology, ecology, natural history, law, economics, politics, and so on. Thinking this way, we find that it is much more important to study variety of discipline broadly to solve the actual social problem.
 Second of all, I think that we cannnot learn one specific subject well without broad knowledge of many subjects. Personally, more often than not, I can get someting about one subject when I study another subject. For example, when I learned mathmatics, I understood Platos philosophical theory. In this way, we often get profound knowledge about a certain subject while studing another subjects. That is why, I think it is helpful for getting special knowledge       
 
 For these reasons, I think it is better to know wide range of academic subjects.
