The statement that the,  " Young people enjoy life more than the older people do",  appears very vague to me. It is a very generalized statement. In my opinion age is just a number and it is the attidude towards life is that matters the most. I believe, if we have a positive attitude then no matter what our age is we will be optimistic and have a zest for life and for other social- cultural activities. In fact as we grow old, we mature and start making wise decisions instead of being impulsive. 
 
 Young people in my personal opinion are hyperactive and prudent. When young we just want to do things which will give us short term happiness or pleasures. During the growing up years, the tendency is to enjoy and to experience everything without considering the ramifications of their actions. But when we compare, the enjoyment that comprises of physical activities, like sports or other adventurous outdoor activities( like biking, hiking, surfing etc.) then there is no denial that the young people enjoy and make the most of it! 
 
 Also when we are young, we face the hardships of life, education, job which at times can leave a little time for adventure or enjoyment. But as we grow old, by that time, we have taken care of our responsibilities, achieved and accomplished our goals. Then we adopt a  more relaxed attitude to enjoy the benefits of our hardwork. So in a way it can be a debatable question who enjoys the life more, the young or the old! 
 
 As far as I am concerned, I do not agree that only young people enjoy life more. Enjoyment and happiness are also associated with    the way we humans percieve things. So enjoyment of life by younger generation can also be dubbed as an ambiguous entity.
