i strongly agree with specializing in one specific subject.  i think each person has a things to do. people do not have to do all thing. if a person could do one thing very well, the person can do that noone else can do. so each person has things that only the person can do. to do the things that another people cannot do, specializing in one specific subject.
 
 in high school, students study many subjects those are not specific. that means they just study many academic subjects. but in university, students go to university to learn about one specific subject they are interested in. of cause university is better than high school. so i think the system of the education today shows that specializing in one subject is better to do.
 
 most of many academic subject we learn in high school are meanless when we get a job. once we get a job, what we need is going to be a specific things. in the society, people do their part of the job. noone can do all part of job. so many company need people who have something specific.
 
 today, i think many people find difficult to find what they should do and want to do. the key find what to do is a specific things. if people know any of specific subjects, why do not find the job that you can use your knowledge that you learned? i think what the world needs now is specific people with specific knowledge.
 
 therefor, specific knowledge is very useful at many situation like jobs, at school and in your normal life. my opinion is to enjoy and make your life succusessful try to get at least one specific thing that others normaly cannot do. as soon as people have many types of specific things, world is going to increase to a new world.
