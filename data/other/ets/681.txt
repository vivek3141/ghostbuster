It wil be better of knowing broad knowledgeof many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one subject.
 
 Education is the manifestation of perfection alredy in man. the knowledge which we get from dufferent subjects are un comparable with the horizon of the sky, the patience of the earth, the flow of water, the greenary of nature.
 
 If we go through the academic way there will definitly increase inthe burden in the subjects in this manner we can improve our skills to solve a problem, if we are concentrate only one subject it will be good only to that subjects where we can score good marks only in that subjects , here the main disadvantage is that we cannot solve different kind of problems, he  may be profeessional  in that   subject than also he cannot  use the other  tactics which are known in other subjests.
 
 Consider a student who interested in the subject physics and he concentrat only on this subject , and he also had a mathematics subject where he concentating less on it, it really creates a problem in future because physics deals with some part of maths and the student must known the minimum knowledge about maths so that he can solve a problem, so it is must that concentrating on different academic leads  a perfect life to the students.
 
 Here iam talking about the acdemic subjects , these are always related to the previous subject so it will be easy to understand the concepts easily once we followed and these concepts can be applied to solve a problem easily and accurately.
 If here students are confused with the different subjects then atleast they should concentrate on there core subjects which always relate to their previous semisters and this will definitly help in the techniqal field where he should know the basics of the subjects.
 
 Here students has make shoure that they are concentrating on there related subjects rather than unussual things like students in maths field should not concentrate much on the medicine field because they are not going  to deal medicine in future,similar way medicine students must not concentrate much on maths field.
 
 Here conclusion to this is it will be advantage to the students 
 who had much knowledge on different subjects rather than students who concentarte only one subject.
