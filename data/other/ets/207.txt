I'm going to have to agree with that statement with most cases around the globe, but the attention that young people give to their communities relies mostly on their culture.
 In the western world, in countries in Europe and North America mostly, the notions of "duty" and "honor" have almost entirely disapeared from young peoples consciences, parents are not teaching their children to love and defend the communites they've grow in and there is no mistery about why young people don'y contribute much time , that when children are going to turn into teenagers, then young adults they won't give much about what happens in their community. Today "community service" in the west is a form of punishment for the minors who draw on walls, sell drugs, steel or commit other violations of the law.
 Take for an example the number of young people who would go to a rap a concert where they are encouraged to consume drugs and told to sleep with prostitutes, and compare that number to that of the young volounteers who wanted to help the Catrina or 9/11 victims for example.
 In other parts of the world, or in "the third world" as the Westerns call them, young people still care about their comunities and countries much more to dirty music, we can see a much diffrent atmosphere. Take the last war Israel waged on Lebanon and the countless young men and women who volounteered to help the Red Cross or other humanitarian organisations in order to help the civilian victims who might've survived the israeli raids. 
 When you see young ones still helpingthat much their comunities, you can't say that every where young people do not give enough time to help their communities. 
 To conclude, we can say that wether the young ones help their communities enough or not depends primarily on the culture of the concerned country or community.
