Risk are really difficult to take because of the fear of loosing what we have or care about.
 However taking risks is almost the only satisfactory way to obtain things in life.
 Taking risk gives a lot more than satisfaction, it leads to success, even if it's difficult to distinguish satisfaction from success cause they're strictly connected.
 Not just a reaserch for happiness then, but even a way to grow and be mature.
 Just to do what we know how to do and not trying to experience things such as new styles, new fields, new jobs, and so on, keeps us narrow minded.
 We're talking about trying to do new things and not succeed to obtain them.
 This means that we don't have to be scared of trying cause the fear keeps us ignorant.
 We can learn by tries instead.
 The most successful people had been through this before without caring about risks or consequences.
 Nelson Mandel said " Behaving as a little man doesn't help the world. Free yourself and your presence will automatically free the others".
 He also said that our biggest fear is not the darkness nor things we don't know.
 Our greatest fear is our light and our glory, which means that we might be afraid of our possibilities; in his opinion.
 Fears and lost tries produce regreats so that, even if we don't have to be too impulsive, we have to take the chance...
 For istance, Orazio,  ancient Rome's author, said the famous sentence "carpe diem", that means take the day, take the chance.
 He knew that risks are dangerous, but he also knew that if we think too much there's the possibility of wasting the whole life thinking.
 Taking risks is part of our lives, that's what really fulfills ourselves, one of the very few things who could make us happy.
