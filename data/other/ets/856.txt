I can agree to this statement but of course this does not mean that there are no people that spend time - or enough time - to helping. The problem as a whole is a problem of the society being fast, anonymous and commercial. Let me explain some of the reasons for the problem in detail.
 First of all many young people nowadays do not even have the time to get really involved into a community for a long time. After school they go to a university far away and afterwards they will find a job elsewhere - and even that job can end soon and one will have to leave again.
 One point - perhaps related to the one before - is the focus people have. Most do only look at themselves and do not want to handle the problems of other people - maybe they do not have the time or  connection to the people and city the went to for their new job, for example. So, always looking for the own success makes people blind for problems of their neighbours, classmates and communities.
 Furthermore the preferance of indoor activities as they are very common today - such as tv, computer games or internet - leads to loss of communication with other people. Following helping other people or communities gets less and less, too. A girl sitting at home and watching her perfered afternoon soap and dealing with the problems shown there will no longer be interested in the problems in her community.
 In conclusion  I can state again that I agree with that statement - but this negative issue is not only the fault of single persons but - to a certain amount - the fault or problem of the society and our generation as a whole.
