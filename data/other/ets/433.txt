In Korea, there is a new common thought about Korean youg people after the World Cup 2002.  Most young generation showed positive qualities to keep in order, clean up stadium after play, and have a good manner in encouraging.  However, it is a picture of one particular period and I do not think it tells that yougsters nowadays are a lot engaged to their community.  In other words, I agree with the statement that youngsters are not giving much time to help the community for two reasons; they are 
 First of all, young people participate in community only when it is an obligation.  For instance, my sister Jina, a highschool student, is relcutant to participate in community work.  However, the scholls regulates that it is mendatory to do a voluntary work for the community for 10 hours per year, she does it helplessly.  If it is not for school assignment, she never helps the community.  She says it is such a boring thing to talk with the eldery, clean parks, help disabled.
 Second, youngsters are too selfish to think about others.  Especially thesedays, they concentrates to themselves more and more. For example, the educational circumstance are making children to compete.  My nephew Alice is always top in her class.  To be the most elite student, she goes to seven differnet extracurriculum academy.  She says she has to be a number one and to be like that, she has no time to spend on others.
 In brief, thesedays, the young ages  are getting more and more selfish by competative atmosphere and spends only a little time to help the community
