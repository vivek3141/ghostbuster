In Japan, it has became a big issue that young people do not participte in their communities. Considering this situation of Japan, I agree with that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.
 
 The main reason is that young people have to study instead of helping their communities. In Japan, many parents expect their children to enter good high school, good university and good company. They believe that entering the good company assure their children's happiness. In most case, these believe do not came true. However parents force thier children to study at preparatry school in addition to their high schools. For example, Ten years ago, I worked  as a tuter. At that time, Aya, who I taught math, was very busy girl. She studied five days a week at preparatory school, and she practiced playing a piano and swimming. When I heard her schedule, I worried about her health. In this case, her parents forced her to study hard instead of having spare time to do anything not to related to entering a good school.
 
 As I explained above, in Japan, young people was not expected to spend their time to helping their community. Therefore, I strongly agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.
