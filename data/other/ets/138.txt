I agree to the following statement, that 'Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are'.
 Many companies produce goods and market them to the fields by marketing them or advertising them through T.V shows, advertisements etc. Any products in this world must meet the ISO (International Standard Organisation) standards in their value and quality. One can know about the product by watching the advertisements or the hoardings available. The Marketing producers maintains the ads in such a way that, any people can easily get impressed to that product and buy that.
 They show high standards in marketing them rather than in maintaining the quality. For example take a simple product like a baby milk powder, the current and present ad will be in such a way that, it shows as if a  baby can become super man by drinking it. No body needs his/her child to become a superman, they only want the minimum health needs for their baby to grow. The ads will only impress the children to get attracted to it.
 Another example for this type is the production of bathing soaps, the marketing members will make the ad for the bathing soaps so impressively by keeping celebrity for that ad. So that all the young and youth girls become desperete towards the soap thinking that they are the celebrity. Every one knows that by using that soap an ordinary girl cannot become an celebrity, every one knows it, even the production people knew it. Yet they are making it.
 Am not saying that the advertisements are wrong, its there wish to make or not, my opinion is to maintian the standards in there products, as many people trust them by going through the ad. As huge amount have being placing for a product on their advertisements, they have to keep an equal and energetic intrest on their quality too.
