I agree with this sentence. Even though most of young people have enough time to give a help for theif communities, they doesn't do, I think.
 Most of young people have time for themselves. For example, they
 play sports, see movies, and so on. They always enjoy "their time". There are few young people who have such "time".
 But in most cases, they don't help their communities. Because, of course, it is funnier to play sports, see movies. Probably they don't argue that they have enough time to help their communities, but in fact they don't think that they want to spend "thier time" on helping their communities, I think.
 We can understand this when we think a young person who is really busy. He doesn't have time to do many things.  Naturally, he wants to do something he like to do and probably he does it. There aren't many young people who like to help their communities, I think.
 Then, Why do people help theire communities? It is because these people have much thanks to their communities. They want to do "reply" to their communities. So they spend their time on helping their communitiies.
 So, I argue that it is important to educate young people. For example, I think that it's good to make time to know work of their communities as one of school works. Young people don't know work of their communities well. So, they don't have enough thanks to spend their "precious" time on helping their communities. That is, it is necessary that young peple know local work of the people who help their communities very well.
 I agree with this sentence because of these reasons.
