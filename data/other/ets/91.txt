How to became a successful person?
 i think that nobody could have a right answer for this question, but I`m sure that it`s something linked with the caracteristics of each different personson.
 According to me,in order to start the carrier through the success it`s importand to have a solid base, that means knowledge and experience. So in the beginning i think that everyone should exploit his qualities in the best way, bulding up a solid structure that helps him to grew up.
 when this first step is done, you are able to try new things, to go in fields differents from the one of the basic knowledge: in other words, to risk!
 For me, this is the characteristic that makes you a real successful person, because when someone acts in this way means that his really proud and sure about his own possibilities. 
 I`ll write an example, to better explain this point.
 My father used to have a good job, not far away from home, that allows him to get enought money to live his life without any kind of problems. Some years ago he`s got the opportunity to go to work abroad, chanching company  working, far away from his family: he didn`t even know much about the new job, but he decided to take this chance, and risk. I cannot say that my father is the  biggest successful man that i`ve ever known, but of course he`s got much more success, than if he`d chosen to continue his previous job.
 so, i think that to risk is difficult, but if you want to do "something" in your life, of course you have to do it! And this is applicable for every kind of situation, that means success for what concern your job, family, friends.
