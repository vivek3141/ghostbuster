Some people say that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. In my opinion, I think it is good for a person to have a background in many subjects. However, he must concentrate on one subject which will be his major in college and the field of his job. Each person should has one specialized subject. A doctor cannot be a civil engineering at the same time.
 
 There are many reasons why I think specialization in knowledge is better. First, every society must consist of people that have  knowleges about different subjects. As the human body contains different members that work independently and consistently, the society needs individuals with different jobs and ways of thinking. In addition, people are different in what they are interested in and we cannot find a person who interested in all academic subjects. For example, I like computer engineering but hate medicine whereas my brother's interests are just the opposite of mine. Besides, human brain is limited and a person cannot be creative in many fields. This century is not like the past when one scintist, like Newton, was shining in physics and mathematics.
 
 As we have noticed, societies must consists of people of different knowleges and it is impossible to find a person who is creative in many academic fields. Therefore, I disagree with the idea which says that it is better to study many academic courses than to specialize in one specific field.
