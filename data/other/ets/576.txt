I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people for the following reasons.
 
 Most impotantly, young people can travel anywhere and anytime. For example, my family used to spend our summer vacation in Hawaii about twenty years ago, because my parents liked Hawaii and really enjoyed traveling to Hawaii, such as swinming, plating golf, going shopping. But recently their enjoment of spending Hawaii during summer vacation, because my parents recongized their weak points in their body because of old age. The notice of disadvantage tends to prevent from traveling anywhere, especially, Hawaii. Contrary to old people, young people merely recognizer their weak point in their body  because of their age in cluding me, and young people travel to anywhere where they want to go actively, also including me. But old people as like my parents tend to be limited to travel because of their condition.
 As the above examples shows, young people can travel anywhere and anytime. 
 
 Additionally, young people try to do what they want to do. I enjoy doing  yoga in owder to keep healthier. Also, in spring and fall, I enjoy playing golf. Howerver old people tend to bear doing what they want to do.  For example, my father also enjoyed playing golf in younger age when I was littele child. But, when  ten years ago, he had the operation in his eye because of accumurated stresses for a long time, he came to pay attention with his body, of course including his eyes. And he stopped diving car because of the affairs. Therefore he stands up plaing golf. Instead he go for a walk every morning to keep his good condition and to maintain health
 As the above examples demonstrates, old people tend to be limited when they want to do anything, wheras young people try to do what they want to do.
 
 In conclusion, I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people.
