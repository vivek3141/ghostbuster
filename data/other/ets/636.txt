successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well i strongly agree with this topic because of considering so many successful person life stories.
 when the people successed in their life means its not a small task its a great  hard work what they did in their lifes.They also did so many mistakes in their lifes but if he successed in the same field means he realized the mistakes of the past and press on to the future, thats the first achivement of any successful person
 when you consider one example of life story of richest man in the world who is billgates.In his life he faced so many hurdles but by inventing so many softwares he never stopped his goal by inventing operating system or new softwares he not repeated the past inventions he did differently.
 Not only single successful man when we go through the life histories of any successful man we can detect and unhide what they did and how they become successful.
 Because of there creativity to press on new event they are becoming successful.For every successful person there should be some simlilar features which are self confidence,creativity,dedicating nature,dareness because of these qualities they can be successed 
 successful person never stops with one achievement he fixes another goal and try on that because of that nature only success is possible for a person.Definetly every person have a problems by overcoming that we get successful.
 succesful man will not repeat what they already learned are did 
 they can use there experience in another form because of there dareness and there habbit of taking risks,they are becoming successful and inventing new things.By having this qualities in a person there inventions and achievements will never end until their life ends.
 with this discussion and examples i can conclude my argument as successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what already know how to do well.For that kind of people there is no limit for achievements.
