To answering this question in an adequate way we need to analyse why society use cars. Based on this considerations we can try to figure out if there would be less cars than today.
 The history about the cars began last century. Cars increased and are still increasing our mobility. I belive that there are to different mobilities: the personal and the economical mobility.
 
 The personal mobility is something people want to have. It allows us to move from one point to an other point at the time we would like to. We don`t  need to have a look on schedules. We are independent from others. To give up this personal freedom is hardly conceivable.
 On the other hand, cars are so important for the world wide economy. They provide the mobility of persons and of goods. It is a cheap oportunity to move.  Consequently the whole economy would not reduce the usage of cars if it`s not forced by other circumstances.
 
 Using cars increases the air pollution, reduces the world wide storage of fuel and accordingly rises the fuel prices. This might be an effect to get the society considering  their behaviour. 
 Recently the prices for fuel went up dramatically. I don`t think that at the moment the society is using the car less then before. In Switzerland, where I come from, there at the moment several dissusions about how to decline the air pollution and to improve the enviroment. This discussion is meaningless if just some people on the earth are looking for solution and are really willing to do it. Especially for raising countries it is quiet hard to think about such a problem. The need something to eat and have other problems at the moment.
 
 All in all, it needs a world wide solution. I don`t think that the society would be able to find one without forced from other
