I can easely imagine that there will be much more cars in use in the future compard to today. There are several arguments why I agree with the statement, that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. 
 
 First of all the world population is still increasing very fast. This aspects leads to an simlpe conclusion. More people need more cars. Especially the populations in the cities are growing, because there excits an movement from land to the cities for the last years.  For the people living in this big cities or the little towns neaby, it is usual to own a car. So for this reason more cars are needed. 
 
 Furthermore there is another very important aspect. The global buisness is getting much more important today and will be the main buissnes in the future. I infer from this aspect, that in the future buisness people, or working people in general will need cars and plains much more than today. I cannot imagine buisness men without a car even today and in the future it will be much more neccessary. 
 
 It is said, time is money! And so it will be in the future. The third aspect I am thinking  of is, that people do not have much time today to reach theire destinations, because of the very tight schedulethey have.This will not chance in future. Today this mainly stands for buisness jobs, but in the future even this will change. People working outside the cities on the fields will need more cars to get in the next city to provide theire products on markets. I think in the future even farmers will try to sell things online, so a transfer form the land to the customer must be guarantied. You will need more cars for this, too. 
 
 Finally these arguments are the reason why I think thee will be defentely more cars in the future.
