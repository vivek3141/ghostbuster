There are some argument wether having broad knowledge of many academic subject or specializing in one object. In case of having wide knowledge of many subjct is more benefial to most of student who have taken rather than student of who specialize one subject.
 
 The first of all, it mean many oppotunity that student choose their major or future. Because every student touchs many fields of subjects and.  It help student choose their specific major. If they have many chances to have, it would be happened more less to confuse their future of to change their major.  In long run, this method can save student's time and money which relocated their goal.  These experiences  will be good basis for having specific major. 
 
 Another reason is that broad knowledge help student in their life-time. Having many background infomantion can help many bad or good circumstances. For example, opera which student had studied in class is more attractive to them than others who never study about opera. Also others of subjuct is smilar with it.  
 
 Lastly, studying braod knowledge helps student to see a various aspect of subject(problem). Unluckly, students who don 't study about broad subject might have possibility to see one aspect to others. When I was young, one of my classmates was interested in math. He was also genious in math. But he didn't do well in other subjuct and had problem with peers. Becase he was not interest in other parts and peers. 
 
 Above the reasons, the best option of way of studing subject is having broade knowledge of various academic subjects.
