Many people think that the best period in life for trying new things and taking more risks in the job is the period in which this job is successful.
 In my opinion this is absolutely right, even though there are other events and situations that could get a person to take a risk. Of course, risks should be taken in the time when a person is stable enough, both in private and economical aspects, to succeed in facing the possible consequences that the actions could cause. With reference to this, people tend not to take risks while they already have a difficult situation, like for example the foundation of a new work activity or a problem in the family.
 However, this is not a rigid and strict rule: sometimes people could have to take risks beause the situation itself forces them to do it; similarly, someone could decide to take a risk because in his opinion the result of this action is highly predictable.
 Trying new things is in some ways like betting: maybe you don`t know wether you`ll win or not, but anyway your duty is to be in the best condition to risk, and then to prepare to acknowledge the result.
 Another thing that affects this choice is the success itself: people try to prove their value, doing new things that they previously didn`t know; in this way, the diversification of a business activity can demonstrate what eventually a person can achieve and do well: if you succeed again,you`re a winner; otherwise, you`re just a loser. It`s like a challenge that people accept to take.
 Of course the statement doesn`t only refer to the business situations: people act and follow their desire to challange theirselves also in the everyday and private life. This reasoning is part of the life of all human beings,and normally helps them to develop and improve, or at least to learn something from a bad experience.
