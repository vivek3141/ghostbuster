Before discussing this statement, we have to think about what "enjoying life" means. It could be simply "having fun." If it is the case, we have to say that young people enjoy life more than older people do. But I want to say that "enjoying life" can be attained after we recognize "the meaning of life." When we follow my own definition of "enjoying life," then we can say that old people enjoy life more than younger people do. 
 Young people may have fun during their school life by discussing topics that they newly discovered, traveling foreign countries or simply going out with friends. However I want to say that these experiences would be merely "fun" rather than enjoying life. Because "life" is such a serious thing, it will take time for young people to recognize the meaning of life. Also, young people are busy and poor. They have too much things to do to prepare for the future. They don't have enough money to spend to enjoy.
 Older people, on the other hand, through their abundant experience, would get their own idea of "life." Only after they have some idea of life, they will think about what would enjoying their lives mean. It could be helping others, reading books and discuss about, or travel to diffenent countries. But their experiences would not merely fun. We could say these experiences are "enjoying lives." Facinating thing for older people would be that they have time and money to spend for enjoying their lives. 
 As a conclusion, I would like to say that old people enjoy life more than younger people do.  So I disagree with the statement.
