As a young Turkish man, i am disagree with the statement. In my opinion older people enjoy life more than young people do. The reasons why i think are older people have more experience than young people, they do not have to struggle with life and they can be happy with their children.
 
 Firstly, older people have a big advantage to be happy, they have lived different things before than young. For exmaple, they know a birth's happiness or a death's sadness, thus they have to change to be happy more than young people. I think there is a lot of events which can be hurted for me, but they can not hurt an older one.
 
 Secondly, older ones have not got a struggle in life as big as youths. I  for instnace; need to more work than my parents because they got their side at life before me and their tasks are reducing. For these reason older people live in more comfort than young people. In my opinion older people's comfort is the best happiness at the world.
 
 Finally, older people have their children but young ones not. Although young people have responsibility,  they can not know the responsibility and happiness to having their own children. Children may be most important thing to happiness for a person. For this reason young people should not be sure about their real happiness before they have not got a child. To my mind i will be really happy when i see my own child.
 
 To conclude, although young ones have lots of advantage to be happy, in my opinion matures have real happiness, and have more thing to satisfy. I think vast majority of people think as me in Turkey.
