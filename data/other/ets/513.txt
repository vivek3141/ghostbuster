i am living in acommunity were every one want and needs to have a car ,you can find that all teenagers count the days when they are going to reach the legal driving age just to have a car.the cars rate is already getting higher ,because of the obsession of driving and showing off.
 
 in my country we have ;thank to god; good incom ,so every family would easily offer beying more than one car one for the father onther one for the mther ,and onother two for the driving son and daughter  ;therefore, we have lots of traffic concidering that it is a small country.there is statistical evidents that the rate of vighecils specially saloon cars is increasing ;for instance,in one of my college classes i had an assignment wich was about reviewing some statistics about the rate of car accidents in kuwait "my country" so i reviewed them with the group ;unfortunatlly, it turned out that the car accident rate has increased since the year 2000 to 2004 up to 70% and the main reason is because of the number of cars that have been dramatically raising . from all what we are wetnessing these days with all what technology has been created  ,cars are still the most stable need of every one and technolog wont be easilly able to create some thing that drive our attention from cars .althought cars are very important, people are still missusing them .
