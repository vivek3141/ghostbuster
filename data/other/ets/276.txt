I do not think that young people enjoy life more than older people do. To my mind, the main reason for it is that older people have acquired a strong living experience. Indeed, because they have lived longer than younger people, they have experimented more with different lifestyles and thus know which one is likely to give them the most enjoyment in life.
 
 In addition, older people may have more time to spend; younger people are likely to experience the stressful beginnings of work and education. Thus they have more time to enjoy life: when one is busy working, one cannot spend time enjoying life. In what ways then can older people manage their time in order to enjoy life more ? Older people can fulfill their spiritual needs more easily as their thoughts are more trained. This is why is may be easier when one is older to study serious matter and read more difficult books, and why it is so much more difficult for younger people to concentrate on hard subjects. Put simply, the younger people tend to be more easily distracted by basic needs and so are more likely to be disturbed by them too.
 
 For example, I could cite my grandfather who says that he has come to the best moment of his life because he can now enjoy his present life more than any time before by reading and reflecting on his experience. Hence my idea that younger people may have more physical energy than older people, but older people have equally or more mental energy. 
 
 Thus, older people enjoy more life than younger people do because the former knows how to employ it's time to enjoy life best on the contrary of the latter which doesn't.
