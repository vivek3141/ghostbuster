I agree, I belive in a saying that states " High risk equals high returns". From eralier courses i have taken in school i learned that one should place their eggs in different baskets, which means that investments should be invested in different new ideas instead of concentrating on one sort of new business or idea. 
 
 One can never grow and develope if they keep on preforming  what they already know how to do well, inorder for somone to grow and develope they must try new things, take chances, and make mistakes. For example, when a baby first learns how to crawl and becomes very good at it, the baby is never gana crawl for the rest of his life so the baby will take the risk of walking, even tough the baby will fall several times, the baby will try again and again that's where not being afraid to make mistakes comes in. The baby cannot run unless it can walk, this point emphasises the imnportance of taking risks to achive great success. 
 
 There are a lot of examples one can speak about, for example. For example, Bill Gates a well recognized business man in the United States started off with a business idea in college, and instead of continuing his studies he took his idea and put it into action, he now is the owner of an internationally recognized computer software company Microsoft. Microsoft is always taking risks and introducing new ideas and trying new things in the market causing Microsoft to still grow and strive in the market.
 
 Trying new things is never a risk I belive, how can somone have potentail to grow and strive in todays economy if one is not willing to take initative and try new things. Failling should never hold someone back from succeding in something but it should be a lesson to learn from to do well next time one tries again.
