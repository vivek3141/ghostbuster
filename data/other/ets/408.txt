To answer the question, I have to define what "successful" means first. To me a successful person is someone who is in control of his life and able to live it the way he wants it to be. He is not limited by various barriers in his job or social life and has already achieved a high position in his profession as well as he has a large and stable circle of friends.
 One important barrier that stands in your way to fullfill your dreams is fear. If someone doesn't dare to take a new job opportunity or to meet new people at a party, how could he possibly improve his professional or social situation? 
 We live in a society that is confronted with changes constantly: may it be a new techincal innovation like the mobile phone ten years ago or the latest fashion in clothing. The creation of new things means that there are new products to sell which leads to a growth in economy. And this is good of everybody. Someone who adopts all the new things shows that he wants to be part of market-society and will be successful in it.
 People who don't will be recognized (as they were unfashionable clothes and are not able to send SMS) and excluded. 
 Especially the technical developement openes a wide range of new possibilities; for example in transport and communication. People who are the first to try these innovations can take advantage of the improved transportation or communication the longest. They have a head start.
 On the other hand, taking risks can be dangerous. All those people who bought new economy shares in the beginning of this century will agree with me. If you start something new there will always be the chance of failing. So I can also understand those who stay with what they know they're good in.
 I guess, a truely successful person is able to tell what is a risk worth taking and where they should keep their hands of. 
 All in all I am more or less agreeing with the statement. In the world of today it is better to go one step to far than to be left behind.
