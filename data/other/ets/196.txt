In my point of view the statement is correct. There are simple reasons, why I support this statement. I would like to explain that this is understandable by describing the situation out of different perspectives.
 When you sell a product, for example your old car, you want to make profit out of it. So you clean it up to get the best picture of if and you think of all the features and advantages this car owns. When you sell it on the internet or in the newspaper you mention only these good sides. The reason is simple: You just want to get the maximum amount of money you cat get for it. Most times sellers do not even tell the buyer that the car had an accident until he particularly asks. If you now compare this behavier with the average advertisements there is almost no difference. Both you and everyone else who advertises just wants to earn money.
 Another example is my experience in my job. We offer computer services for enterprise customers. When we make an offer, we tell what we already did, make examles of already finished projects and tell them how good our specialists are. Sometimes I am happy to be at our side of the discussion, because I know the reality. You can not really say that we are lying, but we are using the right words to describe it nicely. It again performed like an average advertising you can see on TV or on the internet, they do it the same way.
 So from the sellers point of view it is of course understandable. Beeing the consumer you have to be aware of all of these strategies of selling a product. I personally always try to minimize the advertations to their provable facts, so that I can compare different products with each other objectively.
