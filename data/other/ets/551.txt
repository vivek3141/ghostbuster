The issue raised is a very important issue as it creates a lot of hesitation in the minds of many individuals.I strongly agree it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.I stick to this opinion for the following reasons.
 The first reason i would prefer having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is because it gives an overall  idea to the individual.For example,a student like mechanical engineer will learn academic subjects like electrical,electronics,computers etc.. other than his mechanical specialisation subjects.This will dope him with knowledge when it comes to design of a product say a car as it invloves the mechanical design and the electrical arrangement.
 another reason is specialistaion in one subject poses barricades being employed in an organisation where the organisation needs skills in all round aspects of academic subjects.to illustrate this point i explain the desired qualities a CNC lathe operator should possess to seek a job.For this the operator should have knowledge about the computer programming which performs various jobs as programmed and mechanical knowledge for assistance.An organisation prefers to hire the operator who has knowledge in both fields of computers and mechanical academic subjects.An operator may not be employed if he is specialised in only one field without having any knowledge about other subjects.
 Finally,specialisation may end up as time consuming process.  A modern industry comprises  of an integrated methods of manufacturing and specialisation may delay the overall manufacturing time in the workstation say an automotive industry where different components of the products are needed to be alligned as one at the end.Suppose a person is specialised in designing the product say the car he may not know what voltage should be need inorder to iginite the engine.so he needs to seek the electrical guy for this which is absolutely time consuming.If he would have braod knowledge of many academic subjects like the electrical knowlegde,he can desing the car in a shorter time.
 In conclusion,at the end of the day the bottom line i pronounce is it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialise in one specific subject  as specialisation in one specific subject addresses complexity.
