Today you found a lot of products on the market. Many firms give you a big variety. On the one hand there are different kinds of products. On the other hand, there are differences within one group of product.
 In the following paragraphs, I explain, why I agree with the statement, that is told.
 
 An important aspect of a product is the function, that means, whether the product could work in the way, it is bought for or not. In regarding to that, most advertisements do not underline the function; they replace the main point with other extra facts.Sometimes it is impossible to find out which product is the best or functional. 
 To explaint it in a clear way, let us use an example. A mobil phone is a important part of modern life. If you want to use it only for phoning, than you do not need a camera. But such an additional function can confuse you. But it is important to know, that it could be differed between several countries. 
 
 Another main point is that products with advertisment cost sometimes more money, than similar products without the advertisment. You have to find out, if you need the advertisment. Sometimes it costs less money to buy the advertisment seperat. If you want to have a personal computer, it cost less money, if you buy for example a painting programm seperate than as a part of the personal computer.
 
 As a result of those reasons I agree with the statement. 
 I think you have to find out, what you want to have and for what use you need the product. Also, a comparison between two products or more but of the same kind of product could help you to find out your personal solution. The products can be from different firms.
