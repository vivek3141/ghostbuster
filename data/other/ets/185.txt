The place of car in our daily life is a really controversial topic. But, I think that some elements allow us to think that in twenties years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. 
 First and foremost, pollution has become a real issue and governements all around the world begin to be aware of the danger of the use of cars for our planet. They hence try to implement some policies in order to reduce it or remplace it. The Kyoto agreement encourages for instance to improve common transportation like the tube or buses.  Moreover, to my mind, it's only the first step and in the next years, these policies will be more numerous and more efficient. In addition, our societies acknowledge that the use of the car triggers a lack of physical exercise and some problems like obesity. Walking now is becoming a popular way to move.
 Furthemore, technologies and communications allow us now to do a lot of thing without leaving our home. For instance, you can go and do our shopping on the Internet. And it's just a beginning. A lot of new possibilities will appear in the next few years. Some people nowadays still work at home. They hence don't have to use their car to go to work and it's actually the main purpose of the car in our societies. These new kind of workers will develop as well and so cars won't be used in the same number and in the same way as today.
 	By way of conclusion, i would like to say that i really back up this idea that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today thanks to  the awareness of their pollution and the progress of technologies .
