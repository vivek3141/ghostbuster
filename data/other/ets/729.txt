I agree with the statement. Because I think young people can do many things than older people. 
 For example, one of my experience.It was when I went to India.
 In India, we need a lot of power to walk, wating for vehicles, and so on. There are no official standard of the costs, so we always have to  discuss with the drivers or selles. I felt they ware very stressful. Because of these reasons, I think they need a lot of physical power.  
 It is pretty difficult for older people to travel to India.It is a special case,but I think it is adjust not  only in India, most of other countries.
 second, last year my father broke his leg and he became not to be able to run fast. He has many hobbies ,like golf , climbing mountains, and playing sports and so on. But now he can not almost of them.
 The doctor said to him that the reason he broke his leg is that he moved too much despite of his age. These days, he always says to me that I had better do various things while you are young.Now,he cant.
 Of course, there are some things older people can do too. But while,there are a lot of things they can not do either. And they are going to increase. 
 Because of  these reason, I agree with the statement.
