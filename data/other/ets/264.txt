In modren society, travelling bacomes a atracktive entertainment for people. People like travelling around for relaxing. Some people hold the opinion that the best way to travel is travelling around by themselves. Personaly, i prefer to travel in a group led by a guide. My reasons are listed as fellowed.
 
 First of all, trevelling in a group can offer a oppertunity of making new friends. Suppose when i am travelling in a group, i have the chance to meet a whole group of people. By communicating with others, i believe i can have a group of friends soon. Take myself as an example, in the last trip to Japan when i was still studying in high school, I met several persons who were also studying in my school and we never met each other. We became froends soon and keep in touch with each other even until now. If i went travelling by myself that time, i would miss several good friends.
 
 In addition, travelling in a group led by a tour guild help me save much more time than travelling alone. When i get to a new city, the first and the most improtant  thing for me is to go to the most popular place in the city. If i am travelling alone, i am sure it is difficult for me to even just figure out where is the place located. Furthmore, travelling with a group of people can recive many helps in case i am in trouble. For emample, my trip to Europe about four years ago. In that trip i insist going out alone, the result is i got lost. The problem is i did not speak English that time. Few hours after i supposed be back, all of the people in my group went out to look for me and got me back at last. 
 
 Each coin has tow sides, travelling alone may also have some adventages such as: saving money, having the freedom to go everywhere i want. However, travelling in a group can not only make friends by giving or reciving helps but also save time. Compare to the advantage i mentioned above, i agree with the statement.
