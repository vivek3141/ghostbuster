Taking risks and getting to know the unknown is an important part of beeing able to move forward and experiencing new things, which is why I strongly agree with the statement.
 Where would the humen race be if our ancesters wouldn't have taken risks? The curage to do something new unexperienced or unknown allows development. If Columbus wouldn't have taken a risk no one would know about Amerika. Many of our scientific achievements are the resulsts of taken risk. If no one would have tried to fly (at the beginning with some strange looking machines) and with that would have taken the risk of breaking an arm or a leg we would still travel with ships (if we are willing to take the risk of sinking). Persons who took a risk are those who are standing in our books and those who achived something in life and for the humen race.
 But lets just look at a more personal level. If we are willing to take risks we are also open for new experiences. If a person is willing to get to know different cultures and views and is leaving her/his comfort zone, that person will learn something beneficiall to her/his life.
 I would say that taking risks is one of my basic humen need. My  life should be excieting and full of experiences, until now I have always been more sucessfull with that additude than those people not willing to take risks. Sometimes I maybe burned myself but the things I leared from those negative experiences is something nothing else would have been able to give me. How is a person able to get life experience or to become wiser with age if that person is not taking risks? It is not at all admirable if someone is only doing the things he knows how to do, to some extend it es even sad.
