There are some people think that understanding ideas and concepts are improtant, you can use the ideas of concepts to relate the other things, but I disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. In my opinion , to learn facts are more important in our life. 
 First of all, Learning facts can make better dicisions in our life. Sometimes , ideas or concepts are just keypoints, we can gain some information from them , but we can not make good dicisions because of them. For example, when we decide to choose a career , we should defintely know what it is , what you will do .If you just know the concept , you may be confused, you can not seperate what is economic , what is finance, what is accounting. Therefore, learn facts are more important and more useful in our life. 
 In additional,Learning facts can make us get high grade in the school. As our experiences, we are usually confused about detail questions in the test, sometimes  we can not seperate the simlilar concepts, This is becuse we just undetstand ideas and concepts, we do not actually understand facts.In the studying , if we can go futher after we studied concepts, i think we can get  high grade and more easily finish the test. 
 In our life, sometimes we always just undertand ideas and concepts of the thing, we easily think it is enough, but in some case, becuse of our poor knowledge, we will feel bad and we will lose some chance, so if we have time , we should learn something deeply, at that time ,you turely get that things.
