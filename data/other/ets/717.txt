''The world is a stage, and we are all players.'' As Shaekespear told, we are the players on this huge stage, who try to enjoy in their short life span. In this case young people are more lucky than older people because they have more life enrgy, and they did not see the bad side of life yet.
 
 My first reason is that the vivid energy of young people is higher than older people, for they have less responsibility.  The older people have to sustain their life themselves, and sometimes they have to look after the youngs. For example, older people have to work and gain money in order to get their basic life needs such as eating or housing. However, the young people do not have to gain money. They can get from their parents what they need. So, young people can use their all energy to enjoy the life, and they are more happy than older.  
 
 Furthermore, the young people do not have more experience than the older people, including the bad ones. The older people made mistakes in their past, and are afraid to do those mistakes again in their future. While they are preventing themselves from bad events, they miss the enjoyable things on world. On the other hand, the young people, who have less experience can move further steps in the enjoyful life, for they are not afraid doing the wrong thing. They even do not know what is wrong.  While old people are being stuck in their bad experiences, younger people live in the sunny side of the world.
 
 To sum up, being a young person I can say that the young people enjoy life more than older people do, because we are loaded with more energy to use for being happy, and we did not see yet the realities which makes people unhappy.
