I agree that it is very essential for students to understand ideas and concepts.
 There is a saying that if you give a man a fish to eat he will eat only for one day ,but if you teach him how to fish he will have food to eat for the rest of his life. The same principle applies here : If a students merely memorises or learns the facts without understanding the reason behind it he will have to keep going back and reviewing over and over again to remember the material  , but if he understands the reasoning behind it ,he will never forget it. 
 Let me explain my reasoning using an example from physiology.
 In physiology we learn that the Sodium potassium pump is very essential for the functioning of the body.  The sodium is present outside the cell and the potassium is inside the cell. exchange of these ions occurs with the help of the sodium -potassium ATPase pump. sodium can come in and  out of the cell through the voltage gated channels but potassium does not need these channels.It has ungated channels. It leaks out of the cell  constantly. If  this pump is disrupted due to injury ,sodium gets trapped inside of the cell and this causes the swelling of the cell. this is what we see when a person is injured ,or when they have  a heart attack or when they have a stroke. If the student doesn't understand the simple mechanism of this pump ,he will keep learning about swelling in different areas of the body without being able to link it to one small process and keep learning the same thing over and over again without making a connection and wasting his valuable time .
 Therefore ,I  believe that every student should first be able to understand the concepts before they proceed to study something new. Most of the  new stuff  We learn is an old idea  in a new package with a different fancy name.
