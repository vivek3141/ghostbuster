People have different opinions on whether it is more important for students to understand idea or to learn facts. I strongly believe that it is more important for students to understand problem than it is for them to learn facts. First, students should learn accuratly about  idea. Second, deep problems are required  understand to solve idea. Let me explain in detail.

 not solve. That's because why I think more to understand idea than to learn facts.
