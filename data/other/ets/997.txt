I would agree with the following statement that " It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject ".If we learn many academic subjects it increases our knowledge by having a good command on all subjects. There are many myriad reasons to support the above statement.
 If many academic subjects are studied then we can gather more information about any subject and we can be brave ourselves in facing any problems or questions regarding a particular subject if asked by anyone. Good researches can be done on any subject by picking one subject from different academic subjects what we have learnt. If any topic is concerned to some other subject what we have learnt then we can have an idea.The main reason of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that we can settle in any of the fields i.e in a good job related to the subjects what we have learnt.
 If a person specializes in only one subject then he can become expert only in that particular subject and has poor knowledge if the questions are asked apart from his subject. So in this world day by day the knowledge is increasing a lot so the people should also have keen interest in increasing their knowlegde to the peak level.Otherwise they can't compete with the students now a days.
 Each and every student should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects to settle in their life.It is considered as important part to the student life by  not sticking to only on subject and becoming expert in that one and only one subject. Having  broad knowledge to discover many things in many subjects adds success to our life like the way scientists do.So good knowledge in different subjects leads to good maturity among different subjects.In this way i agree to the statement to have broad knowledge and not to specialize in only one specific subject.
