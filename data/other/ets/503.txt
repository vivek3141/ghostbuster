Im fully agree with The young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.
 It's true because most of young people is so busy to helping out their communities rather than adult people , specially in korea , they actually live with many complicated thing for instance schools,and after school they most go to the campus,and study,they should go to the college at all.
 I think they don't even have their private time to spend.
 But the valius ways, of course they have to concern with it, that may belongs to education .
 Their definitly busy, but if in their heart ,if theres a little concern with communities, they 'll help communities by themselves.
 however the young peoples of this century is not that nice actually.
 its up to themselves but ; in my experience, they used to think about their friends and what they like to do.I meant,its just like an child who don't concern the future.
 For develpmental of good things is up to how do they think about it.
 of course somes tends to negative but somes are not.
 and Im not sure few people would like to dedicate their goods for the community. thus , this problem will be better as much as inhavitants mind  are grow. 
 however, most of young people wouldn't like to do something for the community,is the truth ,but I hope it will be better.
