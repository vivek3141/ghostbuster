Most students think that it is more important for them to understand ideas and concepts in order to allow them to use them again in their future life. On the other hand, others think that it is more important for them to learn facts because history is made of facts, and facts are the results of the use of such ideas or concepts. However, in the final analysis, I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
 
 First of all, the fact to understand ideas and concepts is the most important requirement that teachers ask their students to do. For example, after a class, every student will have taken notes on the main facts of the lecture and would be able to learn them back home; but only a few could say that they understood all the ideas and concepts of the lecture. 
 
 Moreover, there is a difference between understand and learn. If almost everybody is able to learn some facts, such as dates, everybody is not able to understand ideas and concepts, and replace them in a context or  apply in other cases and situations.
 
 Last but not least, people that have understood ideas and concepts have the possibility to apply them. If we consider that facts are the results or the consequences of the involvement of someone's ideas, you can deduce that the most important is to remember the way to achieve this result.
 
 To conclude, I am firmly conviced that the most important for students is to learn how to think through the understanding of ideas and concepts rather than learn
