The given statement  states that "It is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject.Probably i dont  agree with the statement given because of many reasons .
 As it is said that it is better to have broad knowledge about many subjects rather than one it may applicable only at lower education levels. Where it is easy to read many subjects with not so  prolonged issues but just a overlook about the subject and get a vague idea about the topics which are required and used in our daytoday life such physics ,english,mathematics. But as we go for higher education we probably prefer a single subject that  we are intrested in and make specialization.So i specify my view that it is essential that at which point of time we are taking the important decision of studying our graduation or post graduation at that times only the prescribed subject is required to do specialization.
 I can support my view by giving some important points.The points are, if want to study all the academic subjects at greater level of education then it is very tough because for a given academic time we may not get the information of all the subject in detail.And some times we may not be intrested in some of the academic subjects and we may neglect those subjects and get a lower grade which may not be correct for a proper education.And the next reason is that  doing a specialization patrticularly mean  when we are taking in particular subject and do research about the topic then we say that we have done specilization in that particular subject.we cant say that we have done specialization in all the subjects which is practically not piossible because man is not perfect and he cant gain  such a great knowledge at a time.Basically we select our subject according to our carrer objective so we rather prefer to gain knowledge about that particular subject and do specialization on only that topic ,so if we go for all the subjects according to the student tendency we usally neglect some of the topics.
 Finally i would say that the given statement may be applicable only at lower education levels,but for the higher levels it would be better if we do specialization only in one subject rather  than all the academic subjects.Getting broader knowledge not only means that studying many topics but to have perfection about them which may not be posible for a greater extent.This gaining of broder knowledge may be only for some time finally we have to be perfect in one.
