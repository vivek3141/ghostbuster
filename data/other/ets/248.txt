Youth are the pillars of the future society.Therefore I believe that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities.Young people have a huge amount of zeal and excitement in them to carry out new things.Their accomplishments in whatever they do means a lot to them.
 I truly believe that our firm future is based on how our present and past is moulded.Therefore young people need to be moulded in a proper sense to help the community.This responsibilty is today taken up by the parents and teachers.For instance,youth in the school and across campus are exposed to campaigns such as the AIDS awareness campaign,education campaign etc.These young people go around cities and slums explaining people about how to prevent oneself from a dreaded disease like AIDS.They also go about in the remote villages and explain people the importance of education and how it would help in the progress of their village.
 The youth are the individuals who in today's world have and show some compassion and mercy towards the poor and old.I would like to explain an incident which took place on a street.This street was heavily crowded and there was a man walking past the road.He was very pale and old.Suddenly an autorickshaw driver knocked him down and escaped very quickly.The man was lying on the road bleeding heavily.No one came forward to his help.A group of college students walking by noticed this and came to help this man out.They took him to a hospital and even paid for all the expenses.
 Nowadays,it been observed that in many activities of the society, the youth have an active participation.For example,in the Diwali and Ganesh Chaturthi festivals in India celebrated with a great pomp and joy,the youth are the ones who volunteer for such festivals,right from managing the crowd to the idols immersing rituals.
 The youth, nowadays, are jammed between their busy studying schedules and their extra activities towards society.But the colleges and universities see to it that community service also forms a part of their schedule.Thus,being the bright future, I firmly believe that youth are actively involved in community welfare.
