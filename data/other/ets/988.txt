There are people in the world that prefer doing what they have already know how to do well.
 Fortunately,  there are also people that prefer trying new things and taking risks.
 This second type of people is, in my opinion, the example of who is a succesfull person.
 A person, that bases his work only on  doing what he has already know how to do welll, has few probability to emerge in his field.
 This kind of person, without personal ideas to improve better his works or his like, has no possibility to be a succesfull person.
 For istance, a worker that hasn't ideas to improve his situation, has no possibility to become an executive.
 On the other hand, if an employe has innovative ideas for doing better his work, it is possible that he will became an executive ora chief worker.
 So to became a succesfull person is necessary to have new ideas and try new things, but is not at all.
 There is an other thing to condider, the luck!
 Try new things leads to take risks. The luck is in important component of the risk.
 In general, if a person has innovative ideas and takes risk, he or she has very good probability to become a succesful person.
 If a person has innovative ideas and takes risks, but doesn't become an executive or a chief worker, I presume he is very unlucky!!!
 In my opinion, this person, however, is better than a man who doesn' take any risk in his life, a  man that doesn't live fully.
