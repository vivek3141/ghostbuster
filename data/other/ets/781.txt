The author asserts that the young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.I disagree  with this statement .As the many young people are truly devoted towards their communities.
 
 The green is the color of youth.It reflects immaturity,innocentness.
 They are the effluent sources of energy and enthusiasm.Any of the cultural ,is incomplete without the presence of the youth.The most famous paradigm of a juvenile is the outstanding BillGates.He has not only turn the world by introducing the Microsoft,but also has shown a path towards an unprecedented software boon.He is the one of the richest person in this world.He has helped his community by yearly donating millions of dollar for the benefits of the disabled and orphan student.There are astronomical numbers of people who are young and who have contributed to thier society.Like the famous Sameer Bhatiya,he brought the revolution  inn our communication technology by introducing the use of Emails.
 
 Secondly the participation of younger generation in a countries politics for the betterment of the society can't be overruled.Most of the young people seek oppourtunities to stand in election.Moreover the partcipation of the youth in cases of the crises can't be understated.Whether one consider the day of the most dangerous event of falling of the twin tower or it be the case of London bombblasts.The youth had serve very well at these times of crises by risking their own life.
 
 Thridly if you look at the statistics of number of scientists and engineers,one can markedly see that youth is fully devoted to its communities with the help of their individual fields.Every year the number of people going to the space involve the majority as youth. The most widespread fieds of biotechnology and neurology have their most of the aspirants as youngsters.
 
 Often young people are miss understood for not working for thier communities.People think that today's youth is more involved in self enjoyment.It is sometimes stated responsible for the dangerous ails in th society.Like the increasing Aids,more an more consumption of alcholism.But the scenario is other way round.he youth has nowdays became more responsible for himselfs,for hie parents and for his communitee.
