As the popular saying goes "Jack of all trades and is master of none".Though the saying indicates that little knowlege in all is not helpfull .But in practice like in acedamics ,to find onces area of interest it is essential to get exposed to various subjects.Therefore ,   the basic knowledge about a variety of areas and in depth knowledege on a subject of primary interest is the right blend for any student.

 Another need for learning many different subjects is because each of them provide a different skill set .For example ,a painting class is not only about colors and strokes but helps develope imagination and creativity in students ,which will be helpfull in the long run .Similarly other subjects like mathematics enhances the analytical skills which are useful to even a biology student in analysing results of experiments etc.
 But Basics only are not usfull ,student should also focus on one subject especiall in later part of his career like graduation and specialise in it .
 Therfore learning of many subjects is very benifcial for students along with persuing in-depth study in a
