I agree with this statement because I think that nowaday for the global market is more important to sell the product and take profits than control it. Infact most advertisements make products seem much better than they are. For instance if we notice an advertisement about a car, we may see that the advertisement presents the car how "the best car you'll never drive" and this cause that the constumer wants this car. I think that this selling method is wrong, because the advertisement should represents the product for what it is and not for what it seems to be. In my opinion is a kind of manipulation of the mind of the costumer because the costumer, on the basis of which the company communicates on the advertisements,  trusts the company that sell the product.
 On the other hand, costumers should not completely trust on what is comunicate by the advertisements because, as they should know, it is not the truth.
 However, I think that the costumers that watch an advertisement should take the essential infomations on what is the product and do not take informations on the characteristics of the product because most likely they are wrong or not respected by the advertisement.
