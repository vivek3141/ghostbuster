I disagree with the statement. From my point of view, i think it is more important for students to learn the facts rather than understanding ideas and concepts. My reasons my go as the follows.
 
 Starting off with the disadvantages for learning the concept, student will have a hardship to get invoulved in the society. Although a student can be armed with lots of knowledge or deep thought, it is still unable for them to aknowledge the sofiscated society with out learning the facts. For instance, a graguade student form a well known university, it is still quite diffcult for him to find a job without any experiences. That is why universities offer many co-op programs for the students. 
 
 Another point i would like to share is that learning facts can help the students with understand the ideas and principles. A perfect example for this will be the experiments in school. Many schools spend thousands of money to improve the lab facilities for student. That means students should not only learn the principles but they need to know how does the thing function in reality as well. Practise makes progress.
 
 In addition, learning the fact can help the students in handling the problems. This point happens alot on the soccer field. As well know, every team has their own plan for the game. However, things can be changed suddenly in the field. By the time the plan does not work, the players on the field have to make changes to slove the problem. And there it shows the valueable of the experienced players. They encountered this kind of facts before, so they are quite good at it. 
 
 To conclude, learning the fact is more important for the students because the several reasons listed above .
