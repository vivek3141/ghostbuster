Advertisements, the word that because it I start to be crazy. Everywhere, everytime you will see or hear an ad. Because the many times that you had saw it or heared it you start to lose thier truth. With the incresing in tchnology you are surround with ads from every where while you at the home, while you in the car, while you using the cell phone or the intrernet, and know while you using the puplic bathroom!!. 
 I belive that the ads some times let me buy a product but when thay start to show again and again, I start not to trust on the product.In tha past, the ads used to tell the people about new products and that's it. But know the show the same prduct but with an offer. This thing create a question, why they make an offer if thier product is succefel. I heared a say that said" If your product cost 500 you should spend 1,000 for an ad" did you see the multbly of the number. 
 In this day the ways that the company use to create an ad is so crasy. Like Nike, they spend more than 1,000,000,000 in thier ads. I do not mean that thier products are not good but I mean thy shoult trust thierself. athoer example Hyandai when they made thier cars with BMW cars. Or other company whene thay pay for a star to make an ad for them, and with this all the people who love this star will do what s/he did. 
 It is seem cleare that the compnies start losing there customer because the hard work they do it to present thier product. and I think if they pay all this mone to improner the producte will be abetter than to spend it in ads.
