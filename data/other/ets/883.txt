Advertisements will do anything to grab your attention. Whether it be a commercial on television, a page in the magazine, or a billboard. Make up, food, clothing, or any other product that seems appealing to people these days, are always advertised much better than they truly are. 
 It's always exciting for women to see the gorgeous eyelashes in the magazines from a certain mascara. It looks long and thick in the magazines, but once you buy it, it looks nothing like what you saw. Being angry and throwing the mascara away won't help. That's just the way advertisements are. They are made to attract people and made for people to buy what they are trying to advertise. Or else, what's the point? Why would an advertisement be about something to make people sick to the stomach? (Unless it was about not doing drugs and showing a picture of what it could do to you.) 
 I remember when I was in second grade and I was walking through a store and I came upon this barbie convertible. The box had a picture with Barbie and Ken in it, and I thought wow how great! A convertible with Ken AND Barbie in it for only 20 dollars?! However, when I got home and opened it, I realized that it was only the convertible. Little did I know, the advertisement on the box had in tiny words "Barbie and Ken not included." Even if it has the words in tiny letters on the side, the advertisement is still tricking you and having your mind not even think twice about reading the box or paying attention and just buying it. If the picture on the box only had a convertible, it would look dull and unappealing to most, and therefore they wouldn't earn any money. 
 The commercial industry always has to make a product look better than it really is. Even when it comes to pens, they have to make it look like the coolest pen in the world. The smallest products in the world are advertised to look better than they really are, and it's all for business, and money.
