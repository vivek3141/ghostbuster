As far as individual is concerned,i agree with the statement that the cars will be fewer in use in twenty years than today.There are bounch of reasons can voice my support in the following passage.
 
 First of all,we have got a terrible traffic system in today.we used  to waste many precious time be stuck in the traffic jams in everything morning and evening.Fortunately,the govenment already began do something to slove this problem,so i believe the situation will be better in tweety years with the govenment's politics and the slogans than today.
 
 To the second factor is that the cars will be fewer because of the development of public transportation.In comtemprary society,many people prefered choose public transportation cause the high oil payment and other pressures.In many city of China,subway already being the most convenient transport tool in citizen's heart.
 
 The last but not least, along the growth of tenology in twenty years,maybe many inventors already invent some transport tool that may more better than automobile,especially is no more pollution to our living envioronment.As we all known,our planet already been polluted by human beings since the first industrail revolution. we only have unique earth,so we should try our best to protect it.
 
 Believe it or not,no matter what reasons cause,the cars will be fewer than today.Maybe because people  found that a better environment is more inportant that cars.
