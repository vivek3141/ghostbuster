I strongly disagree with this statement which says that, "Most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are." There are some some reasons so that i disagree with it. The main reason is, it is law that,you have to tell everything whether it is prons or cons of the product to customer.
 As I talked about the law, it is the responsibility of the employer to give the right information to the customer. If they break the law and not give the right information about the product, and hide something (defects) to customer, customer can sue on it. If it proof in the court, they lose their licence permanently. Another reason is that they lose the people's trust and it will be more important for them. So they never cheat the people whether it is advertisement or somthing else. By advertise wrong information, they make a big mistake and may be they lose thier buisness too.
 Taking a good example of any electronics company, which produced different types of electronic equipments. Suppose company advertise the computer systems. If they don't mention the limitations with its advantages, and someone buy that computer without knowing its limitation then company has to take back, if customer not satisfied with it. Sometimes some companies do these kinds of mistakes but it is out of law. So every company advertise their product without giving any false information, and this way customer make trust on the company, and they sell more and more products, and make big profit.
