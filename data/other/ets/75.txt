I disagree to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.There are several reasons.
 First, I want to many free time to travel, but tour is not enough to take free time. Usuraly, go to somewhere together group members. I cannot  free walk and look interested in something. 
 Secound, I like go to unknown place. So, I want to way of meself look for new place, foods, hotel, and any more.
 Finally, I think maybe no guide to travel is occur to something trables, but these trables later good memoris. Memory is important to travel.
 There are my opinion that is not to the best way to travel together a tour guide.
