In my opinon there is no questioon that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there  are today.There are really many reasons why i belive this but in these essay i will limit my self to mention two,the first consernes the far distance that people have to acheve to go to there work or some where else ,the second has to do with the incresing number of people in the world.
 The first concernes the big distance that every person has to acheve to go to his or her work that is the conciconce of big cities and also  there are some people how live in a city and travel to anthor city to work.Also there is another cause of this incresing number of cars during next twenty years that is the oportinity the to take credit from  banks as easier as you can that help people to must to solve ther finanshual problem.
 The second has to do with the incrising number of people around the world that they need more cars to move from place to place easily beause they have so many  work or appointement that they  need to deail with and achevie in a  sorter time.Also i think in twenty years every one would have more than one cars and maybe teneegers will have it.
 In bref cars is an main of entertement that is now nessesery for every one and i tkink it would be more in the next few years because of the devlopment of every things and it would be more neede to do what you are eccepected to do.I tink increasing of number of cars  would cause some dangerours proplems like devert type of pollutuion;there is pollution of soinds and gaz and also that can incerse the number of road  accidents when it will be more uses of cars
