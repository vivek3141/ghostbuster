I am agree with the statement that says that succeccful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.
 In my personal oppinion, I think that taking risks and trying new things we can have more exit in our lives. 
 If we do not know how to do something, we have to take the risk to learn to do that thing taht we do not know. Maybe it will not be easy but it cold help us to grew up as a person and can help us to have exit.
 People who do not want to have exit in their lives always do the same thing all their lives. That wold be really boring and sad.
 As human beings we have to have something to encourage us to be a better person. That something could be to try new things.
 Doing new things we can open the door to reach the exit in our lives wich thet is what everybody wants; also can endevelope the different skills that we have and we could realize our value as human beings.
 To have exit in our lives can help us to find the happines that we have been looked for all our entired life and can help us to share that happines with the persons that we love, and also can encourage to others to follow and reach their dreams and to be successful people.
 The commun idea that we have as human beings of a succeccful person may be not the correct, most of people think that a person who has exit in his or her life has to be bad or corrupt but, no, everbody in this life can have exit if we want, the only thing that we have to do is take risks and try new things in our lives and of cours we have to have the desire to do it.
