I agree with the above statement , as students these days are more focusing on ideas and concepts rather than on facts.
 
 I go with it because to learn anything you need to understand the ideas and concept it is because facts are known by everyone but its upto students to understand concepts. 
 
 I want to give an clear example to support it as we are in the development side its important to know about computers. Because they are as important and necessary tool in todays world people know about it evidently but you need to understand the ideas and concepts behind it. Everyone knows about its facts it only not required to operate it we need to know the ideas behind it .so, it more important to the students to know what lies beneath.
 
 I also suggest students to know facts but rarther these wont fulfill the requirements.students must know about idea and concept because is helps him to gather more knowledge and can easily operate them in an proper way.simply understanding ideas wont help them as because they need to implement them in practical to get the perfect use of it .As in many cases students are not eager to know the ideas and conepts they tend to face huge complexities in life, like in any product we need to understand its ideas by mainly implementing them.
 
 we can make people know about ideas and concepts they need separate classes to know them. likewise i give another example people tend to believe on facts which are given or described in ancient times the stories from past didn't had proper idea behind them they simply know the fact and doesn't show interest on ideas behind them. like the stories,myths,the stories of Legends they don't require any idea it's just a fact we need to accept.
 
 In the later part of the conclusion i want to give my opinion that students pay more attention on ideas and concepts than it is them to learn about facts.
