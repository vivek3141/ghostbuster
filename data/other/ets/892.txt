In todays modern life every individual wants to understand and capability to estimate the ideas and concepts of the other person.By which he improvises his ideas and overcome withbetterideas than the other person.So I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. I would like to support this statement for following reasons.
 First, By understanding the ideas and concepts we get the clear image on the aspect.For example if we are studying a particular subject. In that subject it is impportant for us to identify the main idea of the topic and the concept involved in that particular topic. By simply learning the subject without understanding the concepts then it will be mystery for us that subject even if we spend lot of time on that.
 second,By understanding the ideas and concepts we are able to know how to live in the society.That means we are capable how to deal with the problems and our colliques.For example if we want to ride a car, we must first understand the ideas and concepts that means  how to start the car ,how to accelerate ,how to move an gears.By understanding all these and thes if we practice then it will be easy for to ride the car,not only just learning helps us.
 Third, when we find out with new softwares or subjects, it will be better for u sif we have understand the main idea and waht are the improvements ovewr previous one then these softwartes will be useful fo us.
 Consequently the conclusion is that we must learn facts and we must also understand the ideas and concepts what we learn then only it will be useful for us. Simply learning will not help us
