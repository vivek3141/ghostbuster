I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. There are a several reasons to support my opinnion. 
 Firstly, in twenty years some of the developing countries will become economically stable. When that happens, a number of  citizens in that  country will be able to buy new cars. For example, China is one of the countries. Now, it is becoming a economically enormous country and a lot of people are now purchasing new cars. 
 Secondly, in a lot of western countries like America or Canada, except for large cities its almost impossible to transport without cars. People cannot even go to school without cars. Of course small countries like Japan have a very nice subway and bus system, but not all countries are like that. It also costs a lot of money to make that system and its not top priority in the countries to do this so I think the use of cars will not change or even increase. 
 Thirdly, according to the development in science, the prices of cars will go down. Therefore, the people who could not afford to have cars will be able to buy one and it will be easy for people to buy second, third, or even fourth cars in the family. 
 These days in developed nations, there are concerns about the fact that using cars effect the global warming, and instead of everybody using cars, public transportation is being considered. However, there has been a lot of research on cars that prevent pollutions. Toyota's "Prius" is an example. 
 In conclusion, I think that there will be more cars in use than there are today.
