as we all agree the revolution  of the cars was a great event and no one can deny this fact.
 
 lets have alook around in all cities and streets of the word to see th ehuge no. of vechiles are used by humans not only as a method of transportation but for lot of other purposes.
 
 i do agree with the fact that within the coming twenty years the number of cars used will be lessser, and i can link this decrease in the number of cars to the following reasons:
 
 1- as we know that cars moves depending on fule (petrol) and we know very clearly that the word source of fule is decraesing also which will lead to the highly increase of oil, and that will lead to a high increase on the cost of cars and as we know that world income and people income can not afford it, and it will be much more cheaper for exaple to use a picycle or train for example.
 
 2- there is lot of polution comes out of the cars and this polution have it is effect on people health as well as the whole environment around, and scientists working really hard to find more safer solutions  .
 
 3- the whole word is growing and people now adays are  facing lot of traffic and parking areas which make there life taugher, and as i red in one reasearsh that traffic now is a main reason for haert attack among young people.
 
 4- the most important thing about cars that they are a safe avaialable method for individuals only and we can not traet it as a group method of tarsportation .
 
 5- people awarnnes of how protect and    improve thier health is increasing and for example i think people will start moving with in the same city walking instaed of using thier cars, which is safer.healthier and less headache
