In my country there is a famous sentense that says, if you know  the reality today it will be easy to know the history, for this reason I thik is important to understand ideas and concepts, but to learn fact also is usefull.
 
 First, if the students learn ideas, they are capable of practicing their knowledge to some examples or facts in the real life, I remember that when I was studing history I undestood the concept of revolution but only when my teacher gave me some examples I could understand the real meaning, and after it is easy for me to developesome ideas about the Industrial Revolution, or socials revolutions.  I was learn also different thecniques in maths for facts .
 
 In addition, there are some efficient methods to teach, for example if the teacher give in clase un concept , after the student should make as a homework un example associated with this concept , and I am sure the students are not going to forget this word. As a student the most important thing is do not learn subjects with my memory because these kind of learnig is easy to forget.
 
 Second, when the students to learn facts they can associate some causes or consequences and make conclusions, but to conclude it is not possible only if the student have only ideas and concepts. Education has made important advance in this area and in the actual word , intelligent person is who can applie the knowledge or the theories in the real life. It will be usefull learn concepts and facts at the same time and inmediatly to practice above real examples in a company or a school
 
 In conclusion  ti undestand ideas and concepts and too learn facts both are essential.However I think it is necessary for students to have ideas and concept clear because these are the base to developed some interesting new project or knowledge, thus If have have to choose over these point as most important I would choose to understand the ideas as first step.
