Most of the products look better in the advertisements, but not all. Why? that depends on the target market that the company or the producer decide for the product.
 
 For example, when you see the Mc Donald's advertisements, they show you a big and tasty burger, but when you go there and buy it, you realize that this burger is smaller and not that well presented as the one you saw on TV.  In the other hand, when you see a Rolex's or Cartier's ad, you see exactly the watch or the product they are selling to you. Then, when you go to the store, you see the exact same clock or product that they showed you.
 
 When people that watched the Mc Donald's ad on TV are hungry, their mind can automatically tell them that the burger they saw is a good option for lunch. But when people is thinking to buy a Rolex watch they want it to be elegant. If they go to the store and they see that the watch of the adverisement is different from the one in the store, they won't buy it.
