In this essay I shall argument whether succesfull people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well.
 Looking at myself I would prefer a mixture of what I know and have experienced in the past as well as new and risky moves in order to be successful.
 
 At the one side I support the idea of trying out new things, daring the new and wanting to experience the unknown. It may led to unconventional and brilliant solutions. People that are already successful or wanting to reach that state have to go unknown paths more that others in order to maintain a successful and professional status. In my point of view this might explain all the wonderful and sometimes awkward technologies that were invented in the past. If Mr. Bill Gates would have never ever dared to dream of the opportunities a computuer would open for mankind, who knows where we would be now?
 
 On the other side who tells a person whether a new way and  risk will led to the goal one is hoping for? What if a plan comes out as a draw back and the solution is far off of what was hoped for. Being not familiar with a situation or not knowing how a thing will turn out, needless to say that great dangers could be involved, might awake precaution.
 
 Of what I experienced in the past I can state that I was mostly off best when I looked back on what I experienced so far and listened to advices I got from dear people. Starting off from there I was still able to include some new and unconvetional methods in order to reach my goal. Still I think that things a person can rely on are the best basis to get other things started.
 To make a long story short a combination of new and old would be my best bet for a successful way of working and living. And who knows- there might be something new to discover with that as well.
