In my opinion I think it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects instead ofspecializing in one specific subject. 
 I believe it is not so easy to specialize jonly in one thing because there will be always something you will not be able to know. Suppose you are a person who has been always interested in one thing during his life: people would expect him to have always the right answer at the right time. But what happens if the person does not know the answer?People will be disappointed and will consider the person not so well prepared as they thoughtbecause is not even able to answer to what he has to know. Several often it is easier to criticise instead of asking ourselves why the "specialist" could not answer the question. It is also important to consider that the specialist will be disappointed too because he could not demostrate he is a real specialist. He may start doubting about himself and he maybe give up about what he is doing.
 In order to avoid this embarassing situation, you may prefer to have a broad knowledge about several and different subjects. I think there are two reasons for it. 
 First of all, you can improve your cultural background and you will always be able to understand most of the topics people may discuss. The other thing is that people will come to you asking some help. if you can help them, you will impress them and they will realize you are a person with a good education; if you cannot help them, they will understand you because they know you are not a specialist and you are not supposed to know everything.
