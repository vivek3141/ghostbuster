I do not agree with the statement. The reasons are three which are written below.
 First reason of disagreement is not to be able to choose places where I visit. Places where we want to visit might be different by each person. However, we have to dicide one place if we are led by a tour guide and travel as a group. In addition, a tour guide explain about someting I am not interested in at all. I want to travel wherever I want and I want know that I really interested in. I can ask to people who are familiar with the places instead of a tour guide.
 Second reason is responsibility. In a group we have reasponsibility as a group member. We can not do something selfish and have to follow a tour guide. However I can go aroud freely if I travel by my self. The responsibility is only for me. When I went to Washington D.C., I wanted to visit some ghetto places. We should go out in a group. However I can not take responsibility for my friends if my friends and I go some ghetto places and bad things happen. Therefore I went around by myself.
 Third reason is about time. When we travel in a group led by tour guide, our travel will be scheduled like "6:00 p.m. visit musium" or " 9:00 p.m. eat dinner." However, how much time we want spend will change by each person. 
 Because of those three reasons which are choosing places, responsibility and time. The idea of statemant is not confortable for me and I do not agree with the statement.
