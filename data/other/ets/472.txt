I disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than there are now. 
 
 First of all there was no considerable change in the last twenty years and I think there will not be one in the next twenty. Although there have been going on  some developments that speak for the use of public transport, such as the increasing oil price or the ongoing improvments in public transport, the reasons why people use cars or refuse to take public vehicles will stay the same over the next twenty years.
 
 I think the first and most important reason why a lot of people will not give up their cars is the flexibility it brings. You do not have to care about bus schedules. If you want to go somewhere you simply enter your car and immediately you are on your way.
 
 A further, also very important reason is the independency a car brings. You do not have to worry about how to come to the next train station or what to do if you need to go somewhere in the middle of the night when no public transport is active. Neither you have to care about being late for work as the train is late. You only depent on yourself.
 
 Another fact that supports my theory is that the prices for public transport are still quite expensive. Considering that they have not changes considerably in the last twenty years I do not expect them to get much cheaper in the next twenty years.
 
 Furthermore cars and their efficency are improved continuously, which makes them more and more independent from the oil price.
 
 I think that all the mentioned reasons contribute their part to the theory that in twenty years there will be as many cars in use  as there are today.
