ARE WE HUMAN OR MACHINES?
 
 Society has been developing in many different ways according to human necesseties. This human vision has gone dissapeard.
 Actually we move in a very high stressed world, (obviously, in developed countries), that sometimes does not allow to people to increase their human values and their helping in their communities.
 
 Probably, many years ago, young people did not used to do such things that young people, at this moment do. We had more relathionships each other's and also we had more dependence on the rest of the people. Industrialisation, technical developments, new discovers, independence, competition,stress... have really made changing  the world.
 
 Firstly, parents want to give to their children all they hadn't when they were childs, and in many cases they are making a mistake, and in this way young people can't think in things' values and the cost of them.
 
 Secondly, sometimes children schedule is like a minister schedule. I mean, it seems that they have to full all their time in the whole day, going school, learning music, learning, sports, languages, and many other things that you could imagine. After that, they arrive at home totally exhausted, so they don't have the strong enough to spend another part of their time helping their communities. At least, this is what is happening in medium class family in Spain, the place where I live .
 
 Thirdly, they have a great adversary, TELEVISION!!! Oh my God!! I think it is the principal and horrible nowadays' enemy of our young people, they coul spend all theri time watching it.
 
 Finally, I must say that we coul try to avoid many things and to be more creative with our children, and incentivate them to value human relathionships, only in this way they could probably help their communities.
