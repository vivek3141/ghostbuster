It is impossible to determine weather younger or older people enjoy life more. Youth has wonderfull advantages, inocence, coming of age, naivity. What a  wonderfull surprise to  see something for the first time, to touch the snow, to fall in love, to meet a goal. To realize life, its potential and beauty at an age when one is still vigourous, perfect and with all those futures ahead. Not one future, multiple futures, so many  different paths, options and possibilities. A bounty of choices and a healhy body to fullfill them. The option to choose a life, our life, with  such few strings attached.  To pick up up our things and start againg over and over, to sit down and establish ourselves when ever we want, such are the choices of youth. 
 
 Intoxicating situations abound in our summer yet as fall and winter come around one develops certain joys, odes to the time allready  spent.  Memmories come into play, recolections have a special flavor, those things that we will never do againg and those friends we no longer laugh with. Yet no one can take away those songs you've all ready danced to, age allow us to see our errors and our goals flourish. A successfull buisness can keep us going for many years past the the retirement age, some say its the thing which keeps one alive. While a successfull son can yield beautifull grandaughters, happiness keeps coming yet in different packages. A bittersweet moment when one switches from the driver seat to the passanger seat, from being an actor to being a spectator, from the field to the stands. Yet enjoyment is an everyday activity which no one is deprived of, lets just hope we relize this sooner rather than later.
