From my perspective, I agreed with the following statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reason that people need to advertise their product it's because they want to sell more product and try to increase people's  desire of their product. Moreover, there are lots of differents complemental products are competing against to each others.   However, those products are always look better when they are advertising.
 There are few example that happend to lots of people. Have you ever buy a hamburger after you see the advertise of the hamburger  form media? The producer of the hamburger makes the hamburger looks so big and so delicious while they are advertising. However,   when people actually goes to a shop and buy the same hamberger that they have seen form the media, people would find out that the hamburger looks so smaller than the one they saw form the media. 
 Producers are actually using advertisements to attract people to buy their product.
 In addition, lots of compaines are competing against each others and some companies earnd profits because of they abused the advertisement's power and earn lots of money by those unreal advertisements. For example, Car companies always said  their cars are the best and provide a video tape to show how incradible is the car and how amazing is the car, such as a car can drive really fast on icey floor. However, when people who actually buy the car, they always find out that the video are not realistic and they will find out that the adverties video was lying.
 In conclusion, the reason that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are its because those companies want to earn more money and they also want to show that their product are the best and win the competition between each others in oder to earn lots of profit.
