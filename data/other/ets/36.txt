In this mordern world every person seem to be busy some or the othe way. As the world is to fast people have to compeite with the world. young people are not so instersted in helping the communities
 and not only that they are unable to do that  because of less time they have . As it is said that todays young people are twommorows citizens so they have to take care of the communities.
 Young ones are  the ones who can do something for the society . In earlier days at the time when people should do something for the country along with there studies and the thing that most of the parents should encourage on all and they should make there children more concerned to the communities.
 A small example for this is that  one off my relatives son every day he should have to clean around his house and  see the gardening . And thus he can help the community by keeping it clean. in this way each and evey person should involve in doing so. so that we can develop the country. Every one of us should take part oand conduct survey and seminars so that they can learn how useful they are and then they will get involved.
 Although these is the situation or the process through we can tell the people  but  as time does not go as we say . in earlear days there was less to study and the use to to something but now the world is so fast that they dont have proper time play or help the community.
 Its seems to me as a unisided one i would agee with the topic because time should be managed and made possible to help the community and other thing is that time may be the only criteria . there are some points to disagree the the topic but can be neglected.PRAENTS SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE YOUNG ONCE
