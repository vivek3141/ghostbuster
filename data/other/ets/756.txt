Personaly, I prefer to learn broad knowledge, and I believe that broad knoledge would be helpful for a person anytime. Therefore, I agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specipic subject.
 Of course, I guess other might explain equaly valid for learning one specific subject only. In fact, I am planning to enter the PhD course in a guraduated university. For PhD study, we need specific knowledge and it is better to know specific research area deeply than to know wide area thinly.
 However, even if I consider the above goodness, I believe that it is better for all people to have broad knowledge of many academic subject. Why I believe this is follow:
 First, I think all most all people do not deep knowledge so much. On the contrast, broad knowledge is neccessaly when a person face some troubles which are unfimilire to solve it. Whenever we live, we can not do well if we do not our various knowledge. That means we are children. A Child can not live alone if their parents do not help her or him.
 Second, I believe that it is essential for researcher also to have wide knowledge. For example, when I could not write a research paper well and stoped my idea, I will read books or watch TV. Sometimes I can get useful idea from media. In addition, if I have broad knowledge, I would be able to discuss the problem on research by various aspects. That's why I prefer to learn wide academic subjects.    
 Considering the above all reasons, I agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specipic subject.
