During their all long period of education and graduation, students are learning many things on different topics and are developping many skills. That give them the opportunity to improve some of them.
 Is that more important for a student to understand what he is learning, or just to keep things in mind without any explanations or added value ?
 
 On the one hand, I think that it is essential for a student to understand what is teaching to him for the simple evidence that he will better keep it in mind.
 If we take the exemple of an economic classroom, it will be more efficient for the student to understand the concept of "the liberalism" for instance by understanding the way it works and its features, than just knowing the fact that this is an economical way in opposition to others as "sociaism".
 
 But on the other hand, it sometimes difficult for a student to understand every aspect of an idea or a concept.
 This made the fact that some student are tough in an area and weak in an other one. In this case it would be a better way for the student just to learn his class without any more understanding, just like a robot.
 My personal exemple can be releated through the phylosophy classrooms I had im college. I was defenetly weak on this area and the only profitable way for me to get a not too bad resul at the exam was to learn facts and to prevent myself to write extra-explanations that I did not really understand.
 
 To sum up, I will say that it is of course essential to understand the ideas and concepts given through our schoolar education, but that we are not necessarly aware to all the fields and some are so harder to learn depper in or improve.
 We can introduce here the concept of natural selection which drive people to some fields of studying and some others to opposite areas...
