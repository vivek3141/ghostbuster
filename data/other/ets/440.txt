People who succeed always try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and always doing. The followings are the three reasons that claims the statement.
 First, people need long time to success, the reason that they succeed is that they learn from all their failed and successful experiences. They had try all things. If they met difficulties, they would find another methods, in that case, they know what to do when they met the same problems and prevent from doing the same things again. So they both gain in their meaningful experiences. However, for the people who just doing what they know, for example, nowadays, computers are used in many industries, in the person only know how to drop down the things by writing, they will not be succeed in finding a job or being promoted to the higher position.
 Second, successful people can find new markets and always have new ideas in their minds, for example, in a business market, the one who have many new and attractable ideas will conquered most of the customers' favour,and as a result, their profits will be higher the the one who always doing the same ordinary thing, that is only thinking in one direction.
 Last, the successful people will always take a great step forward than the one who doing the same thing because they learn more than others and as a result, they will have greater improvement and they also attemp to use new things and ideas, because not many people will have the courage to take risks, and if one takes the risk, he win and become a successful person. Compare to the one who always pay safe and do secured things, they are hardly to success.
 There are not many successful people in the world because the one who pay safe do not have the attemps to take the risks, to try their very best and bring their greatest effor to the job.
