Cars are used more and more common in today,especially in China.Obviously using cars brings great conveniernt to life,but I think the whole number of the car will reach the peak in the future and then decrease. In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.
 
 First of all,the car use oil to run,but the amount if oil resource is limited in the earth.The  price of original oil in the international market keep raising.In the future ,the cost of owning a car will be much higher than today,peole will change their way of transport.
 
 Secondly,too many cars cause too many traffic problems.In many big city,traffic jam is nomal.During the day of busy time,people cannot take advantage by using cars,they are blocked in the car by the illusion of the traffic.Maybe one can walk to the the place he want faster than using a car.And while the city be devoloped,the taffic system can be designded more efficiently,people can use more and more cheap and conveniet tools to reach the palce they want not only by cars.Another question is considerable that no matter how modern the city is,the space is limited,,if everyone use a car, the outcome is out of imagination.
 
 Cars product most of the waste gas that polluted the air and make the weather get warmer and warmer.In reccent years ,the average temperature incresed a lot.If we still use so many cars,putting off so many waste gas,one day all of the ice-moutain will turn into water then all of the islands and some part of the continent will sink under water.No one can  measure the lost and how could we find another place for human to live except of the earth?
