I disagree that cars will decrease at society after twenty years. I have three main reasons for this:environmental problems, lacking of space to park cars and reducing fossil fuels.
 First of all, today, cars strongly effect to environment. Thus, the goverment may restrict the use of cars. For example, automobiles emit a lot of carbon dioxide. According to research of Environmental Ministry, 
 Second of all, increasing population, there are no land to park cars. It means that houses for living people will be built priolitily  in free space.
 Finally, fossil fuels for cars may shrink, because the industrial structures, factories, power plants, and so on, are more important for nations.
 For these reasons, I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer automobiles than there are today.
