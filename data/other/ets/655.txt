I am agree with the statement saying, "In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than it is today." The use of cars is in 
 the increasing stage during these days. However, I believe that this condition will completely change during next twenty years.
 
 First reason of reduce in use of car will be pollution of the environment. Car is the main cause of pollution of the earth every year. This fact was most likely ignored by the people during past few years. However, people start to recognize the importance of maintaining good environment condition and try to do their best for it. 
 Other reason that cars will be less used in the future is the globalization. Globalization means that the world is not separating as an individual but conforming as one big community. Therefore, other transportation, which is airplane or ship, to travel oversea will be more used than the car. Car will be just used for the travel within the land or continent. In fact, people even start to use transportaion such as subway or airplane more than the car. 
 
 The final reason that effects the use of the cars is the development of the technology. I personally believe that the development of the technology will soon invent or create new way of transportaion. This new way of transportaion will be much faster than the car and have less harm on the environment. This will make the cars to be not welcomed by the human society anymore.
 
 The changes in the world occurs much faster than the past. In other words, there can be big change in a very short period of time. Therefore, twenty years are definitely not a short time for cars to be in a less use.
