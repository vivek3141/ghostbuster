I agree that most Advertisements  makes products much better than they really are as i buy only the products that are seen ads in tv.
 
 when the product is new to markets they have  to Advertise it .If the product is launches without the ads now one knows what is it and they donot buy either .Advertisements  are given for products and relase into the market atleast people recognises it .It may buy some people and if it is  good they will use regularly .
 
 All the popular brands in the world are  investing the one quarter of their money  in the  adds.This shows how much important  for a product the to be launch.Advertisements  are not the new idea  it has has been practise since the ancient times.In ancient times the ads are  in the form of curved in the stone.
 
 
 To know wheather the product is good one are not only can say after using it only.Eventhough lot of campain done for the products if it is not so worthy the results will be no one afford to buy it .product itself has stuff otherwise no ads can do it promote its sale.For example  my father has buyed Daewoo motors matiz car by seeing the ads later it has lot faults then my father told his colleagues that donot buy that one .The feedback  fot that company is not good .one buys it as aresult it got flopped in India.
 
 Nowadays the Advertisements  is one of the good markests in the world.All the products hire the celebrities to be their brand.Kids influence for it,if thier favourate star ads for  it they will want to buy it.Every field require ads to promote its product for example movies star campains  before the prrmer to promote their movies ,similarly the models are launches to popular brands of car ,inauragation of malls  ets .These create the hype of their product  even such that some of them talk about their  product.Thus it shows that their product reach the people .
 
 Wheather the product is good one are not only can say after using it on.lAll the above reasons shows that one can buy only when they know about the product this can be done by Advertisements.
