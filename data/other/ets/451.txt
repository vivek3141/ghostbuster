I agree with the statement which indeed results in the students future and this is important for the students that understanding ideas and concepts  is more important that it to learn fact .
 
 According to my concern i will say that if a student is perfect  or atleast having the basic idea of what he is intrested then he will be the eligible person to learn the fact, it may be any thing like studying about archietecture or concern about sports and intrest in discoveries or else studying about a computer programming all this type of qualities are need to know about their faults and advantages and when a student is enough to learn then should learn facts on their particular stream .
 
 I agree only if a student is having particular qualities not like a child coming to u and asks u to teach me computer programming it just cannot happen in every situation and when a student without having any concern of playing the gittar and he just want's to give a play on his concern of intrest  than if u allow him it will be a great problem ,similarly many such kind of situations are there which just cannot lead learn facts it should be a step by step process then only he will acheive the concept in his intrest . Other kind of situation which i intend to present in my essay is if some students who are intrested in many thing and will achieve the greater heights are those only who work hard and they learn through step by step process only but the have practiced a lot which inturn produced them to reach victories, it not like that if a child learning the concept of addition in his maths  subject and sudenly when he looked his elder brothers notes and want to intend to solve division concept which is at that movement difficut for a child but when he studies step by step he will be th eliglble person who can achieve facts quickly but not knowing the ideas of the particular subject or view.
 
 So according to me i belive that every student should have particular idea in the field of their willingness without any idea their is nothing  to have a particular learning ,what ever it might be but the student should have some knowlege regarding that
