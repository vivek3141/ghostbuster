Nowadays it is possible  youth is considered selfish as regards as not helping their communities, but I'm not sure it to be completely true.
 As a young person, I understand that young people is receiving much pressure in their formation period, to improve their studies and for getting good jobs. All we want to afford pretty houses, goods and travelling, what implies to spent spare time in courses and studying.
 It's possible I wold have been agree few months ago but I've recently meet some young people very openminded and committed with world concerns. Those persons showed me that there is a big web of facilities for helping in our communities or in a wider areas.
 Truly I cannot compare today's youth with previous ones since I've just lived this period, but I believe there are two main flows of people, possibly more and more separated. Firstly those who have their personal challenge and try to achieve it as fast as they can, and others who include other strange people and social or ecological concerns in their challenges.
 If I'd compare both groups populations, it's sure that personal challenges are predominant. It's logical if we notice that we are living a period of luxury and marketing. But, on the other hand I also think there are many socially committed people with very good and new ideas. I trust in this last group to educate the future next youth and to increase the people who dedicate some of their time in helping to the others.
