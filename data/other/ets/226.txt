Underastanding idieas are far more important than knowing the fact.understanding is the best way to learn said by my teacher.humans developed years together by understanding rather than knowing the fact
 from the early stone age we are understanding the concepts rather than knowing ,for example we came to know about fire, by rubing two stones together thus unerstanding the process of fricton by using stones.we cant simply rely on subject by knowing but for undrstanding it.for example every one knows about law of conservatiopn of energy,a person who understands applied in form of electricity or mechaniocal engine.
 student who got good marks in examination cant become a good enginer or doctor or infact good at his or her career but a person who can apply it to his career can be good.thus application is important for a student which comes with understanding the subject.
 practical understanding of subject is best preferred than simply knowing it ,this the reason why the nowadays the education orl study is based on fieled work rather on simply class room teaching.each and every course of today wether you take a science or art or technology projects and the field works are introduced. concept of understanding not gives us the success in profession but also helps get beter in our subjects which we dont for get for our life long.this doesnt happen in simply knowing.
 a stident  should not  apply this to the study but also to the vaerious aspects ofdaily life.this can better not only a persons 
 life but also his relations with other people thus ultimately his life standerds are also increased.this aspect cannot bew leaerned oput side should be made to lesrned in schooling stage itself.finally understandig makes perfect not only good academecally but also in li.fe
