I definitly agree with the statement of "successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what the already know how to do." In this essay, I am going to state my views h
 In my opion, a successful people are willing to try new things and take risks. First, they will not afraid of failure because trying new things can help them to learn more and braoden their horizons. For example, a successful person, Edison, who invented the light bulb was used to be a normal boy whois good at study. But how come he can be a successful person? It is because he was willing to try new thing - to be an inventor. He took a lot of risks on doing the experiment, but he did not give up, ended up, became a successful people. Despite there maybe a risk, they will still keep on trying new things and take these risks to become a more successful person in the future.
 Second, if a successful people only focus on doing what they already know how to do well, they are not that successful. They maybe successful in this short period only, as there are many other people try new things and to be a more successful people. The successful period of that person is limited by himself, sooner or later, others learn his skills and he will no longer be a successful one.
 To conclude, i think that successful people should keep on trying new things. They should not just keep on doing what they already how to do well, otherwise,  people will not claim you as a successful person, they will tease on you because you think yourself is a successful people and
