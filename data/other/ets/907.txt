In my point of view, people should try for new things rather than doing the old things repetedly. Because sucess full things leads to do many new thing that are use full for man kind .
 
 Peole who are in research field they use to invent new things that are use full for man kind ,for example in the fields of medical and space research. In the medical fields there are so many diseases to be known and they should be cured. For example cancer & aids etc , researchers are doing continious invenctions how to find the new medicans that can cure 100 percent a man. So there should be some new thing to do reaserch that it can be cured in some other way. Comming to the electrical and mechanical things without taking risks,  how people can invent the bulb and rotatory eqipements. so there should be some new things which thing leads to change in history.
 
 But, a part from inventing new things there should be some updations what thay have earlier invented. For example computers was first invented by abuscus and the mechine was also prety large and heavy. But comming to the present computers have designed in a fashion that a man can carry from place to place without any need of help or with out any assistance. So there should be also a continous up gariation when some thing is inventd to make its ussage simple day by day.
 
 So , from the above points of explantion it can be said that people should invent to new things as well as old things. There shold be some manner of processure to do the things in a sucessfull manner.The things that are invented should support the environment it shold not distrub the man kind. And there shold be and regulary updation of the things that heve been invented and should be cheked wether it is in a proper condition or not
