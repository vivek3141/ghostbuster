Have you ever bought a product what you do not need? I believe evrybody has the experience at least one time. What makes you buy some product what is not necceray for you? The answer is an advertisement. I agree that most advertisements make products look much better than they are so that people are temtated by those. There are three ways that advertisements make their products seems much better. Those are exaggerating, using famouse person, and hiding an important information.
 First of all, most advertisements hire cerebities to make misunderstanding costomers like that the cerebities are actually using the productucts. You can see almost cosmetic product advertisments has a beautiful feamale movie star in it. Of course the woman has really great skin. She might use the product or not. However, most customers think if they use the product, they can have a beautiful skin like the ceerebity has.
 Secondly, most edvertisements exaggerate their product. For exsample, many toy advertisements show their products are moving automatically without any human control. As a result, a lot of children are temtated by the toys incredible moving, and keep asking to their parents to buy the toys. Then the parentes' saying that the toys are not robot; you have to control yourself to childeren does not work at all. The avdertisements use childrent's pure mind to sell their products.
 Finally, advertisement tend to hide some very important informations with small characters. For exsample, you can easily find a very tiny information right bottom of TV screen that usually telling very important infomation that you might change your mind.
 In summary, I understand that the purpose of advertisements is maximising the selling products. However, their exaggerating, hiding some informations, and making misunderstnading can make people to buy what they do not need.
