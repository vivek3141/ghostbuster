According to my life experience, i agree with the statment the young do not pay enough attention to their communities. In my opinion, there are countless factors for this phonemone. I will explain some of them in the following paragraphs. 
 First of all, nowadays the job market is more and more competitive. As a result, the performance in the school become more and more improtant. However the experience of helping communities will not record in their grade. Meanwhile, Parents expect their children should focus on their study. student are not encourage to help others. Children spend lots of time in learning english, painting and music.
 Furthermore, people are becoming more isolated with each other. In the past, the neiborhood  are familiar with each other. They may organize a small group to clean the street. As long as the adoults do it, the young will be affected. In the end they will helping the community automatically. In the capitalism society, people expect there will some return when their do something to the society.     
 Taking all into account, we can have a conclusion that young people are more and more selfish and unwilling to help their communities.
