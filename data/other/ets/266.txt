Students have to do both: understand ideas and concept, and learn facts.
 
 First of all, I do agree with the statement that understand ideas and concept is more important than learning facts.
 
 For instance, in an history class, the professor will teach the dates, when the event happened, but more importantly why, which is the idea or the concept. 
 Even though it is worth mentioning dates because it is part of the history and it is also culture, in my point of view, learning the idea and the concept is more important. Learning how the second world war started, the concept, the behavior of the governments and the reaction of people is more interesting than knowing that Hitler died and the war ended in 1945.
 
 Another example would be the continents. Students know that a long time ago, there was only one continent, then two (the northern continent and the southern continent) and finally seven continents. That is a fact. What would be interesting is to understand why and how it happened and that would be the concept of changes in temperature and drifts of the continents. Nowadays, it would be the effects of the global warming on the ice and the level of the oceans.
 
 Secondly, if students understand the idea and the concept, they will remember it easily. Moreover, they will be able to use them afterwards for another application. Understanding the ideas and the concept refers to use the intelligence. To the contrary, students learn so many facts that they won t be able to remember all of them. 
 
 Nevertheless, learning facts is also useful. Even if students can not remember all of them, it is worth doing it because it stimulates the brain. The memory has to be used. 
 Besides, it is nonsense to understand ideas and concepts without learning facts. I agree with the statement but also think that both are necessary.
