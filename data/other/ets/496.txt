I fully agree with this staement IT IS IMPORTANT FOR STUDENT TO UNDERSTAND IDEAS AND CONCEPTS because once the idea and concept of particular subject is understood by student than he can use it anywhere he will face the subject, so the subject knoweldge is very important for student to understand its concept and ideas behind its concept . once this is understood by students than he will never forget it in his life as he know the exact idea behind the concept .
 According to me understanding idea of concept is very important for student to understand, i m taking a example of change in consumer making behaviour is a subject topic of business lecture but when taught to students about its effect on particular product can be only understandable when he is clear with the concept of consumer behavoir and its effects on market . Firstly student should be taught by the means of market survey taken out by some product manufacturers in order to know the market position of their produt  and rival in market , what sorts of marketing strategy its competitor is adopting to lure its potential customers . Further more telling about the different causes which effects consumer decision making process student should primarily deal with the understanding of concept which very important to understand than consumer decision making effect on available product in market , it will loose it market share as consumers have shifted to some other product so this an issue, and idea behind this particular reason must be inferior quality of old product, change in consumer taste, change in living style of consumer , new product attributes which lure customer towards it .
 All this is an idea behind a particulcar concept change in consumer bvehaviour.so student should understand concept first in order to retain it for longer period of time.
 Here i want to conclude by saying few few words that a good learner will first understand the root cause of problem and about the problem like what is problem is all about than he will go to the solution part which means understand the concept and idea of subject than farward your learning to next phase.
