According to my opinion, it is not true that young people enjoy life more than old people do, rather, they enjoy it in other ways that would seem unsuitable for younger individuals.
 I believe that as time elapses, physical abilities worsen while intellectual abilities are enhanced, and this might be a reason why a 15 year old boy enjoys his spare time out in the yard playing soccer while his 70 year old grandfather might use the same time in front of the fireplace reading a philosophy book.
 It is simply that by living and going through new experiences we adjust our expectations, we realize what we want to do and what is better for us to do.
 The mere fact that a young boy regards as extremely boring what older people do in order to spend time and have fun, does not mean that they are actually not having fun and enjoying their lives.
 Of course, older people seem to be able to choose from a limited range of activities with respect to what a younger person is, but still, it does not make the point: life should be lived and enjoyed completely from birth to death.
 There is one little, and yet, extremely important thing that every human being needs in order to do this, and that is health.
 Unfortunately a lot of what affects our health cannot be directly controlled, but much can be prevented, and we should bear this in mind throughout our lives.
 Life, sometimes, seems to be something really fragile amd that is why we have to be more careful about it.
 Increasing your lifespan can be really enjoyable, many disagree on this point, but if you do not live, then you cannot even say you had a chance to enjoy your life.
 Older people live a different period of life than the one younger people live and this cannot be the reason why older people should be considered to enjoy life less than younger people do.
