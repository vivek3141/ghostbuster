My opinion on this subject is that young people can easily enjoy life , more than older people because they have less responsabilities . Besides when you are young you don't think about the consequences and about the future   so you do things older people don't . In a way my part is that the society where we are living nowadays gives us this image that young people are enjoying life being consciousness . Moreover when you are young you can do mistakes and people tell you it's because you have not a lot of experience .It's a common thought that older act better because they have experience , since ancient greek times .  I think once you are older you prefer to have a simple and calm  life , whithout doing some big party with a lot of alcohol and without seeing friends every time . Maybe older you want to stop all this . But it can be different if your life has been borring and if you had responsibility earlier like a child or a house to take care , maybe you will prefer a life with more action . For my part i 'd like to say that i am enjoying life studying , going to party , having a lot of friends and so on , but i know that my dad had a family very earlier so he had to work and at night couldn't go with  his friends because he had to study late for university or to take care of me as a baby . Sometimes i think that he would have prefered a different life but he ' s enjoying now the way he lives . So  to respond to this question i will say that it depends on the way you want to live when you are young and especially when you are old . As far as i am concern i think this topic is a reality for us now but only the seeing part of the reality because media for instance like to show young people in this way ,  it's a discussion of society
