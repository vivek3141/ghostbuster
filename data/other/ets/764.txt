People who have succeded in this world have taken risk the set a difference between them and those how have not, and I have seen cases like that. That is why I agree with the statement.
 
 Most of the people around us can be called regular people, I mean those whose activities and actions do not exceed others. Indeed, the people that can be refered as successful can be distinguish from all the normal groups. I remember once when I was 18 years old and I went with my family to Paris. The first night we went out to have dinner and, suddenly, in the restaurant we saw one of the most famous actors from Hollywood. Thus, I realized that many people were looking at him and some others were asking him his last film. Indeed, this kind of person are some kind og magnet to others. 
 
 The fact is that this actor began is career acting in a old theater and letting other people how good was his performance. He took lessons from a acting academy, something that almost nobody else does. Another example that I would like to give about my opinion, refers to the business world; where you can be rich in just a matter of hours. 
 
 When I was in the university I remember, studying for my major, we where studiying business success as the pick of our life,  so we analyzed the Bill Gates case. Therefore we came to the conclusion that you only have to have an idea, a good, new and different idea to have success and in this case how to be richest in the world just in couple of years. What happened to him is that he  worked hard on something different and came up with the big deals of affortable computers.
 
 In conclusion, I might say that making the difference, taking risks, having new and good ideas is the best way for being successful is life, in any point of view.  For those reasons, I agree with the statement.
