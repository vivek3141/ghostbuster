The product I disappointed at the most was my kichen knife. I bought it through the TV shopping channel when someone showed that the knife could cut the cutting boad. Off couse, I found it was not ture after I got it. Therefore, I agree that most advertisements makes products seem much better than they really are. I think there are two reasons: the producers try to explain their products seemed attractive, and  the world the producers explain are vertual.
 The first reason why I think the products seem nicer than real one is that this is the puroducer's purpous. As they want to sell their product as much as they can, they try to make show perfect thinking about the biggest effort by advertising. For example, they hire the advertising company which has artist, copy planner, and strategy proffesiona. As aresult, they make perfect advertisement which atrracts the consumers.
 The second reason for my opinion is that the advertisement shows virtual world. To make the customers think the product is so nice the producer explains the beautiful world which is the people want. Unless the producer shows real worl, nobody wouldl not be motivated to buy anything. To take an example, in the TV commercial of a aprticular cleaner, the famous actress acts smart and pretty wife using the product. Because the watcher may think they want to be a beautiful wife like her, or they think they are same to her, or the man thinks they want to marry with her, they tend to use the cleaner. We know this is not real world, but we want to be by using the product.
 In conclusion, I think most advertisements must seem better than they really are. Although it makes freaquantly confuse me, we can think this is an advertisement when we buy some products.
