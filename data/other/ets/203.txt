Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are to sell more thier products to consumers. However, I really disagree this becase of three reasons: disappointment of costomer, destroying brand image, and decreasing company's profit.
 First of all, it brings the disappointment of costomers. For example, let's assume one woman buys a product thorough seeing advertisements. At first time, she is very happy to buying that product becasue it seems really great on the advertisements. However, she will regret buying the product soon becasue the product is not good as much as she expects. Therefore, this costomer will never try to buy the same brand's products.
 Next, it destorys brand's image. If one company keeps advertising their products seem much better that they really are, we costomers will not buy them because we already know that the advertiments does not tell the truth through our experience. Becasue of this, the company's brand image will be destroyed and needs a lot of time to recover the image again. 
 At last, it brings a severe loss to the company. Maybe, at first time, the company wants to sell thier products than other competitive companys' prducts by making products seem much better than they really are. However, the company will lose the costomers and costomers' faith becasue the costomers really want to buy some products that seem as much as good they really are. 
 Because of these three reasons, I really disagree making products seem much better that they really are. A false advertisement brings disappointment of costomer, destroying brand image, and decreasing company's profit. Altoought the company can sell its products than any other companise at the first time, the company will cost two or three times more than they do.
