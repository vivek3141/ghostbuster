I strongly agree that advertisements make products  seem better. One should not be suprised by that because that is the goal of advertisement. In short, adverstisements want the consumer to buy the product whether or not he has a health benefit.
 
 What always come to mind is the advertisements for cigarettes. In much of these adverstisements, you see either a beautiful woman or hansome man and immediately you want identify with them. Therefore you want to imitate their acts, i.e. smoke. The other point about cigarettes advertisements is the "element of freedom". Most adverstisements show vast pieces of land or sea to suggest somekind of escape or adventure but it actually an illusion.
 
 The other type of advertisements that I would like to talk about is children snacks. On television the snacks looks very delicious and appetizing but in fact they have no nutritious value. Advertisers use bright colors, with catchy rythms to entice children to buy their products. When you look at the nutritional value of the product, you realised that it's full of saturated fat or even  trans fat. Kids love it because it tastes good. Some parents may like it because it's convenient to prepare it.
 
 The last point that I would like to make is commercial for cars. Everyday that you turn the television on, there is a new advertisement about a new car or the new model of an old car. You are constanly reminded to change you car even if you don't have too. What most people seems to ignore is that cars run on gasoline and we all know that cars are the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide (CO2). Most cars companies advertisements will not promote the use of public transportation to cut the emission of Carbon Dioxide in order to save Mother Nature.
