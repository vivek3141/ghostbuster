I agree with the following statement. Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. I have three reasons that I want to support my point of view.
 First of all, I think that if a person is always feel passion on meet new people, learn new things, try new stuff, that means they are not afraid they did wrong thing at least they tried. It not a big deal for them because they have a stronger attem than other people. In addtion, learn more thing that you don't now is good to you. For examle, I am learing a new method for solving math equation, and by doing this, I'll understand more solution that other people don't know. So, I am being a better student that the other person.
 Secondly, I find out that to do such new thing is a littel bit hard for most of the people becasue they are not good at. However, if they break that mind which seems nervus and afraid, they'll go trough it and will get a lot of fun by knowing fresh things. Further more, changing your mind and learn will make you enjoy the thing what you do, I think this is also a big idea that those successful people have.
 Thirdly, I believe that most of the successful people have attempt for their goals, they uses certain ways, very active and powerful ways as the process they'll do. For example, once when I was haveing a dinner with my parents, they've give me some good ideas and I never forget about them. The ideas are if you never try, you never win. And the other one is if you learn more than other people, you'll get more chance than other people. Those are the words I always remember and I realized the life from real, things just like those words.
 Lastly, to conclude based on the reasons that I gave above, I agree with the following statement. Successful peple try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.
