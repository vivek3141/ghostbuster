I do not agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. The reasons for my believing so are several.
 
 First of all people have diverse interests and tastes. Travelling in a group led by a tour guide follows one path for everyone. Just as one shirt can not fit all, similarly one tour can not fulfill the needs of every tourist. A tour guide takes people to major attraction of the destination and some people may like one place more than the other and hence may want to spend more time at the place of their liking. This is not possible when one is  travelling in a group led by the guide.
 
 Secondly there are some places where one would want to travel alone. Travelling in a group may compromise one's privacy  so in such situations travelling in a group does not make sense. I know of some couples who went on their honeymoon to a tourist location in a group. I believe that travelling in group can take away the romance away from such trip.  Furthermore some people gain more pleasure in travelling alone because of sense of adventure that it provides which  travelling in a group with tour guide just can not provide.
 
 Another disadvantage of travelling in a group led by tour guide is that you dont have control over your itenary or travel plan. If due to some reason one looses the group then one may have to face a very hard time to complete the trip just because that person did not plan the trip but tour guide did.
 
 Lastly by not travelling in a group led by tour guide you can plan your trip according to your time and your financial condition. You may choose first class air ticket if that is what you prefer or may choose to stay in a cheap hotel if you dont want to spend a lot of money on the trip. You may choose to extend your trip if you like or shorten it if there is an emergency.
 
 In sum, based on the reasons described above, I  disagree with the statement that travel in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel.
