I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In my opinion, this is because of the change and developement of our sosiety.
 In the past, a lot of people had done agricultural industries, which need a lot of help and group works. Farmers need to help each other to gather the crops and raise thgem .However, as our industires develop, a lot of people started to have service industries or manufacture. which requires less helps, and more competition among the individuals. Because of these, a lot of young people seems to forget about the importance of helping their comminities and care only about themselves. 
 These industrial change also changed young people's opinions.  Long times ago, many people  thought that it's their duty to help each others. However, many young people now a day thinks it is waste of time and money to give even little helps to their community with out reward. For example, long times ago, if we had poor neighbore who is having a hard time, a lot of people tried to help them with out expecting the reward. However, lots of poors in our community suffer because no one voluntear to help them. Because of the change of the opinion, a lot of young people are neglecting to do even small acts to help ous community.
 Urbanization had a lot of things in our community, including the opinion of the people. As our society started to require more and more competition to survive, a lots of people thinks that the most important thing for them is to care about themselves and success. Because there's to many people who do not even practice simple acts to help our society, I sometime feels like no one is caring about our community.
