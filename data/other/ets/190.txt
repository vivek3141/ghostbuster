I disagree with thie stament because i think there are meny young people work hard and give enough time to helping their communties, so, there are many reasons to disagree with this statment.
 The reasons that i disagree with this statment; for example, young people studying hard, communicate with other people, and trying to convice old people with them ideas. First of all, young people studying hard in university and treying to improve them selves by getting high marks and entering the best companies and get the best position in them works to improve them countries. Second, there are many young people communicate witk others young people to try to help each others by them ideas for a reasult to help the communities. Third, in my actual experince i found many young people trying to convince the old people with them ideas and let them help to do the things they want to improve them countries.
 In conclusion, i think there are many young people trying to help with them ideas to help the communities and maybe just few are not helping, so, i advice every one to help their communities and work hard in every thing they try to attend in it.
