Well its a popular phenominon "to exagurate rather than to tell the truth". This phenominon is bieng used by every advertising agency
 
 In todays world there is noting which is not bieng advertised. Now it is a trend that every big company would hire a celibrity or a person fammiliar to the crowd to do advertisments. These advertisment companies would try to make their product the best among their compities. if we take the example of a very big company called cocacola. sum dayz back it was confirmed that the use of pesticides in India for the cococola bottels in incresed to an extent. So what they did was they hired a cilibrity and conveyed the messege that the bottel is not at all harmful and is safe. 
 
 These companies advertise in such a way that they make us bileave that there products are the best in buisness. these have negative as well as positive impacts on thje phycology of people. the positive impact is that they happily use their products but there are too many negative impact. First of all the companies are not telling the true reallity as where they stand and if the products are harmful, they only concentrate on the profits. The second problem is that due to intense compitition they do not use quality products to lower the prices, so the consumers have heath problems.
 
 Advertisments play a very important role in the minds of consumers. They are more confident in buying the product they have already heard about or atleast have seen its ads on the T.V
 
 The role of advertisments is increasing day by day and the faking of companies on their products would increase too through advertisments, and thus the suffering would be taken by the consumers.
