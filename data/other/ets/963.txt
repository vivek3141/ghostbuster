There are many different ways of learning and every body has got his way to learn and understand things.
 do you agree with me in this?
 Is i more important for sudents to undersand ideas and conceps than it is for them to learn facs. I think learning the facts is more important.
 
 First of all not all  the student can understand ideas and concepts because they varing in  thinking and cant all the time imagine whate the teatcher talking about   for example i have a frined of mine and he is a teacher and he telling me abou this that most studente cant understand  by explaining ideas and concepts.
 
 In the other hand he sudent can undersand facts easly for a big reasone because they can see theme and they can  touch them by hand some times so they belive in them and the good example of this the same teacher who een teaching for more than twenty years prove to me that is right by kindly talking me to many of his clases and showed me and i belive in him ecause it was a fact.
 
 I wish tha you agree
