We can wonder how the amount of cars in the next twenty years will evolve.
 In the one hand, we can think there will be less cars in twenty years. We can imagine that the development of public transports will keep going in the two next decades. Thus, people would avoid taking car for buses, metros or trains. Moreover, cars need energy to work, and this energy comes at the time being from oil. The cost of oil has been increased for the last ten years and it is absolutely possible that it will be the same thing in the next twenty years. If the situation of oil price will be worst and worst, so people will not want have a car any more. It would be too expensive. Finally, the environmental matter will force governments not to promote cars sellings, despite of automobile firms.
 In the other hand, there also are arguments which tell the amount of cars will increase. One of them is the possibility of cars using high technologies, as electricity instead of oil in the motor. These cars, if they exist, could be cheaper because they would need a common energy. Besides, in many countries, China for instance, have currently a big increase of their economy. A huge medium class is being formed in China and China is already the third market in the world. If the purchase power keeps growing in the next decades, it could have more cars than now there. The example of China can be applied in many developping regions.
 One complicated question is difficult to answer. Will people move more and more, and by the same use their car more and more, in the next twenty years? I think that it depends on the coutries. In Europe, where the population will be older in twenty years than now, we can think that people will work by being retired, and use more their car. In developping countries, the population may work less than now, thanks to best social conditions of living. There would therefore use more a car.
 So, I globally disagree with this statement.
