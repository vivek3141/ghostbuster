In general I agree with the statement. I only agree in general because I think one has to take lots of things into consideration.
 It is is true that especially nowadays young people do not help communities a lot. ''Helping the community'' is a very broad term, when I read this I understand contributing or becoming actively involved in a community.
 Especially in these days it seems to me that people in general, young people included, expect more from a society and community than what they are willing to give. There are certainly various projects and possibilities to become involved. However, especially in the last years the development of media, video games and goods of consumption in general desensitized a lot of people, especially the young generation.
 This leads to unawarenes of problems that might exist, or even when recognized to an unwillingnes to act.
 Also I think one has to consider the social backgrounds and sorroundings of young people. If a young person grows up in a society where nobody cares about contributing to society and their community, how is he or she supposed to learn that it is necessary to be involved in the community?
 On the other hand, it is common sense to become active. It is a taking and giving, if the giving aspect does not work properly, the community will not be able to uphold the services it offers.
 Especially young people are not aware of this process. 
 Therefore, I do agree with the statement. However, instead of blaming the young generation, something has to be done so that young people get encouraged to be a part of a community and get active.
