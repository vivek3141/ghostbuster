Yes, i do agree with the statement of successful people tring new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Now let us first know who are  these so called successful people. They are people who are a kind of  have expertised and very much on top of what ever work they do or what ever field they are in . Lets take some examples of Micheal Jackson from the field of music or Rahul Dravid from the field of sports who are undoubtedly some of the most successful people around us.
 Now, since successful people have gained so much control , popularity and the kind of achievment they wanted, so there remains very little to prove themselves as they have already proved themselves. So there is no point in confining them to only the things they have been doing  which they already know how to do very well. infact you can put in this way that they have the great opportunity to do something new  by taking a few risks.  The work of trying something new  by the successful people becomes much more easier because of the popularity and the fame they achieved when being successful in their previous profession or job. 
 We can make the above concept much clearer by taking the example of Sachin Tendulkar who being a  great cricketer for india , he also started a restaurant named TENDULKAR'S in Mumbai. So from this we get to know that though he is not a professional hotelier, he tried his hand at this new job by taking a few risks , since he is a successful person.
 so, before i end my essay i would like to conclude stating that successful people do try new things rather then only doing what they know how to do well , mainly by using their popularity in the previously done work  and also may be to get a kind a fresh breath of air into their monotenous and boring previous work though they might be successful in that particular profession.
