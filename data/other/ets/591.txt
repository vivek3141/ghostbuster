Although some people says young people should not enjoy life more than older people do, I agree that young peole enjoy life more than older people do. Because of 2 reasons: knouwledge and health.
 First of all, naturally, young people have more less knowledge than old people. For example, siociety, some actives, and many things. Therefore young people should experience many things. But they souldn't affraid to fail. They should enjoy every new experiences.
 Second of all, generally, most of young people have health body. And in future, we need to keep our health so people who can move their body activity- young people- should develop their health. However stress leads people bad condition so they should enjoy life.
 For these reasons, I agree that young people enjoy life than older people do.
