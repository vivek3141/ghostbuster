Success come taking risks
 
 Trying  news things certainly give a very good idea about what all things one is good in doing  .This statement of mine  confirms that I strongly agree the the fact the "Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well".
 Its easy  for  one to just follow the routine of his life ,like what he learned in the school ,from his house ,from this professional and keep following it to lead a normal life with out attempting to try something new .This happens mostly because many of them are sacred of unsuccessfulness by which I mean people are not ready to take defeat.
 Such people don't belive in the qoute like"winning and lossing is not important ,its just that how you play the game".
 
 I personally agree that trying new things help you to become successful because trying can help you to learn all the other capabilities in one self for example some body took a job of pizza delivery for say various reason like sudden need of money ,droped out of college and while doing this job he learned that he know so much about the city that he can try to be  tourist guide.In doing so there is a big risk invole in giving up a well earning job to a somthing fairly new .But until unless he don't try it he will may never in his like be able to do anything else expect being a pizza delivery person.
 
 secondly ,It help you to know how to deal with different situtation at different point of this.If one fail in his first attempt ,he know what all precaution he need to take incase he try to do the same thing next time.
 
 One of the strong example I would like to mention at this point is "Gandhi".He was lawyer and could have kept on practicinghis profession but instead he took the risk of this life ,career ,social boundaries and steped into the Indian reveloution for freedom.And by the end of the all the event he became the most powerful leader of India and as regarded the same till now.
