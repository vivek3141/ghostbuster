Actually, I think that right. The person who try new thing and take the risks is successed most the time. I faced some oppertunality to enhance my situation but that was need risk. And most the time  i blame my self but that no binefit me. Last try and risk to me is this exam. I don't have a trust with my self in the English language but i knew that if i don't take it today i will lost alot of time. That was about my expiriance but our life and with other expiriances the humanty start from the try and somehow  with the risk. Some of thier try not for help them only, but also to help the humanty. I read Once about the Flying in the sky and i asked my self "If there is no one have an encourage to try flying, how we can travle?". There is allways an answers and part of answered there is a risk. Right's brother had the  money, time, science and most important was the encourage to do that. They take the world everyday around the earth to remember humanty that the risk part of our life but we must woke perfict to be successful.
 I have a note. There is alot of people take the risk and successed but also ther is people failed. That not means "we must rest and don't try". The experiance born from the failed and also try again. But we must asked our self "Why Failling?". Surelly there is wrong may in planning, instrumunts, not enough money and also because we not trust with our self. That will be differ from the successed people and Failed.
 In my religon all the people from all the world must take the reasons (science)  before start to risk to have a result.
