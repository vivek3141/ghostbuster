"Big risks brings big opportunities" I can not remember very well but I heard it or read it from somewhere which tells that by taking risks you gain chance to well-off. I agree with this aggreement and also agree that successful people are the ones who take risks and try new things. 
 There are lots of things you can do for being a successful person. You should work hard, try to learn, watching the new technologies.

However you do not have the courage to imply these information to your bussines. Then what are you going to do wtih them? People try new things and take risks in order to be seccussful.
 Firstly people shoul try new things. Todays world everything changes fastly and you have to follow these changes in order to be successful.. For example you have to learn internet, or how to control your e-mails.  Nowadays every thing runs from internet and by e-mail. Because it is one of the fastest and the cheapest way to communicate with long distances.There are few people left who uses letters to communicate. 
 Secondly and I think this one is important than trying new things is take risks. Taking risks is the key factor that brings you to success. If you always do what you already do really well you stay in where you are. Taking risks concluded with different solutions and also higher revenues. However one important thing about taking risk is you should think carefully and well prepared before you take the risks. Because besides big opportunities it can also bring sadness.

 As a conclusion taking risk and
