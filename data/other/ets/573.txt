Nowadays people who have broad knowlege of many academic subjects will more accepted from the society than those who only specialize in one specific subject.
 
 First, people who master more subject tend to gain more money.
 For example, a person master two language, English and German. 
 There are maybe most of the employees in a  company only master English. In case the company need to negotiate with a German company and needs a person who can comunicate with the German smoothly. In this situation, the person who master German will take this job. If he can take good use of such chance, for instance, to perform himself in good manner and susccessful finish the negotiation work, he will make good impression to his boss.  And because of the appreciation from his boss, his chance of promotion is obviously bigger than that of his coworkers. Therefore, he is more likely to earn money than others do.
 
 Moreover, people with broad knowledge may have a wilder selection of doing work. For example, my major subject is marketing, if I have time, I definetely will choose another subject as second subject. Nowadays, the competition of pursuming a job is more stressful  than ever before. If I only master the subject of marketing, I may fail to find a job easily. But things are changed if I master another subject such like computer technik. I can choose a job among the IT companies. And I will surely have a bigger chance to get a job.
 
 From what have been discussed above, it is undoubted coming to the conclusion that it is better for someone to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.
