As everyone konws travelling is a thing full of fun. By the acient time we have lots of travellers who traveled to the peopleless places and wrote down many liberties for the following people. One of my dream used to be a traveller some day and travel all over the world. But, will travelling in a group led by a tour guide really good? I don't think so.
 The most important thing for travelling is discovering. As everyone's childhood, what I wanted to do is to go further from our house, discover my "New World". This is also the reason for why I want to be a traveller. If you travel with a group led by a guide, it will lose lots of fun. The guide will tell you everything he or she knows about the place. This can make me crazy. You can discover nothing. Just like you are drinking water but you feel you are still thirsty. So that's why I don't like travel with a group led by a guide.
 The second important thing is being along. Most people want to travel just because they want to have a rest. As the pace of our life is getting faster and faster, we need more and more relax. Traveling with a group could never make you relax. The guide will take you everywhere. If you are in the group you may get tired for the whole trip.That's why most of the people in the group sleeping on the way, take photos at the sightseeing and forget everything when they get back. 
 The third and the last thing is, we need free. People are getting couldn't stand about sleeping in cage like apartments everyday. What they need is free. Travelling by oneself, you can go anywhere whenever you want. So if you travel with a group led by a guide. What you do is just like walking after a leader and walk, walk, and walk.
 In conclusion, travelling in a group led by a tour guide will make no sense. You may lose all the fun of the trip. Somehow, that may equals to a waist of time. So,  just try to travel by yourself.
