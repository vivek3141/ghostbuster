I think that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to  have broad knowledge of many academic subjects.  From now on, I mention two reason for my this opinion.
 
 The first reason is because modern society or companies search for the person who is specialist.  Recently, society is becoming worse in a sense of economy.  There are many companies which can not manage.  So society or companies need a person who has special skills or knowledg.
 
 The second reason is because I think the person who has a special knowledge is strong in many fields. If specialized, you can get various occupations.  You will be cherished by many besiness persons. To have special knowledge change you as specialist. So you will be strong.
 
 In conclusion, I think it is important to specialize in one specific subject.  To do so,  your ability will be higher and higher.
