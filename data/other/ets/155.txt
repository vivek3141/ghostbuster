The life is change: my parents when they were child don't enjoy life as young people live today.
 On the one hand thirty years ago the life was very different between  today because there weren't all attractive that there is today.
 For example today the young people go to the disco every saturday night and become to home at the end part of the night; my parents usually tell me that when the week end came they went to the cinema in the afternoon and after they returned to home; often they went to restaurant after the cinema.
 Moreover today young people have a cellular: partents can call everytime their children but I think that this elements could create a limit for the comunication between child and their friends or family.
 On the other hand the world change day after day and it's wright that the people accept the news and the differents; I think that the parents must control their children for not exagerate in requests.
 On balance I think that it's wright that young people enjoy life because a lot of years ago their parents enjoy life too.
