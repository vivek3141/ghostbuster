Some people think that,it would be better to have broad knowledge of different academic subjects because variations of subjects adds to human experience and provides possible solutions in many situations.Others think it would be better to concentrate on one topic and go on . Based on my experience, both opinion are helpful according to my grade.
 When i was in under graduate school, I was fond of reading and  attending different classes which helped me to great extend to pass my exams easily and receive high score.
 On the other hand, when I was in physical therapy school I concentrated on only sports medicine classes which helped me to apply for master degree and find convineant job.
 Finally both thoughts are important depend on needs and goals.
