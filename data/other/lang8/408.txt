Yesterday I rided from our main campus to the medical college. It took me about 3 hours.
The roads is not flat, with so many ups and downs. When I got my dorm, I was really exhausted. After taking a warm bath, I went straightly to bed, and slept until noon. It's rainy today. The sky is gray, and I 'm blue.
My boyfriends has gone home for a week. But he has never gave me a call. I want to eat something delicious to release.
