I went to a restaurant with my friend who is one of my friend in my swimming school last Friday. At first we swam in the class, after that, we went out. We didn't decide where we should go, but a coach thought me good restaurant. The restaurant was near my friend's house. I asked her if she know there. She answered" I don't know!" Therefore we looked for it and we easily found it. She said" I knew it! You and I came here once before! You brought me to this restaurant!" I remembered it. I am stupid, but my friend too!
