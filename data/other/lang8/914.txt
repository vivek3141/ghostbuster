It's been a long time!!
Now I can write my diary.
Today's title is" Jogging".
Do you often go jogging??
I regularly do jogging 3 or 4 kilometers once a week. Today, although I didn't know what I was thinking, but I decided to run to the nearest sea that is about 30 kilometers and back. When I want to feel a sense of achievement, I might do something like this.
I must've been tired of a typical life.
Anyway, it took 4 hours, however I got back home somehow.
I 'm sorry I can't concentrate on writing this.
You know, my legs are raising a grievous wail of pain.
A picture I attached is the evidence of jogging to the sea.
Thank you
