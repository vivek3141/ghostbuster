I am studying of English words for getting high score on TOEFL test. But I am having a trouble. It is that I found it difficult for me to understand the scientific words. Because their meaning are difficult if I translate their words from English into Japanese. For example," Coriolis effect"," spectrum" and etc. I don't remember these words quite. But I will, want to graduate from American university, so I will study hard!!! Thank you for reading.
