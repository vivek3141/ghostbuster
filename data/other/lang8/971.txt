Though I write New year frist journal late, I want to leave my saying to everyone.
I began New year with my oldest friend, we spent good time. he already has a job, and bought a car. I envy him a little about having a job, I get Senior university majoring in Polymer Engineering this year. I hope I will get a job, and approach my dream this year. I hope you all succeed in your wish. ( ;
