I like english dramas like 24, Ally McBeal and something like that.
It is very good materials for me to liseten to English.
But 24 is the drama which is in a little bit unusual situation and very difficult for me to listen to it. Jack bouer always says" What's going on!!!" : ). Although, Ally McBeal is very usual situation and I love it, but I am male... I would like to listen to more Enlish with e - dramas and learn daily conversation more and debate. I am listening to ITConversations and Google techtalk video about the debate.
Are there any good dramas or debate video?
