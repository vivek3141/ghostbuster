When the first day of 2010, like the other years, I made the new year resolution. One of them is to study English hard.
Bur this year is a little bit different with the other year. Because I am planning to move to the foreign company which means my ability to speak and write english sould be upgraded. So I decide to write the english diary as a way to study english. And luckily, I found THIS SITE!! I believe it really works to write english diary here to improve my english skill.
