What noise it is outside! It's too loud to fall asleep, it's about 4 : 30 am here in Japan though. Nevertheless, my wife seems able to keep sleeping even under these circumstances.
I can now hear curious onlookers shouting
and screaming, and a fire - engine siren wailing outside near my
apartment.
I wonder if we even here are safe. The air in Japan is quite dry at this time of the year, so I 'm worried
that the sparks set fire to its surrounding houses and spread the fire. Who did it? And what for?
