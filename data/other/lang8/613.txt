I 'm pretty sad about the earthquake happened in Japan these days. I would like to donate some money through google. org, however the website is partly blocked by our government, so I can't finish the donation.
Double sadness!
I wish the death toll won't raise anymore, I don't know what to do to help.
Good luck to all the people live in Japan!
