I 'm a grad school student now.
When I was a university student, I belonged to yacht club. And now, I 'm a coach of the club.
Almost every members had not yachted before they joined our club. However, we have had a goal that we will place in national championship. We have not achieved the goal, but we will have challenged the goal.
