Hello, everybody
I 'm very surprised and happy to find such a wonderful website.
I haven't understood the system of this well yet, however, I can't help posting my first diary. As for ordinary Japanese people, my English level is supposed to be high to some extent.
Actually, everybody in my company counts on me when it comes to English, for example, the customer or the documents from U. S.
A.
But as you know, my writing ability is like a child play. I 'm always dreaming to get my English composition proofread by English native speakers. If you notice something, for example, grammatical error, unnatural expression, please tell me. This time, I dare to write a diary without using my dictionary. So the contents are probably poor..
