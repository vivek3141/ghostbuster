Unlike the commom university with more buildings and less plants, Changsha University is more beautiful than a garden. Getting into the school gate, you will enjoy a feeling of backing to the nature. Wandering on campus, green trees, colorful flowers and clear water catch your sight, plesant smell of flowers occupies your nose, and the suond of reading aloud and whispering of birds capcutures your ears. What's the better, the road is so clean that you almost can't find any rubbish, even a piece of waste paper. What you feel is that, far away from the noise of downtown, studying and living in the university is more close to your heart, and the quiet environment also contributes to concerntrating your attention on study.
