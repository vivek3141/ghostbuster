It's really cool to meet a lot of foreigne friends here. I think you guys are really nice and open - minded.
In addition, I feel that really happy that know people who likes language as I do.
Everyone has their own reason to learn a or more target language.
No matter what your reason is, there is the only one thing I know that is we all love language with great enthusiasm!
Many lovely people gives me courage and correction, even though my Eng. is a big disaster, you guys still correct my mistake patiently. Anyway, thank you all ~ ~ ~ and I will keep working!!! : )
