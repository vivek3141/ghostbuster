If you come to Japan and speak a few Japanese, you will be praised for speaking Japanese, even if the sentence you speak is very short. That's because Japanese people think Japanese language is one of the most difficult languages in the world. They have prides in their own language. However, in my opinion, Japanese isn't the difficult language compared to other languages. There are two reasons. First, the pronunciation of Japanese is much simpler than other languages.
Japanese have fewer vowels and consonants than English. That's why most Japanese can't differentiate the sound of" L" and" R".
There is a joke about a Japanese politician.
The politician talked to an American journalist during an election time.
He wanted to say he was in the middle of the campain and said loudly," I have an erection now!" Also, to differentiate" worse" and" worth" is difficult for Japanese.
The hardest one is to distinguish" hurt" from" heart"," fast" from" first". It sounds absolutely same to Japanese. Japanese pronunciation is easier than other asian languages as well. For example, Chinese has four sounds for each vowel.
It has much more complex sound than the one of Japanese. Second, the grammar of Japanese is simpler than many languages.
It doesn't have male verbs and female verbs such as French, Spanish and Russian. No singular forms and plural forms. No articles needed. Fewer patterns of conjugation. These are the two reasons for which I believe Japanese is not difficult. Of course, I have to admit it must be difficult if you want to reach a high level.
But it's difficult to master any language, isn't it?
I believe most difficult thing in learning Japanese is writing it because most people aren't used to its letters. I have to admit it must be challenging at first.
But you shouldn't hesitate to start to learn Japanese. After all, you don't have to write when you talk to Japanese.
Do you think your native language is difficult to learn?
