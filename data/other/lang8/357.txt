I live in Kanagawa.
Kanagawa is next Tokyo.
There are many beaches in Kanagawa.
Many big waves are coming to the sea by the influence that Tyhoon is approaching now. It's good day for surferes. I haven't tried it.
I have tried a bodyboard.
The bodyboard is shorter than the surfboard.
This is the board that I use and lie on my face on the board.
I 'm going to do bodyboard today afternoon. I 'm looking foward to that.
I hope I can get good waves ^ ^
