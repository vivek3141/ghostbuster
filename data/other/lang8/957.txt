I write this entry for the first time in 2 months because I was busy studying to prepare for the college entrance exam.
Writing English is difficult but exciting because I can tell people I don't know in other countries what and how I feel and think.
When I get into college, I am going to studying a lot of English, Mathematics, Physics, Biology and, of course, Japanese.
And I will talk to people from other countries to the college and write this entries.
I am pleasant that we can communicate with each others and if I want to get acquainted with people whose faces are known by me I am immediately to able do so.
