Hello!
Today I 'm going to talk about my spent time in the morning ( or time was spent by me in the morning... so...
I don't know what is exactly right ). I woke up at 7am, because I was woken up by my alarm. Then I didn't get up, instead of it I too on (or switched on or turned on) the alarm again, and after I was sleeping up to 7 : 20 am. So I had slept almost 20 minutes yet. It helped me to get up as I was energy. So I got up.
And then I went to the bath to clean my teeth. I drank a cup of tea and went to the university.
Sorry, I have a big problem with Perfect Tense and particularly with Perfect Progressive Tense. I don't know exactly is Perfect Tense need to use there. Thank you guys!
Correct me please.
