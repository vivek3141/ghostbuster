Good morning!
This morning is very fresh.
I woke up late but it's still fresh.
My breakfast
is Tim - Sum.
Today, I 'm going to read law book after I has read lots of novels. I like reading very much.
Reading gives me more knowleages and interesting
things.
We can open the world through reading.
Now, I must go to read. Byebye!
