I did not drink alchohol a couple days. I was a very good girl. I didn't drink yesterday too. I was not drunk at all.
I have teaching a dance class every thursday. (yesterday was thursday) I was so rushing to go to a dance studio. I was late to leave my place. I run to a station, and I found it out when I took train. I wore two different shoes on my foot... Those shoes are different colors, different shapes. I really wanted to go back to change them, but I did 't have time to do it. so I took train wearing two different shoes. I was standing by one foot on the train. when I got the studio, everybody laughed at me so hard. I entertained them.
I was dying to laugh. This couple week, I've been very busy. I have a lot of things to do, so maybe I was tired?! I know It's not good excuse. I know everybody is busy.
I ' m just stupid : p Haha
