I have a certain obsession about the train. I took about 55m to commute every day when I studied in senior high school
It was off at 5 : 30am beneath the moonlight to take the train left at 6 : 00AM All the scenery outside the train were dim because of the weak moonlight
What I had done on train was to gossip something happened in the class with my pals Reminiscence from deep within me, on boarding on the train, emerges from my memories.
Mixing with bitter and sweet, countless memories
Blast From the Past!
whenever I heard the sound came from train station
