Today, I finished trial lesson at last. And I decided language school. I choose of school is a LSC. Other school was almost very lively and comfortable.
But LSC was some different. I felt tension in the school.
I like to feel tension.
So I choose LSC.
Tomorrow, I going to go Rogers stadium to watch the major league games.
I don't have watched the major league game. I 'm already exiting.
I wonder to coming tomorrow early.
Good night.
