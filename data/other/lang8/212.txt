My father was once a DJ in club when his youth, he got many LP records and CDs. So I could come into cantact with many Music from Billboard to Classic. Actually I was truly blessed one. Cause You may know or may not know, My father's generation was absolutely poor. Right after the Korean War, there was nothing left.
Everything was completely destroyed including Music. But there was US Armed Forces in Korea, and they radiobroadcast thier songs meaning Billboard. My father listened those songs from the radio everyday and recorded it (Illegal these days. ..) and dreamed his future. Even though he couldn't eat his fill, but he was happy filling with musics. He spent all of his money to buy the records or guitar. Anyways, I got his blood in my vein, I really into the music also. And I 'm really grateful what he inherted me.
Both of Emotionally and Physically. Those records when he bought his youth, now it's real valuable stuffs : )
