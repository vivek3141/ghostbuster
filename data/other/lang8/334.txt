Yesterday evening I went to a very nice musical in my town, it was called" Anni giovani" in Italian, something like" Years of the youngers" in English.
I teach Italian and English (funny but true) in an Association where street boys and girls with difficult backgrounds are helped with their homeworks. One of the guy performed in the show so he invited me and other teacher to support him. I have to say I enjoyed myself a lot (there were musics from the most well - known musicals af the past forty years), and above all I was so glad to see the boy so proud and happy as I had never seen him before.
