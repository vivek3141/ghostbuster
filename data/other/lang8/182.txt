An interesting TV show was aired last Saturday. It was about what foreigners are wondering while they live in Japan.
It is natural for us, but they think it seems strange.
One of them is drinking alchole outside, because most countries don't seem to be allowed to drink. It is not a smart behavior in Japan either, but we have a lot of fuss once a year outside. It is hanami.
During that season, no one pay much attention even we are drunk, make noise. The next moment we rather become friends with other groups enjoying over there. In Japan, strange custom is remained as for hanami. When we have hanami, we have to get place before starting. Usually new employees are asked to sit on a blue sheet for hours to occupy a nice place.
It seems to be their first task. So, whenver I pass by, I am sure they must be new employees.
