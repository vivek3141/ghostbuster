ASAP
We are just trying to carry out an interventional study with Juvenile delinquents ' whom are a group of 15 - 16 year olds according to the book" EXPLORING FEELINGS : the Cognitive Behavior Therapy To Manage Anger", which was translated in Japanese. Therefore I have contacted Dr / / / / / /, the author of the book, so that we would have some advice for the programing. And with regard to the rating scale and scientific evaluation of the program (to compare the program's effect before and after), he suggested me to contact you and told your e - mail address. We are planing to measure with the State - Trait Anger Expression Inventory - 2 (Schwenkmezger et al. 1992) for the evaluation study, but also thinking that it would be a bit difficult for some of the subject group members. That is why, it would be helpful, if you could give us some advice for the ebaluation of the research and provide the detals about the rating scales that were used in the book.
