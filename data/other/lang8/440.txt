My job situation is becoming busy again recently so I called baby sitter today. She takes care and looks after my daughter at her house.
Today was ok, because I was able to be back in home earlier than I thought. But one example, past March, I was pretty busy.
I couldn't reach home before 9 pm almost while that time and had to rely on beby sitter everyday. And now, my job is becoming busy again (even gradually) and I 'm pretty sure that I'll be much busy this summer. Although I don't hate my job, I 'm sad that I can't spend enough time with my precious daughter.
But this is the my way, I choose it by myself so I never be able to give up. A glass of beer might helps me a lot : P
