There are many clocks in my home.
There're the alarm clock, desktop computer, laptop computer, iPod, ipad, iPhone, TV, VTR, and cooking timer.
Each thing ticks down.
We live a regular life using clocks. Getting up in the morning, Going to work, Backing to home, Going to bed in the night. But I often dream the life without clocks. I think that It might be a life of wealth.
