I think oil spill accident in the gulf of mexico is very important thing in the world. Depending on a case, I think it is more important than the economic problem or the religion or the war or the poverty or any other problem. because It affects the whole world, nobody knows a solution, nobody are predictable. But We hardly hear the news about accident on TV in Japan. I don't know why.
