Do you like dim - sum??
I am a cantonese, people usually love to have breakfast in hotel.
Tea, Dimsum.
I went to GuangZhou a few days ago, intro some kind of dimsum for a ShangHai friend. She loves it so much. My favorite DimSum is LiuSha Bao, cold cake, and chicken feet! = ) You should try Cantonese Dimsum IF you go to GuangDong. Maybe try others if you not dare to try chickfeet!
