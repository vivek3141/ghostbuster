I 'm going to visit Hiroshima tomorrow.
The purpose of this trip is to join the music live!!
I will be able to see YUI, my favorite singer.
Though It takes 5 hours to go to Hiroshima, I 'm very excited. I have a lot of time to enjoy sightseeing too.
I think Hiroshima is a famous city as a peace city.
Is it right?
Before womderful trip, I can't sleep.
But I have to get up early....
I don't know when I become to sleep before trip...
