Recently, I have got a Blow Off Valve for car. What is Blow Off Valve?
It is a tool of turbocharger.
When turbo exhausts comprssed air, it helps to get away air to airatmosphere.
I am using it of HKS campany, it is very beutiful high pitched tone.
But, revolution of engine falls, because it gets away air too much.
