Hi, this is the first sentence I write here, lang8. I've been thinking what kind of topic would be good, and then I 'm writing this vagrant sentences. Well, I 'm gon na talk about myself a little bit.
Since I've been to London, I like London very much.
Before I went to London, I almost can't speak English and my English is worth than an average of Japanese. But I got improve my English while I was in London. I know reading and writing is not so good yet, and this is the one of reason why I decided to write this sentence as well. Anyway, I appreciate you to have read this a kind of letter. Today is the good day, and I 'm gon na go to STARBUCKS to get a coffee or something. Thank you.
