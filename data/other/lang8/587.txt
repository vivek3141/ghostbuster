hey ~ this is anne who keep listening 575 by perfume (japanese artist) these days. welcome to my diary.
11 / 4 @ shimokitazawa
first I went to village vanguard which is a bookstore. this is one of the most kawaii and useful bookstores ive ever been. I love their" pop" (btw how can I say the pop?)
well... they put a cool covered cd.
then I went to cafe ordinaire.
I just wanted to get warm.
and I had a banana tart with cream and a cup of soy latte. I wish that place was non - smorking place and I wish I could stay more... (you have to order more if you want to stay there over 2 hours. ..) but
anyway,,, I love that place and the tart tasted good.
and this is a kind of book cafe so so many books are there. I read the book of movie quotes (interesting) and the newest one of one piece.
amaaaaazinnng and made me cry. yep.
this is me and this is a day of otaku - girl. xoxo
