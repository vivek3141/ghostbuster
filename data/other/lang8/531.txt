Hi there!!
Instead of replying each, I thank you all for correcting on this diary. As for my recent life, I've being busy with looking after undergraduates.
They had to submit their theses by yesterday, so this week was especially hectic.
As a TA, I accompanied them all day long without sleeping on Thursday (on the other days, I had good sleep though).
Consequently, I was relieved that all members handed in them somehow.
But My turn is coming in just one month, that is to say, the hectic days are coming back again.
