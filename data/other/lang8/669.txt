I am teaching a pupil English.
She is a lovely girl and now in grade6.
I found something difficult in her homework.
Could someone give me a hand? Tow sentences, A :" Do you like the green one?" and B :" What about the blue one?". Can I transform A and B's position in the following article? What's the difference from" do you like" and" what about"? Can I help you?
I want to buy a dress.
Do you like the green one?
Its beautiful, but too small for me. What about the blue noe?
Its a nice dress, I'll take it....
