My company's office hour is supposed to be from 10 : 00 to 7 : 00pm. But, nobody leave office at 7 : 00. My coworker all work untill late night. I don't know exactly what time they go back to home because I 'm first three people to leave office. hahaha
I usually leave office around 7 : 30. I want to finish job exactly 7 : 00 and enjoy my private life. But It's awkward to leave office to 7 while other are working silently...
