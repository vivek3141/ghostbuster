I remembered my teacher told us this when I was a high school student, he said :" One of the most happiness is that you have a work for your living, and you really like it." I didn't understand at that time. I thought I wouldn't do anything if I dislike it. But now, I know it's real.
As other almost Chinese students, I offered too many time to learn for the university entrance examination. Luckily, I entered a good university and after graduation, I get a job in a company. It's a good company and my colleagues are so nice.
But the problem is I don't like my work. So, what do I like?
I don't know.
I never try to do anything besides learning knowledge for the exam. I don't even know what I real like. So how can I change my life?
