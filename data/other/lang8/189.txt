My MP4 is broken.
I can ' t live without music!
So I have to dug my first MP3 (1GB) out from my drawer. But it can only input about two hundred and fifty songs.
Well, it can not satisfied me. When will my P4 come back ~ ~ ~ ~???
The classes these days are difficult for me, so I have to study very hard..
And I fall in love with the liberary in our school!!! I always stay there for a long time all day. By the way, listen to music there is also a good choice ~ (ha, ha)
