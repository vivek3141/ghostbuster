Last Friday, I passed final driving test at my driving school!!!!! I was really really happy ^ ^
After the test, I said my appriciation to a instructor who cheered me up when I failed the driving test once. Then, he was very pleased with my passing the test.
I was also happy that time.
Although I could graduate the driving school, I was a little sad because there were many kind instructors in the school.
Thanks to them, I could drive very safely. Thank you for all instructors in the school!!!! From now on, I 'm going to go to a driving center to take a writing test.
If I pass the test, I can get real driving license ^ ^
By the way, from tomorrow my university will start. ^ ^ ;
The long spring vacation will be end today.
I 'm very shocked.
I want more long vacation. ha - ha ^ ^
See you tomorrow!!
