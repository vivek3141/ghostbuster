I want to use the word" sensitivity" properly.
a ) I 'm lacking in the sensitivity to whether an expression is formal or informal. b ) I have to cultivate (enhance / enrich / sophisticate) the sensitivity to others ' feelings. Is there anything wrong with them?
Particularly I want to know which verb is incorrect in (b).
