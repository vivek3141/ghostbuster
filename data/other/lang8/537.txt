The primary reason that I watched this movie because I just wanted to relax for a little bit after knew we still can't get the annual bonus again this year. To my surprised, the movie, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, it has dramatic script with a little romantic, imagination, fantastic.
Plus, the movie scene inside looks couldn't be better. This movie is talking about two different American girls spent their summer to Barcelona where they have a romantic, unforgettable advanture. Mealwhile, they are still learning how to face some subject in their life. Movie's siprit seems give us a possibility that everything is possible, especially relate to love. When it cames to subject to the love, some people tend to relistic, some people are always expect something very different. For instance, one of the actress, she would not able to say what she want, but she knew what she didn't want however.
I can understand how's feel when people want to chase, find something in their life, but don't know what's exactly purpose. It's kind of helpless I think.
Therefore, whatever what kind of life you want, it's our choice. But I think most people in our country, we don't have enough encourage to change the situation, or sometimes we just carry more moral respnsibility. By the way, I also like the photography in this movie. : )
