A birthday party is going to hold in my son's nursery school this Thursday. The party is for the students who have their birthday in this month.
My son's birthday is January 8.
He has gone to this school for 5 years.
This birthday party is the last for him in his nursery school days.
He will become a elementary school student next April.
I will go to the party and say a word of celebration to him.
