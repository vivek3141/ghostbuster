Hi, Samaa!
How are you today?
Did you study hard? : - )
I guess I know that medical jargon is very difficult.
My younger sister was majored in biochemistry and I see it's hard to study too.
There is nothing easy in the world. : - )
Your birthday is past.
I will congraturate starting next year. On my birthiday, my friends arange the party, we gather together and then drink.
I don't like drinking very well but I say hello, he says let's drink if you have a time. : - (
Always, whenever...
Although I don't like drinking, I like meeting the friends. So I alway participate in it.
Well, how do you usually spend your birthday?
I'll will cheer you on. Bye until the next email.
From your friend.
