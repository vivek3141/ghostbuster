Today is holiday (National foundation day) One of my co - workers asked me" When is it enacted? A thousand years ago?" He was joking.
Other guy said" May be from Jurassic period??" Actually, I am not sure.
I think most of Japanese don't care when this holiday came from." May be 2000 years ago??"
Then I serched from Web site. According Wikipedia,
On that day, the foundation of Japan by Emperor Jimmu was celebrated based on Nihonshoki.
It was BC660.
Wow! 2670 years ago!?
But I think nobody knows it's true or not. and Nobody cares about that thing. Hahaha
