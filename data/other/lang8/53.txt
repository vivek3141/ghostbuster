Hello.
Yesterday I went to the stadium to see the baseball game.
After classes of university, I went back home directly, prepared packages and searched what time I should leave home and which trains I should take. I went there with my friends.
The team I cheer is located in second position.
And if the team win 8 games, the team will get first position. But remainder of its games is 9 games. Therefore it is so difficult for it to get first position. The game began.
The starting pithier was not good, so that the opposition could get 3 points easily. But in this attack they couldn't get any points.
So in this game we lost.
We cheered very hard, but the miracle was never happened. So today I have a sore throat.
That's about it for today.
See you again / /
