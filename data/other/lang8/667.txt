she is one of my favorite Japanese singer. I really like her songs especially a song following URL. She has stopped her activity for her sick and now take a long break. I really want her to be back and relase new songs someday. Her song give me energy especially when I feel kind of down. I think everyone have own faviriote song that make you feel better. I like both Japanese song called J - pop and forieng music. But Japanese musii is more confortable for me, maybe because it's easy to understand the meaning of lyrics. Speaking of lyrics in english song, it's very hard to lisiten and understand compared to converstion... I don't know why....
Does anyone feel the same way when you hear song written in your larning language? In the future hopefully my english become good and understand rylics.
