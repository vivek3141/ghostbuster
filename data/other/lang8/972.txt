People often say that I am always ready for fight. Actually, I know I am easily offended and I regretted to be rude to people. The other day, I found out that my cellphone was often likely to restart automatically at any time. So I went to cellphone shop and I questioned why it restarted by itself every time. The assistant said without feeling that he didn't know the reason and it needed to repair at head office. Also he mentioned that it might cost a charge. Then I totally get mad and I said," Huh! What do you mean by you didn't know at all?? You mean although I buy broken thing, I have to put in money? I can't understand. Forget it! I will ask someone else.
you are good for nothing!" In the end, this problem hasn't solved yet... and I need to be a gentleman.
