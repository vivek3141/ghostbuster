Nice to meet you.
I 'm Hiroyuki.
I 'm 25, and medical student at 5th grade. I live in Tottori, Japan.
Dose anybody know Tottori? I want to learn English more.
Today, I read a magazine on which lang - 8 is introduced. I have thought I want to improve my English, and I start it today. I don't know How to use this. But anything will do in several days.
