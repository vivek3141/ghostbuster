I 'm not interested in Buddhism, but yesterday I studied a little. I came to think that Buddhism might have profound teachings. Some memoranda about Buddhism
Buddha means a person who is spiritually awakened. When we would be in trouble, we would ask for someone's helps, for example, other people or gods.
However, even if we could solve the trouble, unless we would solve the root of the troubles, we would be in another trouble like that repeatedly. Buddha had known the root of trouble which are common in mankind. When Buddha would have helped people in trouble, he had thought not only the trouble in front of them, but also the whole trouble should have been solved......
Uhhh,,, It is too difficult for me....
I can not explain it.
