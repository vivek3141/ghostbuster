My stutent visa has been sent to my house from American embassy this morning. I 'm feeling easy now getting the visa although I knew there is no problem... It was first time to go to the American embassy. When I got there, I was so surprised that there are a lot of people wainting outside the embassy. More than 150 peaple were there. Only 6 people per one time can get into the little house next to the gate, and that's why we had to wait so long. I had been standing for 1 hours. I was lucky that day was not rainy or sunny.. it is midsummer now but it was cool in that day. Getting inside the house, The man checked me and my bag with the X - ray mathine. To my surprise, I had to left my cellular phone. and then, I finally could get inside the embassy. It takes more 30 minutes to have done all things inside. I needed to have an iterveiw and have my fingerprints took, too. All funitures of the building was Amerincan style. I feel like already being in U. S.
although it is Japan.
It was funny. Have you ever been to Japanese Embassy in your country? How was it? I guess you don't have to wait so long...
