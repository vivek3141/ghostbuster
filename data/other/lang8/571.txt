Yesterday, I played with my new friend.
I rode his motorcycle. And he took me many places that I've never been. I was so glad I could go to the sea with him.
It was an entirely new experience for me.
Riding motorcycle was not as scary as I thought. I 'm looking forward having a date with him again.
I heard he hasn't girlfriend. So I hope I can be his girlfriend...
