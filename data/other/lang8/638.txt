Today I sold my guitar today because I 'm going back to Japan soon and I can't afford to take my guitar to Japan. Now, I feel sad.
I bought my guitar 10 months ago and have played everyday before going to bed. My guitar is a cheap Epiphone SG guitar and It's just not bad enough to play.
However, I played it for a long time and have a strong attachment to it, so I felt sad when I get money from my customer even though I can't help losing it.
I think the more you play the instruments, the more the instruments have meaning like a friend, a sidekick or a partner.
I told my sister to play my guitars in Japan constantly because my instruments feel lonely. There is a fact that your instruments will go bad if you don't play them for a long time. that's because, I think, they feel lonely.
What should I do until I go back to Japan?
I will clean my guitar in Japan and play my guitar carefully not to damage it and cherish it.
