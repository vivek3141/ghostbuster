I 'm in Tokyo, which is the capital of Japan, right now. I actually flew to Haneda airport in Tokyo from Tokachi Obihiro airport.
I 'm on my way to Osaka to visit my parents ' house.
I attended the seminar on the way of thinking to make sentences in English. Many Japanese tend to translate literally what they want to say. In this seminar, it's more important to express what they feel.
For example, if I want to say that he is stubborn, I can say he never changes his opinion. I learnt I need to have more various point of view through this seminar. It seemed useful enough to expand my expressions.
After the seminar, some participants including the teacher and I went for a drink at a bar. We talked a lot and had a blast, and it was fun that one of the participants talked his experiences when he'd been in Germay. I'll fly to Kansai airport in Osaka in the morning.
It's about time I went to bed.
Incidentally, I write this entry with my iPhone!!
