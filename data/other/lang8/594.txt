My hair is divided on the left side. When I put down my hair, it is about the length to my middle back. I am planning to grow it longer best to my lower back. I do not have a lot of hair so I do a special perm to make the valume more.
I used to wear bang. Since I was told to reveal my forehead to have better luck, I grew the front hair and pull it to the side.
