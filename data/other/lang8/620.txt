My Kindle DX has come to my room from U.
S.!
I enjoyed experiencing this really novel device while charging its battery.
I think Kindle can change my reading experience.
However, the interface is not sophisticated as that of iPhone. I can't start to use it without a manual.
Moreover, the display speed is very slow so that I feel stress a little. Amazon should design Kindle to show the progress status clearly when it takes several seconds to finish some operation. Anyway, I have stepped into the new era of reading!
I 'm really looking forward to enjoy my reading life with it!
