On last Sunday I took an English ability test. There were some different kind questions to check writing skill ; writing your opinion freely, summarizing the reading passage or summarizing the listening dialogue. I was very bad at summarizing the listening dialogue. The result has not came yet, but it's obvious... Whenever I hear English dialogue, I can take the minimum information from it to decide what I should do next or what I should answer, but I can not repeat it using other words.
It means my understanding of English is just superficial and my English is very far away from" frequently".
I should do output more, maybe.
sigh...
