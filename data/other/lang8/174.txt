23rd October.
Suddenly, I've departed for DamYang is located in southern Korea with my camera. In my plan.
- First, I go to GwangJu by bicycle. - Second, when I arrive on GwangJu, I stay a nigt in GwangJu.
- In the early moring next day, I depart for DamYang.
- And I visit Metasequoia street, Bamboo park, River forest and Bamboo museum.
But....
My plan was break down at second.
That's why my bicycle was stolen at GwangJu.
Inevitably, I should go to DamYang by bus.......
Althogh I failed my plan and I was lonely, I 'm satisfied my travle because There is good landscape.
I 'm attaching some of photo is I've taken in DamYang.
