I would practice drumming in school days.
the practice played during short break between school hours. I didn't take drum set onto schoolroom.
a bass drum part played step of my shoes by floor instead of bass drum. a snare drum part played using pencil and desk instead of stick and snare drum. And some coins into pencil case played the part of cymbal.
I didn't play well, so I've never been impressed others. I was often scolded by my teacher.
My tackling tune was the type of music so - called progressive rock, like ' Yes. '
Specially, I would often played introductory passage of ' into the lens. ' The base guitar part of that tune synchronized rhythm of bass drum. At the same time, the keyboard part of that tune synchronized rhythm of snare drum. When I could do that, I feel some sense of accomplishment.
Now I hear that music again, that intro part still exited me, but I feel redundant the tune itself.
I feel recent pop music are brief and insatiable.
But, doesn't make me excite much...
