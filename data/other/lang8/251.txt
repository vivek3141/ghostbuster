I heve been a director of a company now. It is going to start 1st Feb. I must be busy, but I can not earn enough money.
I just want to consider a vision for my future.
I do not live my life with a lot of excuse.
By the way
My English friend now is staying at my house in Japan as homestay. We have been drinking so much alcohol everyday.
He might put on weight!!
His wife might be a little bit angry when he goes back to London.
Such a great fun days.
