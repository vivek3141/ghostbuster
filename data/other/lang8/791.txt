Maybe the autumn has becomed. It has rainned for three days, and the temperature drops to 18 degrees centigrade, It's cool now. I need to dress two clothes, but I feel comfortable. In the store, autumn fashion start to show off (sell), yet they're expensive, I can't afford the purse, It will breake the bank. In my opinion, It's a rip - off. I don't expect to live from paycheck to paycheck.
I'll buy the autumn fashion untill the price become cheaper (the store give a discount)
