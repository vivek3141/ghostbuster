My ex - boyfriend told me about this... about this moment, when you love the music that he loves, when you want to help him in any stupid thing, when you fall asleep with him in your head, when you're ready to kill your time only for him...
I never felt in this way with anybody else, but him...
I can't believe in it, because I used to love him in a different way...
