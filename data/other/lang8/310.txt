Do you know a hot - water bottle? It's a bottle made of plastic or other things (I don't know exactly.) in which you pour hot water. You put it in your bed on the cold night, so you can warm your feet and sleep very well. It's a wonderful article. Unfortunately, the other day, I've got a small hole in the one that I've used for several years. So I went to go shopping to buy another one. Fortunately, I found something better. It's a kind of a hot - water bottle, but there are cerry seeds in the bag. You put it in the micro - wave for 3min, and ready to be used! It was a little bit more expensive, but it will be soon my birthday. So I bought two, one for my feet and the other for my nec and shoulder. Good night. ^ ^
