Sometimes, When I get back from college, I feel that I can do absolutely nothing but watching a movie. I feel so exhausted but I can not sleep because If I slept then when I wake up, I'll have to start studying again or going to college. Watching a movie is like the fun pause between two busy periods.
Yesterday, I watched a movie called The Expendables.
It's an action movie.
It didn't wow me really, not like Inception anyway, because its story wasn't strong or strange enough.
It was very plain and straight forward.
The ending was great, though.
Jason Statham recited a piece of poetry that made it a funny ending.
There is only one line I didn't understand.
What is the"
Epidemy of Cool"?
Here is ending. Enjoy!
