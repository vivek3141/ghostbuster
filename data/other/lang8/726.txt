Today I had the plenty of time in the afternoon so I took walk aroung my hometown. At first I went return DVDs which I rent a few days ago. And then I went to a book store which sold the second - hand books. After that I went to the high school which I graduated to watch American Football.
In fact when I was a high school student, I belonged to American Football club. And also I played it for 3years.
I used to a representative American Footballer of my prefeture.... It's ir really true!! It was long long time ago though....
I said hello to my teacher who always took care of me there.
He hasn't been changed at all. He is totaly the same as before
When I was about to go home, it's going to be rain.... Soon after I arrived at my home,
It has been raining..
When is rain going to let off????
I don't like raining.....
I feel ache and itch on my arm and face skin...
Because I got sunburned before it started raining...
I shoukd avoid to taking a bath... I should use shower!!!
