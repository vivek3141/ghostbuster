It's two ten in the afternoon right now.
In fact, at this time, I 'm not supposed to write in my diary on Lang - 8. But, I 'm going to do it now, becuase my laptop is supposed to get repaired, and in a couple of hours, the mechanic is going to be here and pick up my laptop. So, there's not much time left.
Well, the reason why I call the repair is because big noise is made and screen often wave. It have been about eight months to purchase that, so any service is free. Oh god.
now here he's coming. I got ta get the intercom.
