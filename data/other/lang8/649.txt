Yesterday, I went to the Modern Thai Cuisine restaurant with my father and sister.
It was spicy but tasty. Also, We drank some beers which made in Germany.
The price was more expensive than other restaurant, but service was better. We got so full.
There was the music band played nice music. We had a good time.
I'd like to go to again.
