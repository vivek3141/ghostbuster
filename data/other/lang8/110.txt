I started learning English in the first class of my school, when I was six years old.
In Russia this language is an official program in all schools.
You can choose from three : English, French and German, but English is the most popular.
When I was 6, the year was 1993 and in my country we hadn't a lot of good teachers, because over many years before the people hadn't the possibility of treavelling abroad and no chance opportunity to practice language...
But my mother allways says that it's just a pretextes and nothing to prevent you if you have a purpose.
When I was thirteen, I changed schools and started to learn in a gymnasium.
Here all was different, and the teachers too.
In the first lessons of English I didn't understend anything - the teacher didn't say one verb in Russian.
It was horrible!
In the exersise of gramer, which I doing for an houars I can't do correct any sentence. I looked for every verb in the dictionary and cried...
But several times I passed my exam with" excellent".
But my grammar now is just pre intermidiate.
Then I learning english in the University.
I don't know why, but it's VERY hard for me...
I was the worst in my groupe (the worse group in course :) ) But then, little by little, I started to talk in English.
3 years I don't learn English hard, no have a practic, but I now how to wach the favorite films in the originale and how to reed books - it's wondeful!
And now I give the promise for myself, that I will learn english by the leavel entermidiate and more then this level, and I will never neglect it!
Because it very important ; I'll never get a good job without it and I'll never understand a half of a beautifule sites in the Internet! And I lake to drow in Photoshop and Illustrator, and many other things! PS.
