There was a fire drill at my school today.
It's assuming to a fire.
By the way, Is there the drill that assumes earthquake? As for the drill of Japan, earthquakes are more than fires, because Japan occurs of many earhquake. I am afraid to it.
There is this language in Japan." A earthguake, A thunder, A fire, A father" These are all scared. If there are mistakes in my sentence, please tell me. Good bye.
