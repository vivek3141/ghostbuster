Human is so weak so always want to believe something. In korea foreign missionaries have been succseefully brainwashed people. I living in a small city where total population is almost 200000. but In my city hundreds churchs are here. every holiday people come into my house tell me about god and if I don't believe in god I will go to the hell. yeah sweat hell.
our country used to believed in budha but since advanced countries opened our market by force 70 % of people are catholics and protestants even old mans starting to go to a church. I don't believe anything but me.
I don't want to blame a church or god but always people are making troubles.
It's good to go to a church but don't pushing others to believe it. if there is a jesus.
he might don't throw away atheists to the hell. he is a symbol of forgiveness.
just one reason I didn't belive him. am I going to the hell? hell no!
I 'm really good man.
I didn't harm anybody.
I always try to be good man. execpt when I was angry.
