When I was an enfant, my parents ran a supermarket so I was free whenever I want snacks.
After I enter an elementry school my parents change their shop to fried chicken restaurante. And after a few years, they changed menu to pork cutlet. And when I 'm in a middle school, it was changed to sushi restaurant.
All of my friends envyed me. And now they run grilled meet restaurante. I 'm not hungry even if I don't have money in a back pack travel time.
It used to somebody treat me.
When I had my fortune told on internet, I was died in early age because of hunger in my previous life. I guess that's why I always have a good fortune of eating.
