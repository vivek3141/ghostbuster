For the past 5 months I had been watching a Mexican telenovela called Teresa. It was the same old story about the poor girl that marries a rich guy because she's obsessed with money.
She was mean, she lied to her friends, and said her mother was dead cause she was embarrased of her humble roots. Plus, she dumped the rich guy and seduced his best friend, whom also happened to be her sister's in law boyfriend. So, in summary she was a tramp. Anyways, this past Sunday the novela ended. My family came to my house and we cooked carne asada we were all together to watch Teresa's last chater, we were hoping her to end homeless and lonely (like in the original version), but to our suprise she did 't. AAGHH!
It was so unfair, she kept the money and the guy. So, what did she learn? What was message, be a tramp and you'll suceed? So to end this entry I'll just cite Teresa's mom : Me das miedo Teresa... : P
