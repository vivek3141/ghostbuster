Yesterday I went cycling.
During the cycling, I stopped at some local public facility, where many trekkers took a rest. I was surprised to see many non - Japanese people there.
I wondered why so many people were walking there that I asked one of them. She told me that this facility was one of checkpoints of Oxfam Trailwalk. Participants walk 100 km within 48 hours in this event.
Actually the checkpoint I saw yesterday was that for 80 km. She said that they were waling another 20 km for the rest of the day. This event is also fund - raising event. If you want to join the event, you have to raise a certain amount of donated funds.
I was happy to see so many non - Japanese join the event,
as they might fear the nuclear crisis and aftershock of the 3. 11 earthquake. Some wore T - shirts on which some encouraging messages for Japan were written. If you are interested in this event, check the details here.
