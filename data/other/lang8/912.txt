Study with a group
As you know, there are two kinds of way to study. Study alone, and study with a group.
Many parents are saying that it is better to study alone.
However somebodies are claiming that study with a group is better than studying alone.
By the way, the reason why I am writing about this is because I am going to write an essay about this topic.
First of all, I think studying alone is better than studying with a group.
Here are the reasons.
First, we can concentrete well because if we study with a group, you will make many friends who are belonging to the group, and you can talk with you friends during studying.
But, if we study alone, there isn't person who can talk with us, thus we can concentrate on our study more better.
For example, if we study in a group, there isn't enough time to study.
You will talk with your friends, you and your friends want to play outside, but there aren't any parents who will mortify about this things, therefore you may play outside and don't study. However, if we study alone, normally we study in our home, so there isn't any partner to talk, although we really want to play outside, there isn't enough friends to play, and your parents will mortify about this. Next, we don't need to follow the subjects which they are studying, we can study the subject which is the thing that I can't do it very well because if we study in a group, sometimes we have to follow the schedule which we plan, thus we can't study which I can't do very much.
For example, I can't study the math very much, but I can study English very well.
However, in a group, they study just English very hard although we have to study the math very hard.
Because of these reasons, I think studying alone is better.
