Today, I made" Ozouni" again.
I made some mistakes but everyone expect for my father said it was good. They were really kind. My father, however, said" Oh, this mochi is really hard like a stone." as soon as he ate. Wasn't he rude?
While I cooked, he just slept. He should help or say nothing. I am still angry.
