Today the most famous fireworks festival was held in Omagari, Akita Prefecture in Japan.
I couldn't go to Akita to enjoy them but I watched TV. As of yet I haven't seen the fireworks neither TV nor real one. Today I realized next year I should go there.
Becuase they are so beautiful with beautiul music. How romantic!! ^ ^
