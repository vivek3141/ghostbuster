I am a person who enjoys her own leisure time.
And I want to live my life on my own pace. Sleeping as long as I want everyday.
But I found it hard to achieve recently.
Because when I finished my classes, homeworks or jobs etc... It's nearly 10 pm when I back home. And after I take a bath, brush my teeth, chat with my friends etc...
It's nearlly 12 pm. Afterall, I want to at least healthly sleep before 12 pm.
