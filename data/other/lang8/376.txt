I've been working at a private school for about 6 years.
I teach elementary children ~ high school students English and math.
To teach children is very difficult for me. Because they're so powerful that I can't sometimes control them. But also I often get a power from them. So in turn, I want to give them the ability to pass their exams or something.
I think I must be more tough and study harder to see their smile. It's March and the season for entrance. I met many newcomers.
They all look gentle and good children. I 'm willing to do my best for them.
