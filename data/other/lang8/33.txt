Several days ago, I got an irregular heartbeat for the first time in my life! It was like this ; I suddenly started to feel a kind of discomfort around my heart. Then I checked my pulse and found that there was a missing beat at intervals.
I was very scary because I had been very healthy so far. I thought," It's so terrible!
I 'm still in the 20's. Do I have to get along with it all my life?" Then I went to the hospital and took an ECG.
The doctor told me that I did have a irregular pulse ossacionally but it was not a fatal one. He added that it could get worse due to stress and fatigue, and he just advised me to take an enough rest. I was releaved to hear the doctor's diagnosis but I 'm still worried. I didn't know that stress could induce an irregular heartbeat of a healthy young lady like me!
As the old saying goes, all illness comes from the mind.
