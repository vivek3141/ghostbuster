I believe and we can make money by trading Tokyo stocks according to the following roles :
1.
Japanese stocks fall afternoon of Friday and get back every Monday morning, because many Japanese traders are more pessimistic than others.
So it is good time to buy stocks Friday afternoon and sell them Monday morning.
2.
The movement during the first 30 minutes after the stock market opening is controlled by the dominant tendency made by the US traders.
3.
The stock prices rise on the next days after Japanese national holidays, vacation weeks (April 29th to May 5th in spring ; around August 15th in summer ; 19th o 23th September in fall ; 28th December to 3rd January in winter).
So primarily we can buy stocks at the day just before the vacations and sell them at the next days after holidays except the year end.
In the case of the year end, we need to sell stocks whose quotes are lower than the original ones because we can reduce the capital gain tax by reporting the loss to the Japanese IRS.
4.
The best time for buying stocks is 10 : 30 or 2 : 30, whereas that for selling stocks is 9 : 00 to 9 : 05 or 2 : 55 to 2 : 59.
