It's been very hot around here these days. It's hard to sleep even for a single hour without using air conditioner. Last night, I sweated a lot so I put all the clothes around me into wash machine. I woke up feeling refreshed this morning and found no trousers in my room. Great! Everything seemed perfect. I got trousers as cold as water. I thought that I would be able to concentrate on work for today. Please don't say where I am posting this entry. Obviously, the effect of the new - type trousers lasted only two hours.
