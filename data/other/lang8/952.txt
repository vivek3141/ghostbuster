Just the other day, I went on a field trip to four different high schools to listen to thier explanations about their schools.
The trip for parents is hosted every year by my son's jounior high shcool, but this was my first time to attend one.
My son is in his last year of junior high school.
Early next year he will be takeing entrance exams for high schools.
He has to dicide which shcool he wants to go to but he isn't sure yet.
So on his behalf I went to check these schools.
I was very surprized to see how high shcools have changed since my school days.
They have various subjects such as the care for elderly, which we didn't have in our school days.
Later that day, we discussed the schools over dinner.
My son seemed to be interested after he read the leaflets the schools handed out.
I think it was a really good opportunity for my son to think about high schools.
Listening to explanations, going up and down stairs, and travelling form room to room was really trying, but I was satisfied with the results when I saw my son's face at dinner.
