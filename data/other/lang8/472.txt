Yesterday I was given lots of e mails by my friends and presents by my parents. X )
It was the happiest day. : ) xx
Today I went to a public swimming pool center with my brother, and swam about 2 kilometers!!
It was tiring. haha
After that, I went to a cram school. I have been so lazy for these days that the class seemed to be difficult. : (
I think I should study at least an hour every day then.. lol
And in 2 hours I am going to one of my friends ' house, azabujuban and meet up
some our classmates.
I can not wait that. Thank you.
