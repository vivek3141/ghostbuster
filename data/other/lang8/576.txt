Today, my favorite mogul player run of the final game.
It is fourth time for her to participate the Olympic game. The result of her first olympic in Nagano Japan, was the 7th place, the second's one in saltlake city U. S was the 6th place, third's one in Torino Italy was the 5th place.
Her performance and condition were better than she was and other players, but the result was 4th place. I was hoping she would be a medalist. After the game she said" I couldn't reach the medal but I did it and I did my best." That made me think I would support her ever though I am not ure that she will continue to play mogul. Anywany, I think it's going to be an excitig Olympic.
