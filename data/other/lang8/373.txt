It starts the new fiscal year from April in Japan. At my workplace too, the personnel changes were made it public. So my immediate boss will move the other post. And I get to take the job over from her. I worry about the new job.
Can I do it well?
Beside, I have to hand mine over to new comer from the day after tommrow...!
Oh my... (+ _ + ;)
I 'm working late at the office lately. I need time more. I have few time to study English. Are there any funny planning on April fool around you?
