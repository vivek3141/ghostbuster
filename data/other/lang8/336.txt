My bro will enlist into military. I have only one brother.
he is.
Korea is divided into South korea and North korea. thesedays international news are not good for everyone who live in korea. (you know the YeonPyeongDo's news) So, my family and my relations are worried about him. But, he just said that every man in korea should go to the military, except the disable. So, don't worry about me. He joked" Please buy meat for visiting, esp chichen, dakgalbi..." He is so cute.
kk...
I looking forward to recomeback to home... he will dischange at 2013... OMG!
how long do we have to wait for him?!
