Tonight, I went to the curry resutaurant with my friend. There are some Indians only, but they can speak Japanese and we can communicate with them. Keema curry and cheese nan tastes very good! But the nan is thin and wide, so it gets cold in a minute. And if you drink water After eating the nan, it absorbs water, and become bigger and bigger in your stomach. Oops!
Do you have a favorite Japanese food? I recommend a Japanese food ' Tempra ' : ) Thank you for reading!
