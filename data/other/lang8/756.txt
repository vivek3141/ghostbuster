Today, I should present a general assembly of youth YMCA. Frankly speaking, it is not so strict as we think, because the assembly is held by young students from 15 to 19. I 'm 20 years old, but I took a role that teach them what they should do in youth YMCA. I've been a member of youth YMCA since I was 14 years old (in Korea). But As I graduate from the highschool and go to a university, I'll begin to be in activity in different place, and with different people and different way. So this assembly maybe the last activity I do in this town. Being a student I'd been stuck in youth YMCA, the fact that I should leave there makes me miss it. However, I'll do best in this assembly, and deliver what I'd felt while I had been a member of YMCA as I can. I am also in great hope that I can experience a new things.
