I have been using a Swiss army knife for over 6 years.
This knife has very good quality, and is pretty handy as well. One day, having noticed that I used a screw driver on the knife, a friend of mine told me that it was illegal to carry a knife in public areas." How come?", I asked," I consider this thing as a tool, not a weapon." The friend then told me a story of a man's dismay about a knife :
The man was working on his backyard, installing sods.
He used a long kitchen knife to cut sods.
On a break, he walked to a nearby convenience store for a cup of coffee, with the knife in hand.
On his way to the store a neighbor saw him with the knife and called the police immediately. The police came really quickly and stopped him on the way back home.
The man was almost arrested.
But I still think it is alright in my case, because first, the blade of my knife is only 2. 5 inches long, and second, if I put it in my pocket without letting others notice that, no one will feel threatened thus the police won't come and bug me.
