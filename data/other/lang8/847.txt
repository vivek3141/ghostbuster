Recently, I often watch" FRIENDS", American drama series. For fun and for studying English.
Some magazines recomended FRIENDS for English learning. Because, its wording is not so difficult and they speak natural English. As a matter of fact, it is easier to listen to and understand what they say than other dramas such as" BONES" (in which there are too many technical terms). And I enjoy it very much because the story itself is very funny. But one problem,,, Jokes are sometimes very difficult, especially blue jokes. They require us to have cultual backgrounds or unique vocabulary. It reminds me of an episode. When I took part in a social party with business partners,
a man told a joke but I only saw him blankly. I could understand what he said, but I couldn't understand what is the laghable point.
In the future, when I will be able to enjoy every jokes in FRIENDS, it's the time I really acquire English skills.
