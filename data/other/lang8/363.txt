I worked for 8 hours yesterday as well! : D
Ooh ~ I 'm earning lots of money. It's a sedentary job and I think it's my cup of tea : ) You know, because I suck at dealing with customers, or work that requires a fair amount of communication with the other workers! I'll keep working until the end of this month.
Looking forward very much to seeing how much money I can get all by myself X ) AND!
About 3 days ago I wrote a diary entry which goes : Yesterday was... not my day.
I found myself unexpressed at many bits of the day : ( I received a helpful comment telling me that it didn't make sense.
Does" I found myself not fully expressed by me" make more sense?
I used the word" bit" as" a short period of time" or something like that. (It's the British way of using it, I think.) Someone, please help me out ~!
Thank you for reading all this! ^ ^
