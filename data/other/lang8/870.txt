Latterly, I've had a runny nose. Sneeze seems to be my routine. I always sneeze day and night. In fact, I am allergic to cold air so every time, if someone switch on the AC, I will sneeze later. But this time, the reason why I sneeze all the day is not only cold air.
A few days ago, I plucked the hair in my nose as it was too long. Maybe, I assume that I hurt the cell of my noise wall. The most exaggerated thing is that the tissue I used to blow my nose become moist towelette. I know that it was very disgusting.
But I wonder if it can be cured with time.
