I met my conversation partner (student tutor) named Amanda for the first time. She is an adorable freshman majoring in psychology.
Actually, we were supposed to meet each other last Saturday, but she forgot about our meeting.
(She stood me up!) I thought that it could happen, because we set a time at the beginning of the last week. For that reason, I really looked forward to seeing her. On the first day, we did not work on any chapter of the textbook. She did not bring it, because she thought it is more important to get to know each other. First and foremost, we introduced ourselves.
I told her about my country, age, family, job, hobbies, major, etc.
She asked many questions about what I had just said.
She is 19 years old.
It means she did not reach the legal drinking age yet. Even though we have a big age gap, I think we can be good friends.
The weakest part of my English proficiency is speaking English.
I have no thick accent according to her, but lack of language complexity.
I have a difficulty making long sentences and can not keep talking about one specific topic. Thus, we will work on each chapter and then share respective ideas from next meeting.
I asked her to correct my mistakes and errors.
She also asked me to feel free to ask whatever I want to know. I learned a new word, lactose intolerance, which is my digest problem.
She recommended me to use AOL instant messenger.
I can make a screen name on that messenger.
Also, she introduced her omega sorority organization.
She let me know her cell phone number and I did the same. We set a future schedule and said good - bye to each other. Today was very fun to me.
