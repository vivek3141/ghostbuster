Today, I got on train. And then, priority seats were all taken by girls.
There is an instruction" Please turn off your mobile near the priority seats."
But all girls was using them mobile. And train crews didn't tell them to stop using your mobile. It was unbelivable for me.
But I couldn't say anything to them.
