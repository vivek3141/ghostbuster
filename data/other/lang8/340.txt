Sometimes I really feel frustrated when foreigners and I can't understand each other.
It seems like, we both can speak English, but we can't reach each other's heart.
The words spoken out of mouth is strengthless, and eye contacts are full of confusion. It reminds me of the Bable story, God seperates people with different languages, and people are never united as one any more because of the languages, then the world is full of suspiciousness and frustration. I really hope God didn't do it.
But it's the fact, there's no time to complain to God.
Bravo for our hard work in English!
Keeping going!
