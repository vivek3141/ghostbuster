I feels that the spring have arrived here overnight, for the simple reason that the temperature in recent days even rise to 20 degree during the day. however, there was a heavy snow on 12nd, april last year and the snow remained until the end of the month. but so far, only a little part of snow in the corner where the snow sheltered from shining directly in the day. According to the natives, they had even experienced snowing in may when they were young. now the weather is becoming more and more extremely. The weather forecast said that there will be rain in the following days.
