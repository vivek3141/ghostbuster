Today I went to see an English speech contest at university. 7 students paticipated in it and they were great ^ ^ Some students didn't memorize their script enough not to see it but still I thought they made a lot of efferts. Topics were all different, global warming, internet game addiction, suicide and so on. I couldn't catch all the words that participants were speaking but I enjoyed it and it was really informative for me to listen to advice from judges. Good night.
