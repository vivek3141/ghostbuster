How old were you when you first went on an errand?
Today, I enjoyed a TV program about little boy's or girl's first errands. Children who appear on this TV program laugh, cry and go shopping.
Their parents send children on their first errand. It's so funny really.
This TV program reminds me of my first errand. haha.
