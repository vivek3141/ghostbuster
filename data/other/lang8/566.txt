I 'm writting my first post, and I need to your help to explore my english. My friend Rafael, said in one of his lasts post, that he only can study in a perfect notebook. He's a very funny guy, and I meet him when we was only five years old until now. Untilthis start year, he was my classmate, and he suggested me this website. In my point of view, it's a complicate website, but I think if I practice, I can use so goos this site, and finally reach my objec. I'll apreciate who correct my text,, and thaksssss (a lot of " S " it's a internet form or expression that we use a lot in MSN, here in Brasil)
