I haven't kept a diary for about a month... : - (
I'll do that from now on.
Today, I went to my uni and studied French.
It's difficult for me, but fun because my French teacher is funny!
After that, I went shopping with my friend.
She lives in Tokyo to go to a uni she selected, so we haven't seen each other for a while. But she hasn't changed : - )
We talked a lot of things and cracked up : - > We had a great time!!
I 'm really looking forward to seeing her again!
Tomorow, I have to take a test... omg!!
There are many things to do, but I think it's a good thing for me to do many things!
