Whenever I think about job - hunting, I feel soooo anxiety. I want be a children forever... Is this Pater Pan syndrome? By the way.
I think a defination of adult is different in the world. In Japan," adult" is from 20 years old tentatively.
But maybe there will be many countrys that definate" adult" more early age. Now I 'm 18 years old, so I 'm adult possibly in other country. It's amazing!
