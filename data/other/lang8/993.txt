Today I did part - time job from 8 to 4.
So I had to arrive in the place where I worked at 8.
But When I leaved my home, I would be late. But!
The bus that I wanted to get on was was late to. As a result I was able to get on the bus, and I was just in time for job. I felt relieved.
I 'm doing the same job tomorrow.
I should get up earlier.
Thank you ^ ^
