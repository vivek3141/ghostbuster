Hi, all.
Would you please tell me what is the natural way to ask someone for a favor, especially when we have a question, like what I am doing. Checking a lot of forums about English usage, I noticed that many questioners add a thanks phrase at the end of their questions, like," Thanks in advance for your help," or just" Thanks." Japanese usually don't say in this way but instead we use a different form of phrases to finish a favor. Thanks in advance of your great help.
