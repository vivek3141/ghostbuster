Hello everyone!
Today I come here to learn more about English writing skill. Although I have studied English for many years, writing a essay is hard for me. So I think writing once a day can help my English ability. I have seen some people diaries. They are good at their second language.
I really envy them!
Expect I will pass through the difficult.
By the way, if you have problems at Chinese, I can help you. Thanks
