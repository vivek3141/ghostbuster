THe more and more I have good relationships with my friends, it is much harder to say good - bye to them. Recently, my English teacher left Japan, and another teacher is leaving Japan soon. In fact, I have good relationships with them, so I miss them so much.
I would have difficulty getting over this great sadness. How does everyone get over the grief? I have no ideas.
But I will cherish our precious memories.
I began to wonder about relationships.
I realized that if I am in love with a certain man, there will be when I have to say good - bye to the man. Even if we love each other, or no matter how we attract each other... I am confused by romance relationships recently. How sad season it is!!!
