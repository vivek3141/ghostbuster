No one person has received more praise and abuse than Steven Jobs, who is the CEO of APPLE & PIXAR corporation, as well as has being cover person over 200 famous magazines. I was astonished by Jobs's lecture spoken in Stanford University in 2005, which including three stories, and tell us should follow our heart to find our goals. The first story is connecting dots.
Although his parents eagerly wanted him to enter a University, but when he really became a freshman, Jobs lost himself.
He didn't know what's the meaning of continuing his study in a college which fees is so expensive that cost most parts of his parents ' money. So he decided to drop out.
Instead of this, Jobs started to drop in the calligraphy class in his college, which supplied the one of best calligraphy training in the whole country. At that times, he just interested in this class but have not awared of the importance. Until did he creat the first APPLE computer, all the effects what he had done before came back. Only did you trust something what followed your heart as well as work hard, one day when you looking back, you can clearly know the secrets of these dots you have done. The second story is about love and loss.
He was expeled on the grant scale from APPLE, which company was created himself. Nevertheless, he said that he has been reject, but he still love. Dramatically, these striking things let him found his dreamboat, established a new company : NEXT, purchased PLXAR and became the CEO of APPLE again. According this story, I was inspired by his courage to start over.
So don't settled, keep looking your love. The third story is about death.
He has been diagnosed with cancer.
Jobs described the situation of the examination.
He survived luckily.
And then he learnt stay hungry, stay foolish and facing everyday with an utter innocence.
