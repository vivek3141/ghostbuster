Today, I read" The catcher in the rye" as a summer homework. To say the truth, I could not understand why this book is thought a masterpiece. Because I didn't feel bored when I was reading it, but I was not so excited or moved. But I like the characters in the book, because they are very characteristic.
If you had read the book, please tell me which part you think interesting.
