I often get on the airplane for business trip. When the airplane sways, Japanese CA always say" We are going through a turbulence just now, but it ` s not problem about our flight" I always wonder why they can say that.
Because none foresees nature perfectly.
So, thire saying give me a more fear. I think they shouldn ` t mention about flight detail!
