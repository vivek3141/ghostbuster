I have worked for an American company for 4years. All of my colleague are bilinguals. Ofcource each English levels are different but my company requires at least 730 toeic point. Therefore, our employees English level is higher than other Japanese companies. Other countries, for exapmle Germany, most of business people can speak English rather than Japanese. Hence, 730 toeic points are common for them. But the accent of English is not associated with Toeic score. Even if people who have 900 toeic score, their pronunciation is not good. I found this fact when I jumped in this company. A woman colleague can write English e - mail very well but her speaking has very strong Japanese accent. This trend is vice versa.
It's difficult for us to improve the pronunciation only by reading or writing foreign language. If you want to improve it, you should practice vowel and consonant sounds.
For instance, F sounds is completely different between American and Japanese.
For American, Japanese" Futon" is a misterious sound because shape of mouse for" Fu" is different between American and Japanese.
