Today I watched a DVD which title is" Akai - ito" is my favorite!! Do you know it??
I have watched three times!! If you study Japanese, I recomend it!! When I watched it alone in my room because I 'm easily impressed.
I enjoyed watching!!
During watching it, my tears run down my face...
The finally this movie is happy end but the middle of scene I was so sad. After watching I drove my car with my mom, older brother, younger brother, my younger sister and I. I went shoppping because we had to buy some foods and drinks because our refrigerator was empty : ( After shoppig I cooked lunch!!
It was so fun because I love cooking ; )
