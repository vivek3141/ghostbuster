I was gotten a old laptop PC from my mother last month because my mother bought a new PC. But the running of the PC installed Windows XP is very slow...
^ ^ ; ;
So I installed a new OS called" Ubuntu", which is a linux distribution and free, to be fast the running than former one. As a result, It worked. ^ o ^ /
The PC using Ubuntu is running well as if it is a new PC! And I am writing this entry on it with hearing a music. Maybe, Microsoft may have any crisis!?
