Today, I moved my house. I get my room finally!! I was a homeless that stayed Hi - hostel in winnipeg downtown. I arrived here 6 days ago, my visa is working holiday (permit). so I really needed my room. because the hostel was expensive $ 29 for a day. but my room is just $ 300 for a month and really near downtown!! so my body is light now : ) my english real poor so I can't believed that I 'm alive here for 6 days.
but I have to get my job. please ~ : ) I wanna work as baker or... server..
I 'm a man shit.
even my english is low level.. but I will do my best. plz good luck : )
And I have questions.. is this right sentence?? ' Are you interesting your job? '
' What is cooking Jessica? '
let me know. Thankyou : )
