Today Yukio Hatoyama, who is a new Japanese prime minister, started a new cabinet.

Amazingly, in Japan, the prime minister has recently changed every year. Jyunichiro Koizumi was probably the most well - recognized prime minister in the US.
He was very close to former President Bush, and the relationship between US and Japan has became pretty well since that time.
Most American people hated Bush, though.
Anyway, we have already had four primeministers since Koizumi. Mean while, there was obviously only one new President in the US.
We can not directly discuss this fact because those political structures are very different.
However, it is true that Japanese politics was not stable these days.
This can result in the frequent change of our leader.
Japanese people are now expecting the new leader, and a new era. Thanks for reading.
