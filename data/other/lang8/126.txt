So many MMA fighters thought I want to be more stronger than I thought. This is the most necessity thing for them but my opinion is deffrent from them. Even if they are strong but they sometimes counldn't win. Because MMA is sports but they shouldn't think MMA is sports. There are a fighters who don't think MMA is not sports and if they seems to lose the fights they are going to try to kill their competitor and so that sometimes the strong lost by the weak. I want to say is no future in just only the strong. Fedor who is Russian, I think he is the one of them. He is called the one of the best fighter in the world.
