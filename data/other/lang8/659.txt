I have spent a week in Canada.
But, I feel little difference between Japan and Canada because there are many Japanese students who belong to my same college at university, which I 'm staying. It's meaningless studying abroad, though I want to practice conversation in English. Then, I am not good at hearing and conversation. I feel stressed when I talk to someone in English, so I am confused.
Does enyone tell me the way to progress with conversation skill?
