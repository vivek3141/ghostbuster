That means weekend is just around corner. I like that.
This weekend, my family will be held party to celebrate my dad's birthday. I should buy a present for him.
I am not decided yet but must set up for it at least this afternoon. I am thinking about sports wear to buy for him to encourage him to do work out. I hope that he likes them.
