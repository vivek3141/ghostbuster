I visit my cousun hause last weekend. She got married with her co - worker last summer, and they ` ve lived together since then.
Honestly, I worried about their newly married life. She was poor at housework at one time because her mather took care of her so much. I understand her mother because she was her the only daugher.
But, it was just groundless.
The room was kept clean, and she cooked well.
Before everything, her Mr.
Right was a completely Kiwi Husband.
He was Japanese, but he did housework more than his wife.
I felt sorry, but his dish was betther than her... Some foreigner tend to think that Japanese men don ` t keep house at all, and women work for their husbands devotely. But, I think it is an old story.
Some men doesn ` t do housework still now, but most of them help with household chores. It ` s a few husband who do all af housekeeing like New Zealander, but more and more men began to be interested in their home. Actually, one of my dad ` s hobby is pressing shirts with iron on Sunday. It ` s not work but hobby for him. Tnat ` s why, I want to insist for foreign women." Don ` t feel that it is worst to get merried with Japanese guy!" And it is for foreign men," Do not expect too much to get married with Japanese women."
