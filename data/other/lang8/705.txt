This picture is of baby tomato in my kitchen garden. I grew some plants of tomato, eggplant and green pepper in April. It was uncertainly weather in this spring, and I worried whether their plants grow up well. Fortunately, some plants of tomato have many fruits. I 'm looking forward to eating them.
