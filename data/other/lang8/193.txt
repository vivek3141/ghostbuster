By the great big earth quake in March 11, Japanese energy policy has changed drastically. Many people claim that" we should not use nuclear power plant!!" It's true that radiation pollute people or vegetables, soil, air and sea more or less. However, I don't think that nuclear power plant should stop immediately. According to today's newspaper, if we continue current policy, (now 34 power plants are stopped among 54) it is definitely Japanese economic make worse.
Because if we can't use electricity fully, electricity fee will increase and some corporation decide their factory to move foreign country. Then, Japanese employment will face great big difficulty. Most of Japanese people can't speak English. So if we lose our employer, we can't have job! The important point is" order".
I agree that Japanese energy souse will change to natural resource but I advocate that our most important thing now on is to ensure of our electricity.
After that, we change our electricity souse to natural one. We don't have to change our energy policy if we can't do that safely. From this reason, I don't agree that nuclear power plant should stop immediately.
This is the thing which often Japanese wives say" Which is important I ' am or your work!". It's same question.
