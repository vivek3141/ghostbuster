Hi everyone it's been a while since I wrote the last diary here. I'd like to write about my first Halloween.
We don't celebrate ancestors or dead like the way western people do.
My city has Gozan no okuribi.
But it's like
I had a so much fun this Halloween.
On Friday I was Scream and on Saturday I was a blond hair girl. It remind me high school festival. I saw a lot of funny costumes on the street which has a lot of clubs.
What I found through clubing as a girl is some guys are so disgusting!! Especially one guy who try to dance with me was so disgusting!! He was getting too close and touch my ass with his leg even I 'm a man. Here is a funny story.
On Saturday we went to a club after drinking.
The club has some small stages and I was dancing on it then a guy came to dance with me. He didn't notice that I 'm also a man.
After 5 or 10 minutes dance, at last he noticed I 'm a man. He was like ' OMG!! ' n hold his head. Anyway I enjoyed a lot!! How was your Halloween??
What was your costume??
How do you deal with that kind of guy in a club??
Thank you for reading!! : )
It would be great if you leave a comment or corrections.
