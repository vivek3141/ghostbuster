Good evening!
Yesterday I wrote about my changes a little bit.
I want to write the one of the biggest changes tonight. That is not living with my parents.
It is natural, but I have had life with my parents for 27 years. I was depended on my parents, and influences from my parents was large. I believe my action was limited within my parents allowed. So now I 'm feeling so free as if I were a bird leaving a nest. That is good for me.
Fortunately my hasband don't interfere me. Now after marriage, six months passed. And then I started two things, because I felt I can do anything. I want to write about new things next time.
