I kind of thought that, as long as I write something in english, someone correct my english while sleeping. haha
but I guess thats too good to be true. and thats kind of sad coz this is about interacting with real person. not with computer programs.
I guess I have to take an action in order to find someone to correct my english? yeah let me find someone who needs my help. someone who is studying japanese in this case? alright where are they? can I just say hello to them? or add them? hmm...
isnt it kind of awkward. you dont have to correct my english. just tell me how to use this website first!
