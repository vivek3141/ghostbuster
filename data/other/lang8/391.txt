Today I had a GABA's lesson with a new teacher who was from England. It was our first lesson, so we made conversation to get to know each other.
First I asked him some basic questions, like" where are you from?"," what is your favorite Japanese food?"," What is your hobby?" One of his hobbies was cooking then we talked about cooking and foods. He said that there were many Indian curry restaurants in England and they were very popular.
I was very surprised that England people liked very hot curry. Instead I talked about my favorite Indian restaurant in Ikebukuro. I liked it very much and one of my friends used to go there three times a day.
He was surprised too.
