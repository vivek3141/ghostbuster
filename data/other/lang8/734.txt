Few last days have been strange. Since I've came back home, I 'm feeling very lonely. My mother and brother are in Italy, my father's recently working almost whole day out of town and I can see him only for a while every day. Friends I'd like to see are all out of town too. At first I thought it will be great to have so much time only for myself and my hobbies, but I gradually found out it's not that easy. Since I have so much time, I do things I'd never expect myself to do at the beginning of summer holiday. For example yesterday I read study about the space elevator project (I have no idea why, but I found out I feel an aversion for it. ..) and now I 'm trying to understand the superstring theory.
And I absolutely don't know why am I doing such a thing, because I've never been interested in it. I simply must keep reading.
Tomorrow I 'm having a Japanese lesson after a long time. I 'm very happy about it, also because my teacher is a very good friend. I 'm looking forward to long unnecessary chatting again ^ _ ^
