Yesterday, Japan national soccer team played against Australia. The game was the final of Asia Cup in 2011. Five days ago, Japan team played 120 minutes, including extra times, against South Korea, furthermore, the average of height of Australia team is taller than Japan. So I thought most of the Japan members are tired and the game is very hard for Japan team. As I thought, the game was very hard for Japan.
The game was into extra time two times in a row from semi - final game for Japan. However, at 110 minute, Lee, who came off the bench, got the goal! He became" the Cinderella boy", or the hero, overnight.
I 'm very glad to win Japan team!
