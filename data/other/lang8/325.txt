Usually, I don't wear glasses often even though my eyesight is bad enough to bug me.
I know I should wear them but they make me look like an idiot. People tell me to where contact lens but I think it makes my eyes unhealthy absorbing tears in my eyes. Truthfully, I have lost more than five pairs of lens so it is never worth it. I think my bad eyesight is due to that I like watching, reading, and writing. I like talking also but after I broke up with my ex - boyfriend, It is also like I lost my best friend to talk to.
All of my good friends moved to a distant place for reasons. Back to my eye sight, I feel like it is getting worse lately.
I 'm very concerned with it. I have heard of that mongolian people's eyesight is very good due to the no buildings and no monitors environment. They always see a distant not like us. Anyway, someday, I want to get lasic if it can improve my eyesight causing no side effects.
