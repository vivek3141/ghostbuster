I am always wearing a pedometer. Every day, I look forward to record the distance walked. Yesterday, I took off my pants leaving pedometer in the pants pocket.
My wife washed it without knowing the pedometer in the pocket. After washing, the pedometer didn't work.
Even before, she accidentally washed iPOD in a pocket and iPod didn't work. My wife said" You are wrong leaving something in the pocket."
I said" You are bad to wash without checking nothing in the pocket." Who is wrong?
