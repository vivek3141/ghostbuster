May it is sunny tommottow... I 'm planning to go climbing the mountain with friends tommorow. I wish it'll be sunny.. or cloudy may be better because I don't want to burn my skin so much.
The mountain is called" OOYAMA" which means a big mountain.
It is said from long time ago that you can be healthy and happy or your wis come true if you climb this mauntain. On the top of mountain, there is a shrine contracted in 700's. We, friends since Junigor high scholl, are very interested in this legend. Water, lunch, and own wish will be packd in our each backpack. Because it has been raining for 3days, I made" TERUTERU - BOZU" wishing sunshine. They say it'll be sunny if you make" TERUTERU - BOZU".
It is old custom to make it in Japan although only children do it in these day.. so I may be child.

Usually tit is hung under the roof, but I could ' nt do it. Phot No2 shows what TERUTERU - BOZU is like. is is made of paper and has eyes and mouth looking like joy.
They looks lik swimming in the watery sky now, but tommorrw.. they will be dancing in sunshine! ^ ^
