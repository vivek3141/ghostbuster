Lang - 8 is a language learning site.
I found it recently.
The site is really good because many people who learn second or third language in there and all of us help each other ; correct our each writing. Until recent I had given up writing continuously several times, however the site is like a social community and I can visit there as possible I can. So I could keep writing more frequently. As my friend in the site say, I need to read more English writing. I tried that before but I could not find any interesting writing in the books from the library.
And the other day I found an interest article in a magazine at a coffee shop.
The article was about a girl who had New Zealand father and Japanese mother. She hate her looking until she was teenager. But later she found about her beauty herself and became a fashion model. I was impressed about her story. After that I am thinking magazines are good for reading, but I can not afford to buy new magazines and I do not want to read old magazines from secondhand shops. However I might have to buy new magazine sometimes. Do you know any good English magazine?
