Hello, I 'm a new here. This is my first message for a test.
I was a little bewildered when I first saw this site.
But then I realized it was the interesting one ; therefore, I have registered here. As of my English, I've been learning it for already 1 year.
People say I 'm making a big progress, but I don't think so. Because my spoken English is still poor. I often talk to native speakers, but as a matter of fact, I don't understand them too much. What would you advise me?
Thank you in advance.
