Do you like making a plan to do something?
I like making a plan, but I can't fulfill my plan. For example, I like making a schedule of one day.
I write something to do for one day on a notebook, and I try to fulfill them.
For three days I can keep my schedule, but after three days I can't do that.
I think I 'm a lazy person, so I tend to choose an easy way. I want to do many things for one day. Maybe I 'm greedy, and want to try too many things.
On the other hand, I think I spend too many hours to use a computer. I like checking SNS sites.
It is fun indeed, but it is waste time for me. If I quite checking sites so many often, I think I can save my time more. Then I can do another things.
I need to reconsider about how to use a time. Though I 'm not good at using a time at all, I want to try to be good at using a time. I must make a good schedule which I never give up on it way to. I want to have more strong mind to keep my schedule, and I want to control a time, not time control me.
