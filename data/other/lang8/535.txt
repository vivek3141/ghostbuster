I bought a New Laptop today. Because My PC was Broken. I will take a lesson of English on Skype this weekend. So I need a PC or a laptop definitely.
I went to a shop and I picked a cheap laptop.
But just now I try to hear my voice on Skype. It's so bad.
I could take a lesson smoothly this weekend. I am worried about it.
