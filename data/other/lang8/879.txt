We didn ' meet for a long time. My friend is working on bank and I am studying examination. I was very nice to see her. We were talking about many things. She has been toughing to work but looking for something special. Like her dreams in her mind. I delighted her's word I told her" Girls to be ambitions." Wow!!
Also I do my best to come true for my dreams. I thought that dreams come true is difficult and need to hard effort. I thought that I was read one of book at a library." Dream is eating beads of sweat (your effort), not a rainbow."
