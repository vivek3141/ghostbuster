My office is near by a botanical garden. So sometimes I go there to have a lunch. I usually buy breads and drink, and bring it to there. In the garden, there is also a small restraint. Having a lunch under cherry blossoms is a fantastic experience! Moreover, a small mountain and a lake is also near by my office. It takes about 5 minutes by bicycle. There is also cafe & dinning by the lake. Sometime, I take a hotdog and a couple of coffee. Or another time, I eat TAKOYAKI, a kind of snack which is famous in western area of Japan. In spring, I can see a new branch of trees. In autumn, I can sleep on many fallen leaves.
Having a lunch in the atmosphere is very comfortable. In this way, I always try to eat a lunch in new situation.
