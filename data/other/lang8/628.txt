Tomorrow, I'll aboard to flight to London.
(Next, London to Barcelona.)
Now I stay in my aunt house. Every time I 'm going to be on a trip, I visit here. There are five people here, uncle and aunt, uncle's mother, cousin who is a man, cousin who is a single mother and has a baby. I love them.
By the way, I have a quetion.
When I was a high school student, an ALT (Assist Learning Teacher) said ;" We usually don't say [I 'm loving you.], but the shy boy or girl use sometimes."
Do the shys really say" I 'm loving."?
