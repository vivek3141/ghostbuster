We went to toboggan to the hill in my neighborhood. This is my first time to try to toboggan, although I have skied or snowboarded. That was so scary! At first I saw it lightly and I thought it is the sport just for kids. But it was even more thrilling than skiing or snowboarding.
It is like coasters. The more it went down, the more speed it got. The speed is outrageous. Besides I couldn't control well. I was really worried about bumping against people and trees.
I actually stroke on a children. Fortunately she didn't hurt, but my mind went blank at the moment. I admired children because they have no fear. I guess there are a lot of opportunity to toboggan here and I have to improve it for not be beaten by children. Overall I enjoyed myself!
