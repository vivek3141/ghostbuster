Well...
now I 'm finally writing my journal....! Actually, these days are kind of hectic and I couldn't spare time for doing that. But it is a fact that I hadn't been writing journals. Even though I skipped it for only 1 day. To be honest, there are two reasons...
let me explain it! First, when I wanted to write it, something was wrong with my PC! So, I couldn't do it.
To make matters worse, there were no time left for me. Second, I was too exhausted to do it.
As those who have read my journals know, I started working part time (the contents is that giving out leaflets outside) and I was kind of busy. Thanks to the job, I already earned around $ 240 for 4 days.
In fact, I did it too today. Anyway, I'll write about it in detail sometime.
I said that I earn enough money on my own to study abroad at the Australia, but this job is a little hard. That's because it is boring.
I 'm already tired of giving out leaflets.
LOL In addition, when I do it, I am avoided by people in most case.... : (
Thanks for reading!
If you have time, please correct my poor sentences! ; )
