My 4 - years - old daughter goes to an English lesson since when we decided to move to Singapore for 3 months.
She is interested in speaking English and writing alphabets now thanks to the teacher.
This is the letter below.
I appreciate to teach English to my daughter. She was always looking forward to your lesson.
Your lessons were energetic and so much fun.
When we decided her to go to a international school that only few Japanese go to, we noticed she had to start to study English immediately because she couldn't speak English at all.
I was looking for English class around here. At first we found a flyer at the play room.
We thought just taking a trial lesson, but she told me that I want to go to the lesson again. I am very surprised to her progress. Now she is very interested in speaking English, writing alphabets and sings WHAT ' S YOUR NAME? song everyday.
Her progress owe to you. What your children speaking only English are same class is also good for her.
It will be base after she will go to new school. If I didn't need to take care of my kids, I wanted to have your lessons! When you come to Singapore, please contact us.
It is very easy to come with kids because it is clean, safe, just a 1 - hour time difference and available Haneda airport. We are looking forward to seeing you and your children someday somewhere.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for all the staff and class mates.
Take care.
Best regard.
