I 'm an elementary school teacher as you might know. In Japan, starting next year we'll officially have to teach English to students who are in both 5th grade and 6th grade. I've made some English classes, actually. Yesterday, I made an English lesson with ALT, which is an acronym for Assistant Language Teacher.
The lesson's topic was Halloween. We provided some kinds activities to get the students not only to keep enjoying the lesson but also to keep some vocabulary in mind before they know it. One of them is" Halloween trivias and Bingo". The student need to answer some questions about Halloween I've prepared by playing Bingo. The more correctly they answer, the more Bingo they can get. After the class, I asked the students to answer a questionnaire. I was very glad to find they liked the lesson. One of my ultimate goal as an English teacher is that all students look the world broadly. I 'm sure you'll have plenty of opportunities not only to communicate people from other countries but also to know several cultural differences through the lesson. I believe this will lead them to accepting more things. That's why I 'm very excited with teaching studens English!!
