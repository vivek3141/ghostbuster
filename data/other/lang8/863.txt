My best friend is coming from Japan in a week. She is the first person who visits me since I came to Australia. She is only staying here for 3 days.
It's not very long, still, I am so excited to see her. We went to the same high school and went to the different colleges. She is now working the same bank as I was working. It's acrtually a 5 - day trip.
However, the first day, she is just leaving Japan late in the evening and the last day, She needs to take an early flight so We have got three full days off. I have been thinking where to take her.
We have a lot to talk about too since I haven't seen her for 7 months.
I wonder if 3 days are enough. hehe.
I hope the weather is good while she is here.
That will be so much fun!!
