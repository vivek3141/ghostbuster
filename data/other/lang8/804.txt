I attended" 76 meeting" today. Company presidents born in 1976 gather for it and 20 people came. It started 3 years ago and was held once every 3 months.
On the meeting, one makes a presentation about his company every time, this time I made it. I think it's so worthwhile because everyone can learn lots of ideas and experiences from others.
After that, we drunk together and had a fun. In this drinking time, we decided to go a trip to Hong Kong or Singapore.
I don't know if it would be realized but I'd like to go whichever place because I've never been both.
