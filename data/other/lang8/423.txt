I don't speak English so much recently.
Since both my language exchanging partners, Zac and Mark are busy for school, I sometimes talk to them though, I think it isn't enough for me to speak English. I believe that the best way to improve speaking skill is speaking English more and more.
All my friends who had already mastered another language advice same things to me.
Therefore, I have several plans after I will move to a new place.
I will go to English conversation school everyday.
I 'm a student of online English conversation school and I already take English lessons everyday though, it isn't enough for me.
In addition, I want to try to find a partner who can do languages exchange in person there.
Skype is one of the best way to speak English though, I really want to speak English more in my real life.
I also want to speak to Mark who is one of my language exchanging partner in parson after he will study abroad in Japan.
Since Mark and I are interested in art, I sometimes want to go to Art Museums with him and learn English about art from him in our conversation.
I really hope that I can meet a good English teacher like my current teacher Sean and I also can meet a good language exchanging partner like my best Skype friends Zac and Mark in person after I will move to a new place.
