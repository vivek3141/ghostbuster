I live in Santiago de Chile, in a small town at the outside of the city. My house has two floors.
In the first floor I have a kitchen, a living room, and a dining room. At the second floor I have my room and two rooms more for my family. The walls of my house are yellow, and the ceiling is white in all the house.
