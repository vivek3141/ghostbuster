I 'm talking with two people on skype right now!
One is David from England and one is Chinese. They are nice people and I like them.
We are talking about how to speak English.
Of course, David is the teacher. He's helping that Chinese woman with her English because her English is not that good. She needs to improve it, she says. I suddenly realize that English is so important!
I learn English not because it's used everywhere but I like it. I 'm also trying to learn some Spanish and Italian and German lol.
I like language learning. I 'm interesting in learning new things and I like to meet new people here. haha
This is my second diary on this page.
I think I will write more if I have time and am in the right mood lol. I will try.
See you later.
I 'm going to bed soon.
Have a good day!
