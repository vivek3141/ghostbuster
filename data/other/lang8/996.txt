I think many people are all have their new year's aim, so do I. My new year's aim is that passed Japanese 2level and improve my english. Since I worked, my study intereting is less than before when I was in college. But I found if you don not study your brain may be more and more not bright. So I suppose that we must study if only have time. Just like one sentence" One is never too old to learn".
Do you think so?
