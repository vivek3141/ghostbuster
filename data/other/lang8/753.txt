Last day, my former boy friend called me.
This was after a decade since we finally met or talked on the phone. He said," How are you doing? We're very very long time no see." I said," Oh, I 'm fine. Thank you for calling me.
How about you?
What's up?"
But he said," I moved to Osaka from Kyoto and I still work as a municipal employee. Nothing have I problem. I just remember you. So I called you." I felt slight strange, because he is married and he also has a child. And He has not contacted me for a long time. If I were him, I probably had not contacted former girl friend just remenbered. The line was somehow stuticky. So I said to him" Where are you now? I hear a lot of static."
He replied me" Me? At the balcony of my apartment. It's windy day today." Strange.
Didn't he think about his wife and child's feelings? So after talking with him,
I contacted a common friend of us but he said my former boy friend was OK. Probably there was no problem.
I can not understand why he contacted me.
I think, sometimes he acted childish behavor. I belive he was into all along.
