Today was very busy day. I got up at 8 : 00am.
I washed my face and ate cereal promptly.
I went to Gangnam station to study English in Pagoda academy. I met my friend who serviced in marine band. We talked about the old days during about three hours. I went to computer academy after meeting. The lecture of today was so difficult, however, I did my best to make good program. There are many people in my academy.
Most of the people are older than me. Especially, an old man who sit in the next of my desk is the oldest people in our class. I thought he will be very hard to learn to make program. I am right. so, I always help him making program.
