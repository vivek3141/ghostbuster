" Otlob" is a delivery - service site adress in Egypt. Why I didn't use this for two years?
I really wonder.
Stupid!!
So I ordered Mushroom & Cheese Fetira (Egypt Pizza) using the site with I know about it. But I should go down the 1st floor because elevator doesn't work today so delivery man call me. My house is the 10th floor. (T. T) This is not delivery service.
