Almost all japanese business man use train. Some of them see mobile pages, and read some books, the other sleep in the train. Sometimes they who are seated on chair lean against me. It's weighty. I think they are very tired at their office, because of their a lot of hard work. So they want to sleep more long time as possible as they can. But I don ' tlike to be weighed.
And if they are drunk, it's the worst situation.
Today people next to me is so. I was very tired, while moving to my school.
