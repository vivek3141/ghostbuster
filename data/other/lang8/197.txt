I have two sisters and one brother.
I 'm their older sister. And today our youngest sister has her sixth birthday.
I don't know what gifts prepared my parents. I sewed her a new coverlet ( I don't know which word to choose.
It's covered bed over all other sings, like blanket ).
In the evening we will nave a little party with barbeque. Many children like fried sausages very much.
And of course there will be some our friends with their kids.
