Hi there.
My name is Aki.
I 'm Japanese.
Even though I am living in Japan, I want to study English for many reasons.
One of my goal is communicating without problem in English with the people whose mother language is English. So, please don't hesitate to revise my poor English although it's tiny tiny mistake, misuse, or nuance problem. I believe there are kind people in this community Lang - 8 and hope they will help me with English for improving my English ability. Thank you, ; - )
