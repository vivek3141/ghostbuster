Hey, I didn't write anything on lang - 8 for a long, long time. Guess it was because fire in me did burn to the coal and I've lost my spirit : ( But hey, here I am again and hopefully want to make my profile alive ^ ^
So, in the past two years I've changed a lot, now I 'm certainly more tolerant, focusing on my studying, but not forgetting about friends : D My little (I mean something like " silent ", that's only in me, is it correct?) dream is to go to Australia and see the normal (usual?) life of people living there, kangoos and all that great stuff.
: )
And that's all for now, bye ^ _ ^
