I went to a gym last night.
I joined an aerobics class.
Everyone who joined this class were very good. Even midleage man was better than me! I am beginner. When everyone jumped left, I jumped right.
Oh nooo.
I made mistakes a lot. I wished I could sink into the floor.
It was very hard and I was very tired.
At any rate, it was fun!
I will join this class next time.
