Yesterday, I cut my finger with a kitchen knife.
It was still very sharp because I had used it only for two weeks since I had moved to my current apartment.
When I cut my finger, a lot of blood ran out. At that time, I was washing the dishes, and the sink became totaly red. I was surprised, and rashed into the bath room to wash my hand. A few minutes later, my finger stopped bleeding.
I applied a Band - Aid, seeing the sink looking as if a scene of murder.
