I was upset last night, so I went out for fresh air. My boyfriend often condemned me to be against him. So I try not to oppose his suggestion, but I felt it useless. No matter how much I make an effort, he never changes his mind. This made me hurt, so I went for a walk for a while but he textmailed me ' You don't have to come back! Leave me forever! '
I was very sad.
