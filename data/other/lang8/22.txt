Tomorrow I 'm going for BBQ (I 'm sure this expression is wrong, but I don't know how to say it ^ ^ ;) in the river.
BUT!
Where to do it and when we should leave is not decided yet! (I know that a long subject is not good in English, but how can I rewrite this?)
Can you believe it??
This time we leave everything to my friend, but I 'm kinda person who don't feel at ease unless everything is perfect.
So, even now I feel nervous, wondering if It ' really going to be held.
