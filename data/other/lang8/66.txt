Foreign medias admire that Japanese people are behaving calmly, organised and in a supporting. But it's common for we Japanese. We think that having trouble others is very bad thing and shameful. Every parent want their children not to have trouble others. Japanese have grown rice which need to help each other in the community the past. So getting along with people in the community is very important.
When parents scold ill - mannered children they use the same phrase" I 'm too ashamed to face people." Though this phrase is not so common to young parents, this ethics is in Japanese gene.
