I went to Yuasa town yesterday for business trip. That town is well know as old soy souse town. Soy souse was made about 800 years ago in that town, so there are a lot of old soy souse and soy beans factory there. We bought a fish and squid at fish shop and bring that sasimi to restaurant and ate sasimi, rice and soy soup at restaurant.
We also visited soy souce musium. Actually I work in city hall and work for city center.
We enjoyed there very much and we have to think about our city.
