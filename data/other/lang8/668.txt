I have been studing English for eighteen years, starting from the school, continuing at the institute and now - by myself. But I have no great successes in my studing. For example, I can understand very small part of radio and tv brodcasting, dialogs in move pictures. It is very hard for me to understand anything when I comunicate with native speakers.
