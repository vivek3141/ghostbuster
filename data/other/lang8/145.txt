Hysterically, I am a well planned person so there are always full of schedules that keep me from anything spontaneous. So to speak, there are certain things I have to do almost every day before the sun sets off such as reading a book, watching news, and writing anything. Otherwise, I feel something wrong as if I didn't do a homework that would punish me when I finally hand out the empty note to a meticulous teacher.
Ironically, I find it enjoying hanging out with my friend who came here early morning, taking a whole day from me, doing something stupid such as killing flies, making me think what is more important. Don't be such a smart person who might lose better things.
