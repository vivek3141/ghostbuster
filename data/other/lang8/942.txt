There have been some good news in my family. The first news is that my brother and Mom are going to university this year.
He had a hard time deciding which university he would go to because he got lower grades than expected in Korean SAT.
Fortunately, he's going to be a student from the university he loves. While we celebrate, another good news came up.
Mom got accepted by Korea national open university yesterday. This school is a little different from the general university but we were so happy because we knew how she'd dreamed about it.
So Dad and I prepared a surprise party for them.
We had only a cake but it was really happy.
happiest ever. Now we have three students.
It will be four, if Dad get into college next year. In Korea, the" University" means more than it literally does.
It's like graduating from university is a very condition to be treated as a human.
That's why evey Korean thinks they have to go to college. I don't think that's a good idea, though.
I hope my parents get what they've dreamed of.
I hope my brother does well there, also.
