Today was a bad, bad day!
The weather was extremely cold in here.
Needless to say and no selection for me, I had to wear a lot of clothes and make my effort to keep my body warm before I went to school. Yes, I had act a snowman today... Actually, I didn't know and understand that why my school couldn't provide the warm water to all of the students after they had finish their physiologically need. Say it easily, it means that after you have pissed.
Imagine that you have just finished pissing, when you are going to wash and clean your hands, you have to let the COLD water run through your hands. What's the ' great ' feeling that is! Also, while going back to the classroom, I must bring my WET hands to challenge the nature during the ' journey '.
The wind blowed my WET hands and I could feel my hands were shaking. Whatever, I know that I have to challenge the nature again tomorrow, even if I don't want to face it.
