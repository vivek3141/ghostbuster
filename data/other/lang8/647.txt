Hello everyone!!
I happened to find this place and now I 'm writing my first journal.
Today I haven't got anything nice to write about, so let me simply introduce myself.
I 'm Choo, Japanese, and studying English.
Why I 'm studying English is to communicate with people from other countries and to study jewellery design in Amsterdam (the Netherlands). I'll keep posting in English and helping others once a day.
Every little helps, yes?
