Until today, when I call my ex - boyfriend. but his handset has unused.
I know, I lost him at all. Even we broke off have two years. My heart is so blue.
I dont know why.
Maybe, I still love him, maybe not.
But now, I know I miss him, I dont want lost contact with him by now. Tomorrow is our holiday, we should very happy with my family, but I cant feel happy. I want cry. and actually I had a good cryed in my office at afternoon. I feel so stupid.
