I learned the word that" physically challenged" from a person.
This word means a person who has handicap.
I was told the person with such handicap is called" a disabled person"." Disability" is a negative word.
But" Physically challenged" is a positive word!
I hope there will be advancements in medicine and all physically challenged people will have a more positive way of thinking.
I hope to support them.
So I need to study more
I was able to learn such a good word.
I am grateful to him
Thank u" G"!
