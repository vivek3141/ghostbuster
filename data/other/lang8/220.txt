Drug's name is difficult to pronounce. Usually, can English native speaker pronounce difficult drug name such as" Diethylstilbestrol" or" Ibritumomab tiuxetan"?
For instance, when you saw a article on today's newspaper about this drug, can you pronounce them at a first glance without consulting a dictionary or website, etc.? By chance, you can pronounce them correctly only from the alphabet? In Japanese case, we can not pronounce some Kanji. I commonly used to ask my family," What's pronunciation of this"?
