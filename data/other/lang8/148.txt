Hi.
How are you doing?
Yesterday, I went to Home Depo to buy a bag of soil and a planter. I wanted to do repotting of my roses. The roses grew up and thir flowerpots are too small for them. And also I wanted to do sowing of sweet basil seeds and oregano seeds. Oh, I just remember, I also bought a seat of starting pots for that herbs. After I got home, I started repotting and sowing.
It took long time to do that but I was happy, so I like gardening. Actually I just have
a patio, not garden. : (
I wanted to do sowing of Violas but starting pots was lack, so I would go to Home Depo again tomorrow.
