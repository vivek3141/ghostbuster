I joined this site, Lang - 8 only recently, and don't know how to use it effectively.
I thought I had corrected someone's diary this morning, but it seems that I didn't push the" send" button and my correction vanished.
It also takes me a long time to search for comments people left for me.
I have no idea how to upload my pictures.
I think I need some training of useing this site.
Anyway, I find it very interesting to write my diary in English.
