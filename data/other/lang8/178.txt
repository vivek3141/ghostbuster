Keeping a diary is difficult to me. I want to keep a diary everyday, but it is not simple thing to me. I know the reason, so I hope to correct the reason this time.
I also hope to improve my poor English ability this time.
Please correct my sentence or grammar.
I think I have poor English grammar ability, so thank you very much for your advice. Thank you!
