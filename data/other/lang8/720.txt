I've been thinking about writing blog in English, but I wasn't sure how I could start it. Today when I was net - surfing for blogs in English, I happened to find this site. It's sooooooo simple and easy!
What an awesome world we are living in!
It's so wonderful that now we can improve our language skills for free based on people's good will!!
I majored in sociology at Sophia university in japan since I 'm interested in what affects people's decisions whether to do something or not. After graduation I worked for a trading company and was hoping to study abroad.
Unfortunately, I haven't achieved that yet, but now I've chosen English education for my career and I 'm enjoying my work teaching students. I've enjoyed learning English since my childhood and my goal in my youth was to live abroad.
It was not only out of curiosity but also because I didn't feel that I fitted in my surroundings well. I thought that if japan was not the best place to live in, just try another one. I thought there might be nicer places to live in.
I think it's a good angle to see the world around you.
You can choose where you live, you have choices - that makes you feel easy when you find yourself unfitted in your circumstance. If you can speak english, you can live almost everywhere. So, I worked hard to learn English.
I 'm also interested in analyzing the types of societies. Individual lives are definitely influenced socially, historically, and culturally.
I want to think about what type of a society japan is through my everyday experiences, and express my views on the Japanese society. I wish to get feedback from people who visit my blog from overseas and exchange opinions about japan and your country. Looking forward to hear from you!
