I got a foot masssage today.
It's kind of Tai - wan stayle massage. I loved the massage shop where I went because the staff of the shop explains what is wrong in my body. They said I 'm cold - natured and have poor blood flow.
In addition, the staff said correctly that I had problems with my lower back and my neck.
I was surprized at finding my health condition from my foot.
After that, I went to a fittness club which has bedrock bathing. I feel relax to take a bedrock bath ^ ^... but now I 'm very sleepy... zzz
