At the July 4th party, one of my friends brought Kinect which is a body motion sensing gaming device for XBOX360.
I heard that before but I've never played it and every one over there neither. After having a beerpong, many people played with it but a funny thing happened on that day. Two guys were completing against each other for running in an athletic game. Both of them does not know how to run in the game exactly. One of the guy tries to run by lifting up his knees a lot and the others are not. Actually, it requires lifting up their knees higher enough to make Kinect senser to sense their move, so he was correct and keep the fastest speed in the race. However, the problem is he is a bit too serious so he started moving toward the TV monitor little by little, then finally he slipped on a floor and fell down. As the result, suddenly he became 7th in the race which is the second from last. On the other hand, while he is running seriously is falling down, the other guy is keep running, but since he did not lift his knees up, so he kept the booby in the race - until the other guy fell down.
So, the race turns out really funny one since one guy fell down and the other guy runs his slow pace. It resulted in getting 7th and 8th. Everyone started laughing and I was feeling like a documentary of a race with a guy who didn't give up even though he fell down in a middle of the race and a guy who keeps running slowly but never give up. Anyway, it's a one of funniest moment ever.
Be careful during running even though it's a game. : )
