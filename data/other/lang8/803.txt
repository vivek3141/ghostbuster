I think it's very important for me to have as many opportunities to talk to a native speaker or a person who can speak English fluently as possible in order to improve my speaking skills. One of the opportunities is the lesson with a native speaker. This lesson is held almost every Saturday. The teacher is one of five ALTs (ALT is the abbreviation of Assitant Language Teacher) who work in public school. Five ALTs take it in turns to conduct a lesson.
This lesson is a quite precious opportunity for me. My region has few people from other countries because it's so rural.
That's why it's very hard to find them in my area. There is always 3 - 5 persons including a teacher in this lesson.
The size of a lesson is so small that I can many chances to talk in English. First of all, I talk freely with a teacher and other participants.
After talking, we do some things by using a text. For example, we remember useful expressions, play a role play, and make sentences which contain new words. Lastly, we read an article in newspaper and discuss it. 2 hours always flies fast. I always enjoy it.
I 'm really lucky to have this lesson.
