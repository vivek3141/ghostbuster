yesterday I saw weather forecast which informed that today will rain all day long. As soon as I woke up this morning, I checked outside.
I opened window but it was not rain. It was warm fine day. During the day I waited rain as look up the sky and I was thinking what is the problem with weather forecast organization. I think we have one of the most powerful computer in the world at that organization but they know nothing. There was 90 % which expect the rain today but they were wrong. I was shocked at their disappointing work.
