Foreign - Exchange trade is difficult.
The value of currency alway change. Because it is never keeping a constant level, you have to keep to check the market at all times.
Even I have done the deal for three years, I still confuse the moving of the Market sometimes. My trade rely on the two basic forms of analysis : fundamental analysis and the technical analysis. Fundamental analysis is based on which the price will reflect the big news. Thechnical analysis use the charts as the objects. The practice have three step.
1.
Focus the big news.
2.
Check the chart (20days term, moving averages).
3.
Big Deal, and not loss cut easyly.
4.
Decision on 30 percent profit.

CHART :

How do you think my deal method?
