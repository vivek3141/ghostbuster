The other day, I transfered to a college.
I was angry with myself today.
I went to my college and they gave us an orientation about how we were gon na study this year.
The leader of the department that I 'm taking told that most of sophomores including those who transfered to this college might've gotten over 650 points at TOEIC. When I heard him saying that, I found that I flattered myself too much in spite of not having studied hard!!
And I had thought I was smarter than students who had studied at the college just because I transfered. I found that wrong. It is always said that don't compare youself with others and how hard you have made efforts IS important.
To be honest, I can't help but compare myself with others because it's the easiest way to be proud of myself and get confidence.
I want to change myself.
Actually, I don't like to compare. One of the reasons is becasue when you compare yourself with others and if there is someone smarter than you, you get very depressed, like you're going to die. Another reason is that I don't like people who look down on someone esle, and when there is someone less smart than me, I find myself looking down on him. I hope I can come to like myself completely someday.
Thank you for reading, and I 'm happy if you correct any mistakes.
