Today, I made" Irish breakfast" for my lunch. It's too heavy for me to eat all in morning, so I often do in evening. I like this so much, but I feel that Irish bacon and black (white) pudding are slight salty for Japanese, so I eat bacon and bread together. Thats much better.
there were no beans in my fridge, so I dished up carrot salad and olive with bacon, fried egg, sausage, pudding.
oh, I forgot fried tomato too. Tomorrow, Im going to make Japanese potato pancake (imo mochi). Its like a ricecake and made by potato, tapioca flour, cheese, mayonese. I have to use the rest of cheese, otherwise it will get mould.
