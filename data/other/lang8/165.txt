I really like reading books.
My precious time is the time when I read books taking a bath! I usually take a bath more than half an hour. After my families go to bed, I concentrate in reading books.
Nothing bothers me, I can be absorbed in books.
However, I have to be careful, or books will swell up.
I read documentaries, science fictions, mysteries...
and many more.
But I don't like love stories.
I think knowing others ' love affair doesn't make any sense for me. I like the stories which can not be expected and be like a roller coaster.
