I went to shopping with my husband a few days ago. After we shopped, we went to bakery to buy next breakfast. I paid money for bread and received the change but forgot to bring the bread... I went to other store of same bakeries today. I looked the price that I had forgotten the bread of. Although I had paid $ 2. 9, it was $ 1. 9!
I had not only forgotten it but also paid too much.
I feel down.
