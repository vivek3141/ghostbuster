I've learning English at the community center twice a month, first and third Thuesday.
I had a lesson today instead first Thursday because 1th January is National holiday called" Osyougatu" in Japan.
Our teacher is English.
He was taking holiday from 18th December to 18th January. So we had a lesson another teacher who is Ethiopian duerng his holiday. We have a lesson from Ethiopian more than English teacher lately. Honestly I like Ethiopian than English, I seem I 'm incompatible with English teacher.
I feel he is always nasty to us.
For example
He question one by one, we try to answer but some student can not answer When another student helps to the one, he said at once" I asked her, not you.!" It ended unplasant atmosphere. After that we feared all this time.
