A typhoon is slowly on its way to Japan. I 'm planning to travel to Gunma prefecture on September 2nd and 3rd. So I 'm worried about it. I'll go to the hot spa and eat many delicious food such as crabs, steaks, desserts and so on at the hotel. I studied English and about my major much in this summer vacation, so I want to take a rest and enjoy this trip! : D
I want to go to as many places as possible! Thank you for reading!
