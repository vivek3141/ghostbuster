My family went to a hospital to remove my daughter's plaster today.
She broke a bone of her left arm two months ago. She seemed to forget how to use her left arm because she kept her left hand close when she came to a gutzer at the first time after removing a plaster.
But she was able to use her left arm soon.
I felt safe.
