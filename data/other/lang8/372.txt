Where do I start?
Well, it's very tough to figure out what to write in because my days is always the same routine. As always, there is nothing special to happen today. Well, I have 94 days left until the return to the college. I think it's near at hand.
Anyway, I have a plan to go to CheongJu and look for suited room near my college with my friend MinSung on Nov. 17th.
Well, I hope that the room would be very silent and calm, not noisy. In addition to that, I want it would fit my position. I mean it'll be great if it won't cost me much money, because I don't really want to burden my parents with the rental prices. Speaking of which, I and Minsung might be suppoesed to live together at that place. We've been through this, and he think it's going to happen, but I don't decide yet. I've now and then seen some people live together and always put up a fight each other about mean and small stuff and end up hating each other. What if I and he would be that case? So, I 'm rather worried about that.
But, there's a merit. Actually we would only use English everytime we're at our place to improve our English speaking dramtically. This was Minsung's idea. Well, this sounded like very lovely idea to me when he propose that, because I've thought about that either. Actually I 'm thing about that. Well, I don't know what is a good decision. I 'm just hoping to make a great decision.
