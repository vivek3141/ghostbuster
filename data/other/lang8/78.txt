Today was the day of my chinese friend's birthday. She is the 26 years old woman and work for travel agency. Besides, she is pursuing model career in Japan. We met night club in Tokyo. Dreams is different, but I think we are similar in terms of pursue own dreams. I feel like her a sister.
I wonder what I give her present, so could you give me some advice?
