It was not very cold wether in the morning, not like typical wether in Sweden. Spring is comming! ^ ^
Anyway, I had to cook somthing to eat for 3 days ' lunch. I had some chiken and I wanted to cook DAKDORI which I failed three times already! Fortunately, now I have a book which my mom sent to me which is about Korean food. DAKDORI was just one thing included in the book about chiken menu. But just try!
After 30 minutes my kitchen became a little bit dirty but taste was fantastic! I was very proud of myself. Now I can show this to my friend who are eager to eat korean food. hahaha
