This is first working day in Singapore today. The result is no so bad. And food and life is good for me. My English is still poor, but I can enjoy my life in Singapore.
I had a dinner at food - court. I said" Can I have a take - out this?". (I don't know this phrase is good or not) Then staff said" take a way?" These are different? The" take a way" is better than" take - out"?
Anyone help my question.
