I 'm reading The Main Street Series by Ann M.
Matin.
She is famous for writing The Baby - Sitter Club Series which I've read some of.
I've read two third of the first book of The Main Street Series. It's tltle is" Welcome to Camden Falls".
I think it's little bit boring. But it has a sign that if I'll read a little more, it'll turn out to be interesting...
