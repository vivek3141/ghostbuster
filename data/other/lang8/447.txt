Hi.
Now, I have to increase my English skill because it is essential for the college entrance examination. The college I want to enter demand very flexible English skill. But I was not hard learner, so I can not write English sentences fluently. By the way, I think it's very silly to learn another language just for passing the exam. So I really want to communicate with native speakers.
I can introduce some of Japanese things if you write as a comment. I 'm glad if you correct my sentences very strictly because I really want to write in English quite naturally. I 'm sorry for my bad English!
