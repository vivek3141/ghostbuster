I met a lady who had a something grey. She told us if we touched it, we would be happier. So many people wanted to touch it even we had to wait for a while. There were about three hundred of people. It has a cute name.
And she is very popular among her friends.
They call her" Unae".
It is an eel.
She made it using a towel which she bought at one hundred yen shop. Do you know" Unagi nobori" in Japanese? It means" rise rapidly".
If you touch" Unae", you will be lucky rapidly. Actually she has been lucky since she made" Unae". She can meet many people and talk together. Now she is an active business person.
