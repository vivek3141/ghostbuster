I have been quite busy in last couple of days becouse of my exams at the University. I 'm a student at the Silesian University of Technology, at the faculty of Environmental Engineering. I enjoy my classes a lot and I know I will miss them when I will graduate. I have one last exam left and when I passe it, I 'm going to have some holidays. Me and my dad are going to visit France to go skiing there. I can't wait : ) When we will back I will have to start working at my thesis which is about ventilation and heating in passive house. My main task is to make a project of it and make a cost - effectiveness analysis.
