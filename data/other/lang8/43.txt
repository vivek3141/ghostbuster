I am going to talk about the historical novel called" The First Man in Rome" by Colleen McCullough, who is a british woman writter.
The novel is about a important roman politican called Caius Marius. He is de main character, although appearing others like Cornelius Silla, Metelus, and the Caesar's grandfather. Marius didn't come from a important family, but he became in consul because he was a clever and popular general at roman army. So, after he was chose consul by the romans, he went to Afrika where he fought againt Yugurta who was king of Numidia. Marius won the war in two years, and when he went back to Rome he was chose consul again during five years. Marius had to fright other tribes at north of Italy, until in 100 B. C.
he must leave the power because he got sick.
