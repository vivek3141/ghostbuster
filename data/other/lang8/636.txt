I want to live in Provance in France (such as Aix - provance, Nice and Marseilles) and study cooking (about the traditional France dishes) in the future.
I like cooking more than anything else, but I 'm wondering deeply if I should go into the way of cooking... But I heard that becoming a chef is really difficult and competitive.
I think my idea is not realistic.
In addition, I really like cooking, but am not good at cooking very much. Could you give me any advice?
And if you live in France, please give me some information about France. (In English, please.) And!
If you have a similar dream, please contact me : D )
