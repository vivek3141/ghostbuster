I hadn't taken the freeway before. I only drive to work.
Last Sunday was my frater's birthday. So I came to the Jeongseon - gun that my parents live. I drove alone, I 'm not afraid of drivig anymore. I 'm good at cutting in cars. Have you driven in Korea? It's so overcrowded with car. Some of the car have no manners. I don't submit to no manners's car because I 'm brave woman?! ^ ^ * Do you know Jeongseon - gun?
