I heard a sentence last night when I watched TV. It reminds and inspires me a lot.
Your life is like when you walk.
When you go downhill, you have to stick out your chest or you will fell down. When you go uphill, you hvae to bend your back. It is like when you are confronted with frustration, you have to keep your confidence. When you are go smoothly, you have to be more modest. It is really good for me.
