I've received the acceptance letter and scholarship decision from the Berklee College of Music. I'll enter the Berklee in the fall semester this year. But I have two worries. One of them is that my English is very clumsy yet. Another is high - priced tuition. Anyway, I 'm studying English at the TOEFL Institute these days. The Berklee don't requires a TOEFL score. I 'm just attending the Institute to improve my English because I'll have to take many classes in English.
Many assignments are given to me everyday. It's very difficult to do all of them, but I always try to make maximum efforts.
