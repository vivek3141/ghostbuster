I went to Whistler yesterday.
My host family suddenly asked me if I would be free last weekend.
Of course, I was free therefore I was taken to there. It is a main place where mountain games will take place in 2010 Vancouver Olympic. I hiked there and on the lakeside.
It was very beautiful.
There is a lot of nature.
Even buildings in Whistler Village were beautiful. It was like Canada that I imaged before I came to Canada, or more. I enjoyed very much. I wanted to stay and spend slow life more.
