Today, m worked as intern in a small venture company. In this company, there are only four people there and some intern students including me. This company deal with some It like business. And today after the working I had a dinner with my acquaintance, a person who is workin in the famous consulting company accenture. He is also born in Kansai area, I mean Osaka, so the tempo we are talking matches. The topic came to the experience I had in my Phillipine trip that I had in this August. This trip was held by all myself to see the thoroughly different culture and study English, and my trial resulted in success. I could experienced precious time. And as I talked about that topic, I don't know why, but I noticed tears in my eyes. This is probably because of that experience, I had there, that is what I saw in slam area and people in poverty and what I felt unreasonable. I thought I want to heartily changed this situation, people who naturally didn't do anything wrong. I thought again, and what should I do? I asked to myself again in my mind, but my answer still couldn't come back.
