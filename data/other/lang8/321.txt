Yesterday, I had an English party named" English cafe" in my English school." English cafe" was opened every first Sunday once a month and many students, teachers and Christians gather the party. A party name was" English cafe", but I hadn't to speak English.
It was different the usually lesson, the students and the teachers were relax and fun. I ate" Chili Con Carne" by my English teacher Jerry with pasta, rice and pan.
It was very good!
I made many Christians friends there. I 'm not Christian but I was happy to making friends.
