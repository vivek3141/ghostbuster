Today, I had some problem in my car.
Since friday, whenever I turned on A / C, some weird and loud noise came from the front part of the car where an engine is located. Also, I could hear similar sound when making a turn.
I was worried and took my car to the mechanic.
They said I had some problem with A / C.
As for noise of turning, they just refilled a little tank with some liquid.
After that, that noise went away.
But, I still could hear very interrupting and worrying noise from A / C. They said they don't do that kind of service there and gave me the direction of another place.
I drove there and asked for help.
But, unfortunatley enough, they didn't have any techinician at that time specialized in the A / C part.
Thus, I had to get back home.
Tomorrow is sunday, so I don't think they will open their business. I will take my car again on monday.
I hope It won't cost me a lot. P.
S.
I will post a picture of Spot tomorrow with some writing, yet, right now, I 'm so tired and want to go sleep.
