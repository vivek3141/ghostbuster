I 'm in New York now.
This was my 1st week in NY and I'll be staying here 3 more weeks.
I came here to learm English. I 'm going to international language school.
My class includes 9 people, 3 from Japan, 3 from Korea, 2 from Spain and 1 from Brazil.
But I 'm feeling very sad and lonley now.
Because I can't make friends in my school.
Most of my classmates are older than me and they have jobs.
My roommate is about 50 years old.
I wanna make friends here.
I want to see my family and my friends in Japan.
I really miss them.
I 'm not sure how I spend more 3 weeks here. Oh my god!
It's terrible.
