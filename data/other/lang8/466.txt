As you know, Bruins won the Stanley Cup this year! So there was a parade yesterday in Boston.
The end of the parade route was Copley Square, and I got there. When I arrived at Copley, I'd naver seen a tremendous amount of people at there. I thought all the people in Boston came to downtown yesterday. I couldn't move easily.
To make matter worse, the weather was so hot... Nevertheless, many people were really passionate and excited.
This was the first time watching a parade in Boston, even I 'm not a big fan of the ice - hockey, It was awesome. It was just a new fresh experience for me.
I hope that Red Sox will be a winner of Wolrd Series, then I'll have a chance to watch a parade again!
