Happy New Year!
I hope I will do my best for study and work. At New Year's Day, we had New Years dishes" Osechi". Once it was made by each home.
But now most Japanese buy it at the supermaket and department store. Because there once lived so many peoples in a family, and mother and grandmather made much dishes for their children and guests, however, there are many nuclear families in Japan and are few guests." Osechi" making is really hard work. I miss the customs are going to lose.
