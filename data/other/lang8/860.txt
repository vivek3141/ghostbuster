I love my wife.
I married her thirteen years ago.
She is very heart - warmed person. But she isn't good at housework, especially washing dishes. Yesterday a lot of used dishes were piled up at a kitchen and I couldn't bear those left for a day. So it urged me to wash dishes and I dealt them roughly with anger. 10 minutes later, my wife came across to me and showed me a white cup. The edge of the cup was chipped.
She told it was presented by her grandmother who was already dead. Then she weeped.
I couldn't say anything to console her.
