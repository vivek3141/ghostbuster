until yesterday I was very busy so I didn't watch dvds.
I hooked on the American dvds.
The title is" closer".
Before that I hooked on" Alias".
Jennifer Garner is attractive women so when I watched making scene, I felt drawn toward her.
I think Amercan drama is a good study but this drama is very difficult.
