This is the first time for me to write diray in English. I 'm really happy if someone kindly read and check my English. Last weekend, my husband was not at home, so I invited my friends in company on both saturday and sunday. They were working mothers having two children, just the same with me, and I heard about their life after maternity leave.
They said they were busy, and they had to get many days off because their children often got sick. It's said that boys tend to get sick more frequently than girls, and my friend who has a son said it was true for her.
In her case, her mother lives near her, so she can get her mother's help, and she does ' nt need to get off work. But how about us?
Our parents live far away from us, so we can't ask their help.
Hmm...
I felt down when I imagined the life after I started working again.
