Today, since people turn out to be more and more rational and have higher demands about the opposite sex, alone with an open mind about dating which nurtured tons of different reality dating shows. Some of them are really funny, but some are absurd.
I believe one of these shows is a romance killer.
This show features with" Parents dating Guys". The process is like this, the girl's parents will meet the guys first, then they will make the decision for their own daughters who is not even on the scene, by the way, about whether should give this guy a chance to go out for a date with their daughters or not. Ridiculous?!
Dont understand why so many people are into these stuff, I deceided to arrange some nice dates for my friends by following my own style. A date which can exude both parties ' warmth and charisma. Sounds a lit bit tricky? Haha, I just did it in the easiest way, chose a good restaurant, put two nice people together and let them talk!
Without audiences, love judges, parents, just a friendly and private atmosphere which allows them to be theirselves and enjoy the moment. Last night was a second date I arranged for my friend and hopefully they can work things out! Crossing my fingers for them ^ _ ^!!! lol
