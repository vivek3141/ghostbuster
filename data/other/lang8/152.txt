I think it is difficult to communicate with others.
Especially, in company, there are many relations. For example, there are my boss, my superiors and my juniors.
I want to know how does communicate with each other in foreign countries. It doesn't mean I 'm not going well. I 'm confused because there are various people, and many thoughts.
