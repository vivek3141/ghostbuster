I extremely want to escape from reality.
I've been working for eleven straight hours ever since I was transferred in January.
I hardly have a break time every day.
I haven't done my own cooking for a while.
On my day off I do my homework, read a reference and attend a lecture.
I wonder if I would take a summer vacation. I guess even if I takek a vacation, I'll have to spend much time on homework.
