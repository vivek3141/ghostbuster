Hello!
I 'm Che.
My nickname is from Che Guevara.
Because I love him.
I have many books and dvds about him.
I live in New york.
I 'm a student at ESL.
I came here last summer.
The reason why I live in NY is my boss suggested that.
I've worked in Japan as a computer engineer.
After I graduated a university, I entered some major company. Then I've worked in that company about 3 years.
After that I changed my job.
And I entered a company which is I work now. Then I've worked in next company about 2 years. And I decided to change my job again.
I talked to my boss about retirement." I want to change my job, so I 'm going to quit my job."
First, he said only" Okay".
But a few days after, he sent me a mail." Do you wanna go to New york?"
My boss is a good business man.
He has many comanys.
And one of them is in NY.
When he was young, he wanted to go abroad.
But it didn't come ture. (I don't know why.)
So he wants young people to have a chance to go abroad.
So he suggested to me. When I got this offer, I knew it would be a great opportunity.
So I was thinking all night, and I decided to say" Yes!".
But, I had a big problem.
When I was a student, I didn't study English at all. Of course I couldn't speak it all! I should've spent time on it...
Now, I 'm going to a ESL, and after that I 'm working.
Actually, I didn't change a company.
I still belong my comany in Japan. I mean...
I 'm working in my room such as soho using internet. And I contact my co - worker using Skype and E - mail.
I can work Japanese comany's job in NY. (It's difficult to explain in English. .. do you understand?)
I 'm trying to study everyday. Please check my bad English!
Thank you for your reading.
See you.
