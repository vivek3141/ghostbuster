My children go to church on sunday.
I don't go because my ex - husband will come. Today I was yelled by ex - husband at church." Don't leave children, I can't take care of them!" He don't like that I leave children at church. But children like to play at church, and mabe, their feel happy to meet their farther I thought. I 'm so full of sadness...
