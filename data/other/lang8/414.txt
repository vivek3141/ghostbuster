My name is WangHuan. I 'm from Xi ' an International University.
I am a junior studennt major in Japanese. After graduated from high school in June, 2008, I have studied japanese for neary two years since August, 2008. With my hardwork and teacher's instruction, I have grasped daily conversation and English and Japanese Writing.
At present I am learning computer by myself. I can use computer to deal with some graph and data statistics and so on. I am not good at communicating with people before, but during the living at University, a Classes cadre as I am, my ability of communication has been increased. Im frank and has the patience to any matter and the sense of responsibility. Although I have not graduated, but noing can question my will and I have the confidence to the future. I will well prepared to accept future challenge. Finally, best wishes for my friend. (I wound like you to correct my error)
