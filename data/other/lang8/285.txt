This may be boring to those who do not like technical topics : )

Nanotechnology is one of the most promising area for science and technology field. Because of its particle size, which is less than 100 nm, nanparticle has mechanically, physically, chemically, and electronically different properties than that of bulk materials. Engineered nanoparticle is applied for drug delivery, solar cells, clean manufacturing process, cosmetics, and so forth. Venture capitals, governments, and industries has invested tremendous money for spurring the innovation of nanotechnology. While the bright side of emerging nanotechnology has been extensively covered by media, the safety of nanoparticle has attracted small attention. Because of its size, nanoparticle could intrude our lung when we are exposedto it. Once nanoparticle is in the environment as products or byproduct from factories, it is practically impossible to detect because of the particle size as well.
