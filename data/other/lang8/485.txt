This city is called ' Music city ' where is Nashville. Here is a Mecca of country music. A lot of country music stars coming from here. I came here few days ago, and I found this city is full of music. For example, there are music boxes along the street, and there are a lot of bars open from lunch time, and they have good live music. I really want to the bars and listen to these real country musics, but I 'm ashamed to go inside for myself. Before I leave here I have to try.
