My favourite season is summer, but not very hot. Now in Russia is summer and it's awfully hot!!! We go to the river almost every day, but even bathing doesn't retreat me from the heat! I've never imagined, that I will hope it will be winter now. Winter I love too, but if you want to go for a walk in this season, you will be able to wear many clothes!! Autumn... I hate autumn! It's often rains, it's why you mustn't go for a walk. It's usually warm in spring.
The sunshine isn't so hot, grass and leaves are green, birds are singing... A lot of people love this season.
but it's not mine.
I accustom to summer's heat and love it best of all!
