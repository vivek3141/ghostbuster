I can't sleep too long, which will me dizzy.
However, if I don't get enough sleep, I will feel depressed. On Sunday, there are no activities and no plans. It is supposed to be a good time to sleep longer. However, I still got up on time as usual.
I tended to sleep as much as I could when I was younger.
Sleep quality seems to be more important than the time.
