I think that may be a common question for those students want to pursue a higher education. We seldom research something.
What Chinese universities offer for their students are mostly composed by coursework base curriculum. The show of our lives must go on, so does the application.
I've sum up some points which I think important and useful. 1.
You can count on google as your best friend, adviser and an almost infinite resources of academic papers. Many of them you can download pdf copy, or If you can't download paper from the links scholar. google. com offer you, go directly to the author's website, many authors enjoy their paper to be seemed and cited by potential readers. 2.
A good review is the best start point. And then you can trace the author, or the paper cited to do a more in depth research in your interested area. 3.
The balance of width and depth of your reading is essential. Both way have its merits and disadvantages. 4.
Inovative and original idea is good, but if you can not find them, you should know that most of research work is just refinement of other's work. A practical plan and reasonable analysis is also worth a lot.
