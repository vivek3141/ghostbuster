I 'm looking for a friend who is native English Speaker.
Because I'd like to my English skill up.
I was recommended to go to bar of pub where foreign people go to.
However I don't have much courage to go to pub and talk to unknown person with my cheap English.
Using Lang8 may be a way to make a friend. Does someone know a English speaker who want to study Japanese. Please Let me know. I can help Studying Japanese instead of learning English.
