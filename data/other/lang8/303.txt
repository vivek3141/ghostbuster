It was very cold day today, even though June is coming tomorrow. I think that it is kind of hot and very humid season in June, a Japan's rainy season. But it seems like the temparature would be not so high according to the wether forecast.
So I hope there will be no high humidity. I have only lived in Japan, but I hate Japanese very very very humid climate in summer!
