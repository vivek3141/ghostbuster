I was really shocked by the death of Stephen Gately.
I just listened his Boyzone's brilliant song" No Matter What" on the way back home. Stephen is cute and brave but now he is gone. When I was in junior high school everything seems boring and no meaning, also I did poorly in study. One day, I was failed to pass the examination. At that time I have no place to go, parentes hate a underachieved me but suddenly a fair - sounding floating to my ear ' I can't deny what I believe I can't be what I 'm not ' I was astonished by the voice and lyrics which cheered me up. Your lovely face look like a ray of hope. Wish you happy in paradise
