There is a bear at the washbowl in my house.
Of course, it isn't a real bear.
It is made of spnge : ) It is cute. It waits at all times to clean the washbowl.
Yesterday, I learned that John Galliano was tried when I watched CNN news.
I was so surprised and sad.
I thought he was a wonderful designer, but he got into trouble.
