Second of all, I" d like to study fashion design. Japanese fashion school don't teach fashion design. They only teach how to make clothes beautifully like the way of sawing and making patterns. But I would not like to learn those skills.
I" d like make my story deeply and study how to express the story to everyone with strong impression. Therefore I started to study in foreign country.
