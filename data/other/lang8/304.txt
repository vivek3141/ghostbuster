The weather was very fine today.
But, I was at home all day without doing anything particularly. It's really waste of time. I think I'd rather go out than stay at home uselessly. But, I don't feel like going out as well when I don't feel like doing it though I have what to do like a report. I always regret it after finishing the day. I 'm writing this journal regretting today.
