I hear news that one of oldest and most famous restaurants in Rome was punished with suspending business operation because they dishonestly charged a Japanese couple about 700 Euros for lunch. They can not speak Italian or English, but their Japanese hotel owner went to the police with them and claimed it. I was surprised that they paid it with their credit card! If I were them, I would make complaint in English, anyway. But they might threaten me or pretend not understanding English.... What can I do???
