Hi everyone...!
My name is Martina, I 'm 19 years old and Italian.
I found out about this website yesterday, and this is my very first entry journal here.
I am at my first year of university and I 'm currently studying English and Japanese as main subjects. I've always loved learning new languages, and these are the ones that I definitely like the most. I actually think I 'm in love with English and everything related to it since I first started studiying it in Elementary school...
I really enjoy learning new words ad expressions, and when I don't know the right way to say something or the right word for something you'll literally see me running towards the dictionary and grabbing it as soon as I can! yes, sometimes I 'm quite obsessed ahaha.
As far as Japanese is concerned, It's always attracted me in a way and so, since my town has one of the best language insitutes in Italy (can you say that about a university? I don't know. .) I've decided to study this charming language. I 'm going to try and write also in Japanese, although my vocabulary and grammar are obviously very poor at the moment. = P
Well, I hope to meet new people and I can't wait to learn many new things and get many corrections in order to improve my English (and my Japanese, too!).
See you soon! = D
