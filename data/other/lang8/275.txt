I love reading.
I always carry a paperback and read it while I am commuting or when I am free at school.
Today I bought a book written by Morimi Tomihiko at the bookstore in my college, where all the college students and teachers can buy books at a five persent discount off the regular price. ( The bookstore is called ' Seikyou ' in Japanese.
Most of the Japanese colleges have such bookstores. ) The title of the book was ' Kitsune No Hanashi. ' (' Kitsune No Hanashi ' means ' A story about a fox. ') I found that the story was very mysterious. I don't think Morimi Tomihiko is common all over the world, so let me explain who he is. Morimi Tomihiko is a Japanese novelist.
He graduated from Kyoto University with a major in agriculture.
Now he lives in Kyoto and the settings of most of his novels are Kyoto. Though many of the main characters in his novels are dull college students, his literary style is very colorful and sophisticated! Most of his stories can be categorized as magical realism fiction.
In Japan, his books are very popular among young people, especially among college students. Whenever I read his books, I am fascinated with his wonderful literary style. Futhermore, his story is very enjoyable. The characters in his stories are somehow likeable.
Anyway, I am fond of the books written by Morimi Tomihiko. But I 'm afraid his books are very difficult to translate into another language. In fact, all his books are remained to be translated into foreign languages.
I 'm going to finis reading ' Kitsune No Hanashi ' today., After that, I have to concentrate on the preparation for the STEP test on the next Sunday! I 'm a little nervous.
