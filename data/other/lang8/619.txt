Thank you for your kindness.
When I speak Englsh, though It isn't perfect sentence, a native speaker can understand what I mean. But I always wonder my English is right.. I have never visit foreign country. As an English learner, definitely, It is necessary to go to abroad, But I did not have enough money. I heard about Sookmyung university TESOL course is linked foreign university, so after finish the course I hope to study going in foreign university. As an English learner, I felt the English education in Korea was not effective. Through the TESOL course, I hope to improve myself as the good English teacher. First of all I will try to complete the sookmyung TESOL course by good grade, and I will learn every guidance with sincerity.
After finish the course I will practice what I learned in Kindergarten and if the chance comes to me I want to go to graduate school.
