Eventually English class finished today... I think the term of 1 month was very short, but it was very lucky to meet a good teacher. Daniel Duarte.
He is from Chile but he had lived in America from his youth life. Through the efforts of him, I could improve my English communication skill a little bit than the past time's. I think his teaching skills matched with me well than anyone's, of course, it would be very different to depend on varous people.
For instance, when the class started, he always said to us one question," What happened yesterday?". When I got his question at first class, I could not answer about it well. Of course I had my intentions so I wished to say to him but I could not answer at all. But as days go by, I could gradually adapt to his question. So if I have my intentions now, I can brainstrom ideas and tell anything. Although it is not yet perfect but I feel my skills exactly upgrade. Anyway I feel so sad with parting from him... I only have good memories and leave... From now... many dirty realities will wait for me...
and I think I will be not able to meet like him again in the hard world. It will be very precious memories to me..., so I hope to get them until dead... Then...
addios... my friend...
And thank you...
