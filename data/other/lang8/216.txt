These days, I 'm stressed out for my work. Though I like to behave myself, it's not easy to take control over my sensitive character. I think that I 'm easily pissed off regarding tiny things recently. If I keep going, before long, I might be known for a picky woman amongst colleagues. Anyway, I listed up my steps to reduce the stress as you can see the below. 1.
Eating sweeties 2.
Falling asleep
3.
Playing some music instruments 4.
Watching movies
5.
Having a conversation with friends and family The simple way is eating sweeties. But I 'm afraid to get weight. What a sad if I get a chubby because of the stress. If I had no sweeties during hard work, I would suffer from stomach ache because the more stress I have, the more gastric acid my stomach secrete. Still I had no idea which one is more better between gaining weight and aching stomach. It's a catch - 22 situation for me. lol.
Speaking of falling asleep, it's the best for me to reduce the stress. Nevertheless, it is not feasible to take it due to time - constraints. When it comes to another ways, it's impossible to do these at the office.
: ( Desperately, I need to search for alternatives to cope with the stress. Dear Lang - 8 friends, what would you do when you're under stress?
I 'm happy to hear about it. As always, thanks for reading my entry.
