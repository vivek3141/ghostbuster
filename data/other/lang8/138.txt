We have three days holiday, so I spend these days on playing. Though today is second day of new year, I say best wishes for my friends all the same.
Happy new year, my friends and my relatives.
Yesterday I got up late as usual, and then had lunch, went to supermaket with my good friend, and bought something to my family. Yesterday was a buzy day, but very happy. I feel the time past faster than usual. How time flies!
This is in 2009, it's so fast.
I elder than before. Today I had a tour of this city by bike.
It's nice, and I like it, if I have enough time, I will do it again.
