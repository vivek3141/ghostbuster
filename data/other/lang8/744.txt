I bought a voice recorder that is called a linear PCM recorder. This kind of recorder can record your voice and music at the same level or higher as CD's. Compared with my old voice recorder, the quality of the sound is totally different.
My older one's sound level was MP3, so when I heard the recorded voices, I had to stand hearing cracking sounds. However, the new recorder can reproduce the voice and music in a more natural way.
What is more, the price was lower than before!
BTW, I chose Sony, which has a good reputation of its beautiful sounds.
