Alright!
I've just changed my name" mlpxxx" to" Chloe", even though I still like my old name... lol
I've just remembered I knew" xxx" has" that" meaning when everyone told me, and I don't want you guys to mislead my name any more! haha.
My cute" My Little Pony" should not connet to such a nasty word. lololol No, they shoud not......... haha.
I don't think Japanese people know" xxx" has" that" meaning.
We just know" Kiss Kiss Kiss", so you can see cute and classy Japanese girls have usernames include" xxx" on twitter! Believe or not, we just think" xxx" looks" Kawaii". : - ) I've tweeted that kind of things for my kindness on twitter, some of my followers retweeted.
LOL
The reason my new name became" Chloe" is my real name starts" C" also. : - ) I think" Cindy" is good one, too. Please get used to my new name if you remembered me" mlp - porno". haha.
