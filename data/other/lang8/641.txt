actually I want to get more language friends here...
but I don't know how to make it. how do everyone get many friends? if I send message to stranger like" hello May I be one of your friend?" I 'm not sure but it's a little strange, isn't it?
should I correct someone's diary then I say" ummm...
I really think we will be good language partner : )"? I haven't ever approach to people so much. Is this really japanese thinking?
