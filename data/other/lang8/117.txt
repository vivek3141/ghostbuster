I have been here, NY for 4 months.
My NY life is getting change. For example, today I ordered some clothes on the internet shop! I felt fulfillment! It is a very simple and easy work for American, especially for me, this work is not simple one.
When I was in Seoul I used to shopping on website. There are many products that are more cheaper than off - line stores. After left Seoul, I didn't use the on - line stores. Because I have a something like phobia with the internet shopping.
I couldn't believe the method of charging. I suspected that way.
Because it was much simple than Korea method. I just need credit card numbers, that's all! I was worried, whether another people catch my numbers. Finally, I choose the official web site. Because I could feel more safe and comfortable. I visited A & F official website.
I was surprised!!
It was very cheap!!!!
There is no A & F official store in Korea, so private people sell that brand clothes. And the prices are very expensive!! Because of this experiences, I couldn't stop shopping on A & F website. I ordered some clothes and they are going to ship on FEB. I 'm a little bit disappointed about the speed of shipping, but it doesn't matter, I 'm really satisfied with the price and design of clothes. I expect the arriving would be happen very soon! And, I will try to use the E - bay, as soon as possible!
