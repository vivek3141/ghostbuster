I run near my house twice a week for the health. I usually run about 6 km. I sometimes run up to 10 km. It takes for about 40 minutes to run about 6km. My pace is usually 6 minutes per 1 km. I run for the halth, so I never overdo. If I feel something bad, I don't run longer than usual. But I run at least about 3km when I feel someting bad. If I feel good, I sometimes run much longer than usual. Maybe I run about 10 km slowly when I feel good.
