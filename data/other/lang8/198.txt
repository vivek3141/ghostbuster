UW means University of Washington, which locates in a beautiful city whose name is Seattle. I am here attending in a class that is ARW4.
Before I went to school this morning, I spent one hour jogging around a big lack which is Green Lake near my neighborhood. It's one of my regular hobby and sometimes it's hard for anyone who can not believe a girl who does this kind of work everyday, but I do exacully.
