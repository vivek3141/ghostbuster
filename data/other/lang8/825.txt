Yesterday my English conversation teacher Sean and I took a very interesting lesson. He suggested me that tell a lie in English. According to him, it is good practice to speak English fluently.
Because when people try to tell a lie, they tend to speak fluently.
If they can't speak fluently, we doubt the story and they wonder if that the story is true or not from their facial express, voice tone, gestures, or something like that.
When I told a like, I was very nervous to trick him. Because I had to make two stories which one is true and the other is false and I also had to told them in English with same facial express, voice tone and so on. My stories are like that ; when I was a younger, I was a tomboy and most of my friends were boys. I like playing games with them and one of my favorite games was making frog bombs. It was that I stuffed fire crackers into alive frogs and throw away toward to people. My mom was always upset to my behavior. When I was three years old, one day I was looking at a washing machine and had curious about that. While I was watching the movement, I don't know why, but I wanted to try jump into the watching machine. At the same time I recognized that I turn around with laundries. All my hairs came out and of course, I heard my mom's screaming. On the other hand, when I was a younger, I wished to do pee with standing like my boys friends. When I played with them, I always did pee with standing. One day I tried to do pee with one of my boys friends from upstairs toward to my dad's car. We were standing on the balcony and did pee. When my mom saw our pee downstairs, she was really mad to us. Do you know which story (turning around into washing machine or doing pee with standing) is true? Of course, I don't speak them in English though.
