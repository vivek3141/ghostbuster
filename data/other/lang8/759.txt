I went to community center this afternoon. That's because I attended the chorus.
I have been singing a song once a month with chorus member. It makes me very happy.
All member are good people and half of them are retirement age. I have enjoyed everytime. Our repertory of songs are a few and our talent for singing is not so good. But it is a good way to keep member's relationship. It is only once a month and so it is deifficult to improve each other. But It's OK for us.
Even enjoyable time is important.
