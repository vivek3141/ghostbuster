I read the article about Starbuck Instant coffee in the Asahi newspaper yesterday.
I suppose most of American people know it well, as it's been being sold since a year ago. My American friend has kept sending it to me, I've been enjoying it every day. It's very good.
You can make cold coffee with it too.
It's packed individually for one cup, so you can keep it fresh too.
If you are a Starbucks fan, it would be worth to try it.
