I live in NY since September, moving from Japan, and discover and wonder new things about US, writing about my questions or comment. the other day I was shocked with the dispute on TV show. in the show, a young wife suspected that his ex husband abused their second kid who is just 8 year old.
she reported her kid seemingly behaves strangely so that she asked what is wrong with her then she confessed their father, I mean her husband abuse the daughter. at first, I was very shocked not because she reported sexual abuse but because such serious dispute on air and was going to be argued in public.
the TV show was end up that she lied because she wanted to get back the custody of her first daughter who now lives with her ex husband. the reason that she was deprived of her custody of first child was she was overdoes of cocain (I forgot why she had it at that time) I thought Court TV show should deal with easy case, but I don't know what is easy and what is serious in US.
