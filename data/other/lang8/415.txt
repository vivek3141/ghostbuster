I usual run to work, but take trains to work on rainy days. We had two - days rain, so I took trains. Since I have to take two trains to work and there are some time loss, it takes more time to go to work by train than on foot. This is the disadvantage of taking trains.
On the other hand, the advance is that I can read books in the train. I could read some classic novels these two days.
