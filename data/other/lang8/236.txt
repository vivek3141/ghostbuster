I stopped smoking two weeks ago.
I started to smoke since last year and I didn't like cigarettes so much that I thought I would stop it easily...
But I know that I need to smoke really now!
I want cigarettes more than meals.
I 'm not irritable so much but I gained 6kg since then and sometimes I wanna eat foods that I don't take before. It's a little scared. So I'll try to find things I like more and I have to go on a diet!
