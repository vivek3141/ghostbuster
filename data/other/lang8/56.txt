Last English lesson, we discussed it.
There are some of causes, such as high calorie food, laziness...
In Japan, there are a lot of fast food restaurants around town. convenience store too. we can easily get food. same circumstance in the U.
S. but most Japanese people are not obese.
A teacher asked it" why".
that is probably a result of lack of self control to eating.
I go to study English on Sundays.
Sometimes I can't explain what I thought and I can't come up with good idea thinking in English.
But, the moment I just touched the door knob at my home, I got my answer." School lunch" and" Education of dietary" could be good effect of self control to eating.
All of public primary school provide lunch for students.
That was wonderful system.
The nutritionist organized calorie control, a variety of menu every day, providing best season's food, traditional meal.
Through school lunch, students learn many kind of taste, knowledge of food and Japanese culture for six years at least.
once every three time a day though, It makes good habit and health.
How about my opinion?
