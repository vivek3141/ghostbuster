With knowing comes caring, with caring there is an hope that we can find an enduring place within the natural system that supports us. An environmistalist said in TED.
Oil has been flooding in the gulf of Mexico for three months. There has been only 15 days without war since human being started recording of history which means uncountable people have been killed and killing at the same time. On the other side of the world, a great number of people live in less than 1 dollar. Apparently, the world is lopsided. All of a sudden, I am wondering how many of us believe we know what's going on outside, watching lots of news as CNN or New York Times play out. Whether things they play out are plausiable or not, one thing we need to know is that when you try to know what is true, you might be able to help anything that can chage the world in a baby step.
Pay attention.
