Today, I was reviewing my previous entries and my comments.
I realized that I 'm that kind of people who are easily impressed. I find lots of things fascinating.
I 'm moved by very simple things and other people might not even have a second look at. For instance, I started watching Indian movies about a month ago. I have some friends who are crazy about this genre.
I, on the other hand, didn't have much time to watch any.
When I had the time, I brought about six Indian movies to watch. The first movie I watched, made me cry for two hours like a five year old who lost her doll. You think the second one was different?
Not at all.
The six movies have the same basic idea.
Actually all the Indian movies have the same basic idea. However, I continued crying during the rest five and each one of them impressed me even more. Indian movies are like clay that you can shape into many different shapes but they're all still made of clay. The shape is what impresses me, and not the clay itself.
This concept might be a bit ambiguous for those who haven't been in such situation. So, how bad is it?
