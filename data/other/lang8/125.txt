People seems to have particular own sounds of steps.
I can recognize a person's ones, because it is a matter of life or death for me.
Yes, it is my boss's one. Before he open a door of a room where I am, I hear it and shape up, so if I fail to hear it and he accost me, I 'm really surprised and suspected by him even though I didn't do something bad.
I thank my ear for my survival until now.
