I have started learning English at the age of 13 which was a junior high school student in Japan. Since there was not many foreigners in my city at that time, I felt learning English was really fresh. English was my favorite class.
I graduated from university, at the same time, I quit studying English. However, I restarted studying English for my better life since I do understood how English is important in the global society.
