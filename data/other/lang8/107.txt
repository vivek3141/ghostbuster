My Japanese friend sent me some tea things of Japanese tea ceremony last month. I learned Japanese tea ceremony lesson one time a week for three years befor I come here at Japan. I liked how to make the greentea and friends who I have became friends. And the teacher was so great to teach us. I was enjoying to commute this class. Now I want to drink this greentea sometimes. I know it's thick and bitter.
So today I made greentea by simply process. After I mede it, I drunk the greentea. What bitter! It was so bitter for me. Why I don't remember this taste? I wonder!
But I'll make the greentea again.
