I 'm participating in a university contest involving some tests (I don't feel test is the best word. .. can you think of a better one?), all about the Millenium Objetives stated by the UNO.
After each team submits its proposal, there's a week for the people to vote their faouvorite on the web. After that, a jury scores / rates each one, and so the winner for each test is chosen.
There's a final prize for the three ones scoring highest at the end of the contest : they all can enrol for free in a postgrade major course (or a language one, if they haven't finished their career). Additionally, the first team get to travel to New York! We won last test, and each of the components of our team got a mobile phone. As I had just bought a Motorola Milestone (the european version of Droid), I gave it to my father, who's actually very happy with it, since it's a cute small nokia with wifi. We go firsts now, but since they try to give one prize to a different team each time, we expect the jury to make the ones who go third win this time. But we still hope we win at last and visit USA!! Wish us luck : )
