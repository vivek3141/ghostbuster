Time goes by so fast.
Two months has passed since I came here. I am really learning a lot, but I sometimes wish the classes would be a bit more difficult so that I could learn more. Also I don't have many assignments, so I am still enjoying my free time, which is good, though.
Today, I jammed with a british person in his house because his band lost the guitarist, so he was looking for one. I hope I can join them and balance everything I need to do here.
I sometimes go to pubs just to drink couple of beers.
I was surprised how people here make friends. People go to the same pub always, so they become friends automatically.
Actually, this kind of thing happens in Japanese bars, but it seems more natural and common here.
The interesting thing is, the more you go to the same pub, the cheaper the drink you order becomes.
I paid three pounds for one beer at first, but now I just pay about two pounds : )
Next month, I have nine days vacation. I am planning to go to Canada and the USA.
I hope I can manage it on my budget : )
