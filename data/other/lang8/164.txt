The worst thing in life : (
Good morning : )
Exams are the worst thing in life : D, It really is
I know that It is essential but It make me really stressed out : (
I Love to learn new things especially languages but I want to learn it because I want to not because I have to, you know
The worst thing in the world is sitting in a room with only your pen and watch the time go away What if I don't remember what I have studied because of stress and worry!
But whatever I will do my best and try to work hard enough to do well in these exams, hopefully : D
Prey for me : D : D
