These days my lovely boy is getting naughty.
He is crowling everywhere as his instinct tells. When he gets silence, it is dangerous sign to me. He is chewing something really dangerous.
Today he chewed a piece of kleenex.
He would almost be stucked.
I noticed it because he coughed.
I put my fingures into his little mouth, and pull it out. While I was washing the dishes, he did it.
I tried to keep an eye on him on doing house work, but it happened only in a few seconds I didn't see.
Everyday he is growing up little by little, step by step, and everyday I am learning how I deal with his can - do things.
