That was the first time that I had ever seen the whole town had no electricity and got completely dark. No electricity means that everything including traffic lights, streetlights, stations doesn't work completely. So there must be good chances that accidents happen.
Yesterday, I had blackout for three hours and during that time, I stayed home and played the acoustic guitar because there was nothing expect playing the acoustic guitar. I couldn't turned on my PC, I can't cook anything with my kitchen which works with electricity and I couldn't read any books. I felt like our life went back to the primitive age and I again realized that electricity has a large portion of our life.
Now I've been wondering when our life will get back normal.
