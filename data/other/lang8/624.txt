These days I read the novel" Kafka on the shore".
This is written by Haruki Murakami.
My coworker gave me this novel for my birthday present.
Actually I don't like Haruki Murakami and coworker's known that.
But she said this novel was special and you'd like it.
So I tried to believe her opinion and started to read it.
I've read half of it, and I think it's better than I expected.
But sometimes I feel impatient, when I read the sentence that has too much fantastic expression.
You know, Haruki Murakami is best seller author.
His novels are translated throughout the world.
But I don't know why he is popular in the world.
Do you like Haruki Murakami?
