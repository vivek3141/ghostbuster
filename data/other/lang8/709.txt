Every time I met a foreigner interested on learning spanish and also interested on lerning the language on a spanish speaking vountry their natural choice was Spain. and I started wondering why. It might be that spain is closer to them because in Europe all countries are kind of together, or the currency. but then again, south america is far, I know, but by plane is what 1315 hours away from europe? then it is not that far anyway.
Plain ticket, much more expensive... but wait, living here is much cheaper, hotels, food, clothes, everything is way cheaper.
then what. maybe because it is a dangerous place. in fact not all south america is ruled by narcos and guerrillas. there are so many places here that are safer than some countries.
South america is beautiful, I didn't understand that really but until a few days ago. chile, my country, doesn't really have a culture of its own.
many things we appreciate being ours are actually the heritage of Spanish, German, or holland emigrants. but this mix of cultures together with the effect of time over our population make us a country rich on art and architecture. I've always felt like a foreinger among my people, and I guess that is why I like to observe them so much, so many simple things make us what we are, chilean and south americans.
Please if you are planning to visit a spanish speaking country, dont loose the chance of droping here or inany other neighbor country.
