I 'm always sleepy after eating lunch.
I used to lie down on the sofa after finishing it. Recently I read a book about the digestion. Acording to this, taking a nap is not good for digestion. It recomends us that even if we are sleepy after lunch, we should not sleep, and if we get very sleepy, we should go for a walk to forget our sleepness. Finally I decided to practice it. After lunch of today, I brought the book to the sofa and began to read it. But two hours later I found I had been sleeping until that time. I went to sleep after all today too. I wonder I will be able to stay up tomorrow.
