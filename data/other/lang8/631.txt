Those who speak English sometimes say" I don't mind." and" I don't care."
I often use them not knowing proper use though, so teach me if you know about it.
Btw, I 'm going to buy a present for gift exchange party on Christmas but don't know what to buy because the present isn't for someone special. What do you recommend?
