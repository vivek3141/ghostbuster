I go to the training gym and running about three times in a week. Then I often listen to rock music, but I want more songs that is speedy and rhythmical. I hear that music of BPM 160 - 180 is suitable for running. I 'm always looking for the songs. If you have any songs you recommend, please tell me. I often listen to Good Charlotte, Fall Out Boy, Linkin Park, Zebrahead and so on.
What music do you listen to when you are running?
