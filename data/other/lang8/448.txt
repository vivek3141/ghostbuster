Tomorrow a new semster will begin. I don't want to go to class.
After one and a half year I will graduate from my college. I have prepared to take the IELTS exam in May. But one of my friend think I should take BEC first, and then finish the IELTS in July or August. Because BEC is good for job hunting. Now I have no idea what should I do. Can you give me some suggestions, my dear friends? I am really confused now.
