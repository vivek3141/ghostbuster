The US president Bush will finish his term soon. In my opinion, I've always thought he is really incapable and dull. (Again, it's just my personal opinion.) In spite of incapable people, they can be a politician. There are a lot of such politicians in Japan, too. Probably, they also could be a head of state, if they had something advantage, such as crowd - pulling charisma. So I 'm wondering what is Bush's advantage. I still can't find it. As you know, an Iraqi reporter threw his shoes at Bush at a press interview in Baghdad.
That scene was aired on TV repeatedly.
According to the news, the shoes were not the reporter's own ones. He prepared big and heavy shoes for this attack. If it had hit Bush, he must have gotten injured. Then, finally I found Bush's advantage. What a good reflexes he has. He has cat - like - reflexes. I wonder if he was playing any sports when he was young. If Japanese politicians were him, they would get hit and injured terribly. I don't think he could be the US president due to his good reflex though. I think you watch it a lot of times, but look at his incredible reflexes again! Especially, the first throwing!
