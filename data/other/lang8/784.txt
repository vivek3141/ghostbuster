Have you ever used a pedometer?
It is said adequate workout help you keeping your health. I think walking is the easiest workout for almost everyone from young to old people. The pedometer count your steps when you put on it automatically. You can see how many steps you have walked.
It is fun, even funner than expected. Not bad at all.
I recommend that. More than ten thousands steps a day is appreciate daily target to achieve. Why don't you try to put on a pedometer and go walk?
