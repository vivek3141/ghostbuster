It is cloudy or rainy recently. Although my school was no lecture, I got up early in the morning today. I ate a piece of toast putting butter and cinnamon sugar and went to a coin laundry near my house to wash my clothes because I do not have clothes washer in my house.
It cost six dollars to washing and cost six dollars to the dryer. When I washing ended, it was evening. I went to the cake shop in the city my friend introduced to me as nice taste and famous. The shop of inner decorating was green. After came back home, I cooked dinner, and the dinner was prawn & avocado salad, roast chicken and OTAMA SAN GOHAN. First, cut lettuce, cut coarsely a tomato and then stair - fly some prawns. Stair - fry it until it became golden brown.
The roast chicken only heated up with oven.
The OTAMA SAN GOHAN is Japaneseonly traditional food. It only sprinkles the raw egg and a pinch of the soy source on warm rice. They were easy cooking but they tasted nice!! After that I watched two movie, animation of genius boy and 007, on TV for approximately four hour. So I felt tired my eyes and butt.
