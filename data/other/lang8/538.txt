Today I went to the Tokyo Bay's fireworks show!
I arrived takeshiba station at 1 pm for saving space.
Our space is near the sea and the station, and when I arrived there, there were some friends. They had been there from yesterday, so they looked so tired!
About 4 pm, many friends came there.
And we had waited while eating and drinking for starting the fireworks show... At 7 pm, the fireworks show started.
We have been tired, but when we watched them, we forgot our fatigue. The fireworks was the most beautifl which I had watched ever. Please watch them with my picture ^ ^ In fact, more beautiful!! Or, I weared a yukata for a long time so I was happy. I want to go there next year too ^ ^
