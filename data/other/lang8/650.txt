Today is 2nd - anniversary of going out with my girlfriend. We went on a date today.
First, we went to American Village. She bought me a bottom and two shirts. It's so cool! Second, we went to Kaiyukan (This is aquarium in Osaka). We looked at many fishes and took many photos. I will buy present for her (because we didn't have time today). I can be myself when I am with her < 3
