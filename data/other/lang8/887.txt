I like reading science fiction.
My favorite SF writer is Sir Arthur Charles Clarke.
Do you know him?
He wrote" A Space Odyssey : 2001"," The Childhood's End"," The City and The Stars" and so on.
I have these novels on paperback.
It is very interesting to read them in English.
Because I read them that was translated to Japanese several times, I can read them without a dictionary. Do you like SF?
If you so, please recommend your favorite SF books.
Thank you.
