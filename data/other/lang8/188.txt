When I went to school, today also there were only a few students in the classroom.
I 'm no longer suprised that situation. All I want to know is that why they couldn't come to my calss. I asked someone about why they were not here. He explaned the reason in Swahili, so I wasn't able to understand, but I realized that they were in under the punishment. Almost all students. 3 / 4.
Do you remember my journal which I wrote 2 days ago? About the CHOTA MAJI.
Today's calss is the same class which I wasn't able to teach them because of CHOTA MAJI. So, They are turned over the progress of classwork.
As I was thinking what can I do to keep up with other class, one of the class member proposed to have a class at night.
I don't have any option, so it seems that I should teach my students at 8 : 00 pm tonight.
Tanzanian students are differ from Korean students. When I was in Korea, if we skipped the calss because of other affairs, they seemed very happy. However, in here, my students don't want to skip the calss. Whenever I have a class at night (actually, sometimes we have an extra class at night like today), I was satisfied of my students who listened devouring every word. I love my students ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
