I have started making a next travel plan in May or June.
My plan is to go to East coast because I have never been there and the area I want to visit are New York, Washington D. C and Florida. I guess it would take more than a week if I will visit all famous tourist spots in those area and I 'm not sure whether I could take a vacation more than a week. So, I might give up to visit some spots. Anyway, I have to research how long I need to go around each location I want to go and then decide the duration of the trip.
