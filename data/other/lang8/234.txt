In order to drink, I finised my work early. I drank with coworkers days after a long separation. Because one of the man was on leave of absence from work, we couldn't meet with us. I had a really good time with them.
But I was reflect that I could do something for him more. Maybe if I could listen to his affair he might be not on leave of it. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

I went to the climbing gym. I could climb today more than last time because my hip's hurt was getting better. I was really happy.
I felt that health is the most important thing for human. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

I couldn't wake up early this morning.
I can have been tired, nevertheless, I went to the climbing gym. I thought that I 'm happy to go to the climbing gym. Because I could meet to my friends whose I wanted to meet. A Japanese famous climber Yuji made many challenges in there. I tried some new challenges but they were so difficult for me. After all, I couldn't do climbing at level five of challenge. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

I joined the English conversation club.
This is my sixth time joining this club.
I couldn't speak English too much. Speaking English is more difficult than listening and writing English.
I had met a man who was good at English very well.
I'd like to see him again.
Then, I went to the climbing gym.
At last, I could climb the level five of challenge and almost yellow 11th.
I was really happy.
I went to drinking with Nobu afterword. I had a really great day.
