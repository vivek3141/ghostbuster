I finished my work of the last year on 27th December.
Then I went to Kumamoto by plane on 28th December.
I caught a call from my friend, whose birthday is on that day. He wanted to be celebrated his birthday by me, so I celebrated him. It was a very funny, because the person who calls is opposite from normal.
He is not an usual man. The next day I went to Hakata.
Then my friend lost his purse in the train from Kumamoto to Hakata. Therefore we went to the contact center in the station and the police station to ask if the purse was found. Two hours later it was found, so we appreciated people who help us. Then I went back to my hometown on 30th December. I met some friends in recent days, and will go to Chiba tomorrow. I would like to stay more at my hometown, but I'll start to work on 4th January. I wanna work near my hometown someday.
