I went to USJ yesterday with my friend.
It was so cold that I could not stop shivering.
However there were not so many people there, so we do not need to wait our turn outside. My friend worked part - time at USJ.
It looked like she was really having a great time!
So I wanted to work part - time at USJ, too.
I will go to Tokyo Disney Land in February.
I am really looking forward to it : )
It will be very cold.
So I must ptotect myself against the coldX (
I want to go to Walt Disney World someday!!!
