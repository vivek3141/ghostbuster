Ah, that thingie just reminded me that I should write an entry.
No idea what to write about, let's just see if I 'm able to produce consistent English, at least on paper (on monitor, you'd rather say :) ). Although I don't like these commercialized sites that offer everything in the form of several easy steps, I have to admit that the vast and helpful community easily overcompensates it : ) As I noticed people like to break things into paragraphs here, sometimes having a dedicated one for each sentence. Just like the one above.
And forgive me for having such a silly entry title.
I really couln't come up with anything better.
In case you have nothing to correct (I am too optimistic today) leave a note so I know it doesn't get ignored.
