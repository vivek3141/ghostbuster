As I wrote yesterday, I had to write a rough draft of short report on behalf of my elder daughter. Today, I had to translate her message for the graduation ceremony. She will be graduated from elementary school soon! The graduation ceremony and party will be held in mid - June.
There are a lot of things to do before the promotion.
She had spent only 3 months in this elementary school, She needed to write some articles ; * What I will miss most is...
* My favorite memory of this school is...
* My best field trip is...
* I am looking forward to...
I was surprised and delighted to know that she could write plenty of sentences in Japanese.
Her new life seemed to be filled with memorable days!
But I am all anxiety now. You know, my English skill is such poor and I don't have any confidence to my writing at all. I hope her teacher will correct her writing before it will be used at the ceremony...
If there were more time to submit, I would write the sentences here and ask to correct!
