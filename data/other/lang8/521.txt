Well, it's really overwhelming knowing that I will be 25 hours later when I got up.
So I think it's memorable to keep something down here. I have to admit age is a becoming more and more sensitive as I get older and older, and the older I got, the more responsiblity comes along and the more mature you should behave. How I wish I could live without aging!
Well, I think I wish I could welcome the moment at home as usualy, but I failed for the last conple of days which flashed through so quickly in a northern city I have never been to before. Travelling makes the time elapse so quicky that I have hardly anytime to digest the change of age satisfactorily, Even though I have been able to come back home this morning, I still can't take my time and am actually struggling to keep awake to digest it as much as I can, because I hardly sleep yesterday. By the way, I also logged on my skype again and again, but people just don't show up, the day when we are all 24 wil be gone forever, : ), you know I am talking about you, but entre nous, you just do
n't tell others, okay? I just want to say, last but not the least important, I like English and English is beautiful.
