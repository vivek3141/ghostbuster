Do you know Hastune Miku?
Hastune Miku is a Vocaloid.
She is a computer game character made by SEGA.
SEGA is a Japanese game maker.
We can enjoy Miku to sing songs as we like. There are many Vocaloid fans all over the world now.
In this summer SEGA took Miku out of computer.
They made her sing in front of hundreds people!! How?
They figured out an actual size Miku by 3D computer technology, and they projected her on a transparency screen.
Miku took her first concert in Tokyo and America. Many Miku fans went to her concert to see an actual size Miku singing and dancing.
I felt deep impression when I saw her concert DVD. Miku seemed REAL!!!
She is so cool!!!
I sang together her and an audience in DVD ( ^ ^ ; Now Japan economy is decreasing. They say Japanese young people do not go out but play games in their room nowadays.
They put the blame on young people for not buying something like a car.
The automobile has been an main engine for Japanese economy for a long time. In 1960's and 70's any young people longed a car. They worked hard to buy a car, TV, house, washing machine, refrigerator and so on.
I 'm sure those were so cool for 60's - 70's young people.
But now, we can not long for a car like them.
For us a car is just a car.
A young people always loves first thing in the world.
I 'm sure Miku's concert is first thing! (^ ^) I 'm very very glad to see Game Character coming to see me out of PC. I grow up with a lot of Manga, Anime.
I love GANDAM, EVA, 999, GOKUU, SLAM DANK... also Laura Ingalls Wilder, Anne, Frodo Baggins, Holmes, Momo.
I have seen a REAL character like them first time in Miku's concert.
I 'm sure Miku is not useful for anything at all.
Some feels that I 'm funny and Miku is curious.
But I 'm proud that the parents of Miku are Japanese and they tried to make a REAL Miku first in the world!
