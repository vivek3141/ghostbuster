What I feel? What I learn? In this period, I learned a lot of interesting things about all the themes that my classmates explained.
I learned new vocabulary that I didn't know.
I think the most important thing in a presentation is the vocabulary that you learn.
And other thing that I must learn is not be afraid when I speak in front of people. Although I feel a bit bad, and dissapointed of me because I've decided be more responsable with my homework and I didn't do it. In both presentation, I didn't effort for get a good note, because I know that I could do it better but I didn't, but also I didn't recived the support of my team. If I was lazy, they were lazier than me. That's why I've learn that I got to work harder, if my team don't do anything, I got to do it because the note is important, and I guess that got to be individual. At the other hand, I felt very amazed about some clasmates, they did a wonderful job, I felt envy of them because I'd love to do it at the same way or better. But I promise the next time I'll effort and I won't trust in my teammates.
