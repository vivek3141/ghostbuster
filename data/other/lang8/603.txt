The room was well air - conditioned.
No sounds of swirling air were heard, but from somewhere up on the ceiling, chilly and dry air was mechanically circulating.
It was as small as three to three square meters, and the walls were wood - effect, which you may think gave a hint of dark impression to the space, but the glass pane of the window was so large, fully transparent from the bottom to the top, that we could feel moderately comfortable, not too dark nor too bright.
From the angle where I was seated, I could see Yossy and behind her the gloomy, stormy weather in Tokyo through the window, but couldn't hear any sounds of the rain or thunder. Even though we were behaving normally like mature adults, we might naturally become a little nervous.
At least I forgot to ask her several, but very material questions that I wanted to hear directly from her ;
Music - wise, how should I properly understand regarding the natural harmonic overtone?
How has she been able to improve her English ever since she began to write her journal here every day?
How does she practice playing sax, her professional carrier, and how could she keep her motivation to improve more? etc, etc...
If you had stood next to the sliding door of the room hearing what was being talked inside, you might have heard intermittet laughing sounds made by a female, and monotonous, enthusiastic talks by a male, which might have gave you an impression ; the atmosphere was not too bad, or too good either.
