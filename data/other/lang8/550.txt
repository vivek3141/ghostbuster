It's been raining.
How depressing!
I don't like rainy days.
It was also a cold day today.
According to the weather forecast, it's going to snow tomorrow. I think winter is surely coming. I 'm plannning to go to Sapporo (a capital of Hokkaido, Japan) this weekend and I feel uneasy to go through the pass because it's very dangerous to drive on the icy road. Actually, I've never gone through the pass in this season of the year. I hope that nothing will happen. Today four more students were absent from school because of the swine flu.
In total, thirteen students were absent.
The third and fourth grade class are suspended as well as the first grade class. I 'm worried about my students ' condition.
I'll demonstrate English class tomorrow.
I 'm a little nervous but I 'm looking forward to it.
I spent after school preparing for it.
I hope that someone will give me some beneficial and useful advice and my students will enjoy my class.
