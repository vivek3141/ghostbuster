Hi everyone,
I just realised I am so lucky!!!
Why?
It's because my mum is probably the best cook I have met in my life. Cooking is not her profession, she is a housewife. I have ate at hotels and expensive meals but they are nothing like what she cooks. A friend once told me that the reason why I love her cooking is because she's my mum but that is not the reason.
Being a housewife is really tough.
I rather be working outside than be a housewife. So I must appreciate my mum and help her ^ ^
