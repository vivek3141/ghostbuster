Hi!
This is my frist entry on lang - 8. com.
I am a girl from Beijing, China.
I am a freshman in university. I got to know this web site several days ago, and I have got through some enties written by others. I find them interesting and I decided to start writing on this web site to improve my English.
I don't have much language talent.
The only foreign language I am learning is English.
I will spend some time to correct Chinese learner's enties. Because I wish more and more people can appreciate my mother tongue.
