I tutor a 9 - grade student in math because of the upcoming senior high school entrance exam.
Yet she always answer wrong at the same questions that I had taught several times, like negative number multiply by negative number is positive number. After today's tuition, she will go to a karaoke with her classmates.
She just casually answered the questions and sort of appeared impatient, which made me sort of angry. Yet I has reflected on myself of my behavior back home. Not everyone is good at math or should be a mathematician or something like that.
I should have more patience.
