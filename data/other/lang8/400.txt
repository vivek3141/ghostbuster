My niece and I went to a municipal indoor swimming pool yesterday.
It is used the heat produced by waste disposal for heating water in the pool.
She is 4 - year old.
She can't still swim very well yet, so she wanted to use her inner tube all the time. But she improved a little for one hour. I can swim very well because I used to practice swimming in high school as after - school activities. I was a breaststroker.
I felt myself getting out of shape....
FML
Anyway we had a lot of fun.
