Yesterday, my husband and I visited Fort cunning park and MacRitchie reservoir. Both were beautiful nature parks, we had a good time there. In the morning we started our walk from Fort cunning information centor to get a map. It was a time to have lunch, so I went to Fort cunning club house there were some restaurants and bar. Unfortunatelly, It was renovationing! We were so shocked because we were hungry.
We loooked for other restaurants in a hurry and found it on the map. At last we reached there. That was a nice looking restauran on the hill around a beautiful forest t. It was a colonial style (singapore colonial house is called black and white), and founded in 1908. If the restaurant had not closed, we cought have a lunch in the teraace! What a disaster!
The resaurant was closed on every sunday! We wanted to eat anything, anywhere so we had a lunch in a near macdonald (my husband likes mac). After lunch, we took a walk around the park. There were so many tropical tree and plants and many of them was first looking for us.
I took many pictures in daze. On the way, I happen to watch the traddditional malay wedding outside. That was so wonderful! I was so impressed.
We had time to go other place, we went MacRitchie reservoir near our house. In the reservoir, we rented a canoue two people using the same. We paddled the canoue there and it was a lot of fun! The reservoir was in the forest, we felt exploring a jungle or something.
