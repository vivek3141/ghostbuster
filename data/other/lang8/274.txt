S.
A
An annual meeting of society for neuroscience will be held from the next Saturday to Wednesday at Chicago. To attend the meeting, I'll go to Chicago.
This is the first time to go U. S.
A for me.
And I haven't use international flight alone. I know almost nothing about international travel! And sometime people says" U. S.
A is dangerous!"
So, I 'm really anxious about this travel. But, of course, I expect to have a good time.
I hope this trip is fun.
This is a good chance for me.
I'll enjoy Chicago!
