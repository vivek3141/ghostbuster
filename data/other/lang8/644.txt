I have been to Turkey last summer. I went to Cappadocia. Cappadocia is very interesting because there are many characteristic rocks. One of them is like a camel (Picture1 is it). I scaled rocks and scenery which I saw from the upper part of rocks is so beautiful and amazing. I was impressed with the beauty of nature.
