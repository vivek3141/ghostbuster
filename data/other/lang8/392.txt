Tomorrow morning, I should take a toeic exam in school. I often have taken a toeic exam in Korea, It's a long time ago. I'd like to get a good score.
When I was in Korea, my one of big problems was weak english listening. It's so difficult until now. Yesterday I tried to listen and understand the news,
but I couldn't understand well. I already have been living in Toronto for 3months, whenever I went to the theather I am always frustrated. Last saturday, I went to the AMC to watch a movie" Harry potter"
I know, It's not easy understand english without subtitles.
but I couldn't everything. When can I be able to understand the news, movies and pop song. I am always dreaming that I am able to travel everywhere without english.
