I really like summer, which reminds me of passion.
My complexion are getting better compared to other seasons. Besides, prolonged daytime makes me feel comfortable even though I go outside in the evening on safety grounds.
But there is one annoying thing.
No other than mosquitoes. I personally think that people are divided into two groups : Folks who attract mosquitoes easily or not.
Unfortunately I fell into the former.
One of my nicknames is" Living mosquito safety net".
It means that people around me are free from mosquitoes at the price of my mosquito bites.
So ironically, I 'm not the subject to be protected.
It appears that mosquitoes deeply love to eat my blood.
Dear mosquito, do you really think my blood is more yummy than others? I 'm already getting tucked at a great deal of mosquito bites. I even dreamed that mosquitoes attacked me seriously like" the Birds" by Hitchcock. No kidding!
I make up my mind to take actions for it. I don't like to be a powerless victim from mosquitoes. I 'm wrestling with the ideas so as to protect me from them. Dear Lang 8 friends, do you have any stories related to mosquitoes?
I 'm genuinely happy to listen to yours.
As always, thanks for reading my little story.
Hope you have a nice weekend. : )
