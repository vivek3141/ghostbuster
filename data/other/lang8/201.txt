Last week, I traveled to Rota Island.
It is a small island between Saipan and Guam.
There are far less tourists than Saipan or Guam. There is no shopping mall, no duty free stores but full of natures. You may feel bored if you like modern cities but I love there. Actually I have traveled there eleven times! I think the ocean of Rota is most beautiful in the world. Local people are very friendly and we can be friends quickly. I have some friends in Rota.
Every time I come to Rota, they say me" welcome back!". They invite me BBQ, picnic and hunting!! This time, they took me to a coconut crab hunting. It was really exciting experience. Coconut crab is active at night so we went to a coconut forest at night. It eats coconut, so it's flavor of coconut. It was yummy!!
