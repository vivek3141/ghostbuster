Some students need to find job for living, but others have choice if they work or no for extra money. Also some of them say work would obstacle for their study. It sounds it is right so that study should be prioritized.
But I agree with that students do part - time even in Japan. In japan it is common that parents pay their children's tuition and living cost until they graduate from school.
So they do not need to work, though they still need some extra money for cloth dating and so on. I think there are few students who work for living cost like foods, house rent, utility bill. Thats why it seems unnecessary experience. But It's not only money that they could have.
They can learn how to work with other people and cope with problems that they face in their workplace.
Cooperation skill is very important, so if they won't do any job while they are student, after graduate they may face some difficulty such as related with social and coping skill in the future. Also they would know how time is precious and enhance their time management skill. In conclusion, part - time job is beneficial but students shouldn't spend too much time for a little extra money.
