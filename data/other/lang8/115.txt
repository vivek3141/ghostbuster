From the Wall Street Journal today, I found an interesting article about the future plan of Japan.
The article is from the Review & Outlook section.
The title is" A New Plan for Japan".

As far as I am concerned, the article clearly suggests three main solutions for Japan's problems.
Actually, there are not only three solutions in the article, but I just picked up three solutions. I felt this was a good article for both Japanese and foreign people to understand Japan's current situation.
The first solution is to lower corporate and personal taxes.
The taxes in Japan are relatively higher than those in most of other developed countries.
To signal young leaders that entrepreneurship will be rewarded, this solution is important.
The second solution is pension reform to control the exploding cost of old - age payouts.
As you may know, Japan has the second lowest birthrate.
This will result in rapid aging society with fewer children. The current pension system was mainly created in 1985.
I think it's already outdated.
The third solution is immigration reform.
As mentioned above, because Japan will become the aging society with fewer children, Japan needs people from foreign countries.
However, inviting foreign people are not easy due to the following two reasons.
First, Japan is an island country, so many Japanese people have not had much opportunity to communicate with foreign people.
Second, many Japanese people can not speak foreign languages very well.
This solution is easy to say, but not easy to implement.
The longer Japan delays, the harder it will be to implement the solutions.
To improve the current situation is really difficult, but it seems to me that it is possible.
I believe Japan can thrive again with the right leader and the right reforms.
I also want to be of some help to revive Japan.
