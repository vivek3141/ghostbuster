Recently, I watched ' Gran Torino ' directed and starred by Clint Eastwood on TV. It was a great film.
I think this film is one of the best films of Clint Eastwood. In the beginning of this summer, I met his son, Kyle Eastwood, in the big book shop in Paris.
There was a kind of lecture about his music career. He played the contrabass and the guiter. His music is played in the end of Gran Trino. He was very nice guy and handsome.
