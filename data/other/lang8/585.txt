My girlfriend is worth respecting.
She can be kind to everyone around her and never says bad things.
It is far more difficult than we think to behave like that way. She is not only able to play the piano well, but also knows how to listen.
Because ensemble requires cooperation, listening to other is very important. It also applies to daily conversations. Her attitude of listening enriches her communication.
I sometimes wonder if I deserve to be her boyfriend.
I should learn from her.
