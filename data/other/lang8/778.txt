It's over nealy in weekend.
I just had dinner and sat at desk. Ah..
At last, It's fall.
I can feel chill in the morning early. I like the fall in the weather. It make me sentimantal and moody. So I just recorded CD. While I driving in car, I often used to listen music. Have you heard Sting of musician? I like him and his voice.
He's like a fall. or His voice is good match in the fall. (I 'm not sure this sentense)
