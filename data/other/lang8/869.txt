I received a very sad news from my friend in Tokyo. She is one of my close friends who are painters.
According to her, one of our classmates in our painting school died because of a cancer. Actually, I talked to her last month. At that time she seemed to be fine.
So, I didn't know that she had been suffering from the disease.
To be honest with you, I didn't like her because she was the person who said whatever was on her mind. So, I was weak in her. When I chatted with her last time, it was my first time to see her in six months. Although I didn't realize, my friend told me that she had been in hospital for a while.
I live in far from Tokyo, so I can not attend her funeral. However, I would love to pray for her.
I guess I will feel sad when I will see her posthumous work at our painting school.
