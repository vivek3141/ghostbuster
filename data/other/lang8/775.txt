Today, a student from America came to my school.
I want to talk with her.
But I can't talk well.
So I talked with her little. I want to talk with her more!
I tried hard tomorrow! My friend speaks English very well!
I want to improve my talking ability. What should we do? If you have ttime, please give me little advice.
