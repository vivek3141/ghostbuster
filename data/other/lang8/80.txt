Friday!
Recently, I 'm fascinated with a TV series named" How I met your mother." (Though I don't watch it on TV but the Internet because is hasn't introduced into Taiwan.)
And thank God it's Friday night so that I have time to watch the newest episode.
This sitcom is talking about a man named Ted telling a story about how he found his true love to his children.
Well, however, Ted hasn't seen the" lucky" women from season 1 to 4.
Ha ha!
My favorite character is Barney which is not only a successful businessman but a humorous friend of Ted's.
He always make his own theory about life! : - D
Except the humor in the series, another reason why I love this sitcom is that I am looking forward to a close, meaningful relationship like the one between Ted and his friends.
Hope our TV station can bring the series into Taiwan soon!
