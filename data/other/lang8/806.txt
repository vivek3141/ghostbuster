I watched DVD" Who killed the electric car?" ; this is a documentary film thta deals with the history of the electric car, mainly focused on The General Moters EVI. This type of car was invented to reduce air pollution, the emission of carbon dioxide out of atmosphere about ten years ago. When it was released at GM, it became sensational, but disappeared and" Hammer" was released instead. This is said chiefly because the influence of Bush administration and oil company pushed out this environmentally friendly car. Ten years later, now, we are conscious of how we can be" green" and President Obama are going to encourage the invention of this pug - in electric car. The film is very impressive to know the situation in those days, and how strong policy and companies ' relations are to pursue each profit.
