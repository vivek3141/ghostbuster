Coming home, my wife and I talked about people we met at the Sarah's wedding. It's been almost more than ten years since we got into the University but some doesn't seem to be growing up. Oh, I might be asked whether I am growing. I surely can say ' yes, I am ' - at least ' yes, I did grow up in some area. ' Well, it's not that I am proud of myself but thirsty for growing. I should be growing not to be arrogant but to shine.
