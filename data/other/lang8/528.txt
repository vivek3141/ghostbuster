I wanna love myself, I wanna love them.
In addition, I wanna be loved by them.
But, there is no point we can share deeply.
I think I understand their value, but they looks that they don't understand other value of me. I know it's really small thing, but I also feel this tiny gap definitely exists. I know they don't hate me, but I also know they don't love me.
As you know, I 'm a kind of person who is so ' easy '. Being easy is good point, but it make me wanna die. I don't know how to escape from this guy I have lived for 22 years. I have no idea.
The thing I really hate is predictable future. I can predict my future.
I think that is the best case.
I feel I need to change.
If I act, I need to act perfectly.
Fortunately, no one knows about me here.
There is no option not using this chance. I can stay here only 3 month more. I need to change.
See ya.
