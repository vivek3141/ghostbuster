Hi!!
I 'm happy today, but people seem as if they were very very angry.
When I was walking by the street, two cars were going to kill me!
xD
And people seems as if they were constipated (this word is funny because in spanish " constipado " is " cold ", and it's eassy mistake the meaning xD). But I've been happy, and soon I've seen a teacher that was happy too. This is gorgeous 8 )...
Another new : I've finished my sculpture! At last!
And this is a secret present for my dad xP
Good day for everyone!!
