I couldn't attend my last English conversation class.
I will move to a new place so I quit English conversation school at the end of this month. My last class was this Monday though, I had to go to my daughter's cram school at that time. I like my English teacher, Sean, and I sometimes wrote about him here. His teaching style is so unique that I loved the way. He always encouraged me and spoke to me after classes. We enjoyed chatting in couple minutes. In the conversation one day he told me that I 'm his favorite student.
When I listened to that, I was very happy. I miss that I couldn't attend the last class very much. I wanted to express my thanks feelings, and I also wanted to say good bye. If I know his e - mail address, I can contact with him though... After I married, I've repeated moving because of my husband's business. This is seven times. People told me that I 'm lucky because I can live many places, and I can have the experience which people can't. Of course, it is true but I 'm not an easy going person like that my friends think. Moving sometimes works minus. Sean and I could maintain good relationships if I didn't move. I always have to cut good relationships by myself even if I don't want to do that. In this case, I cut two good relationships by myself. One is my oil painting teacher, and the other is my English teacher. I've never returned back to here so I never meet them from now on. I know that after painful separation, I will have good meeting. Therefore, I will be optimistic, and I want to expect good meeting in a new place.
