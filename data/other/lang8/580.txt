I could not believe my eyes at all when I saw that on TV. Because now I live in Thailand. So it is inconvenient to get the precise information. I went for a drink with my colleague and watched a BBC program. What I saw there, is an atrocious scene. Large amount of cars, houses, people had floated. Walls and signboards had fell. So many people were waiting for trains to go back home.
The worth things, the focus of the earthquake is near my house. My mother and my sister still live there. And apart from them, my father and younger brother also is in the prefecture. Therefore I called with my cellphone to them. But It couldn't connect.
I was so worried about of them. I can not help stopping to see internet to get any information. For example, ustream, twitter, facebook and so on.
Finally, I got an e - mail from my sister this afternoon.
She said they are all safe and stay at home together now. I felt relieved a little. However, the situation is still serious.
I 'm concerned about the nuclear plant.
It is about 100km from my town to the plant, but...
you know?
the damage of nuclear is so terrible. All I have to do is to pray for their safety.
