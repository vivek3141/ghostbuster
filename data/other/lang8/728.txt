Today is Sunday, and I just did what should be done on Sunday, I rested, watched a movie, went to facebook.
There I found a link, yes, it was lang - 8, a very interesting place.
Now I have got a content, maybe I could make some friends here, what's more important is I can improve my English.
I want to learn Japanese after my graduation, for I love ACG very much.
And when I can speak Japanese I want to join a group that translates Japanese ACG to Chinese.
Then I should be very happy when I see others watch a cartoon translated by my co - workers and me.
Thank the ones who will help me to improve my English and Japanese in advance.
It will be grate if I make friends with English amd Japanese speakers. Good night ~
