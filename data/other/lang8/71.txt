Do you like singing songs? I like very much. Today, I went to a karaoke box with my son and naighbors. I sung so many songs and brewed my stress. My favorite karaoke songs are Seiko Matsuda's. Her songs are easy to sing, familiar with many people and rytmycal. I had a relaxed time. Today I might fall asleep soon. Good Night!
