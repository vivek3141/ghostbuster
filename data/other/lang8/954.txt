A question about writing an English e - mail
I sent an e - mail at 1 / 23 to a professor in Japan.
This professor has verbally agreed that I could visit his laboratory in this summer. In the mail, I told him that I am ready to discuss my research plan with him when he has time. However, I did not mention any detail of my plan. I guess it is probably the reason that I have gotten no response so far.
Therefore, I decide to write him another mail. I would like to put the contents of the former mail in the first part of this new mail, in case he did not receive or notice the former mail.
Could you teach me how to do it in a proper and polite way?
Thank you very much for your responses!!
