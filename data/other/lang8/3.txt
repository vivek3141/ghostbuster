A couple of weeks ago, I heard a new Whitney Houston's tune on my car radio. It sounded not bad.
I had been wondering what she was doing. And finally, she released a new song!
She came back!
Today, I read an article on the net about her comeback performance in New York's Central Park.
It said that was disappointing. Her voice was hoarse and cracked.
Oh, My God!
What a shock!
Her recent picture was not like her before.
Old and not beautiful..... What happened to her?
I know her tumultuous marriage with Bobby Brown and an arduous battle with drug addiction. Still she hasn't recovered from them? She had a incredible beautiful high voice.
She was decent, not like Mariah Carey.
However, she is already 46!
More disappointing thing to me is she said the reason of her bad voice was because she talked with Oprah Winfrey too much on her show. That might be one of the reasons, however, it sounds like just an excuse. I believe she can sing.
I hope she would come back to the scene as a diva again, even not like her heyday.
