I wrote about a test of the radiation contamination for foods before. The radiation specialized staffs have been performing this inspection. However, our staffs were asked for the help because of the shortage of the test member. Today the staff who was decided as a helper wanted the change of the date. The reason is because he wants to participate in the athletic meet of the child. Because we decided the date after having heard the staff's convenience, this is not almost possible. I was surprised that there was the staff who valued home event than the work.
