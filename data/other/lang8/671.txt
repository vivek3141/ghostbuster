After one year childcare leave, I finally returned to my work at the end of September. For now, my daughter and I are doing OK.
I used to work from 9 am to 8 pm.
But now I am working from 9 am to 4 pm for my one year old daughter. And she apparently likes her nursery.
She never cries when I drop her off at the nursery.
Since I started to work again, I can not write this lang - 8 journal so often. Still I want to continue. I 'm keeping this journal for my daughter to be interested in foreign languages in the future. Mother's journal written in foreign languages is interesting enough to motivate her daughter to learn to read them. Don't your think so?
