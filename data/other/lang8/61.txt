I think a birds of a feather flock together. The otehr day I met one of my classmate in high school at a station for the first time in fifteen years. She is a teacher as well.
I 'm English teacher. She is teacher for walking and posture. What a coincidence.
We had small talk (short talk?) there, and left. When I started to walk, I thought I want to talk with her more! So I shouted her name and stopped her. We exchange our contact info and decided to meet again very soon. We met two weeks ago, I felt strange, because we didn't meet each other for many years, but we have many things to tell each other. Plenty of things to talk, but not enough time. We shouldn't sort people into level, but I believe we are living in same level (same category, same world). That's why we could meet again!
