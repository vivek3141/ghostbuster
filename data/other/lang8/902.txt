I got up at 6 : 30 am at hotel in Yokohama. I stayed here for two days on a business trip.
The hotel name is Yokohama Prince Hotel, and the room I stayed was very good. I wish I could stay more! I attended some workshops and two classes.
The workshops and one of class were so boring but another class was so nice. The teacher was enthusiastic character so I concentrated to listen to her lecture very much. Her lecture was so interesting and I was so satisfied with it.
My friend who met last night after a long time brought me two paperbacks today. It might be difficult for me to read all of them, but I will try to read them.
The powerful typhoon has passed by, so the weather was good in Yokohama. I left there about 5 : 30 pm and came back Niigata about 8 : 30 pm. It rained here.
Though there were only two days trip, I felt a long business trip this time.
