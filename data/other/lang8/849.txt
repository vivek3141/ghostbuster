I'd like to challenge to take a TOEIC test. My friends is always taking a TOEIC test every time.
She said that she like to take a TOEIC test because she get a lot of energy from taking a TOEIC test. She has been studying English for 3 hour a day. That's great.
I can't study English for a long hour. Even if I have time to study English I will not study English. Lately I often watch videos from YouTube.
I 'm learning English from them.
