How time flies!
I will graduate from this college in two months. my major is English teaching, and I have got a job as an English teacher in a middle school.
Now the only task is to finish my thesis.
Is it real that I have to leave this college in two months?
Oh, how wanderful the college life is! I don't want to leave this school and to be a teacher.
Once you get into the society, your life won ' 't be simiple as that in college. I haven't been prepared to face all the things.
Because it is such big change in my lifetime.
Anyway, I will cherish the rest of my college life.
The four years ' college life will be a colourful and precious memory for me forever,
