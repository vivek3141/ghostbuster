I 'm a nerd.
So I know North Korea has been making nuke weapon!!! And I watched on TV that US jernalists were detained in North Korea. Why were they in North Korea?
They didn't know the situation there? jernalists are so crazy that go to dangrous places, even though there is possibility to die. I respect them, but I will never go to war place!!! By the way, If they launch the misile, which country will be the target?
Is it Korea or Japan? Or are they brave enough to attack US directly? Anyway no country is interested in Philippines, so.... What a peaceful world here!!!!! Wait!!
I heard there are some pirates in the Philippines, and they kidnap people and kill them. Maybe bandit too. It seems to me that I need a machine gun for protecting myself.
