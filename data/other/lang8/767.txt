I very often use twitter in a day. Usually I tweet about my thinking and news articles. For example, I read news and if I felt it was interesting, I tweet its title and link. In addition to that, I often add my comments.
Recently, I had become to read news on my iPhone usually. Typing on the iPhone was bothering for me because my typing speed was very low. So I didn't add my comments when I was read news via my iPhone. However, my typing speed was improved dramatically because of training using an enjoyable application. For this reason, now I can add my comments easily.
Tweets including comments must be interesting for followers. : )
