I practice for making stories with some words and phrases that I studied today. I made a story, today. > > >
Kim Yu - Na is one of the few Koreans who succeed at an early age in the world.
Her great success is based on her strong will.
The whole world is keenly interested in her walk of life.
Recently, she was appointed as the U.
S Sports Academy's 2010 Female Athlete of the year.
Congratulations on your winning!
