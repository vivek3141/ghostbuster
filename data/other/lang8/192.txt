Despite some analysts say that Japan has been at the bottom of the depression, I agree with the opinion that our country starts to show the sign of recovery from the damage caused by the earthquake.
There are two evidences for this : movements and discussions.
First, I can see some movements of peoples to recover from the damage now. For example, there is the movement to buy the commodities made in Fukushima.
When the earthquake had happened, the economic activity was depressed strongly. We thought that it was not good to have a satisfied days when people in the damaged area were suffered. Therefore, we stop buying commodities, especially luxuriant items.
As a result, the economy of Japan got stagnant.
Although that, we have already realized that the stagnant economy was more bad for the recovery of Tohoku area. We have to spur the economy to supply works and money in the area.
Because of this reason, the movement has happened.
Second, the discussions about the plans how we recover from the earthquake has been activated.
For instance, the usages of the area contaminated by the nuclear energy are now discussed on Japanese newspapers frequently. Some scientists advocate that that area should be used as the plants of the solar energy because the area is not good for living and there are a serious shortfall of electric energy.
Such discussions are able to be heard around Japan now.
All in all, Japan is trying to recover from the stunned situation now.
I hope Japan will recover from this situation and reply other countries for their helps in the future.
