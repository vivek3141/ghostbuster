I went back home from USA yesterday. I realized many differences between Japan the US during my 3 weeks stay in the East Coast. Firstly, there are few convenience stores in the US.
In Japan, I can find convenience stores when I get hungry, but I couldn't in the US.
Secondly, streets in the US are designed in grid style, and each streets have theirs own names. For instance, the names of the streets are numbers (like " E 32 Street ", " 5th avenue ") in New York. It is easy to read maps.
In Japan, I often lose my way because the streets are very complex and narrow and there are a lot of streets which have no name.
Visiting foreign countries enables us to see our countries from other viewpoints.
