We've had no longer lifetime employment system sice late 80's. Instead, I've watched powerful harassment like" you're incompintent!" or" we don't afford to pay dude like you." in order to enforce them early ritirement. After introducing the performance system to mimic the US, teamwork does not work and we think co - workers as enemies. We used to be happy and energetic even if we had hard time in a recession because we supported each other and believed we'd be happy someday.
We, however, exploit temporary staff and live in dog - eat - dog world. We bully weakers and weakers bully weakests. Luckly I have a job and depenadable payment. But, I sometimes feel helpless when my colleague left the office.
