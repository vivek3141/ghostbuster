The life is full of temptations, especially in which someone study abroad. I often would give way to various temptations such as drinking too much, talking with Japanese, club, boys, shopping, and others.
Before I fall into this situation, I always ask myself why I came to Australia.
I don't have enough time, so I have to study English hard.
