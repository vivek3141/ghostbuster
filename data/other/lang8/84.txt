I have been looking for correct my English diary.
Today, I finally found nice site.
I was suprised when I found it. I have been study English for 2years. Because I want to make a lot of friends all over the world. Yesterday, Kitajima Kousuke who is a breast stroke swimmer, he got the gold medal. I was excited, He marked new world record. He got it the second time.
He moved to tears when he won.
He is smaller than other people. But he did it. I impressed very much.
