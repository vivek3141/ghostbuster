It has a long time I didn't write an entry and now I 'm here again. I been stopping learning Korean for a number of weeks already. These days I just realized that I should learn my ENGLISH! I 'm figuring out what's wrong with my English. I feel frustrated.
For the past few weeks, I been playing a website called Omegle. It's a website who is random let you talk to strangers. I have fun on it though.
It lets me know my English level. I can not understand English Native Speakers. I think that's a lot of slang inside their conversations. Do you think I talk to them will improve my English skills??
