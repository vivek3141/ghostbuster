I tried to rent a house these days and had an interesting discovery.
In the place that I want to rent house, the average price you buy a house is about 350000 ($ 5484. 5) yuan per square meter and the average price you cost to rent 60 square meter house is about 5000 yuan per month. Consider you are the house owner, the house will cost you 2100000 yuan. If you let the house, you can get 60000 yuan one year. That is to say, you money only grow in a rate of 2. 86 %, while the current one - year deposit rate is 3. 5 %. With the fact that the house price have stopped from rising, why not the house owner sell the house and deposit the money to bank or doing other investment? Is the housing price in Beijing is too more high? Or is the rent price is too low?
I would like to the housing price and rent place in your place, could you tell me? P.
S : I 'm practicing my English also, so I would appreciate your corrections. : )
