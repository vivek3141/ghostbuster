Two weeks ago I bought a new portable DVD player that is region free at an online - shop. Although I like it, I realized that some DVDs do not work. It is shocking to me.
I have lots of American DVDs whose region cord is 1 in my house. However, I can not watch some of them with the player.
After I looked for why I can not watch some of them, I discovered there are some DVDs that is difficult to recognize the region cord with a region free DVD player. That is why some my DVDs can not work with my DVD player. So, I am thinking when I go to America next time, I am planning to buy a portable region cord 1's DVD player. I think if I bought it, since all my DVDs are region cord 1, I could watch all of them. Although I have to stand this situation before I will go to America, I think it is a good idea. I hope I will be able to buy a good one with a good price.
