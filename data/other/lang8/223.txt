Today, I went to school. Our teacher was angry because recently many people bring on many chocolates, a cellular phone and all that. But I never bring on them. So I am shut of. But my teacher said" If you find person with many chocolates, a cellular phone and all that, you must warning to the person. If you turn a blind eye to, you are tantamount of the person." But I was unconvinced. Because I think that those people do not listen warning.
