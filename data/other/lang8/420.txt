Today, I had five classes whose subjects are The Japanese Constitution, Postcolonial literature, Ethics, English literature and Educational system.
The hours of one class are ninty munites, so I got exhausted. We don't pay tuition per one class but stated cost in each university unlike universities in other countries. I take as many classes as possible, because I have a voracious appitate for studying! But, sometimes my fatigue beats my motivation > < Since I have been pressed for time because of heaps of assignments, I have slept 5 hours on average recently. I really need time off...
In Japan, some students often sleep during a class at an university. I, however, have heard that university students in, for example, America never sleep while taking a class.
Is that right?
Have a nice day!
