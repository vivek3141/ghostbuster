Sometimes a good animation doesn't need any words.
In my opinion, a good animation has three element : 1.
nicer script : Frist, you must grab people's focus, what you want to say and the content whether make fans keep on it. 2.
Suitable background music : This is important, and I think A good music is spirit of movie. That can make people more easier put themself into the drama. 3.
Creative angle : Whatever what kinds of drama, which position we watch, it depends on director's plan.
Of couse, actor's design and its action are important.. hahaa like this octopus.. it let me feel very cute even though without any lines. by the way... how many feet does octopus have? hahaaa
