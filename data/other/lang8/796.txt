There has bean a earthquake in Japan. It is very sad thing.
When A earthquake was occurred, I was very anxious about my wife and daughter. So I had called my wife as soon as possible.
But It was connected with her. I feared for her and daughter safety. After I was allowed from the company to leave, I leaved office at 5 o ' clock for the place of her a little early. I went to the Sinagawa Station from Shibuya. I thought It had taken about 5 hours time. But we didn't meet at there, because it wasn't work communication network system. After It was passed a little time, We could talk each other by smart phone. My wife said she was walking to the child - care institutions.
(my wife is Japanese, I 'm Korean) I only had to walk for the same place. I reached home at AM 5 o ' clock. So I walked for 10 hours all of time. I was happy to my family safety. But I am very anxious about the accident of nuclear power plant. It is fear of radioactivity.
