I went to a photo shop to develop my pictures while my break time today, and I remembered that I had to buy some desiccants to protect my cameras and lenses and I took two packs of the desiccant to the counter to buy.
A clerk said to me" That'll be 1040 yen."
I took money from my pocket but it was 930 yen, so I was going to pay 110 yen from a my point card of this camera shop but it was lack of 10 yen, so I had to give up on buying one pack but I really wanted to buy one more. I really needed 10 yen to buy the two packs.
A idea came to my mind, so I went to a drink vending machine outside and looked at below the vending machine.
There was a 100 yen coin under the vending machine miraculously, so I could buy two packs of desiccant!
All workers were surprised that I found 100 yen. What a lucky person I was!
