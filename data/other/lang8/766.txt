I am finding the way to enlarge my learning process. For me, Physics is consisted of complex concept and a lot of information. To learn it well, I must memorize it with realization. But I can't achieve that, as I am not good at memory. I konw that I will lose my way if the situation continue. I hope I can overcome the problem...
Before that, I should find the solution first. As we know, success will not come in a sudden. I can't pay for the success without my effort. Because there are meaningful that we have spare effort to strike our goals. Umm...
Also, I must improve my english.
Now, I understand that it is interesting, so I can learn it easier than the past. -
In fact, the word I write is to encourge myself for learning. I don't want to give up my study. I have goals as everyone. I am looking for the future.
: )
And you?
