After great earthquake happened, I often feel shaking though it's not earthquake.
I thought earthquake is coming when I wash my face in the morning. I 'm so nervous at earthquake. I made an emergency bag in case. And I have to fix my furnitures to stop slipping. Preparing in case is very important.
I learned it.
