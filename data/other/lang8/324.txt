Yesterday I went to Tsutaya (it is the biggest rental DVD and CD shop in Japan. However, we can buy new DVDs and CDs there.) with my family because my husband wanted to borrow some DVDs from the shop. And then, I discovered many imported CDs are selling for 80 percent off. I bought three imported CDs.
I 'm very happy because I could bought each CD for only 300 yen!!! It's very cheap!!! Today is the last days of golden week. During golden week, I couldn't learn English anymore. Therefore, from tomorrow, I would love to learn English again.
