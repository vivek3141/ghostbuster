These days I suffered many unhappy things. Maybe those matters were not so bad as the facts, but I really could 't handle them while they occured together.... English is one of my biggest problems.
I don't know how to master this language well... Though I spend most of my time and energy in learning English, it seems that I hardly make any improvement has become a truth... I don't know why I have to learn English so hard..!!! Today,..
I went to take the business English correspondence class as usual.. but this time...
our teacher said a sentence to me, which made me heart broken.. I had never knew my English was poor until the teacher told me that my English was sound illogically.... I didn't know how I felt at that moment..
but I did know my eyes were wet..
and the tears nearly fell from my face..
