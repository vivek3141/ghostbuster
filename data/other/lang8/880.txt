A couple of days ago, I watched Twilight (the first movie) in English.
I had attempted to listen to the book in the past, but I just didn't like it.
That's why I was surprised when I realized that the movie * is * worth watching.
It's easy enough to understand, and it's quite entertaining to watch. The movie is suitable for a young audience (10 - year - old kids and up) so you can even watch it with your little sister (in a foreign language, of course!)
I don't really like the second one, though.
New Moon is kind of boring.
