I like beyonce.
You knows she is a great singer. Now my favorit song of hers is" If I were a boy" In the song she says" If I were a boy I would treat my girl respectfully."
But real boys don't think deeply about their girl's feeling. I partly agree it. Boys should think more and girls should effort to understand. What do you think?
