I transcribed three songs which are" Metalingus" by Alter Bridge," Stay with You" by Goo Goo Dolls and" Top Gun Anthem" by Steve Stevens.
I don't have good ears, so I had to listen to CD again and again in order to copy phrases and write it into music sheets. It took long time to finish one song. Due to listening to the same songs over 100 times repeatedly, I memorized them perfectly.
Now, I don't need music sheet any more. To enjoy my hobby more effectively, working preliminarily is required. I look forward to playing them with my band tomorrow.
