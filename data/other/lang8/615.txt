Tomorrow, I finally take the TOEIC test.
I 'm not confident about getting a high score very much, but I'll try my best. One of my friends on skype told me that all you have to do is concetrate on the exam and relax. Certainly, To relax is necessary to get a high score. Since I've written some journals about TOEIC, you might have guessed that I risk my life for it, but it's not true. LOL
I only want to confirm my English ability.
Well, studying bussiess English is bloody boring. I don't think very much that bussiness English must be needed to communicate with foreign people. Anyway, I have the test tomorrow.
I'll strive to study as possible as I can.
Thanks for reading!
If you have time, please correct my poor sentences. ; )
