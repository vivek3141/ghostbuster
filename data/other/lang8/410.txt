So long time I didn't write here anything.
For first, I found a job. I think that it's a good job for a girl who haven't higher educational.
For one year I'll be working there.
At least I hope.
This is a job in one not big shop of bathroom equipments, ceramics, baths, washbasins etc.. For all day I and my two affiliates have been carrying the products, doing price labels and studying the bathroom equipments.
To say a true, now I see dreams about all of it every day!
Today I saw a bath when I was sleeping.
And my affiliate, her name is Galya, she saw a robbery of our shop.
Spending time there is so nice.
I really like it.
Tomorrow I have an off day.
I 'm planning to spend this day in the center of our city.
This is a nice place with a beauty architecture and different shops where you can find some interesting things.
But for real, I love my native place a little bit more than a center of a city.
I live in a small sceince center with a big number of institutes. I'll tell about it later because it's a long theme.
About my job again..
some time I will be working six day in a week but later this will be just five days and two off days. I'll can choose my off days by myself.
I can choose any days what I want.
So.. now I want to sleep.
Now I haven't so many time like I had.
Ok.
Good night.
I feel not good now, but I really glad that I have a job. By the way, my affiliates are so nice people. It's a girl and a boy who a little bit older than me. I hope that we will be good friends besides affiliates.
Hm..
that's a rythme!
But not right sentence I suppose.
My English is terrible, so enought. I'll go to sleep.
