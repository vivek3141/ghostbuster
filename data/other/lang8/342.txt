I decided to take the next TOEIC test.
The date is Nov. 29.
We have approximately a month to the test and I take this test for a long interval.
I hope to get a better score than the previous. I am going to buy some study books for it.
If you have any recommendations for study, please tell me.
For daily English study, I use" English Grammar in Use."
