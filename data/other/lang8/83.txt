Without fail where there's great need, great hearts and minds rise up to meet the challenge. Two mouth later, my professor will take some students to Ohio university in America for a month. But who wants to go there, he must pass the exam and the interview. Going abroad is my dream, so I really cherich this opportunity. It is a good chance to strengthen my knowledge, boarden my horizon, and enjoy the foreign customs, and also realize my dream. Without any means, what I can do now is to improve my poor English, speaking more, listening more and reading more and so on. In my opinion, it is a difficult process to overcome myself, but I must insist on and keep on making it, whatever how difficult it is. Once you make up your mind, so persevere in doing it. Yangyang, come on, you can do it.
Yes, you can.
Er... but how to start?
