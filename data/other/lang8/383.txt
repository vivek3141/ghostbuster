I ran last night for practicing the marathon race. But the distance is only 5km - too short to say the" marathon race". Anyway I practiced with my co - worker.
He also applied for the race.
Yesterday was so cold and windy so that it was too hard for us to run. But we ran about 1 hour with talking each other. Now I have a mascular pain...
Training body is important.
