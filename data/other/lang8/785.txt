To be positive is much more important thing than I've thought. Today I read a book.
It said that it would be bad to think" it's gon na be ok" when you are afraid about something.
That's because it would make you more afraid.
When people are really fine, they never think the same thing.
The book also said that you must not say or even think" I don't - - -." That means that you must not focus on negative side of any stuffs. For example, when you are afraid about something, don't think" I don't have to be afraid." but instead you can think" Relax! ' or" Enjoy." Actually I can't agree with this easily, but the point is the same thing Robert told me before. If there is water half of a cup, how do you think?" I still have half." or" I have only half."?
To be able to answer former one makes us different. Now I got what he said somehow.
