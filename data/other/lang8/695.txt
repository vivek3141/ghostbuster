As I wrote in my journal entry yesterday, my 6 years old son was able to get on a train by himself.
I think he had a lot of anxiety on his way to the destination, but he managed to reach it.
My wife and I called him" The Great Adventurer" and praised his courage very much. We think that it will be a good experience for him and will be very helpful for overcoming the difficulties in the future.
After his great adventure, he seemed very confident in himself.
On the other hand, his feelings seemed unstable.
I think a lot of anxiety affected him very much and he did not know how to cope with it. As he stayed up late last night, I told him to go to bed. Then he suddenly cried out with a lot of tears.
I think there was no particular reason. I thought he should release his accumulated anxiety at that time.
So I held him softly and let him cry until he was satisfied.
Anyway, it was a very nice day for us. I am looking forward to seeing how he will grow up from now on.
