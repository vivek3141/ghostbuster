The flowers keep flowering and rising up towards the Sun. Friend is holding a knife or a gun. All around you doesn't mean a thing. But birds sing.
Things which were going down below the darkness abyss.
I hope each matter will face the peace.

Man!
I got the melancholic time which gives me a reflect of life that has already passed me by. It hit me and it even made me making rhymes. I 'm young enough to change a lot...
But sometimes I think that good life isn't booked for each one who wants it. Above all I 'm wondering about the aim of our subsistence.
I wish that God held your hand in the time full of doubts.. The moment that lasts can be the best moment of all you had. You still have new friends, the old ones are covered by a dust. Don't you forget it... as I did.
