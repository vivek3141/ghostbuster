Is it correct?
My goal is becoming a veterinarian.
And I consider Basic Studies in Natural Sciences as a strong, varied science base and an international experience for admission to a vet school.
Besides that I have intention to learn Danish, which will be sixth language I know. Interdisciplinarity, practical studies, wide choice of courses, experimental spirit and open - mindedness are causes why I am so enthusiastic about RU.
