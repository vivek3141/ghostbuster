I don't have a class every Friday, but I have workshops instead. I signed up for an Essential Idioms workshop yesterday, but it was canceled today because nobody signed up for it except for me.
Therefore, I did homework at school.
These days, I watch PRISON BREAK, which is my favorite foreign drama, almost every day.
Since I watch it with English subtitle, it's not so complicated to understand the story. I have a Saudi Arabian friend who can speak Japanese fluently.
He told me he had studied Japanese by watching Japanese cartoons.
I also have a Korean friend, who likes Japanese comedy and music, and he can speak Japanese well. I want to improve my speaking and listening skill, so I have a question. Do you think watching movies or dramas is a good way to study langueages? If you have a good way, please let me know it.
