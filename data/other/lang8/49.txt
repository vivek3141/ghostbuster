Hello everyone,
I 'm Makitys.
This is my nickname. I was born and grew up in Tokyo.
I studied applied physics and electronics at a university in Tokyo. I took a bachelor's degree of these subjects at the university. After graduated from the university, I got a job as an engineer.
I changed jobs a few times but the same type of job as an engineer. I still work for an electronics maker in Japan as an engineer. I 'm a single woman and live by myself.
My parents and a brother and a sister live in Tokyo. I moved to Fukuoka from Yokohama for business this January.
Fukuoka is located the northern part of Kyushu. Kyushe is a part of the Japanese Archipelago. (see the map I've attached)
Fukuoka city is the biggest city in Kyushu.
Comparing with Tokyo, Fukuoka is compact but it is a very comfortable city. Commodity prices here are lower than those in Tokyo and Fukuoka Airport is very near central Fukuoka. You know, Narita Airport is far from central Tokyo. It takes one hour from the airport to central Tokyo even if you take an expensive superexpress.
Moreover Tokyo is a very crowded city. One thing I unsatisfy to live here is that I 'm separated from my family. It takes much money to go see my parents from here. I miss my family and relatives who live in Tokyo.
If you come to Fukuoka, please let me know!
