I went to the Koshien stadium to watch a baseball game, last Friday. Hanshin Tigers versus Yokohama Baystars was held. We rode a bus and a train to there, and the train was crowded by the people who went to the Koshien stadium. I watched the game at a highest seat behind the backstop, and looked very well.
The game was a seesaw game, and excited very much.
There were base runners every innings, and hitted home runs. We enjoyed very much, and came home at late night, then youngest son was already sleep. I want to go again.
