I think that Manga is the great entertainment culture from Japan. My favorite writers are Naoki Urasawa (The Monster, 20st century boy and more) and Hiroya Oku (Gantz). By the way, I found some web sites that there are huge amount of Mangas that translated in English. (I think no doubt about illegal.) It's a new experience and very educational of English. But, I think that there are a lot of difficult expressions in Mangas in English.
