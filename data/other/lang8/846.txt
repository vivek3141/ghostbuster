Both the reading passage and the lecturer in the listening part refer to a question that dinosaurs are warm - blooded reptiles or not. The reading passage argues that dinosaurs are like today's mammals and birds are warm - blooded animals, but the lecturer holds an opposite point of view and maintains this theory is not very persuasive. First of all, the lecturer indicates that how to identify the four - chambered - heart fossil, a conclusive evidence can prove dinosaurs are warm - blooded, is the remains of dinosaurs or other mammals is a main problem.
He refutes what is cited in the reading passage that the fossil in South Dakota in 1993 is the evidence that can support that theory. As far as he knows, all of the fossil records, dinosaurs and mammals usually mix together in the sea bed.
The lecturer's second point is that dinosaurs do not have to adapt unstable climate as how snakes and lizards do today. Contrary to what is mentioned in the reading passage that only warm - blooded animals can survive from the fickle temperature at that time, he opines that the weather at that time is relatively moderate than today's, meaning that there is no extremely shift between high and low in temperature. Besides, the fast - changing weather temperature was never been recorded. Last but not the least, the lecturer contends that big body size do not necessarily mean that having a warmed - blood system. He agrees with the opinion of the reading passage that giant body needs a constant body temperature ; however, he believes dinosaurs like big sea turtles have a low ration of surface to volume, which can reduce heat - losing, and that is able to keep them in a stable body temperature.
