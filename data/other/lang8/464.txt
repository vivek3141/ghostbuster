I work at a supply center.
One of our duties is issuing rooms.
Before we issue a room to a resident, we need to check a room if it is clean.
So my coworker and I went to barraks for checking two of the rooms. But these are the most aweful rooms ever.
Cleaning all of the rooms took 4 hours.
I saw what I should have not seen.
Horrible. Filthy rooms are clean now.
