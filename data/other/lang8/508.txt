Sometimes when I take a walk with my dog a sidewalk, I feel danger because of bicycles. Actually the sidewalk allows bicycles to pass, but I think that they have to keep safety manners for passers or if they don't want to reduce their speed, they must pass through roadways.
In Japan, we have the rule that defines bicycles as a kind of car that has risk. But some people who ride bicycles don't know or understand it's risk. They don't care safety manners and reduce their speed.
I sometimes watched on TV that in Paris there are roads for bicycles. It gives safety to people.
I hope that my city also prepare bicycle's roads for safety.
