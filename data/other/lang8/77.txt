I went to Okinawa last month with my son and my boyfriend.
Okinawa is southern part of Japan so it was hot there. We enjoyed snorkel! We went to the beach which is at an desert island near Naha. I felt like in dream because the sea was so beautiful and a lot of fish. And We went to Okinawa Prefectural Peace Memorial Museum. I think that we shoud never happen the war. We should never kill another people.
