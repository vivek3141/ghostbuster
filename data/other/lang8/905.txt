Hello.
I live in Sendai.
I had experienced the gigantic erthquake in north - east Japan. I was working in my office in Sendai.
The all of the things on the desk fell down on the floor. I walked back to my house about 50 munutes. On the way home I saw the peole filled in the streat walking. I am happy all my family are safe.
