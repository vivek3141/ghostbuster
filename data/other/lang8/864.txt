I have left this site so long time...
So I was surprized at changing this site!! I 'm enjoying my summer horiday, but I have a lot things to do. First, I must do my homework. We have a task to write" considering of a book". I 'm really not good at writing this since I was a erementary school student!
I like reading books, but I hate this homework! I don't know what to write... Tomorrow, my childhood friends comes to my home. We are to go karaoke. We may play the game.
So, I will not be able to do my homework tomorrow. I'll study by now...
