This is my first time to write diary on the internet. I hope someone see my diary and correct it. I watched DVD" Grey's anatomy" today. Actually I keep watching it these days. I 'm so into it.
I watched season 2 today.
So there are a lot to see. I don't know medical word in English very much. So I have to check dictionary all the time.
But I can study English through this. And I think it's fun, right? Thank you for reading this.
