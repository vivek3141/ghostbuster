[ I 'm so sorry...
I couldn't send you mail sooner. You know, The earthquake was too bad for my family. The tsunami destroyed my mother's country (home?).
But, My gran ' ma is safe. And my cousins are fine also. : )
I wanted to see them.
However it was too terrible to live.
(There was a power failure until now.)
I pray for them it make a comeback to normal life! ]
