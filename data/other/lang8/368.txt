I have to study English now because I have to get a good score on the TOEFL, so please correct my sentences very hard!
: )
These days, I want to go on a trip pretty much.
I have never been abroad.
I played basketball in junior high school and volleyball in high school.
When I played that, I continued it everyday on summer vacation and winter vacation with not so much as rest.
Although I really loved that, as a matter of fact, I want to go on a trip. I said again and again to my mother that I would like to go somewhere and give me some money to do it. She did not give it ; I do not have passport now. Japan is a small country, however, I could not visit many places.
If I finish my needs, I want to go around Japan first.
Hmm, instead, do I want to go abroad, especially America?
I am still thinking now.
Do you have any place to recommend for me? (anywhere OK) Please tell me : )
