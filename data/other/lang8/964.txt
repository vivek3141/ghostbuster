Here are my 2011 resolutions for my lifestyle.
1 ) Study harder about bookkeeping.
I think I want to take more challenges at accounting.
I will take some test about bookkeeping this year.
2 ) Write journal entries every single day.
Aim to take English test something. This is difficult to do, though.. hehe.
3 ) Read two books per week.
I need to learn many things more, about Japanese culture, history, and so on... Anyway just only my hobbies ^ ^ What's your goals by 2011?
