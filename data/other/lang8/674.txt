It is July 2nd today - - that means a half part of this year has passed. How time flies!
This half year was quite busy one for me. My husband got a job in the US and we had to work hard to get visas.
After moving into CA and getting used to the life, I found myself have got pregnant. What a happy thing it is!
I 'm planning to deliver the baby here.
There are some worries but I 'm also excited.
What will it be like the latter half of 2010? I hope it would be a good one and I'd like to meet my baby born just healthy.
