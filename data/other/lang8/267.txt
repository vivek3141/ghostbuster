I had school for five days until today, and it finished, so I can enjoy chatting with friends I met on this web site.
Even if I had school the next day I chatted, but I was a little sleepy at school the next day, so I decided to sleep longer.
Six days ago, I took a long nap for about five hours and sat up late.
When I was enjoying chatting at about 3 - ish, I considered if I should go to bed, but I thought if I went to bed once I wouldn't be able to wake up at 6 and continued chatting till I went to school. I was a bit sleepy at school, so I decided not to do the same things again. From today, I 'm free and can enjoy chatting at night!
