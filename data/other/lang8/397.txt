I don't know who developed this fantastic website.
It is such a great idea to exchange the resources and help each other with their language study.
Now I can give my opinion and receive advices from others instead of just letting my friends help me. On my first day I wrote 11 entries.
What a job! What more exciting was I received 9 corrects. My thanks goes to minicat who devoted lots of time and attentions to my long articles, reviewed them one by one and corrected almost all of them for me!
My appreciate also goes to kw0kster, David, Chard, Lu, Kevin, Ari, headlessmunkie.
I also corrected a couple of entries, however, the states of my profile just showed 1 corrections made. After the interview, I would help more to give back. Let us make the world better together!
