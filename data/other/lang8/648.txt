I baked a cake unless using eggs and butter last week. I love sweets!!!
I really really like them. But almost sweets are very high calorie. I easily gain weight.
I don't want to get fat.
But...
I want to eat them... lol
So I thought out how to bake a cake without much oil, eggs and the other high calories stuff. Ofcourse it should be yummy! I found the recipe last week.
It was easy to bake.
It was light taste and yummy. My mother told me she loved it too. I was glad to hear that.
This recipe have became my regular menu!
