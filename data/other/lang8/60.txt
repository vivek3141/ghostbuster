Tonight I read and corrected many diaries.
I might be make a mistake when corrected English.
But I think it's good way to learn from my mistake.
Thai
I tried to correct Thai language for who wrote in Thai.
It's also fun to read Thai writting from a non native speaker.
English
I started to practice my English since I've started my journey aboard.
And realized how language could help you know more people. Reading English language make me feel very happy. Then when I went to Japan.
My English could not help me
anymore.
I am impressed my life at there very much. I only told them in English language. It would be good if I could speak.
Japanese.
I could not writting Japanese or understand.
Japanese culture is interesting but Japanese people is quiet,
It's difficult to know what are in their mind.
So I started to reading japanese book which translate to Thai language.
I don't want to take Japanese class.
It's might be boring. So decide to learn by nature... viewing Japanese anime
and remember Kanji which I like ^ _ ^.
I learn a lot from Japanese food...
Japanese food is available every corner in Thailand.
