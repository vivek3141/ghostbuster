I'll think of a bit about if I was woman. The reason I'll think of it is just enjoyable for me. That is the only reason.
If I was woman, the figure would be more lovely than sexy. She would have long hair hanging down the chest, and the hair color must be black. The personality would be rather calm than tomboyish. Maybe she wouldn't be so active, so she wouldn't belong to any club. She wouldn't be doing so poorly at school, but she would hate studying. Her type would be a man who is a little brawny and has a tender heart.
