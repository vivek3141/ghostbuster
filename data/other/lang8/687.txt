I am going to try to explain English grammar in English to learn English.
( English, English, and English.
Please help to fix up the above sentence. )
Today's topic is future.
The following sentences are examples.
(Q) Where are you going to go next holiday? (A1) I will go to Kyoto next holiday with my wife. (A2) I 'm going to go to Kyoto next holiday with my wife. (A3) I 'm going to Kyoto next holiday with my wife. (A1) means that you've just decided where to go.
(A2) means that you've decided where to go since some time ago. (A3) means that you've decided where to go since some time ago, and you have a trip detail. (A3) is easy and simple than (A2), so sometimes we use (A3) instead of (A2). Does it make sense? Please comment.
FYI :
It is Golden Week holiday periods in Japan now. We have holidays up to 16 days. ^ ^
