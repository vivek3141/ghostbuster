In this day and age, economic growth often comes with the improvement of technology.
Thus, it's hard to say our prosperities in developed countries are compatible with environmental protection.
However, apparently, this is cahnging.
A lot of companies began to come up with the ways technology and a lot of commodities can go with environment.
In some cases, there could be" greenwash".
However, raised awareness is getting rid of this trend as consumers are more eager to purchase authentic eco - friendly commodities.
Even though I say it myself, I 'm using some soaps that don't contain chemical substances. I heard that some detergents can be harmfull when they are drained to the river or ocean, rendering local people unable to avoid some danger from the pollution. From the look of it, eco - concious might be the watchword from years to come.
