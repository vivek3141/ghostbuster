There are two types of foreigners who were in Japan before earthquake happened. Some foreigners in Japan went back home country. However, It is founded that Tokyo may be safe area this week, so they try to come back Japan. I hear that when they come back Japan, they have problem. Other workers who did not leave in their company were continuing to work and they may be angry. In fact, they imposed their work to other worker, but I think safe is the most important and they should be welcomed to their company.
