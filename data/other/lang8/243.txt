I have decided to start a writing for Teacher's exam in the winter of next year.
I've heard that The United States introduced a system that rating teacher ' s ability.
what the most interesting I thought is that this system assesses teachers with students score. I don't think students score could be the standard for estabilishment. When we set a standard to appraise something, we should avoid being open to dispute.
We do need absolute criterion.
In my opinion teachers must be assessed by their teaching ability itself.
For example, varities of teaching methods and materials should be involved in criterion for estimation.
