On next Wednesday, the economics seminor softball match will take place. I have hardly played neither baseball nor softball, so I practiced today after school.
I had played for 7 years, so I like almost all sports.
However, the experience of volleyball is not always working well for softball because of a form difference. Anyway, I 'm really looking forward to playing the game!!
