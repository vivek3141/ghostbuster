( I 'm keeping a diary to improve English writing skills.
It would be my great honor for you to correct my mistakes..
Have a nice day ~ ~ ~ )
I have two sons.
Older brother is 4 years old, and younger 2. When my wife was pregnant," just like all the other husband and father" I thougt everything is going to be beautiful just like on TV." We'll come together around dinner table, talk to each other looking at baby's lovely eyes.." I thought.
But, after 2 sons, What I imagined proved such an illusion. Far from talking and eating around dinner table with my lovely family gracefully, I can hardly eat my meals to survive. I bet anybody who has child (especially more than 2) can understand exactly what I am saying now. Reality is wholly diffrent from imagination. Even so, I can not help saying that I love my sons.
Seeing me and wife playing loudly (maybe my first child seemed to have thought we were quarreling), he said to me that" Daddy! don't do that.
She is the only woman you have to love in the world.
I don't want you to hurt mommy." T. T He made my eyes water. We have to learn children's thoughtful consideration for others and frankness about it, because we know cosideration and frankness always work. Have a good day ^ ^
