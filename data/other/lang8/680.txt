I guess that many of Japanese members of lang8 will write same topic tomorrow. Because tomorrow is Tanabata as a Japanese traditional day. Tanabata came from a fairy tail.
Long lon ago, there was a couple of lovers. However, the lovers couldn't see. They could see only a chance a year. The annual day is July 7.
Due to the story, it is believed that our each wish will be true if we pray one wish on the day. Now, the fairy tail is concerned with actual stars.
But, July 7 is the end of Japanese rainy season.
So it's usually rainy or cloudy.
I 'm older, I can not remember some fairy tails better. it was very hard to write this entry.
