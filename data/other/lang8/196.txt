I feel happy when Friday night comes.
The reason is very simple : I don't have to worry whether I can awake in the morning the next day.
These days, this is becoming the happiest moment for me.
^ ^ It seems nothing, but very real happiness to me. Thanks to my current boss, I 'm enjoying my work although I have tons of it.
He's really good at asking someone to do work.
I want to get his techniques someday.
At the same time, I want to get how to say no gently because I want to have much happier moment than sleeping in the morning! ^ ^
