Today, I went to a coffee shop with my girlfriend.
I 'm very pleased with the shop.
That shop always put a flower in a big vase. I 'm looking forward to seeing it.
Today's flower was" fox face". I have never seen that plant.
It looked like" fox face" really.
My friend is a teather of junior college. Recently, your student asked her." Why we need study?"
Do you think that? Her said.
I thought a little, and I answerd. For expand the capability of them.
She smiled in agreement, and sipped the hot coffee. I watched the sunset through the window.
It was a beatiful evening.
