In my country, we do not need to vow when we get married. Brides and grooms simply go to city offices and turn into the marrige application form, which has the brides ', the grooms ', and two wittnesses ' sigunitures. No picture IDs are requiered to turn into the marrige applicatin form. Even the law does not require the couple to come to the city office. Somebody else can go there insterd of the couple. Becouse of the system, sometimes problems are arisen. When a couple go to the city office to turen in their marrage form, they sometimes find out that one of them (or both of them) is alredy married to someone else.
