I 'm surprised that I suddenly accepted messages on a Japanese SNS from my junior high school friends who I had not seen for more than twenty years. He sent me an email. He showed me my friend's account on the Japanese SNS.
I sent an email to them. No one did not remember me clearly. I belonged to the track & field club in my junior high school age.
There will be an alumni association of the track & field club in the next summer.
