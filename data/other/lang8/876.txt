Nice to meet you.
I 'm Galle.
My name" Galle" is named from a beauty salon I go to. I am a student at Japanese university. I want to go abroad because I love English.
But my English is bad especially about speaking, so I can have no word whenever I try to speak in English! So, I want to study ' English of the moment ' in this website. I'll write diaries as possible as I can. Please check my mistakes! Thank you for reading.
