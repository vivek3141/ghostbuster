It's been a while since I wrote diary on lang - 8. Well, I 'm into the Ray Charles's" Hit the Road Jack" song recentry. This youtube video is so good at symphony of music and image. Cool!
By the way, What can I say when things is so good? I imagine only" cool" or" awesome" or" dope". Plese tell me if there is anything else often - used words that means so good.
