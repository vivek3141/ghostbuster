As if the big blue moon speaks me... The moonlight bustled my mind.
Maybe I should challenge difficulties.
I always chose stable way... I always be afraid failure... I always run away from problems...
I always avoid true my feelings... And probably I distress myself about my attitude. I am pondering if this is acceptable.
The moonlight ask me to make life for yourself. I wonder how many times should I see the moon to make a step toward... I will think about it under a full moon.
This is tonight...
