Recently I have studied English.
Firstly, I started studying vocabulary. secondly I have studying Grammar....
I study like this. Today, I have the chance to speak English. But I couldn ` t speak well.
I think it is better to learn conversation and know our cultures than study vocabulary. So I want to watch movies but it ` s too expenive for me... Do you have any idea?
If you have, please teach me!
