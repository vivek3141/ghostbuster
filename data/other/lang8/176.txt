Today, I become a member of lang - 8.
I really need help.
My gramma is very poor, and my poor gramma always drives my SAT gramma teacher crazy. And I will take the SAT2 on May 7th.
This is a little bite hard for me because I have to deal with the tasks in school those which surrounds the college entrance exam in China too.
So I want to find some friends on this web site to offer me some help.
