I 'm living at farm which is Sussex at New Brunswick. There are 5 cats, 5 horses, 4 cows, 3 dogs, 3 pigs, probably 20 laying hens and vegetable garden! The farm is on a hill.
The location is so nice.
It's very calm and clear air. There are many stars in the sky at midnight. I didn't know that we can see it all directly even though except a telescope. Also I was noticed my city is bright. We've forgotten there are many stars in the sky. If they noticed it, they turn off lights more than before notice. I knew, I like nature and animal but I'd not known, I like a farm life so much. I was living at Tokyo in Japan before I've come Canada since 30th, May, 2011. I could feel it strongly.
Tokyo is busy and always crowded that why. I hope I could live in a rural place.
