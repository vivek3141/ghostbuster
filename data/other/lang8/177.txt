My sister asked me to translate some documents into
Korean since Korean often come to my sister's work place. Luckyily, I have some Korean friends so I worked on it asking my frineds weather the translation is correct or not. I was really really sensitive at work because this is a national related documents, which means I was not allowed to make
mistakes!!
I 'm sure there were some mistakes.
It's impossible to grip the nuance perfectly since I 'm Japanese.!
Oh..
this is just the execuse. (laughing laughing)
Anyway I did my best more than I could and finished. I feel so comfortable now!!!!!
Year!!!
