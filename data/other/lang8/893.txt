I always feel sleepy when I have some works to do. (homeworks or cleaning my room, etc. .) Also I can sleep in a few minutes when I try to read a book, kkkkk : ) After the english class which in I could not even understand what the professor said, I had prepared for the class reading a book and thinking about what I'd say. We discussed about some cases of regional economic intergration, but I still couldn't say a word.
Just waiting for Chuseok, Korean thanks giving day. I'll go my hometown and see my mom.
I miss my family.
Here is not comfortable to me, too small and too noisy. But I 'm also really enjoying this life to read some journals and to talk to you guys! All good people here.
