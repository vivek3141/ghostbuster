I waked up 4 : 00 a. m. to go to the sea to surf this morning, but the waves were too small to surf. I intended to surf before job, but I can not. I didn't have time to go back to my home, so I slept in the car.
Because I slept in the car, I could not sleep well.
That is why, I am sleepy now.
After the job, I intended to surf again, but it is wndy. So I did not go to the sea.
Thease days, I did not surf. If I go to work 4 days, there is 9 - day weekend. I can not wait it. Good night!
