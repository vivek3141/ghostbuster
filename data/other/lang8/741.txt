I have fallen in love with a Korean girl.
Actually it is just infatuation!!! But I believe my intuition!!! She is just new student at my school. She is Korean, while I 'm Jpanese... How can I manage this situation? 1 to give up her. 2 to force her to go out with me 3 to study Korean language 4 to sniff her and feel contentment
5 etc
A main difficulty is a difference of our languages... How can I tell my feeling to her!!! What if I take off my cloths in front of her?
My imagination is still getting bigger ^ ^
