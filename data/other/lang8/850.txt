A few days ago I bought a CD and radio player. It is waterproof.
I wanted to listeng music in the bath room. So I've craved for it for long time, and finally I got it!
I was happy!
It's getting colder and colder.
Full - fledged winter has come in Japan.
So I 'm feeling like to spending happy bath time to warm body. (not only having a shower, but being into the tab fulled warm water) That is the reason why I wanted it.
In the bath room I listen to music, sing songs, and sometime dance to the music in the tab.
XD
The way to spend my bath time is funny, isn't it!? Haha!
