This happened yesterday on the way home.
I was driving on the three - lane road and stopped at the red signal.
I was a first car at signal on the right lane to make a turn right there. Then, what happen was that the car on my left passed my car and turned right on red signal. This car was on the middle lane at the time. Crazy!!
