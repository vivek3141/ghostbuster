Japanese likes" Manga". Recently, I think that Japanese likes a game too. There are adults who play game in the train. They use a portable game player for example NINTENDO DS, PSP (PlayStationPortable), or something.
The other day, I saw a women who play game walking a busy street! I like playing a game too. But we must choose places to play a game. I wonder What do foreigners think about this.
