Yesterday father and I planted a young trees. We went to the shop, where we bought some trees.
They are five kind of trees which are about one or two - year old. They're maples, vines, and some korean native kind of trees. Before we go to our garden to plant, we went to a restaurant for lunch. Then we met my eldest sister couple by chance in the restaurant. My broter - in - low who's name is Mr. park, joined. And we plantde trees and clean the garden. It taked about two hours to finish. I thought we couldn't plant trees in a day without his help.
I was lucky yesterday!
