My house is near to a post office. It's very noisy.
On the left of my house is a barber shop. My house is on the right of the post office.
When I go to the market I can see many kinds of things, such as a barber shop, a shopping mall, and a kids ' school, as well as my school. I belong to a middle class family ; that's why my house looks like a middle class family house. I live in this house with my parents and my sweet brother.
