Each time when I memorize the earthquake, it always makes me painful, because the horrible scene that I experienced and saw from TV and DVDs often appears in my mind, and I can hardly forget people's bloody face and incomplete body under the ruins. It was very horrible, and you can not imagine it.
Human being was so fragile in the face of nature disaster. That earthquake changed me a lot, and it made me rethink of myself, how I should live and what the most important thing in my life is. I think it's necessary for me to write down what happened and what I experienced in the may, 2008, because it will release something in my deep heart and I really need a release, and which have depressed me so long, and I must unload them now. I am a little sentimental, so maybe it looks like I am a little exaggerated.
