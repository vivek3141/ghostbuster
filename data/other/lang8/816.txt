I had a part time job today.
It was very cold in the morning, so I bundled up and ' waddled '
to work..
not caring whether I look fat or not. Work was good.. lunch was excellent.. short nap on the way
back home was like heaven.
I was suppossed to give my dog a bath, but I postponed it for a day.
She can wait.
Trust me, she's happy about my decision.
The cold weather is making me very lazy.
I was suppossed to
do a couple of more things, but neglected them perfectly today. I always have tomorrow, and the ' things ' can wait ^ 0 ^
