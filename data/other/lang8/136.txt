I started lang - 8. I 'm learning architecture now.
Everyday, I 'm very hard to learn it. But recently, I wanted to speak English. If I speak English fluently someday, I want to go abroad. And I want to see the wonderful architectures of foreign countries. That's why, I started it. I want to make many friends!
