Some of my friends, namely H and F, and I had made a plan to go on 2 days trip to Sendai during the 5 successive holidays, from September 19th to 23rd. Yesterday F sent e - mail to H and me. According to F's e - mail, F suddenly will have to make a business trip from September 20th, and F requested us to modify the trip plan during September 22nd and 23rd. But, unfortunately, H will have to go to the office on September 23rd.
That is to say, our plan fell through.
So we made again a plan to go to Odawara for a day on September 22nd. I really think that we can't mad thinks to have our own way easily.
