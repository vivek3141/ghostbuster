It seems that high school life is not far behind, those happy moments occur to me all the time. I was like what if I could stay at that time forever, but I know my mind now have changed a lot. And I wouldn't have thought I would go this far. All I 'm thinking now is how I can get a good, promising job, improving myself, socializing with other people and getting my English, especially oral English, even better. And I think it's quite a long time that I didn't post any English article on the website, and it might be the best time for me to practice my second language by using Lang - 8. So here I am.
I would force myself to write something in English every day. Everybody have rights to urge me.
Thank U!!
