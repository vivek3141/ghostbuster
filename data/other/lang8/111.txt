Today, my whole classmates and I went to the Huang River Park. Huang river is the second longest river of China. as its name, the water is very yellow carrying lots soil. It was little cold and windy, so the air is stale.
I was regrateful that I wore a new clothes, when I came back it full of dust. The river is very long, I can't see the limit, and the water is peaceful.
