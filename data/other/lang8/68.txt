I didn't know why I lie but at that time I was blank I = out. It was a job I seeked from the news paper. Although I know a private school student like me in Singapore is sticktly prohibit to go to have a job. I am still go to the place and try my luck. When the auntie ask me what kind of pass I am holding. I felt totally nervous and words came out from my mouth : I was a student and holding a student pass.
Many of my friends went to work.
She has no doubt at me and told me to go tomorrow to meet the other people (maybe is the HR staff)
I was going to afraid what am I gon na do tomorrow..
Having a job here is good.
But for me I am more focus on learning the experience through working and communicating with others. By the way, the job is really a short - term job (seller), which is only last for two weeks. And I am having my long holidays here.
