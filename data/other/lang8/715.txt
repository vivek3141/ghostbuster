Today, I 'm writing about one story in a Jhumpa Lahiri's book which keeps me thinking about relationships. ( yes, I know.
No answers on this kind of subject )
Here is the summery of the story. There is this young Indian woman who has an arranged marriage with a several - year older Indian man and they move to the U. S for his business reason.
She gives a birth to a daughter in the new circumstance and one day, she meets this young, friendly, and attractive Indian guy in a park who came to the U. S. to study at a prestigious university.
They get along well right away as they are close in age and also have a lot of interests in common.
Before long, It becomes habitual that the poor, hungry young student from India visits her house and gets to eat authentic Indian food and his visits become a part of her dairy life that she looks forward to.
Ten - something years later, she hears the news that the Indian guy left his wife for another married woman despite of the fact that he was very successful at work and they were having a good family life...
Of course, there are much more factors in the story like the relationship between the Indian woman and her husband, that between her and her daughter (actually, her daughter is this story teller and the whole story is described by her point of view), her daughter's dilemma as an Indian American girl who has two different backgrounds and so on.
It is enjoyable to read.
If you have the kind of double backgrounds, you might wanna try it : )
Getting back to where I was, I'd like to ask you one question to conclude my scattered thoughts on this story." Is there any tip to find a monogamous partner?" LOL
