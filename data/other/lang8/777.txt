After 18 days of my stay in New Zealand, I finally got back home yesterday, at around 7 p. m.
To put it briefly, it was genuinely a great eye - opener for me.
* Things I discovered in NZ *
1.
Most of the toilet seats were ceramic.
Those cruelly cold things had to unnerve my buttocks everytime before I relieved myself.
2. (Sorry for a toilet issue again) They have half / full flush buttons and you can choose them accordingly!
I thought this was such a nifty idea but then, after that, the taps at washstands always emitted a massive jet of water.
It just made me wonder.
3.
People were so friendly and warm - hearted.
Once I got helplessly disoriented in the middle of nowhere.
I went into a shop and asked a lady clerk for a direction, and she kindly offered me a lift to my destination! Oh she just seemed like a goddess to me.
4.
Kiwi accent was tricky to me.
After a while, though, I got used it and ended up finding it charming.
They often use the word ' reckon ' for ' think '.
Also, I noticed that they say ' There is / was (a plural form of a noun). ' These really intrigued me : D
5.
I found no cram schools as we have here in Japan.
6.
Most of the names of lands are Maori names and I found them sound quite familiar, being a Japanese native. 7.
Auckland has a huuuge population of Asians.
About half of the people I saw walking down the streets was Asian. 8.
Lots of sheep & cows < 3
9.
The sunshine is really strong.
10.
They cherish their beautiful nature so much and are seriously aware of the necessity to preserve it.
Well, that's pretty much about it.
On the train back home from the airport, I found myself missing this country so much, staring blankly at the skyscrapers soaring high above.
Thank you for sparing the time to read all this!
Don't forget to be harsh on correcting my English ; )
