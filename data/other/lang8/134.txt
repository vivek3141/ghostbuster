Today, I meet a friend. She is my old friend.
For long time, I didn't see her.
So My heart flutters with expectation.
She is still being cute.
I drank the beer with her. I asked her if she have boyfriend or not. She answered me" Yes, I have a boy friend." I disappointed it a little. But I 'm OK.
Someday, I will make a girl friend. Come to me chance surely.
