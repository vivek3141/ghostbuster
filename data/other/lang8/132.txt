Is almost 4 : 30 pm and I haven't done my housework yet, it's been a very hot day, I don't feel like doing anything, I was thinking about jumping into the pool, but I have to wash it and fill it first and that is going to take some time.
What else can I do?
Uhh, it's raining!
I 'm gon na dance in the rain, yes, that's what I 'm going to do.
If I get a cold, I 'm going to give you tell you first.
Thanks for reading and correcting.
See you, guys!
