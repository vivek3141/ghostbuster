When I traveled to Germany, I had muesli for the first time in my life.
At that time I didn't know how to eat them, so I poured milk over them, which didn't taste very well. In Tokyo I found out muesli in a grocery. I saw that we should make them soft by soaking them for several hours in yogurt. It seemed a good idea. I bought a pacake of muesli, mixed them with yogurt and put it in my refrigerator at night before going to bed. In the next morning I had it with fruits jam. It was so delicious that it was necessary for my breakfast.
