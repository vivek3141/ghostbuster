It is said that students in foreign usually get up at 9 : 00 and then go to school, and it is 3 : 00 when the school is over, right??? But the situation in our country is the opposite. Here is the time table :
get up and go to school : 5 : 45
leave school and have lunch : 11 : 30
go to school after lunch : 14 : 00
leave school for dinner : 17 : 30
go to school after dinner : 19 : 15
leave school and sleep : 21 : 20 (if you study in grade 3, the time is 22 : 00)
Not only the time table is amazing, but the content we learn is a lot. Every term we study Chinese, Math, English, Physics, Chemtry, Biology, History, Politics, Geography, Music, Art, and Physical education, 13 in all. That is scarried, do you think so??
