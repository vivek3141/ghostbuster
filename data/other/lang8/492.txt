I have last 6days for my TOEFLiBT test... I take the test for the first time and this test is really important for me... If I can get certain score, I can go to america to study for a year using exchange student program of my university. But, it seems very difficult for me, so I am almost losing my confident now... It's no use saying complaint for now... I understand that!! but can't help saying...
I should have studied harder in my winter holiday. (> _ <) anyway, I have an exam in english class tomorrow, so I have to concentrate on it!
