Next month I planing to get some rest at snowy mountains. Unfortunately I could not it during the new year's celebrations with my friends because of my illness. But now, after exams I must have some fresh highland air. There is a ski resort in my town, but to my regret I have got to know about it at last year. Over there snowboard is popularest, but I have chosen it not for this reason. I have experience of many years in ski, but I never snowboarded. Well, I wait for the end of this month and for good weather now.
