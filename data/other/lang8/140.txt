Asashoryu is a Sumo champion. Sumo is one of the Japanese traditional sports. He has been accused of puching a man while drunk recently. Sumo champion, called yokozuna, is required to be strong not only phisically, but also spiritually. He is one of the most strongest Sumo wrestler in the Sumo history. I am not familiar with the sport, but I know his name.
He is as famous as even I know. It is a pity that he retires because of this boring case.
