Today, I went to the dentist after long time interval. I was supposed to go on 1st March, but I canceled the appointment. (Sorry, we went to Universal Studios Japan. .. .)
I procrastinated it because I was too busy recently and my teeth didn't ache any more. Today, I had free time and finally go there. I think my teeth never ache any more, but I have to have my teeth and the filling kept clean.
