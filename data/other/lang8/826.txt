I wrote in my diary about one of my patients who has bipolar disorder.
Yesterday, she said that" I want to sing White Christmas in English, please teach me!"
I didn't know the song perfectly, so I asked my British friend about it.
He gave me a copy of the song's lyrics, but I just sing a begining of the song that" I 'm dreaming of a White Christmas just like the ones I used to know." That's all.... Therefor, I checked the melody of the song on Youtube and I 'm practicing now. she is coming to my clinic at 4 o ' clock.
It's in 30 minutes.
I 'm a chiropractor.
I 'm not a music teacher, am I???
Hahaha ^ ^
