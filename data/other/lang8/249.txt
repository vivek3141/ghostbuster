It is getting warm in Vancouver lately!
Summer is coming : ) I can hardly wait!!
I want to do a hundred of things. I also need to work, though.
I have gotten used to work ; therefore, I enjoy working much more.
It is sometimes hard because of my poor English ; however they are truly good experiences * By the way, I moved in the new house last Saturday. Actually, this was the fifth moving... I hope this will be my last house even though I have had bad lucks of houses. The house is very nice because it is cute and clean!! It used to be a garage.
The owner renovated it into a nice house.
There are a kitchen, a bathroom and two bedrooms just for my friend and I : D For now, while I am living with previous tenant, my friend is going to move in this Sunday! I am really looking foward it. Thesedays, I have not studied very much...
