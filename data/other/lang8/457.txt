Yesterday I met a friend who studies law in my university. He called me on the phone when I was eating lunch in campus. We promised to go out and talk.
In the afternoon, We met at a cafe in front of s station near my university. He seems to me that he want someone he can talk without any constraint. His conversation mainly focused on his academic life.
Law is not my field, but soon I realized I 'm interested in it, especially when he talked about a relationship between criminal law and psychiatry. He looked like enjoying himself by talking his matter of concern. After talking in a hour and so, we backed to university.
