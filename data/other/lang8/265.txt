This title comes from my favorite song sung by Green day, one of US band. As they said, It's essential for you to know your enemy which makes you in a trouble. As for me, Today's my enemy is untidy fat around my stomach! Few weeks ago, I went to Australia for sightseeing. (I'll also write this episode soon)
The travel was very enjoyable, but I ate high - calorie meals many times during my trip. (In particular, on the plane for Australia flight crews kindly served me with meals five times) After I came back to Japan, my weight increased by more three kg before I left for. And I haven't change troublesome part of my body yet. Recently I read a book about body control.
It emphasized it's important that the calorie you consume must be high or equivalent against that you take in. That's why I decided to eat low - calorie foods and to go jogging everyday. Then there're good thing and bad thing. The former is that Japan has a lot of low - calorie and delicious foods like udon or buckwheat.
The latter is that going outside in winter is reluctant behavior as much as possible!
