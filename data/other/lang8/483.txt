Hi all.
I 'm a new comer.
I've been hunting for jobs recently because I 'm gon na graduate this July.
Now it's 00 : 53 pm here.
I took part in a job interviw this morning, but after the HR kept asking me questions for about 30 minutes, she told me maybe this positon doesn't fit for me because I don't have the SQL skill. I was wondering why didn't she ask me if I have the SQL skill in the phone call last week. If she had asked, then I would have told her that I can't deal with that and would not be there this morning.
It's kind of a waste of time.
I have two job interviews to go tomorrow. One is in the morning, and the other in the afternoon. I like these two jobs so I need to start preparing for them right now.
