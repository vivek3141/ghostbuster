Today, I bought two bread at my favorite bakery.
The back one is I have forgotten seeing the name tag of it. It was a sandwich.
The front is a small bun with cream cheese and walnut.
The sandowich costs 280yen and I ate first time. My coworker told me it is great!
Indeed, it was yummy.
This is a french bread with cheese, maybe raw ham with spice and lettuce.
Maybe I can't get raw ham at ordinaly stores. It tastes high - grade hum! But the bread was a little of hard, I am aching my chin a little now.
