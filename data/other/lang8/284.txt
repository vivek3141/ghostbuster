I was on day duty today.
I dropped in a department store at Nihombashi on my way to come back home. The purpose was to buy a Christmas present.
After four days, I will do a Christmas party. I will exchange my friends to presents gathered by us. It costs about 1000 Yen per one. I was at a loss for a while, but I bought shoes - keeper involved in deodorizers. I hope my friends will be pleased with my present.
