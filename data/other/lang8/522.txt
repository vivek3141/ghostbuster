- Daikon - Oroshi is a mashed Japanese white radish. -
An old man tried to kill his daughter because of her having his Daikon - Oroshi without notice him.
He got angry and swung his kitchen knife, his daughter resisted with her cane and escaped. And then the police caught him in the act of doing it. He said that my daughter ate my Daikon - Oroshi in refrigerator without my permission, so I got upset, I didn't intend to kill her all along, just for a threat... What a fearful the grudge of food, is it!!
