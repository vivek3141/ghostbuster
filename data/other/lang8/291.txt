I like five - finger socks and wear it almost everyday. It's quite comfortable because my feet don't get sweaty. One day, a friend of mine found me wearing five - finger socks and said to me," I know it's comfortable and I like it too, but can't wear it. When my mom was wearing five - finger socks, dad said that it was enough to turn off even a love that lasted a 100 years (a Japanese proverb). In addition, my husband agreed with him!".
Mmm, it may look a little goofy, but I don't think it that bad. How do you feel if your girlfriend or boyfriend wear it? Enough to turn off the love?
You should try wearing it if you have never worn. You will like it!
