I have to make a newspaper in English as my summer vacation homework and I decided to introduce about my dog on the news paper. So, please somebody correct my English!
I will introduce about my dog, Tiara. She is cheerful and plump pretty dog, perhaps she is the cutest dog in the world. She's a golden retriever and she's 8 years old. Her fur is beautiful amber and soft. She is little stupid, but has perceptive insights about food because she is always famished ^ ^ She loves food! When she has had her food, she always prances around the living room merrily.
And she loves basking too.
She usually lays down near the big window and basks in the morning sun.
When she is basking she looks very comfortable.
