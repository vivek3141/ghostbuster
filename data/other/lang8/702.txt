After some days of rest I 'm recovered from the fever. For celebrate I've called my friendds and we've decided to go to dance in a club of Caribbeanses dances (salsa, merengue, bachata). When we've entered every my tought has addressed to music, so after I've removed the coat quickly I've begun to trigger me on the track. Between all the Caribbeanses dances the one which I prefer it's the salsa, because it expresses passion, characteristic that is part of me in fact I 'm a scorpion ^ ^. When I listen to this music, in particular Marc Anthony, I become an only thing with the melody and I feel free a lot that every thing around disappear and I feel only the hertbeat of my heart that follows the rhythm of the music. The dance for me is like the air that breath, own the lack of this has rendered me impossible to be firm to bed when I had the fever... fortune that now I 'm not more badly! ^ _ _ ^ Escapes from the club we are stopped in a beautiful bar where we have made breakfast with cornetto and cappuccino and speaking we have seen to be born the sun of the first morning... the dawn is a magnificent show!
