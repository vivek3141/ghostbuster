I 'm wating for my colleague in my office now to leave out here together.
Actually I don't like this situation, cause I don't have my own car.
That's why I need to wait for my colleague who has a gorgeous car.
So, I 'm planning to buy a car in a few month.
As you know, economy situation is getting worse especially car industry including US and Korea. I think this is good chance to buy his own vehcle, if anybody get some enough money.
In my case... hm...
I have to save money if buy a car... ^ ^
