Today, my classmates and me will have a picnic behind our school!
And this time is my first picnic in my college! I think it must be very interesting! I can make many dishes for my friends.
The happiness on thire face is meaning my good performance. What I pay gives my happiness.
I think it is dream from I 'm a boy! Now it comes true. Wishes all my friends happy!
