I feel very sleepy today of all days.
I just slept 5 hours yesterday because of church things. So I got up at 5 : 00a. m.
and went to the church. My first class was microeconomics.
Today of all days,
the prefessor's dull voice sounded like a cradle song.
So I dozed
in that class..
Hmm I borrowed 2 books for sister whom I know. Marie, Can you
remember the sister whom I told to you? the preetiest sister whom I have ever known.
(damn, I don't know how I express.) 2 weeks later, there will be exam awaiting me. I decided my mind to study from today, but I didn't study as I planned....
To do everything in my plan today, I should stay all night.....
That's all for today.
BYEBYE
