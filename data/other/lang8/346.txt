I would like to wirte a letter to my English teacher, so I want you to correct my English. well... I can't tell you how much I appreciate your help.
Thank you for everything what you did for me. And thank you for correcting my terrible essays over and over.
I do like your explanation! Thanks to you, I was able to understand easily.
I really admire your sophisticated teaching skills. Not only that, you are really fluent in Japanese and already passed the Japanese exam. I've never met a native teacher like you who have been studying harder Japanese. I look up to you!
In this way, you encouraged me, as well as all students.
You inspired me to study harder without a doubt.
I really enjoyed our private lessons.
They wouldn't have been nearly as much fun without you.
Oh...
I don't know what I should do without you from now on... I will miss you so much.
well, I have a present for you. I give you a red ballpoint pen. I will be really happy if you could correct my English someday in this pen. Thank you so much!
