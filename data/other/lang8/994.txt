I 'm staying my friends house now. His cat bored four kitties recently, and all of those are so cute!!
I think being cute is stronger than any thing now. If now is the ancient age, they would be killed or eaten immediately by snake or something, but now is modern era. Snake or something is picked out from their position by much stronger animal, human being. So, kitties got much more power with their cutie. Kitty's perfect cutie is much more powerful than incomplete power of snake or something now.
