Hello!
My name is Natasza.
I've just found this page and decided to start to write my diary here.
I've been learning English for about 9 years with 4 years of brake, but I've never had contact with people who speak English, so I think that in my future posts you will find lots of polish influence. My idea for a life, I think, is make all dreams come true doing everything what I can at the moment. I hate living in one place and doing thesame everyday. My favourite subjects are maths and phisic, so probably I can have problem with connect they with traveling or something like that. But last time I heard about charity organizations which need ingeeners and it can be a nice idea. : )
