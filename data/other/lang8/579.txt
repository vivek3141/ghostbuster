Today I had a English meeting with three representatives of our company customers. I met three colleagues in Tokyo station then headed to Utsunomiya station where we were going to meet them. I was a little bit nervous yesterday so called my mom to ask her the points I have to keep in mind in the business meeting in English. The most valuable lesson was how to shake hands.
Most Japanese don't understand the basic concept of" shake hands," She said." Shaking hands" is to shake hands literally, not just to grab hands.
I felt comfortable with those lessons she gave and I think I did a good job today.
Anyway I feel free after a big day now.
