Noooo OMG.....
I failed to get a Working Holiday Visa of UK... I couldn't get an appointment which is for submitting the document to the visa center.
It was limited to 1000 people and filled up so quickly.
It means that I can not work there and will have to go back Japan only 6 months because of a circumstance of my money, if I had gotten the appointment I could stay up to 2 years.... It's so tragedy for me. I 'm feeling so blue despite in New Year.... awwwwwww
