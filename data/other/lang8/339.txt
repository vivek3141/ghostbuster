When I heard the briefing session by our HR department, I felt like a discretionary system is logical and understandable at first.
However, I changed my mind after the Q and A session.
One of the employees complained about his working situation.
I totally agreed with his opinion. In some departments, the employees always work overtime until about midnight.
How long they work a day is kind of controlled by the urgent demands from their various stakeholders, so they don't have any discretionary zone. They have no choice but to work late on a regular basis.
In that case, this discretionary system won't support the freedom of the employees, but it will just cut their overtime pay.
I also work with many stakeholders, so I work overtime every day.
I envy some employees who work individually because they can perfectly control their work time and they will take advantage of this system.
The aim of this system is to improve the employee satisfaction ; however, it might increase the unfairness among the employees in different departments.
