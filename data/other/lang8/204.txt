Today's weather was rain. I felt bad.
I went to the gym which Neyagawa city run so that I can strenghthen muscle. Maybe, I don't have much muscle than general men. So I strengthen muscle. And then, I went to Lowson which is convenience store so that I can work at there at 5 pm. Its work was easy today, because today's wether was rain. That is to say, when the weather is rain, people are reluctant to go out.
