Today, I played tennis at the Yokoyama Tennis court.
Many people gathered there to be a stronger tennis player. After practicing, me and Asano matched with strong pair. To tell the truth, they weren't that strong, but we lost. Asano was in the bad condition today. He did a lot of double faults.
I realized when my pair was in the bad condition, all you need is a teamwork.
