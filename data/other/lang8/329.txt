There are several different types of houses in American. So far, I've visited town houses, condos, apartments, except single houses. I heard about a single houses is very pricey. Absolutely, you have your own garden without sharing it with others. Last week, I spent two days to stay over at my father's friends ' place. It is really a luxury house. The house is big and there are two yards adjacent to it.
The gardening of the front yard is very nice. The anti maintain it in a very neat and organized condition. Not only the front yard is good but also the back yard is too. They built a outdoor fireplace and a BBQ stove. They also put some hammocks over there.
The house has six rooms and the ceiling is very tall.
It is two - floor - high and there is a spiral staircase there. Every room has its own bathroom and each of it has 2 sink for hand washing. The most special room is that there is a indoor window of it. You can stand in the room and see the whole panorama of first - floor living room.
