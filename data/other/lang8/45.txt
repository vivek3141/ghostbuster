I've just received a international call by my cellphone. I was wondering if that was from my friend's call. But that's from Korea's quarantine depot, they're conducting follow - up of super - flu for entry to Korea recently.
They asked me if we have fever and cold symptoms.
We don't have this symptoms now. If that helps, this picture is the information what gave us from Japan's quarantine depot when we returned Japan.
