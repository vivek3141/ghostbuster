The afterquake is still happening in Japan, Kanto area. But the stuation is being recovering by helping not only Japanese but aloso all over the world. Unfortunately, we can't say there is no problem at Fukushima reactor. Now I 'm in Nagoya, Aichi.
I am going to move out to Saitama (Kanto area) from here just because I study at the university in Saitama. I 'm very worry about the radiation. And Kanto area reaches the electronic shortage.
We don't know when the situation recover perfectly.
