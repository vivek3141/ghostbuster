Hi everyone,
Below are my short diaries.
1.
The price of gasoline recently become high in Japan.
I usually use a car on commuting, but I will use a motor cycle to save money. 2.
I have a iphone3GS and enjoy it.
However it is very very slow for its oparation. I 'm thinking of buying Android or waiting next iphone...
Thank you!
Kaz.
