Before farewell party for my friend, we went to Sunset beach. She is going to Korea tomorrow.
I 'm so sad....
My friends are getting decrease.
I 'm trying to absorb it as like it's a kind of destiny for us who are coming to US to study English. I've already sent lots of friends. But I 'm not still used to it.
I always feel sad.
So tomorrow I will go to LAX to send her. I might be crying tomorrow, because she was one of my best friends when I was Orange County.
I hope I can see her again someday.
Anyway I went to Sunset beach. It was lots of fun!!
We swam a lot for total 2 hours. Thanks to that, I got pain in my whole body today.
