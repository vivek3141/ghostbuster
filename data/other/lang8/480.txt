Nowadays disciplines from teachers to students in schools are said to loosened up. I 'm not sure why this is happening since I remember hearing somewhere that they were strict back when older than our generation went to schools.
I think even my generation didn't take a hit so much in schools.
Yet, even I, who have got time of years since I didn't need to go to school anymore, get a sence that disciplinarians are dicreasing.
