This weekend, I went to visit the Queen's head with church's new friends in the north coast.
There was fill of tourists who let me felt so bad.
My new friends who they come from USA. I was suppose to very nervous, because my English isn't well, I was afraid that I couldn't express well in English. It's a tough mission for me.
But my old friends told me." Don't take it so hard, it's a good chance to practice your English ability".
That right, I should be about to break through myself.
