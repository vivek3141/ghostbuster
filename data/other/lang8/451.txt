I fell over by bicycle on my way home. I have never fallen down by scooter so it was been a long time since I have hurt myself. How the accident has happened is I was riding along a road but then the road disappeared so I had to go over to a carriageway, there was a small step, I tried to step over but I couldn't since I was going kind of perpendicular to the road and tumbled over with the bicycle. I scraped my knees and elbows plus, got blues. However In some way, I think I was lucky, it could be worse. I am glad there was no car coming behind me. I remember when I was little, I hurt myself exactly the same way. Bicycle is dangerous. My bicycle's handlebar bent, so I had to keep it diagonally to keep going straight. The wound is not too bad but I was a bit embarrassed. I was very scared to ride today.
Even the small steps scared me and I was riding very carefully. I wish I had a car!
