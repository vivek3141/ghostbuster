I heard someone on TV said" It's the spring drizzle, so I will walk to wet through it". Not sure because it is long ago, when a servant put up an umbrella for his master, the master replied the words to the servant.
It is raining right now.
I have a marathon today. I don't like running in the rain very much certainly. That is why I said the words above. Umm, okay, okay, It is just a spring drizzle, I will run to wet through it!
