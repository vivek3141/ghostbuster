A fern is a unique group of plants.
A fern does not start from a seed and does not flower.
A fern begins to grow on the structure named prothallus, which is green and whose shape is similar to heart mark, and a fern will bring up through a lot of complex events. If you want to know this complex event entirely, please check wikipedia or some books.
Unlike mosses, ferns have vascular bundles of xylems and phloems.
This is why ferns are more closely related to usual plants such as a wheat or poplar than mosses.
