Today is a busy day for me. I have a all day working. It's means that I have to work from 9 : 00a. m. to 10 : 00 p. m. Working in a bookstore is busy but exciting.
You can learn a lot of things, like how to use a kind of pen, and meet a lot of people, even they are not always very kind. I have to work now.
It's too short in break time.
