Hello! I 'm sorry to late dialy ; ( Today, I had sleeped only two hours. So I feel sleeping all day. Why I still up late, because I watched ladies soccer game! The game was Japan called" Nadeshiko Japan" vs America. This game was very tough game for each team.
The half game was score less drow, the second half was drow. Extra game was drow too! I was very strained by PK! I 'm afraid of watching PK. Fighnaly, Japan won the game, so" Nadeshiko Japan" is top team in the world!! I was exciting, so I can't sleep ; ) But I don't regret watching soccer. I want to play something sports! Thank you very much : )
