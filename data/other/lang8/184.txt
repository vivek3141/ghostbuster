My friend works in Oshima.
Oshima is a small island nearest to Tokyo in Japan.
We were classmates in college as an undergraduate.
Two months ago I went Oshima to meet him.
He was fine but bored with his work.
He has worked at a customer service representative about an insurance. Since few customers come there, he has nothing to do for a long time.
So he will try to study about something in that his time. But he has no idea that he should study about. Japanese economy is so bad now. We are concerned about when we lose our job. If he lost his currently job, he wouldn't know what he should do. I recommended that he study English or Chinese with me.
I wish we were on lang - 8.
