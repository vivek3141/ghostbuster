I could see a beautiful full moon last night.
The air was clear because of the recent coldness in cherry - blossom time, so the moon looks brighter.
In Japan, we say two rabbits are pounding rice - cakes with mortar and pestle on the moon.
What do you say about the texture of the surface of the moon in your country?
Two rabbits, a big crab, side face of a woman,..., Please tell let me know that.
