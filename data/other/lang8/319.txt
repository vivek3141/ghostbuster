I start this SNS and diary.
I know this SNS, using learning forign language," iKnow" (http ; / / www. iknow. co. jp). I study and learn English.
Sometimes I go abroad, such as Taiwan and another asian country. But I live in Japan and work in Japan.
Why?
English is communication tool and the most popular in the world. I think communication tool give us some chances. If possible, I work with foreign people using my english. Is it rigid?
It's my first diary, forgive me.
So let's study together!.
