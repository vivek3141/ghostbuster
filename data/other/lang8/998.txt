I haven't been much of histric buff myself. So, I don't know the details of ancient civilizations. I think they are still relevant today because histry has a way of repeating itself. Wnen we learn history, people usually associate their own lives with the history and try to learn things relevant to today's society.
That way, they can feel familiar with the acient history. I think when you study history, it's good idea for us to try to seek what the history has in common with our society now. I imagine trying the way will make synapse connect with each other transcending the long time.
