Today I joined Lang - 8 and this is my first English diary here.
I found this website when I read a magazine for English learners in Japan.
I 'm not good at using computer and I 'm not familiar with social networking system in the Internet. I still don't know how to use this website, which is very complex for me to understand the system. But I think this system is wonderful for every language learner, so I want to learn a lot with it.
