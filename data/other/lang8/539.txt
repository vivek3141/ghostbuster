Hi Annette!
The music is so beautiful!
I really liked it.
I'll try to get it as soon as I can.
I 'm guessing the music is from South America.
I can tell you right away that it isn't Mexican.
I was struggling a little bit to figure out where it is from.
I think it's either Colombian or Peruvian.
I didn't read" Magic Kingdom for Sale, Sold!".
I guess it's a great book.
I read a little bit on the page of wikipedia.
Yes!
That is Couer de Pirate.
I love that song, I can listen to it over and over.
So, you grew up bilingual ehh?
That's why German is easy for you.
I think German is like Spanish, it has like 7 tenses and a complex grammar.
How many hours do you spend learning languages?
I always try to practice English for 2 hours each day but I think it's insufficient because I have trouble when I 'm writing.
I 'm so slow.
In fact, the other day I was writing this same message to you, and I almost lost it when I accidentally closed the window.
Ahggg, I was so angry.
Have a great night!
Alvaro.
