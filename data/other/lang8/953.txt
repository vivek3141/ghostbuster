This afternoon I had dinner with my tibetan friends together, ohh ~ ~ ~ We were study in a same high school in Tibtet, we were often communicated with each other, like a football match, beautful grils, foods or CCP, tibetan chirdren are loyaly, friendly and smartly. Sometimes I feel they were sensitived about some politics topics, but because of many reason, they felt happy, too. Our high school teachers were very cared for them, and the Han ethnic classmeets gladed help them to study many sbjects too ` ` ` The dinner was delicours, and we drinked a bit of beer, played some joke on eachother ` ` ` it's a wonderful time. I frogot many annoying things temporarily, what a happy night in Beijing ~ ~ life is cool ~ ~
