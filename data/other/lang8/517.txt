Because of the early airplane, I fall asleep while the plane was flying. When I woke up, I heard a sound like glasses fell to the floor. I realized that it was my glasses, but I could not see where they are after touching for a while. So I asked the person next to me to help me find my glasses,
although I even did not know who he likes. He was very friendly brought it to me, then I noticed he was looked like a gentleman with full of understanding, as same as my age, maybe? wearing a glasses. After continuing exploratory talks, we found that eacher other actually produced a good impression, because we enjoyed our talking, we had a really nice time, we will be close friends in the life.
