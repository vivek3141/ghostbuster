I came back from my work earlier than usual today.
I 'm a little bit tired because I went to bed late last night.
I should go to bed early though, I have a lot of things to do. I 'm satisfied with my speech I had last night, but I must continue leaning English to improve it more and more.
I will do my best and will be able to communicate with my friends in English fluently in the near future.
