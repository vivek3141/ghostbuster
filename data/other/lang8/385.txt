I wish everyone a happy holiday.
Although to me, today is not the most cheerful day of my life...
After Christmas, my father will have a second course of chemotherapy.
Now he is in stable condition, with a good appetite, though he hasn't gain much weight in the past few weeks.
Last week I saw the diagnosis report, in which the doctor reported that my father's rectal cancer is in third phase.
I couldn't believe what I saw because only the cancer without distance metastasis can be defined as third phase.
But today, when I had the chance to ask the doctor about this, he said it must be a typo.
My father is still diagnosed with the IV phase of cancer... Typo...
What else can I say...
I have prayed many times for a miracle.
Will a miracle happen in 2009?
