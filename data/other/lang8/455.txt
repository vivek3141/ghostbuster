" You have your whole live ahead of you" That is one person's word which I've just got when I ask something about live in a little while ago. I sometime feel insecure about my way if I should get things going whether or not. I kind of hesitate to do. In that time, someone give me a supportive small push in right way. And then, I would be in a radiant mood.
Is there someone like that around you?
I wish I could become like one of them someday.
