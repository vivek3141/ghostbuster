I wasted too much time on watching Youtube. I watched without any want to watch. That's a kind of ' inertia '.
Most of the videos are less enjoyable.
Political ones are always full of childish swearings. I don't want to regard these comments as representing the average intellectual level of the viewer as a whole.
I had to shft to better one, more fruitful one, even obeying that inertia.
Then, I found a Japanese TV program introducing Wittgenstein's ' Tractatus Logico - philosophicus '.
I was interested in how they explain the book which I read few years ago (in Japanese) only the initial and threw up. But that program was trashy ; it simplified the discussion too much, and pretended that the matter is really simple.
I found that those who swearing or explaining are not only simplifying the matter too much, but also tending to neglect what is really not simple.
These neglections are sometimes violent. Of course, any understanding of objects may involve some simplification (as I 'm doing now).
But it never means that the objects themselves are really simple.
We just have simple ideas about complex objects.
Although I don't understand Wittgenstein's that book, it seemed that he didn't distinguish between ideas and objects.
It gave me a sense of strangeness.
I know there are a lot of things which I doesn't understand yet.
And I will never understand all, of course.
