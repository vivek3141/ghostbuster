I dined a dinner with my co - woker in order to listen a invitation of new job from privious superviser.
The restaurante was so nice and delicious. We had a good time together and could talk about a job. It sounded okay but I also infered he didn't talk to us the truth completely. I mean He didn't lie to us but I guess it includeed his hope. I should think with a wide perspective.
