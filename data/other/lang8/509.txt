After the 10 days, we will take an exam about english. It is called College English Test Band Four (CET4).
It is very important and very famous which if you cant pass, you wont get a suitable job in china. It is for college student. Most of them can pass it.
Even though peoples who have already graduated, they also take this exam, for making them more compititive. But actually, even peoples have abelity to pass it, they could not communicate well by english. I passed it half year ago, but now I write a passege still really hard... I am learning French, and I am often confused betwen English and French...
French is really difficult...
I dont have more time for english...
