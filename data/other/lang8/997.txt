I think you shouldn't be able to choose when they want to die. Since it also murder. Some people said it not only help for the end of theirs pain but also it help to slove their family's economic problems. They have a right which is their live a quiet life for the rest of their days. Even though their pain is so hard to endure, they should keep their final right.
This is a bless. If they had a crime, they could atone.
