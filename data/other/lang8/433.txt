I took photos yesterday with my new digital camera.
I couldn't handle it well yet, but I felt the camera had very good performance. The attached photo is some street scene at Stanford university. I like this photo.
I set the camera's mode as Nostalgic Mode. I think the atmosphere looks like old time.
What do you think?
Please tell me your impression.
