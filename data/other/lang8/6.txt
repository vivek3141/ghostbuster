This morning I found out that one of my favourite band released his new album. I already forgot about Rise Against an it is a great surprise for me, because I didn't return to them for 2 years. I hope this band didn't become worse yet like many others big ones and I'll enjoy listening it. Well, there remains to get it and check it out.
