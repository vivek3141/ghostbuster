I watched the World Series last night and as most of you know, The Yankees won. Most amazingly, Matsui hit remarkably and was chosen the MVP of this World Series. I was really disappointed with the result ; the Phillies lost.
Have you ever heard of Matsui?
He came from Japan a few years ago and joined the Yankees.
Since he had been probably the most popular player in Japan before came to the US, many fans were shocked at his decision of leaving Japanese league. However, most of the people are still rooting him as" Matsui in the Yankees". I was a fan, too, but last night he turned to just my foe. He hit too much.
In the interview of MVP, he said" I feel like in a dream." That was a nightmare for Phillies fans including me. Anyway, I enjoyed watching the Phillies ' games and I want thank all players! Thanks.
