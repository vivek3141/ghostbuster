When I was a secondary student, two teachers taught us English at the school. Mainly, Japasene teacher taught English grammers, accents and various words. Another teacher who came from English speaking country (maybe The U. S or Canada, I forgot) helped the Japanese one teach us accents.
I had never met a foreigner then, as I lived in a small town in Japan. I was really interested in her and, I wanted to talk with her in English.
However, the English class was carried out in Japanese!
The Japanese teacher talked and talked to us in Japanese whole the class. I did nothing but writing down what the teacher explained. The English teacher sat down benignly beside the main teacher because she couldn't understand Japanese.
Apparently that was standard English class in Japan in those days.
I wish English class in Japan became more creative now.
