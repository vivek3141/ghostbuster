What does leeway mean to you?
In my opinion, western youths have more freedom than their friends in Eastern. They have more things to concern whenever they make a decision.
In many cases, they have to earn money for not only their living but also their family : they become the main earners. So sometimes they can't follow their dreams, instead they get jobs they don't like, as long as it brings them much money. A few people don't give up but after several years, passion is not strong enough. In other word, they sacrifice for their family. It is not common now, but it is true.
Especially youths come from countrysides, they have already suffer dearths and not want their blings to do so.
