Hello.
I am pun.
They are the fourth graders now.
Im from Hiroshima Prefecture Higashihiroshima City.
I went to study to Pusan in South Korea during about half a year of last year. I can speak to Korean. However, the more it studies Korean, the more English is forgotten. My hobby is baseball and a travel. I am a fan of Hiroshima Carp.
I go to watch a baseball game if there is time. and like go to trip Japanese famous place and traveling abroad, and I have gone to China last week. I had been to five countries up to now but China was the most interesting country. I want to go to not only Asia but also Europe in the future.
