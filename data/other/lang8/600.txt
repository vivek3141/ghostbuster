It's a very cold day : - (
My friend and I were going to do the homework after classes. we were doing the homework at the good pace. But we talked about our high school days to refresh ourselves because we were tired. We planed to do the homework again a short time later.
However, we were talking for 1 hour and 30 minutes!
and we had not time to do the homework, so we went to each home. It is very fun of me to talk with my friends. Probably, most women will like it. How about you?
