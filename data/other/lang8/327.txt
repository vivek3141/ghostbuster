The day before yesterday, it is a special date to our youthes. It is so called Youth Day which celebrates the youthes ' contribution to our country. We are just the flowers growing up healthily and will serve the country after grown up. I feel fortunate that I can live in such a country with speedly developing economy and superior military power. As a university student in the present age, I have a heavy burden on my shoulder, so I know that I should have the will to build our country stronger and take every action to gain a good knowledge of science. I can't feel relax, do my best to contribute myself.
