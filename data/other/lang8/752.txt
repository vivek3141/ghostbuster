A couple of days ago, I discussed foods with my Filipino online tutor. The class was very interesting.
While we were discussing, our topic was changing to fast food. I like Japanese fast food :" udon"," soba"," okonomiyaki"," takoyaki"," kaiten - shushi" and so on.
However, I do not like especially American fast food :" hamburger"," french fries"," fried chicken"," pizza" and so on.
So, when I spoke to him about MacDonald food, he shared me with a very scary video clip from YouTube. Please watch it first.
What do you think about it?
It is very scary, isn't it?
Of course when I looked at the process of rotting, they looked like very gross.
However, natural french fries and a hamburger went rotten quickly, but on the other hand, MacDonald's food's rotten speed was very slow. It passed even two weeks, in the Big Mac's case, it changed nothing.
It is very scary!
The most scariest stuff is MacDonald's french fries. Even though it passed 10 weeks, it still looked like normal.
I think that the guy is from my favorite documentary," Super Size Me". The video clip associated me with two documentaries," Super Size Me" and" Food Inc".
Two of them were very interesting.
I really think that there are lot of chemical stuff in MacDonald food. However, I really think that it is not only MacDonald food, but also we can say quite the same things to another fast food. Eating out is one of my hobbies.
However, I definitely need to think of where and what I eat.
