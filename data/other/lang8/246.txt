Happy New Year, everyone!
How was your new year's day?
I have been staying at my parents ' - in - law's house in these three days to spend our new year's days with them. I got" Otoshidama" from both my husband and my parents ' - in - law this morning. After I enjoyed having" Osechi" with my family, I went to a temple called" Tatebetaisha" as" Hatsumoude" with my family.
I prayed our family's good luck there. And then, I reported my new year's resolution.
My this year's resolution is here. 1.
I would love to read 48 books in English.
This year I completed 24 books in English.
So, this year I want to try to double amount of books. I know it is very difficult because my reading level is less than other comprehension skills ' level.
However, I really want to improve my reading skill.
2.
I would like to paint 10 artwork a month. I also want to create my art blog in English and post my artwork constantly.
3.
Of course, I really would love to improve my English comprehension skills further.
I want to become able to express my thoughts, opinions and feelings with natural expressions as native English speakers do.
After I got home and checked my mails with my PC, I realized that my Michigan painting friend registered my May classes.
I am planning to go to Michigan in May to take two painting classes.
In one class I would love to learn how to paint portrait.
According to my friend's mail, my class choice was very good.
She told me that I will be able to lots of new things from two classes.
I am really looking forward to going to America again.
Before I will go there, I would like to develop my English comprehension skills further.
