Yesterday, Hikaru Utada who is a Japanese female singer said that" My Greatest Hits will be released on November 3.
But you should not buy this!
This CD doesn't have my soul.
The recording label made this without permission."
And she said that" If my CD will not sell, I will be lambasted by everyone".
I think a woman who fight with someone is very cool! Utada grow up in America. So I guess she is mentally strong.
The talk changes.
Brock Lesnar lost in UFC!
I was so shocked!
I like his powerful fighting style like a tank. Next, he will win by F5!
I hope it! Thank you.
