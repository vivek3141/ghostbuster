We live in the world for reasons, some of us live only to live up with their parents and so on. I am no one of them, but I also miss someone with heart and soul when I feel lonely. The first one comes to my mind is my grandma. My mother suicided herself when I was only a baby born one year and since my father worked far far away in the town, I was brought up by Grandma. As a child, being naughty, I brought about a lot trouble to Grandma, sometimes I even broken her heart. Every time I go home, she always says that :" Oh, my son! You are so thin and more than ever!" And then makes good dishes for me. That's Grandma, in whose heart, I am always a child. Then I think of my father. About 7 years old, I went to a primary school in the town and lived with my father in his school. Grandma made me a human and Father made me a person. He always encourages me that I am the best one in the world, if only I can hold on, I can get whatever I want. In my 16s, I did a lot of bad things, but they never abandon me. So here I want to tell you how much I love.
