I had to endure a long long flight to get to Spain.
Changing planes, it took nearly 15 hours in total from Nagoya to Barcelona.
Each seat has a small TV screen, with which we can see movies, listen to music, play games and you name it.
I don't like watching a close screen so I killed time reading something. It was really wearing.
I will write details about my trip tomorrow.
