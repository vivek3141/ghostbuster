During the last summer vacation, I traveled around Asia ; Melaka & KL (Malaysia), Siem Reap (Cambosia), and Bagan (Myammer). I met a Japanese Backpacker When I was in KL. We lived in the same guesthouse and we were the only Japanese who was there.
We became friends soon. He is 27, older than me by 6 years.
He is experienced backpacker. He said He traveled around this world. His travel stories were really interesting and exciting.
We talked and stayed up late every night.
Especially I like His stories in Thailand and India. That was really fun. When the last day of my stay there, He said He would plan to go to see Mt.
Kinabalu in Borneo Island. Today I read his blog.
It says He is in Isreal now. Then I know Backpacker is always freewheeling.
