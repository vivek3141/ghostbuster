My friend Philipp and I went to office this morning by bus. He had to call one guy who would hand a key over to him. The one was entrusted by Philipp's German friend. At beginning," # $ %! @ # %! @ # $" Philipp said in German. but the one opposite ends of the phone line didn't reply. So Philipp said," Do you speak German or English?" And then, they chat with English. Philipp's English is not as good as his German.
After two or three sentences, ' Do you speak Chinese? ' he asked.
And he turned to speak Chinese. The guy is a Chinese as we are.. I was laughing until we get out of the bus.
