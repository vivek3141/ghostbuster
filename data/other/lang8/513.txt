We have the alumni soccer games next May.
I am looking forward to it very much. My high school's alumnus will play soccer, whose age are from about 20 to over 70, at a single team.
Don't you think it sounds great and fun?
I was told about the alumni soccer club and joined it at the annual party of the Tokyo branch of my high school alumni association several years ago.
Once or twice a year our club play matches against another senior soccer teams. We can enjoy playing soccer very much nevertheless we could not play smoothly as used to at high school days.
It is very fun.
Thereafter we go to a party and have a nice time chatting with each other about our recent state.
It is very fun, too.
I think alumnus seem special for ourselves us.
We keep in touch with each other.
We also help each other in both our public and private life. We had a very good time at the high school.
I am looking forward to meeting my alumnus and playing soccer with them very much.
