I remember the day when I first watched Terminator 2. It was a really exciting film with two cyborg guys called terminator chasing and fighting each other. This movie is of course fictional.
But it made me wonder how soon we would see the society where such cyborgs or humanoid robots are living with us. Although it still takes time before we can actually create such sophisticated cyborgs, we may soon be able to have a simpler humanoid robot which can help us in our daily lives. Recently Honda, a Japanese automaker, announced that they have succeeded in developing technology by which we can control a robot with a mere thought.
The technology links human thoughts and humanoid robots.
So if you want one of the robots to move his right arm, for example, all you need to do is just think about it in your head. This is awesome. I 'm a little concerned that this kind of technology would be used for a military purpose (as you can see in the movie). I know, for better or worse, technological developments have always come hand in hand with military activities. But I just hope that they use this great technology to improve human well - being.
By the way, I think the movie has its sequel. Is it interesting?
