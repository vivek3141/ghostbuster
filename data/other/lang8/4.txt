I think this web site is a cool idea.
People help each other learning their languages.
Let me write something and see if anyone can review it and give me some advice.
I just installed Fallout 3 and played a bit last night.
I would say after 10 years of waiting, it has not failed its title, at least from my first impression. A lot of good features are inherited from old Fallout series, like the SPECIAL system, always having good, bad, neutral and (my favorite) sarcasm options when talking with NPCs.
I 'm not sure about keeping the action points feature though.
Anyway, I think I'll spent quite some playing it in the next few weeks. OK, let's all for my first entry.
