I will take English exam at June 12th. This examination name is" EIKEN". EIKEN is popular English exam for Japanese people. I think that EIKEN exam is made by Japanese people for compulsory educational student. Of cause, usual adults are able to take exam. However, until EIKEN is somewhat replaced by TOEIC. Maybe, TOEIC examination is normal English examination all over the world. I feel difficult TOEIC more than EIKEN. I want evidence of learning English.
and then, I will take EIKEN exam.
