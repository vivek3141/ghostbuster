I just found this site today.
That's why it is my first day today. Also, it is the first day in Februalry.
Spring is next to me : - )
It seems very helpful for me. I hope I keep using it. Last night, I went to sushi bar with my coworkers and owner. It was great time. I learned many things from them. In Japan, when you have a toast, you have to care about your situation. If you were youngest, your glass should be little lower than others. It is the way to survive in buseness situation my boss said. Actually, I don't wanna be a buseness person : - (
OMG ~ it's raining outside.
I don't wanna go out, so just watch movies today!
