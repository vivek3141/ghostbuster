I really love watching video clips which encourage me and motivate me. Yesterday I discovered a very nice video clip, so I would love to share it with you.
According to the video clip, although she is 90 years old, she is still fine and has been keeping creating hand made violins. I found a wonderful craftsmanship inside her. Since I 'm not good at listening to the Arkansas accent, I can't understand what she is saying perfectly. However, the reporter's English sounds very clearly, and I can guess what she is talking from the reporter's story. Can you have maintained your motivation like her? After I watched it, I asked myself. I've been learning how to paint for 15 years.
I've been learning conversational English for 2 years.
However, I sometimes loose interested in painting and learning English. I know that in both painting and learning English, if I would love to master them, all I have to do is keep going. However, it is the most difficult, and most of the people drop out in the midway. I really want to be like her, and I want to enjoy my life like her.
In the video clip she looks brightening. I really would love to be the foremost craftsman like her!
