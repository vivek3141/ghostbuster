I was born in north - east Japan. Those who were born there have an original accent. Although there are many accents in Japan, the accent of our area used to be said that it was corny a long time ago. I had been made fun of it in front of my friends when I was a child. I was so humiliated our accent during my chilfood that I tried to modify it. That's why I can speak common accent too. I took a class to study Japanese language structure to be a volunteer today. Our teacher told us we should not be ashamed of our own accents because each accents were created by their cultures. She let me speak aloud my accent in front of other students. I wonder if many people all over the world are proud of their original languages. I 'm very proud of my accent now! Because it was gifted by my ancester.
