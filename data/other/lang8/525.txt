I work in the office.
The company is about trading. There are many things to export especially foods. My boss went of site of the company at the moment. I really hungry. I want to have banana. In the picture. It is a sample for sell. But It look really nice and smell good. My boss always tell us don't eat the sample because he have to use it for exbition (I mean to show in somewhere). But I can't patient. I want to eat it.
