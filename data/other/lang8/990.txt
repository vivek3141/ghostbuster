I am going to write here about some rules.
I have a restaurant.
People can eat there, but can't drink.
I have a bar.
People can drink there as well as smoke.
You can park your car just next to the hotel. You can not park your car here in front due to the no parking zone area. You can try a free fall jump with the help of parachute but you can't jump without it.
You can swim in this swimming pool, but you can't swim in my swimming pool.
You can enjoy horse riding there, but you can't here because it is my personal farmhouse.
You can stay in this hotel, but you can't stay in my hotel because it's so expensive.
Actually, you can not afford this.
