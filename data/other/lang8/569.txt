My son was sometimes bullied by some students in his class.
He had put up with it for a month.
When some bullies walked up to him to bully him yesterday, he suddenly defeated the boss of them by a punch in his stomach. The boss sobbed in front of everyone.
Honestly, I was glad to hear that from my son and I am proud of him. Whenever I heard some bad stories, I always remembered" Biff" in the movie" Back to the future".
I thought that my son got the piece school life for a while.
