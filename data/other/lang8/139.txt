I didn ` t write here for a long time because I find a job. I worked as a waitress in a cafe.
It was very difficult work because we have to fag overtime. Every day, 15 hours... without interruption.
But it was very interesting work too.
We have many foreigneres as our clients and I really could try my strength in English ) It ` s so interesting to tolk with the Britishes, Germanes, Italianes, Danes, Finnes, Croates... and many others )
One Dutch always ask us" How are you?", nobody understand him, except me and we could talk with him for a long time. It was difficult, but very interesting time ) After my hard - days I am going to go to Belarus, to Minsk )
