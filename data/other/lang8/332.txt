Time is the most precious thing.
I have been studying English for the Test of English International Communication : TOEIC which is famous standard test in Japan.
Of course, my goal is to be as good an English speaker as a native English speaker. but I must get the good score with the TOEIC so that I do my best to English now. While I get into the studying English, my lab has begun the project that lab students have make a glider robot. There is harder and harder working the project. The schedule became tighter and tighter.
We had felt difficulty that we make the glider robot. In reality, the most problem is that we design the glider robot for the first time.
Though we can imitate and reference the similar types of the robot, there is no effect.
We must understand its mechanism completely.
That ` s why we took a lot extra time. I want to use time the English study more than I do that. I ` m reconsidering to adjustment my schedule. I have never forget to make good both things.
