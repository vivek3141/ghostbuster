On Dec.
3rd, Summit Global Japan reported they would start to sell instant film and instant camera of Poraloid in Japan in 2010. Polaroid faced financial crisys and it stopped selling instant film and instant camera. It finally filed for Chapter 11 in Dec. 2008.
I love Poraloid.
I took many pictures by their camera and film. I regretted that Poraloid stop selling thier photography products and think if I were richman, I would buy Polaroid company and continue to sell their products. Fortunately there is another rich company and it revive Polaroid. I appreciate its decision but also think their way is very hard.
One of the most attractive point of Polaroid is that we can see photos just after we take them. But now we are using digital camera to do that and running cost to see photos taken by digital camera is free while photos of Polaroid costs us film fee. Even so Polaroid has unique attractive point such as exciting feeling when we see photos appearing on the film. I hope Summit Global complete the its hard way.
