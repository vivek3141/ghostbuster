Today I got a phone call that Mrs huang asks me to interview in her company. It's third calls untill this moment, but I didn't go anyone. Sometime I regret my decision, but I have no way because of my studies. I just want to find a job early, then I'll have time to work next term.
In fact, I am nervous since I remember the interview.
I don't perpare for it entirely. I don't know how to dress up and how to deal with one and one hard questions that I cann't answer. Now, I 'm confused. I 'm bored to death.
