The best traditional peruvian food of all the places I've already ate. It's mostly a very good place where you can enjoy our traditional dishes.
It's located in the San Martin 1062 avenue Pueblo Libre. Particularly, they have a great and good variety of food, a big menu of traditional meals and dishes such as papa rellena, ceviche, butifarra and one of the most famous is" choritos a la chalaca". The whole place has an structure of our colonial time! I think is one of the only places in the capital city that maintains these traditions. Inside of the restaurant, you will see many pictures about the time when this place was under construction, pictures of our first monorail, the first cars in peru, etc. The place is quite small but very comfortable.
The waiters are a bit old but they are really good. I feel very pleasant every time I go there, you can't not only find out about our food, but also you can find out a little bit about our history! and there are a lot of foreigners going there as well. The price it's quite normal and I find it reasonable since they cook very well.. I would like to recommend this restaurant for all the tourists who are coming to visit Peru, if you plan to fill your stomach with something tradtional, fast, unique and good with such a ancient place like this, don't hesistate and go find it out for your own.
