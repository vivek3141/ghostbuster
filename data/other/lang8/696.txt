I was staying in my room all day today, because I was really ill.
I can't believe I caught a cold in christmas season!
I must have got some kind of virus when I went to a town to do my christmas shoping. anyway, I've got to get better by tommorrow as I 'm going to see Edward Scissorhands (dance performance one) with my friend!
I 'm really excited about it.
I have seen the film so I 'm quite curious how they adopt the story into a dance performance.
I'll see how it is going. thanks!
