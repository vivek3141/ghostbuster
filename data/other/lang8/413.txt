This morning I have to sit with my little cousin, Dima. He is so annoying! Don't think I am so evil, I do love children. But he makes me feel angry. Although he is already 3 years old, he cries like a new - born baby, while his mum is out! Not only cries, but even shouts. I don't even know how to calm him down.
He only cries and cries this word :" MUM" Omigod, soon I'll go crazy. I nead some earphones.
