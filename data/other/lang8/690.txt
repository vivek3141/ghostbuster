Hi,
How are you doing everybody?
As I said earlier I 'm a beginner in studying Japanese.
Today I had this question in my head and I couldn't do anything because of it. I know it's a stupid question but not knowing the answer bothered me alot.
The question is," How do japanese people know the end of every word or every sentence?". when I googled it, this is what I found," Notice there are no spaces between words.
You will need to practice reading the same sentences over and over again to get used to where words begin and end without getting confused.".
Is this what actually happens in reality?!! because it seems impossible for every single japanese individual to study all the words and sentences that he / she is going to encounter in his life.
This just doesn't seem reasonable.
So is this true or there is a better way to tell when a word is completed?
Please help because it's driving me nuts!
Thanks
