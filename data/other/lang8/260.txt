Something came down from the sky.
As soon as I saw that, I found it was a walnut. And it was devided and rolled on the load. Suddenly something had been flying for the walnut. And I noticed that this crow dropped the walnut from his beak to ground in oder to break that shell. How clever!!
The crow must understand the exist of gravity which we have 't understand yet. On my busy days, It was a time I felt happy.
