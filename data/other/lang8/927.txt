# Today's entry was way long and has some questions, so I splat it into three parts. I hope you would give me some comments.
Question : Some people spend their entire lives in one place.
Others move a number of times throughout their lives, looking for a better job, house, community, or even climate.
Which do you prefer : staying in one place or moving in search of another place?
Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.
# This is an opinion writing. I should first state my opinion, its supporting reasons, and then make it detailed with some exemplifications. It demands me to write at least 300 words in 30 minutes. It means I have to write ten words in a minute, and a word for six seconds. It's so intimidating.
Here is the first part of my answer.

I should answer this question by stating how I am living now, rather than stating a opinion that is actually not like what I am now.
At the conclusion I would like to see which person I am by observing what I have written, objectively. # A question
I wondered if should I use" mention" instead of" state" in the first sentence of my answer.
According to my dictionary, to state means to express in words, either in a verbal way or in a writing way. It more instinctively means" to put something forward." Moreover, I feel like" state an opinion" is more natural than" remark or mention an opinion." Is that right?
