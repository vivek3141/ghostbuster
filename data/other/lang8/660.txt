Hi everyone.
Today is a first day!
I think a new class will have new students, also me.
I have stayed in Singapore for 9 months.
I am a student, study English for becoming fluently English speaker. But I am disappointed, because I can not speak English well.
My listening comprehension and conversation skills are very bad...
But I have studied hard!
I will become bilingual!
