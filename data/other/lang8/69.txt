Today I saw a movie - Twilight. I like this movie very much!
I've seen a lot of movies and cartoons about vampires.
But some of them make me feel disgusting. There are always so much blood, people are so thirsty.
But Twilight is different.
Edward was cute, he cared about Bella. And Bella was a strong girl. She wasn't afraid of Edward.
Sometimes I think being a vampire is good.
They don't need to sleep, they run fast, they are sensitive.
But they can't eat food!
Aha, so I can't be a vampire, I like food!
