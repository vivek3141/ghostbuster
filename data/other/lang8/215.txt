I went to the wedding reception of my relative yesterday.
The bridegroom is my brother's wife's younger brother.
He's very good at basketball, and has won a championship in a 3 on 3 basketball competition in Kyushu.
The bride read a letter for her parents, which is often included in Japanese - style wedding receptions, and the letter was very touching.
I remembered my own reception, my starting point yesterday.
(Question ; which preposition is more appropriate, " for " or " to " in line 5?)
