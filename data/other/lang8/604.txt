It has been about 2 weeks I had joined this site. Surely, I got many friends that really wanted to help me. However, I only found a friend on this site which was really kind and concern. She was Laura also called as Amaya,. She was from US. She always helped me on every journals that I have written. She also corrected me. I 'm proud of her because even though she was busy working and studying. She still got time to help me. So, I would like to thank to Amaya for her helps and advices. I hope she will achieve her dream to study in Japan. Thanks Amaya for being a good friend to me! = )
I really appreciate that!
