Do you know the word, al dente? This is a Italian word which means boiling spaghetti for a short time (five minuets or less) and not boiling it till its core was boiled.
I found it terrible when I had the first spaghetti in UK. It was boiled for too long time and too soft for me. Moreover, I felt bad when I bought a can of spaghetti and had it because gelly spaghetti appeared and I regarding that can as a can of meat sauce. In Japan the far east country, we didn't know al dente in the past. that's because we have traditional noodles, which are Udon and Soba, which are basically boiled till their core were boiled. However, we know that's far better to have spaghetti in that way nowadays. Why isn't al dente that common in this Europian country whose people are most omnivorous. I think Italian people ought to march in a demonstration to make al dente recognized commonly : )
