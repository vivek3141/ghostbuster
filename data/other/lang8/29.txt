I went to Kanazawa university festival with my American friend. It was fun.
I made good friend with Vietnamese. We ate Ikayaki and Omurice there.
They were good.
After that we wemt for a drive to enjoy the autumn colors.
we enjoyed well. And we had a dinner with my another friends. We ate pizza and pasta.
We talked with each other and enjoyed our meals.
It's a amazing day today.
