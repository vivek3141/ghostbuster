I couldn't write my diary last week because I was busy and tired for my part - time job.
I hadn't ever had exprerience of a hall stuff member, so I always be tensed up during working. Recently, I feel a little relax that I got accustomed to working as a hall stuff member. Today is the most busy day in my experience days. I can not only having a break but drinking a glass of water. I was really thirsty and tired.
After working, I drank water soon and went back my house to eat something.
I went to bed after eating soon.
Tomorrow, I have a work as a hall stuff member but I have a holiday day after tommorrow, so I can stand it. See ya tomorrow.
