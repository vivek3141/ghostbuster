is getting better I made a lighter became too hot from fire of the lighter, I pressed a lighter on my skin to get smileys I felt hurt then but I was ok : ) and my bf told about smiley, (I have never known about it before) but he was worrying me when I got them so I will not get new one anymore by the way, they dont look like smiley I think because I use japanese lighter so they dont smile,,,,! : o but I dont mind ~ so I have not studied english recently,, I should!!!!
