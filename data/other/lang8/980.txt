I went to Okinawa, which is southern part of Japan, as a school event this week. We were there for four days, and the first three days were rainy and cloudy, so I didn't feel I was in southern island. Also, the hotel we stayed at on the last day was at the center of Naha City, the capital city of Okinawa, so it made me feel like I was in Tokyo, too. But It was the last big event in my highschool life, so I enjoyed spending time with my friends there and visiting many places. We did water activities in the beautiful ocean, visited an aquareum and a museum, and other things. Everything went well without any trouble, and the trip made me realize an important thing, so I think it was nice to have this experience.
