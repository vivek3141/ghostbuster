I play street live at every Saturday.
It play on station near. I am get meeting to many people by street live. I studied many things from there.
For example...
Courtesy, Gentleness, Inclemency... there still.
Last Saturday, I play street. Then I get courtesy.
I was very happy.
In the future, I want to sing for Gratitude.
Thank you.
