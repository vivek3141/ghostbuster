My neighborhood is surrounded by stray cats.
I like to take home sick kittens to treat their illness. Most kittens are overly ill and died few days later. My cat is the only kitten that grows to adulthood. A kitten made a way to my house.
It was raining.
He was wet, cold, thin, and had droopy eyes.
I wanted to adopt him but I don't have a space for two cats. So, I decided to nourish him before releasing him.
I bath him everyday because he has thick layer of fleas. After a few days, his eyes are getting better but he's still thin. This noon, when I checked how he was doing, his box was empty. The housemaid said, that he went to the veranda, jumped from the second floor, and escaped through the front gate.
