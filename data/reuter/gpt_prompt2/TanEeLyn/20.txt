In a stern reminder, a top US envoy urged China to honor and uphold the promised freedoms for Hong Kong, as the city approaches its handover anniversary next year. The call for action comes amidst concerns over China's increasing influence and potential erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy.
Speaking at a press conference, the US envoy emphasized the importance of maintaining the fundamental rights and liberties that were guaranteed to Hong Kong under the "one country, two systems" principle. This principle, agreed upon during the handover from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, enshrines Hong Kong's extensive degree of autonomy and promises the city a high level of freedom unseen elsewhere in China.
The envoy highlighted that the international community is closely monitoring developments in Hong Kong and expects China to adhere to its commitments. While recognizing China's sovereignty over the city, the envoy underlined the significance of a strong and prosperous future for Hong Kong by upholding the values that have made it a world-leading financial center and preserve its unique cultural identity.
Questions have arisen over recent constitutional reforms imposed by Beijing that critics argue are undermining Hong Kong's democratic processes. The controversial national security law and the disqualification of pro-democracy legislators have raised concerns both locally and abroad about the preservation of freedoms guaranteed to Hong Kong under the Basic Law.
The US envoy's reminder echoes growing international apprehension over China's tightening grip on Hong Kong, symbolizing broad concerns about the erosion of civil liberties and the rule of law. Several countries, including the United States, have openly expressed support for Hong Kong's democratic aspirations and condemned any measures that undermine the city's autonomy.
As Hong Kong approaches the 25th anniversary of its handover, the international community is putting increasing pressure on China to respect the core values that have shaped Hong Kong's unique identity for so long. The US envoy's message serves as a call to action and a reminder to China that the world is watching, expecting that the promises made to Hong Kong will be faithfully upheld in the years to come.
