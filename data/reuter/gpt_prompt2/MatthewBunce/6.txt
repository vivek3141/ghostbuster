Abidjan, 15th May 2023 - The Inter-African Coffee Organization (IACO) is gearing up for its annual meeting in Abidjan, where delegates from across the continent will convene to address the pressing issue of low coffee prices in the global market. With a record low in coffee prices impacting African coffee producers, the IACO is determined to find collaborative solutions to stabilize and enhance the economic viability of the African coffee industry.
Hosted in the bustling economic hub of Abidjan, this year's event will witness the participation of key representatives from coffee-producing nations, industry experts, policymakers, and stakeholders in the coffee value chain. The primary focus of the conference will be on formulating strategies to counteract the negative impacts of low world prices and foster sustainable coffee production practices across the continent.
Over the past year, African coffee producers have been battered by a significant decline in global coffee prices, resulting in severe economic consequences for farmers and their communities. The African coffee industry, which contributes significantly to the continent's economic growth, has been grappling with this issue, threatening livelihoods and future investments in the sector.
During the three-day conference, delegates will delve into the root causes of the persistently low prices, exploring factors such as oversupply, global market dynamics, and the impact of climate change on coffee cultivation. They will also discuss ways to diversify the African coffee market and seek new avenues to strengthen the continent's position within the global coffee industry.
Keynote speakers at the event include renowned economists, market analysts, and coffee industry experts who will share their insights into the present scenario, highlighting potential strategies to improve the economic sustainability of African coffee production. Panel discussions, workshops, and networking sessions will enable participants to exchange ideas, experiences, and best practices.
The IACO aims to foster greater cooperation and coordination among African coffee-producing countries, encouraging them to harness their collective strength to negotiate fairer trade terms and prices in the global market. Additionally, the organization will advocate for sustainable practices, including improved farming techniques, climate-smart agriculture, and responsible resource management, to enhance productivity and quality while safeguarding the environment.
The annual meeting in Abidjan provides a vital platform to raise awareness and demonstrate the resolve of African coffee producers in addressing the challenges associated with low world prices. By building stronger alliances and sharing knowledge, the IACO seeks to devise innovative solutions that will enable coffee farmers to thrive and contribute to the continent's economic development sustainably.
As the meeting draws nearer, anticipation is high among stakeholders eager to witness the outcomes of this crucial gathering. All eyes are on the IACO, hoping for an impactful conference that will pave the way for a resilient African coffee sector, ensuring fair remuneration for farmers and a sustainable future for the continent's renowned coffee industry.
