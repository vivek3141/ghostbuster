Introduction: 
In a controversial move that has sent shockwaves throughout the exporting community in Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), the government's recent proposal to hold exporters accountable for income tax debt owed by upcountry buyers has sparked a united front against the potential financial burden. Exporters argue that this unexpected liability threatens the stability of their enterprises and could have severe implications on trade dynamics within the country.

The Ivorian government's plan, under consideration by the National Assembly, seeks to shift the responsibility of settling income tax obligations of upcountry buyers onto exporters. The move comes amidst an effort by authorities to streamline tax collection processes and generate additional revenue in a struggling economy. However, exporters fear that this measure will manifest adverse consequences for their businesses and the wider export sector.
The exporters' alliance, formed in response to this proposal, highlights several concerns central to their united opposition. Firstly, exporters emphasize that they already face extensive challenges operating within a competitive global market. With rising costs of production, transportation, and legal compliance, adding the burden of income tax liability to their already strained finances would substantially impede their ability to remain competitive.
Moreover, this proposal overlooks the complexities rampant within the export process. Exporters frequently deal with numerous intermediaries during the supply chain, making it incredibly challenging to ascertain accurate financial information and track specific buyers' income tax obligations. Holding exporters responsible for the tax debt of upcountry buyers would require an unreasonable level of monitoring and mandate that exporters act as tax collectors, drastically increasing administrative burdens.
Additionally, exporters argue that it is unjust to expect them to bear responsibility for the income tax debt of upcountry buyers. It is the purchasers' duty to fulfill their tax obligations, and exporters vehemently oppose being held liable for the buyers' actions over which they have no direct control. Imposing this liability unfairly penalizes exporters, placing them in a precarious position where their financial stability is at risk due to factors beyond their control.
The coalition of exporters has proposed alternative solutions to tackle this issue effectively. Instead of placing the responsibility solely on exporters, they recommend the government strengthens its tax collection mechanisms and engages in increased oversight across the country, particularly in the upcountry regions. Implementing effective monitoring systems, facilitating tax education programs, and enhancing enforcement capabilities will enable the Ivorian government to directly address tax evasion issues without burdening exporters.
Conclusion:
Exporters in Côte d'Ivoire are actively mobilizing against the government's plan to hold them accountable for income tax owed by upcountry buyers. They argue that this proposal not only undermines their ability to compete in the global market but also places an unreasonable burden on their day-to-day operations. The exporters' alliance suggests that the government focuses on strengthening its tax collection mechanisms instead, allowing them to maintain their vital role as contributors to the nation's economy without bearing unnecessary liabilities. As discussions continue within the National Assembly, the outcome of this contentious proposal will have far-reaching ramifications for exporters and the overall business landscape of Côte d'Ivoire.
