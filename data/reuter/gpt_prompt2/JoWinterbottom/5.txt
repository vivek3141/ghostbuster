The decision to review water company price limits five years ahead of schedule comes amidst mounting pressures on the water industry. Ofwat acknowledges that the rapidly evolving landscape necessitates a proactive assessment of pricing mechanisms to align with the market's current reality.

By reassessing price limits, the regulator anticipates incentivizing water companies to adopt more sustainable practices and invest in cutting-edge technologies to mitigate these challenges effectively.
