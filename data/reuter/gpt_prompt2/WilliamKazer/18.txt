Maintaining Fiscal Discipline:
Recognizing the significance of fiscal discipline in ensuring stability, China has made substantial efforts to manage its debt levels prudently.

The BRI aims to foster enhanced trade and investments, thereby creating opportunities for China to generate revenue streams to meet its debt obligations.
Restoring Global Confidence:
Recognizing the importance of maintaining international investor confidence, China has consistently prioritized transparency and openness. Commitments to financial reforms, such as the liberalization of its capital markets and the continued opening-up of its economy, have reassured global stakeholders regarding the nation's intention to fulfill its financial obligations. By embracing accountability and ensuring a level playing field for both domestic and foreign entities, China seeks to strengthen trust in its ability to repay its foreign debts.
