[City, State] - Ameritech and Sprint, two prominent telecommunications companies, both reported remarkable double-digit profit increases in the third quarter of 1996. These stellar results come as a testament to their unwavering commitment to growth, innovation, and customer satisfaction. 
Ameritech, a leading provider of telecommunications services in the Midwest, posted a striking 16% rise in profits compared to the same period last year. The company's strategic initiatives, coupled with a solid performance across multiple business segments, catapulted their earnings to new heights.
One of the key drivers behind Ameritech's success was their relentless focus on customer-centric solutions. By investing heavily in state-of-the-art infrastructure, the company enhanced their ability to offer cutting-edge services such as landline telephony, data transmission, and internet connectivity to their growing customer base. The decision to diversify their portfolio by venturing into cellular communications also paid off, as demand for mobile services soared during this period. Ameritech's steady stream of innovative offerings cemented their position as an industry leader.

Sprint's unwavering commitment to providing high-quality services, combined with astute marketing strategies, fueled their remarkable growth.
Sprint's focus on long-distance telephony services, which accounted for a substantial portion of their revenue, remained one of the primary driving forces behind their remarkable increase in profits. Moreover, their merger with Centel Corporation in 1993 enabled synergies and cost efficiencies that further strengthened their market position. Sprint's strategic partnerships with other major players in the telecommunications industry, such as AT&T, also contributed to their overall success.
Bill Esrey, CEO of Sprint, hailed the company's financial performance, stating, "We are thrilled with our continued success and the trust our customers place in us. Our commitment to exceptional customer service paired with continuous investments in cutting-edge technologies has allowed us to dominate the market and maximize our profitability."
