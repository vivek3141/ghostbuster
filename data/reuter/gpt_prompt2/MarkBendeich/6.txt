With a strong commitment to growth and a strategic approach, the company plans to establish joint ventures to tap into these lucrative markets, aiming to cement its position as a leading global player in the brewing industry.
India, with its rapidly growing middle class and changing consumer preferences, presents an enticing opportunity for Foster's Brewing Group.

Vietnam, with its vibrant urban centers and thriving tourism industry, presents another compelling opportunity for Foster's Brewing Group. The country's beer market has experienced steady growth over the past decade, fueled by a young population and an increasing appetite for premium beers. Foster's plans to forge joint ventures with established Vietnamese breweries, leveraging their local expertise and distribution networks to gain entry into this rapidly expanding market.
By entering the Vietnamese market, Foster's Brewing Group aims to expand its customer base and capitalize on the country's fast-evolving beer-drinking culture. The joint ventures will provide access to regional and domestic distribution channels, allowing the company to establish a strong foothold and effectively cater to the diverse tastes and preferences of Vietnamese beer enthusiasts.
