Recognizing the potential disruption of network computers on the existing market, the company aims to maintain its dominance by capitalizing on the preferences of everyday consumers.
With an increasingly interconnected world, network computers have emerged as a potential rival to traditional PCs. However, Microsoft intends to leverage its expertise and reputation to cater to the specific needs of users who prefer more control and versatility in their computing experience.

Furthermore, Microsoftâ€™s commitment to user-friendliness is a direct response to the obstacles faced by individuals who may find network computers overly complex or unintuitive. By providing easy-to-use personal computers, the company is placing the power of technology back into the hands of the average user.
Microsoft's move not only caters to consumer preferences but also safeguards its own market position. By offering inexpensive PCs with user-friendly interfaces, the company intends to retain its loyal customer base while attracting new users who are seeking accessible and versatile computing solutions.
As the threat of network computers looms, Microsoft's commitment to innovation and considering the end-user marks a pivotal step in adapting to the evolving industry landscape. Their focus on affordability and ease-of-use ensures that personal computers remain a viable and relevant option for years to come.
In conclusion, with the rise of network computers, Microsoft is determined to stay ahead of the game.
