Montreal, Quebec - In a bid to put an end to swirling rumors, the owner of the iconic Montreal Canadiens, Geoff Molson, vehemently denied any intentions of selling the beloved franchise. This denial comes amidst reports suggesting that a consortium is eying a bid for the historic hockey team.

The rumors began circulating last week when a local news outlet reported that a consortium, comprised of both local and international investors, had expressed interest in acquiring the Canadiens. The news sparked widespread speculation and fueled debate among fans and experts alike.
While Molson acknowledged receiving inquiries regarding the team's ownership, he stressed that these discussions were merely routine business matters and did not reflect any intention to sell the franchise.
Addressing the fans, Molson further tweeted, "I understand your concern and love for this team. I assure you that any discussions I've had are completely unrelated to a sale. We are focused on building a contending team and providing a sensational experience for our loyal supporters."
