Wickes Plc is planning to make another charge against its financial results following accounting discrepancies that were recently discovered. The British home improvement retailer is preparing to take an additional charge of around £10m ($13m) as it continues to assess the impact of the errors.
The new charge follows an original charge of £7.5m ($9.8m) that Wickes announced in November 2020. This first charge was related to an overstatement of profits, which resulted in a misstatement of its financial results for the first half of the year. The company said it had identified the issue during its year-end audit process, which was conducted by PwC.
In a statement on Tuesday, Wickes said that the new charge would be taken in its full-year results for 2020, which are expected to be released on March 24. The company said it now expects its underlying profit before tax for the year to be between £45m ($58.6m) and £48m ($62.5m), compared to previous guidance of between £55m and £59m.
The accounting discrepancies relate to the application of commercial discounts to certain suppliers, and the timing of certain costs in relation to the timing of revenue recognition. The company said it has taken action to address the issues, including adopting new policies and procedures, and providing additional training to its finance team.
In its statement, Wickes said: "We are committed to ensuring the highest standards of financial reporting and governance, and we deeply regret the impact that these issues have had on our stakeholders. We have taken immediate action to address the matters identified and are working hard to strengthen our internal controls and processes."
The company's shares fell by more than 5% following the news of the additional charge. However, Wickes said it remains confident in its long-term prospects, and has recently announced plans to open new stores and expand its range of products.
Wickes is not the only British company to have recently discovered accounting discrepancies. In December 2020, supermarket chain Tesco agreed to pay £129m ($168m) to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders over an accounting scandal in 2014. The scandal saw Tesco overstate its profits by £263m ($342m), and resulted in a number of senior executives being suspended or forced to resign.
