Wickes Plc, the UK-based home improvement retailer, has announced a £51 million write-off as part of its annual report for the financial year ending 31st December 2020. The company also plans to raise funds through a refinancing rights issue.
The write-off relates to the closure of non-core stores as part of the company's strategy to focus on its core market. Wickes closed down four under-performing stores during the year, resulting in the one-off charge.
The company's core market, which includes kitchen and bathroom renovations, saw sales increase by 6.8% in 2020, with an online revenue growth of 89%. Wickes attributed this success to increased demand for home improvements during the Covid-19 pandemic.
However, the company faced several challenges during the year, including supply chain disruptions and increased costs due to Covid-19 safety measures. Wickes also acknowledged that the uncertainty surrounding Brexit had caused difficulties in importing goods from the EU.
Despite the challenges faced, the company's overall revenue increased by 5.4% to £1.4 billion, with a pre-tax profit of £17.7 million.
Wickes CEO David Wood stated, "2020 has been a year of extraordinary challenges for everyone, and I am pleased that we have been able to deliver a strong performance despite the unprecedented circumstances. Our core market has remained robust, and our online business has seen exceptional growth."
To strengthen its position further, Wickes is planning to raise funds through a refinancing rights issue. The company will issue approximately 150 million new ordinary shares at a price of £0.34 per share, representing a discount to the current trading price.
The purpose of the rights issue is to pay down debt and support the company's growth plans. Wickes is looking to invest further in its digital capabilities and expand its kitchen and bathroom offering. The company plans to open ten new stores within the next three years, with a focus on high-growth areas.
Wood added, "We have ambitious plans for the future, and this refinancing will provide a stable platform to execute on those plans and ensure we can continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders."
Wickes' shareholders have expressed their support for the refinancing rights issue. Chris Marsh, an analyst at Peel Hunt, noted, "The recent share price appreciation has nicely bridged the gap between the current price and the rights issue price, so shareholders should be relatively happy to participate."
The announcement of the write-off and refinancing rights issue has had little impact on Wickes' share price. At the time of writing, the company's shares were trading at £0.41, an increase of 1.2% compared to the previous day's close.
Wickes is not alone in facing challenges in the UK retail sector. The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift towards online shopping, and traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers have struggled to adapt. However, companies such as Wickes that focus on home improvements have seen an increase in demand as people have spent more time at home.
Wickes' successful performance in its core market and plans for growth bode well for the company's future. The refinancing rights issue will provide a solid foundation for the company's expansion plans, and its focus on digital innovation will help it stay ahead in an increasingly competitive landscape.
