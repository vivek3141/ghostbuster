Millennium Chemicals, a leading producer of specialty chemicals, has announced its plans to buy back its own shares as part of a low-dividend policy in the future. This move is in accordance with the company's new growth strategy which focuses on expansion and innovation.
The company's management team highlighted the importance of investing in research and development, as well as growth-centered mergers and acquisitions (M&As). These are expected to result in long-term benefits that improve the company's competitiveness and profitability.
In light of this strategy, the company's board of directors has approved the share buyback program, which is expected to begin in the next few weeks. The buyback program will be executed in stages, with a target of up to five percent of the company's total shares outstanding.
Moreover, the company has declared a low-dividend policy for the foreseeable future. The decision to keep dividends low is a reflection of the company's growth-centered strategy, aimed at increasing capital expenditures.
Speaking about the new strategy, Mr. John Hendricks, CEO of Millennium Chemicals, said, "We are pleased to announce these strategic moves that demonstrate our commitment to our growth plans, which are aligned with our long-term objectives and the interests of our shareholders."
He added, "Our investment in R&D, expansion and innovation will be key drivers of growth, and we remain committed to finding opportunities to create value for our stakeholders. This includes exploring various M&A options that are in line with our strategic priorities."
The company's share buyback program is expected to boost shareholder value, while the low-dividend policy will help to facilitate future expansion plans. With sound financial backing and an innovative strategy, Millennium Chemicals is well-positioned for long-term growth and success.
