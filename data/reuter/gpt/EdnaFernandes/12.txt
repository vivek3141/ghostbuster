Wolseley Plc, the UK's leading distributor of heating, plumbing, and building materials, is set to announce a slight drop in profits for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021. However, it is expected to increase its dividend payout due to strong cash flow and improved efficiency.
According to analysts, the company's profits are likely to be affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted the construction industry. The company had also incurred significant one-off costs due to restructuring, which impacted its earnings.
Despite the decline in profits, the company's revenue has remained stable due to its diversified product portfolio and strong market position. The company's recent acquisition of Merritt Plastics, a US-based supplier of plastic pipes, is expected to further strengthen its position in the North American market.
Commenting on the results, CEO Adrian Barden said, "We are pleased with our performance in a challenging year. We have made significant progress in simplifying our business and improving efficiency, which has helped us to weather the impact of the pandemic. We remain committed to our long-term strategy of expanding our presence in key markets and providing value to our customers."
Investors are likely to be pleased with the company's decision to increase its dividend payout, which reflects its confidence in its ability to generate cash and maintain a strong balance sheet. The company has a track record of paying consistent dividends, and the increased payout is expected to be well-received by shareholders.
Wolseley Plc is set to release its full-year results on September 14, 2021. The company's shares have been trading steadily in recent weeks, and investors will be watching closely for any updates on its growth plans and strategic initiatives.
