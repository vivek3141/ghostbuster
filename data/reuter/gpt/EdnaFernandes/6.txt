The former chairman of Wickes, Michael Ashcroft, has accepted responsibility for accounting irregularities that led to a write-off of £51 million. The announcement was made on Monday, June 28th, by Wickes’ parent company, Travis Perkins, who also confirmed that they have reached a settlement with Ashcroft.
The accounting irregularities were uncovered during an internal review in 2019, which led to Wickes restating its profits for the previous two years. In March 2020, Travis Perkins announced a £51 million write-off, which included £29 million in stock losses and a £22 million charge relating to accounting irregularities.
Speaking on the settlement, Wickes’ CEO, David Wood, stated that it would “draw a line under these issues and allow us to move forward with confidence.” He also praised the work of Wickes’ employees during the past months, stating that they had “worked tirelessly to rebuild trust with our customers and partners.”
The financial irregularities occurred during Ashcroft’s tenure as chairman of Wickes, between 2015 and 2018. In a statement, he admitted that he was “disappointed and regretful” that they happened on his watch. He also explained that “after the discovery of the irregularities, I instructed the board to investigate and address the matter fully.”
Travis Perkins’ CEO, Nick Roberts, praised Ashcroft for “taking responsibility for his actions” and for the “professional and constructive approach he has taken throughout the settlement process.” He added that Wickes was now a “strong and profitable business” with a bright future ahead.
The settlement with Ashcroft is a significant step for Travis Perkins, who have been working hard to rebuild investor confidence following the accounting irregularities and the impact of Covid-19 on their operations. In May 2021, the company reported that its trading performance had exceeded expectations, with the Wickes division being a standout performer.
Despite this positive news, Travis Perkins’ share price has been sluggish in recent months, as investors remain cautious about the economic outlook and the impact of Covid-19 on the UK’s construction sector. However, analysts are optimistic about the company’s future, with many predicting that it will continue to benefit from the current boom in DIY and home improvement.
The settlement with Ashcroft is also a reminder of the importance of corporate governance and the need for companies to take responsibility for their actions. As the UK’s economy continues to recover from the impact of Covid-19, investors will be looking for companies that can demonstrate transparency, accountability, and strong leadership.
In conclusion, the settlement between Wickes’ parent company, Travis Perkins, and former chairman Michael Ashcroft is a significant development in the ongoing fallout from the company’s accounting irregularities. While it is a reminder of the importance of corporate governance, it also highlights the resilience of the UK’s construction sector in the face of economic uncertainty. Wickes is now well-positioned to capitalize on the current boom in DIY and home improvement, and Travis Perkins can move forward with confidence.
