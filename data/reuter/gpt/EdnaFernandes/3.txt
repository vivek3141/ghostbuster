Rover and Vauxhall have both announced significant investments aimed at ramping up exports in the British motor industry. The two companies, long-established players in the sector, have outlined plans to further enhance their global reach and increase production capacity to meet growing demand.
The move comes as the UK’s auto sector continues to rebound from the pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions, with sales of new cars increasing in recent months. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), new car registrations rose by 28% in June compared to the same month last year.
Rover, which is owned by Tata Motors, said it would invest over £100 million in ramping up production at its manufacturing facility in Solihull, West Midlands. The investment will involve the introduction of more advanced robotics and automation technologies, as well as the expansion of the company's electric and hybrid vehicle product line.
The Solihull plant, which employs over 8,000 people, currently produces the Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, and Land Rover Discovery models. The new investment is expected to create hundreds of new jobs and enhance Rover's ability to meet growing global demand for its luxury SUVs.
Meanwhile, Vauxhall, which was recently acquired by the Stellantis Group (formerly PSA Group), announced that it would invest £100 million in its Ellesmere Port manufacturing facility in Cheshire. The investment will enable the plant to produce electric vans and other commercial vehicles, which will be targeted at the European market.
The Ellesmere Port plant currently produces the Vauxhall Astra hatchback and employs around 1,000 people. The new investment is expected to create 750 new jobs and secure the future of the plant in the long term.
Commenting on the investments, SMMT CEO Mike Hawes said: "It's great to see leading names in the industry committing to investment and growth here in the UK. As we move towards electrification and a net-zero future, the automotive industry has a huge opportunity to demonstrate its value and ensure we remain a globally competitive nation. This investment will help drive our economy and secure the future of thousands of highly skilled jobs."
The UK's automotive industry has faced significant challenges in recent years, including uncertainty around the country's Brexit negotiations, the global pandemic, and the shift towards electric and autonomous vehicles. However, investments such as those announced by Rover and Vauxhall are seen as a positive sign of the industry's resilience and potential for growth.
As the UK works towards achieving its target of net-zero emissions by 2050, the automotive sector is expected to play a critical role in helping the country transition to a low-carbon economy. The investments announced by Rover and Vauxhall are set to further strengthen the UK's position in this area and ensure that the country remains a world leader in the production of innovative, sustainable vehicles.
