Colombia has vehemently denied that its army is linked to paramilitary death squads operating within the country. The government has instead pointed fingers at leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers, accusing them of spreading lies and misinformation.
In a statement released on Wednesday, Colombian authorities claimed that accusations linking the army to these groups were baseless and unfounded.
"The Colombian army operates in full compliance with international human rights law," read the statement. "We categorically deny any involvement or complicity in the activities of illegal armed groups operating in our country."
The accusations against the army first surfaced last week, when an investigation by the New York Times uncovered evidence suggesting that soldiers were collaborating with paramilitary groups in the killing of civilians, including activists and social leaders.
According to the report, members of the army were working alongside the paramilitary groups to target individuals deemed to be a threat to government interests, such as those advocating for human rights or environmental protection.
The allegations sparked outrage from human rights organizations and opposition politicians, who called for an immediate investigation into the matter.
But the Colombian government has dismissed the claims as part of a broader conspiracy to undermine the country's security forces.
"Leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers have long sought to discredit the Colombian army and tar its reputation," said one government official. "These allegations are part of their ongoing campaign to undermine our democracy and wreak havoc on our society."
The government's response has drawn criticism from many quarters, with some activists accusing officials of being complicit in the violence that has plagued the country for decades.
"We need to hold the government accountable for its role in perpetuating the violence that has ravaged our communities," said one advocate. "The fact that they continue to deny any responsibility is a slap in the face to the countless victims of this conflict."
Despite the denials from the government, pressure is mounting for a more thorough investigation into the alleged links between the army and paramilitary groups. Whether or not this will bring justice to the victims of this violence remains to be seen.
