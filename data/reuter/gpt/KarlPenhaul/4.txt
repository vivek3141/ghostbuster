At least 24 people have lost their lives in a series of clashes between Colombian soldiers and rebel fighters over the weekend. The fights took place in the southern province of Caquetá, where the notorious Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, has an active presence, making it a high-risk zone.
According to a statement released by the Colombian military, the clashes occurred in three different locations. They said that the FARC insurgents attacked government troops who were on a routine patrol. The authorities say that the soldiers returned fire, and the firefight lasted for hours.
The Colombian Air Force was called in to support the ground troops, and government forces were able to successfully repel the militants. Three soldiers were killed in the line of duty, and another eleven were injured. It is not known how many FARC militants were killed or wounded in the clashes.
This isn’t the first time that there have been violent clashes involving the FARC. The group, which was founded in the 1960s, has been responsible for thousands of deaths in Colombia. The FARC is classified as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union, and Canada.
Since 2016, the Colombian government has been in peace talks with the FARC in an effort to bring an end to the violence. In November of that year, they signed a peace agreement, but there have been reports of violations of the agreement by both sides.
The latest violence will come as a shock to the Colombian people, who have been hoping for an end to the violence for decades. A spokesperson for the government, who asked not to be named, said that they were extremely concerned about the situation and that they were working very hard to ensure that peace talks continued.
The Colombian authorities are calling on the FARC to respect the peace agreement that was signed in 2016 and to come back to the negotiating table to find a peaceful solution to the conflict.
