Colombia has denied investigating accusations of political killing against BP, but has opened inquiries into human rights abuses in the country. The announcement comes amid mounting tension between Colombia and the UK-based oil giant, which has been accused of involvement in the murder of human rights activists in the South American country.
The accusations were made by Colombian NGO Justice for Colombia, which claimed that BP had hired paramilitary groups responsible for the killing of activists who opposed the company's operations in the country. The group also accused BP of using security forces to intimidate and harass local communities, and said that the company had failed to implement adequate human rights safeguards.
However, the Colombian government has denied the allegations and insisted that BP is not under investigation for political killing. In a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the government "rejects any accusation of human rights violations in Colombia by multinational companies, including BP".
The statement added that the government was "committed to protecting the human rights of all Colombians, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations", and that it would take "appropriate measures" to hold anyone accountable for such violations.
In an apparent attempt to appease critics, the government said that it had opened inquiries into human rights abuses in the country, and vowed to take "decisive action" against those responsible. However, the specifics of these inquiries are not yet known, and it remains to be seen whether they will lead to any concrete action.
The accusations against BP come at a time of increasing scrutiny of the company's operations in Colombia. Last year, the company was forced to halt production at its La Cira-Infantas oilfield in the eastern province of Santander after a series of leaks and spills contaminated local rivers and farmland.
The company has since been working to repair its environmental record and improve relations with local communities, but the accusations of human rights abuses have cast a shadow over its operations in the country.
BP has denied any involvement in political killings or human rights abuses in Colombia, and has cited its commitment to sustainability and transparency in its operations worldwide. However, the accusations are likely to raise further concerns among investors and human rights groups, and may prompt calls for a full-scale investigation into the company's activities in the country.
