Thousands of people from across Colombia have taken to the streets of Bogota to denounce the recent wave of kidnappings in the country. The march, which was led by families of victims, aimed to bring attention to the gravity of the situation and call for action to be taken against this scourge.
The kidnapping epidemic is once again rearing its ugly head in Colombia, with reports indicating a surge in abductions across the country in recent months. According to police data, there has been a 26% increase in reported cases of kidnappings this year compared to the same period last year.
The protest march was held under the banner of "Stop Kidnapping in Colombia," with angry participants chanting slogans and holding up banners calling for the government to act decisively to end the scourge. Families of those who have been kidnapped or killed by guerrilla groups, drug traffickers, and paramilitaries were particularly vocal, breaking down in tears as they remembered their loved ones who had fallen victim to the criminals.
"I'm here for my son, who was kidnapped by guerrillas four years ago and is nowhere to be found," said Lorena Martinez, who travelled from the eastern province of Meta to attend the march. "We want the government to do something so that no more families have to suffer like we did."
The marchers demanded accountability from the government, asking for more resources to be directed towards combating the kidnapping menace. Some of the protesters went so far as to demand that the administration of President Ivan Duque step down and be replaced with leaders who could better handle the rising security challenges faced by the country.
Colombia has been grappling with a volatile security situation for decades, with paramilitary groups, left-wing guerrillas, and drug traffickers regularly engaging in violent conflict. The government has been trying to end this violence through a combination of dialogue, military action, and social investments, but progress has been slow and some regions still live under the shadow of uncertainty.
Observers say that the sudden increase in kidnappings could be a sign that some groups are trying to flex their muscles amidst the ongoing power struggles in the country. However, the marchers argue that political uncertainty should not be an excuse to inflict more pain on innocent citizens.
"Kidnapping is a heinous crime that must be punished severely," said Diana Marin, one of the organizers of the march. "We want the government to take this issue seriously and devote all resources necessary to dismantle the groups responsible."
The protest organizers say that they plan to continue their demonstrations until the government announces a concrete plan of action to tackle the kidnapping epidemic and other security challenges in the country. Until then, they vow to keep pushing the authorities to do more to protect the innocent citizens of Colombia.
