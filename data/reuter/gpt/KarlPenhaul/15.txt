A former German secret agent and his wife have been charged with abduction in a failed kidnap rescue mission in Colombia. The duo allegedly tried to rescue a businessman who had been abducted by a criminal gang in the South American country.
The former agent, who has not been named, reportedly flew to Colombia with his wife after hearing about the businessman's abduction. He had previously worked for the German security services and had experience in overseas operations.
According to reports, the couple hired local informants to gather intelligence on the gang's whereabouts before embarking on a mission to rescue the businessman. They allegedly arrived at the gang's hideout in the city of Cali, armed with guns and handcuffs.
However, the mission quickly went awry when the agent and his wife were discovered by the gang members. Shots were fired, and the couple was forced to flee the scene. The businessman was not rescued, and the gang members reportedly increased their demands for his release following the botched operation.
The former agent and his wife were eventually arrested by the Colombian authorities and charged with abduction, possession of firearms, and attempted coercion. If found guilty, they could face up to 20 years in prison.
The German government has confirmed that the former agent worked for its security services in the past but stated that he was not acting on behalf of the government in this instance. The government also stated that it does not support vigilante justice or extrajudicial actions.
The case has raised concerns about the use of private citizens in overseas rescue operations and the potential risks involved. The German authorities have urged citizens not to take matters into their own hands and to cooperate with the relevant authorities when faced with similar situations.
The businessman who was abducted has since been rescued by the Colombian authorities. He reportedly suffered minor injuries during his captivity but is said to be recovering well.
The case has attracted significant media attention in Germany and beyond, with many questioning the motives of the former agent and his wife. The duo has yet to make a public statement on the matter. The trial is expected to begin in the coming months.
