Bogotá, Colombia- The Colombian oil sector saw a significant shift today as the Oil Workers' Union announced their merger with three other labor unions, including the Colombian Mining Workers' Union, to form the Industry-Wide Front. The new organization aims to target the non-unionized workforce and foreign companies operating in the country.
"The creation of the Industry-Wide Front is a critical turning point in the history of labor rights in Colombia," said José Altamiranda, the newly appointed President of the Industry-Wide Front. "Our goal is simple: to unite all workers in the oil, mining, and energy industry behind a common cause. We will fight for better wages, safer working conditions, and the right to organize."
Currently, only around 20% of Colombia's oil and gas workforce is unionized. The industry, which accounts for over 7% of Colombia's GDP, has long been dominated by foreign companies, including the likes of ExxonMobil, BP, and Shell. These companies have often come under fire for their treatment of workers and the impact of their operations on local communities and the environment.
"We cannot allow foreign companies to come into our country and exploit our natural resources without giving back to the local community," Altamiranda continued. "We need to ensure that workers are given a fair share of the profits generated by these companies, and that the environment is protected."
The move was welcomed by other labor unions across the country, who see it as a positive step towards greater solidarity among workers. "The Industry-Wide Front is a symbol of hope for all workers in Colombia," said Luis Eladio Arango, the Secretary-General of the Colombian General Workers' Union. "We stand in solidarity with our colleagues in the oil, mining, and energy sectors and will support them in their fight for better working conditions and fair treatment."
The creation of the Industry-Wide Front comes at a crucial time for Colombia, which has seen a rise in political and social unrest in recent years. The country has also been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many workers in the oil and gas sector losing their jobs or facing reduced hours.
"We are living through tough times, but the Industry-Wide Front is proof that we can come together as workers, demand better conditions, and build a better future for ourselves and for our country," Altamiranda said. "We are stronger together, and we will not stop fighting until every worker in Colombia is treated with the respect and dignity they deserve."
