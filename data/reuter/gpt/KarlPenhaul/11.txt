The International Coffee Organization (ICO) predicts that the trend of just-in-time roasting and inventory cuts will sweep consumer countries, leading to a rise in financial risk management.
Just-in-time roasting, also known as on-demand roasting, is a method of roasting coffee beans only when there is sufficient demand. This helps reduce the amount of excess inventory and waste, and enables vendors to serve fresh coffee to customers.
Inventory cuts, on the other hand, involve reducing the amount of stock on hand to lower the overall cost of maintaining the inventory.
The trend towards just-in-time roasting and inventory cuts is gaining momentum as consumers continue to demand fresher and more sustainable products.
According to the ICO, consumer countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom are increasingly adopting these practices, which are changing the traditional coffee supply chain.
With this shift, the ICO warns that there will be a greater need for financial risk management, as the demand for coffee will become more unpredictable.
"The traditional coffee supply chain involved long-term contracts and regular deliveries of coffee beans," said Jose Sette, the ICO's Executive Director. "But with just-in-time roasting and inventory cuts, vendors will need to be more agile in their procurement and ensure they have enough coffee to meet demand."
This shift towards on-demand roasting will challenge the traditional supply chain by requiring more flexibility and faster response times from coffee traders and producers.
"The supply chain will need to shift towards a more agile model," said Sette. "This will require better coordination between all stakeholders from coffee growers to retailers."
To mitigate financial risks in this new model, coffee traders and producers will need to consider developing hedging strategies and risk management tools. This could include futures contracts, which set a fixed price and date for delivery of coffee, or options contracts, which provide the right but not the obligation to purchase coffee at a specific price.
"Investing in financial risk management tools can help coffee traders and producers mitigate the risks associated with on-demand roasting," said Sette. "This can help them ensure they have enough coffee to meet demand while minimizing financial exposure."
One example of a company that has successfully implemented just-in-time roasting and inventory cuts is the American coffee chain, Starbucks.
In 2017, Starbucks launched its "Roasteries" initiative, which involves the construction of large, immersive coffee roasting and retail spaces around the world. These roasteries feature on-demand roasting, allowing customers to experience coffee at its freshest.
Starbucks has also implemented inventory cuts through the use of its mobile ordering and payment app. By enabling customers to pre-order and pay for their drinks, Starbucks can anticipate demand and reduce waste.
The success of Starbucks' Roasteries initiative has inspired other coffee chains to adopt similar practices, further driving the trend towards just-in-time roasting and inventory cuts.
As the coffee industry continues to evolve, financial risk management will play an increasingly important role in ensuring the stability and sustainability of coffee supply chains. Producers and traders will need to adapt to these changes and develop new strategies to manage the financial risks associated with on-demand roasting and inventory cuts.
