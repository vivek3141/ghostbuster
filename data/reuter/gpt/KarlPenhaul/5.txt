Colombia, the South American country, is under immense pressure to arrange a deal with the US to extradite drug lords who have caused chaos and havoc in the streets over the past few years. The entire world is looking at the Colombian government to show results and lead the charge against the drug trade.
The extradition treaty between Colombia and the US was active until 2013 when Colombia’s Constitutional Court ruled it unconstitutional. The decision allowed Colombian officials to prosecute drug lords in their country, rather than extraditing them to the US.
The Colombian authorities have been facing international criticism since the ruling, especially following the recent rise in drug-related crimes in the country. Critics argue that the decision has fueled a surge in cocaine production and caused significant concerns about narco-terrorism.
The US government has played an instrumental role in the Colombian government’s fight against drugs. They are disappointed with the country’s recent decision and have been pressuring Colombian authorities to reinstate the extradition treaty signed in 1979. If restored, the treaty would allow Colombia to extradite accused drug lords to the US and prosecute them for their crimes.
In 2020, the country produced an estimated 1,500 metric tons of cocaine. In comparison, Afghanistan and Myanmar, which are notorious for producing massive quantities of illicit drugs, produced only a few hundred metric tons of opium and methamphetamines, respectively.
Narco-traffickers use many tactics to smuggle drugs, including through port cities and other travel routes, such as flights and ships. However, in recent years, the industry has seen an uptick in smaller shipments through land routes to Central America. In addition, in some parts of the country, narco-terrorism has exploded, with illegal armed actors seeking control of vast territories that form part of illegal economies like narcotics or illegal mining.
The demand for cocaine has been fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, as more people are turning to drugs as a means of coping with the challenges of isolation, anxiety, and depression.
The Colombian government has recognized the importance of restoring the treaty with the US and has been working with its Supreme Court to find a workable solution. The country’s need to show that it is serious about tackling the drug trade cannot be understated, and the international pressure is unlikely to relent anytime soon.
There is some hope that the country could soon reinstate the treaty, with many politicians promising its restoration if they win the upcoming elections. However, it is a complicated issue, and the government must balance national sovereignty and the need for international cooperation to eradicate the drug trade.
The world is watching Colombia, and it must act urgently to address the problem, reinstate the extradition treaty with the US, and bring all drug lords to justice. Failure to act could lead to irreparable damage to the country's image as well as to the economic and social stability of the country.
