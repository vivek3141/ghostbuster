The Colombian government is reportedly considering bypassing the country's congress to pass stricter anti-drug laws. According to sources within the government, President Ivan Duque is said to be frustrated with the slow progress of lawmakers in passing legislation aimed at curbing the country's rampant drug trade.
Under current laws, drug trafficking carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison. However, the government believes that this punishment is not severe enough to deter drug lords and their operatives from continuing their illicit activities.
To address this issue, President Duque has reportedly instructed his ministers to explore the development of presidential decrees that would create new anti-drug measures. Such decrees would bypass the need for congressional approval and could be enacted immediately.
Critics of the move argue that bypassing congress could undermine democracy and give too much power to the executive branch. However, supporters of the measure claim that it is necessary to prevent drug traffickers from further undermining the stability of the country.
Drug trafficking has long been a problem in Colombia, with the country supplying the majority of the world's cocaine. While the government has made some progress in reducing the influence of drug lords, the trade remains a significant threat to the country's security.
President Duque has made tackling the trade a key focus of his administration, but his efforts have been hampered by political gridlock. The country's congress has been frequently mired in disputes and lawmakers have been slow to pass new laws.
The president's proposed decrees would focus on increasing the penalties for drug trafficking, as well as giving law enforcement more power to investigate and prosecute those involved in the trade. The government has also suggested that it could increase the use of military force to combat drug trafficking in areas where it is most prevalent.
The move to bypass congress has been met with mixed reactions from the public. While many Colombians are frustrated with the slow pace of progress in passing anti-drug laws, some worry that the proposed measures could give the government too much power and could be used to suppress political dissent.
It remains unclear whether President Duque will proceed with the proposed decrees or whether he will continue to work within the existing legislative process. However, one thing is clear: Colombia's fight against drug trafficking will remain a key issue for the foreseeable future.
