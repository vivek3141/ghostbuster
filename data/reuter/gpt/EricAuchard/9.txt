Santa Clara, California – Intel Corporation announced its quarterly earnings report on Thursday, exceeding Wall Street expectations and lifting its stock by more than 5%. The technology company has confirmed its status as a shooting star and remains a top pick in the tech sector.
The quarterly earnings report showed that Intel Corp generated a net income of $5.1 billion, or $1.11 per share, for the second quarter. This exceeded the analysts’ expectations of $1.08 per share, according to Refinitiv data. The company's revenue also rose by more than 1% to $19.6 billion beating Wall Street’s forecast of $17.8 billion.
"We achieved another outstanding quarter, surpassing $10 billion in revenue for the Data Center Group on continued strength in cloud and enterprise adoption," said Bob Swan, the Chief Executive Officer of Intel Corporation.
The data center group is Intel’s major revenue generator, accounting for roughly a third of the company's total revenue. Strong demand for cloud computing and enterprise spending helped the company beat expectations, despite the slowing demand for personal computers and a pandemic-driven economic slowdown.
Intel's data-centric strategy in the technology sector has been paying off, with the company earning a reputation as a dominant player in data center technology. The company reported more than $10 billion in revenue from its data center business throughout the quarter, up from the previous year's $7.1 billion, a staggering growth of 34%.
The coronavirus pandemic has affected the world's economy drastically, as many companies have been forced to cut costs and reduce staff. Intel had initially warned in April that it might miss its profit targets due to the pandemic’s impact on demand. However, the company's profit was boosted by high demand for personal computer components and shift to remote work that has increased the demand for cloud computing and data center solutions.
Intel's share price has been on the rise since the beginning of the year, gaining more than 23% year-to-date, recently reaching a 52-week high of $64.45. The recent earnings report has further powered Intel's stock, with shares trading at $59.18, up by more than 5%.
The company announced that it expects its third-quarter revenue to reach $18.2 billion, beating the analysts’ forecast of $17.9 billion. Intel's management remains optimistic about the future, noting the demand in cloud computing and enterprise platforms, as well as 5G technology, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning trends.
Intel's quarterly report has confirmed its status as a shooting star, with analysts impressed by the company's performance despite facing the unprecedented challenges this year. The report showed that Intel's steadfast focus on the data-centric business has paid off, cementing its position as a top pick in the tech sector.
