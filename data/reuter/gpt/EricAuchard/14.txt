The deal is also expected to have a positive impact on MCI's financial performance in the coming years. According to a statement released by the company, the deal is expected to generate $1 billion in incremental revenue by 2025, as well as provide significant cost savings through optimized network utilization.
"We expect this deal to be accretive to earnings and free cash flow in the short- and long-term," said Dubois. "We believe that it will enable us to generate significant value for our shareholders while also positioning us for long-term growth."
Overall, the MCI-NextWave deal is a testament to the growing importance of wireless communication in the US telecommunications market. As more and more companies recognize the value of wireless networks in conducting business, deals like this one will become increasingly important for companies looking to stay ahead of the curve in the evolving telecommunications landscape.
