AOL announced its new strategy to become a mass media company on Tuesday, February 26, along with a number of other major changes. These include introducing flat-rate internet pricing and hiring Robert Pittman as the head of their online service.
As AOL announced this new direction, they made it very clear that they intend to become a powerful and influential player in the media world. To accomplish this, AOL will be shifting its focus from being a subscription-based internet service provider to creating and distributing high-quality content across multiple platforms.
In order to compete with other mass media companies like Netflix and Amazon, AOL is investing heavily in its original content and multimedia capabilities. The company has also formed strategic partnerships with other major media corporations, such as NBC Universal and Twentieth Century Fox, to help them expand their reach.
But the most significant change that AOL has made is the introduction of flat-rate internet pricing. This move is aimed at making their service more accessible and affordable for the average consumer.
According to Tim Armstrong, the CEO of AOL, they are doing away with their old pricing model because it was "too confusing and too expensive." The new plan is much simpler, with just two options: a basic plan that costs $20 a month for up to 20 hours of internet usage, and a premium plan that costs $30 a month for unlimited usage.
This new pricing plan is a major shift for AOL, which has historically charged by the hour for its dial-up internet service. But as the world has moved towards more high-speed and always-on internet connections, AOL has had to adapt. With this new flat-rate pricing model, AOL hopes to attract a wider range of customers, including those who may have previously shied away from the service due to high and complicated pricing.
The final major change that AOL has made is the hiring of Robert Pittman as the head of their online service. Pittman has an impressive background in media, having previously served as the CEO of both MTV Networks and Clear Channel Communications. His expertise in both traditional and digital media will be a huge asset to AOL as they continue to navigate their new focus on becoming a mass media company.
Pittman's appointment comes at a critical time for AOL, as the company tries to expand its reach and presence in the media world. According to Armstrong, Pittman will play a key role in helping AOL to "create and distribute the best possible content for our consumers." With his experience and expertise, Pittman is expected to bring a lot to the table in terms of creative leadership and strategic planning.
Overall, the changes that AOL has made are a clear signal of the company's ambition to become a major player in the media world. By shifting their focus from subscriptions to content, and by introducing new pricing options and hiring fresh talent, the company is positioning itself for real success in the years to come.
However, it is important to note that this shift will not happen overnight. AOL will need to put in a lot of hard work and invest substantial resources if they wish to truly become a mass media company. But with these changes in place, they are certainly off to a strong start. We can expect to see continued growth and innovation from AOL in the months and years to come.
