Computer Associates, one of the leading software companies, has announced plans to shift its focus from mainframe software to PC-based mid-range software. This decision has caused concern among investors, causing the stock price to drop initially.
The company is planning to invest heavily in PC-based mid-range software, which is expected to be the growth driver for the company in the coming years. According to reports, the company plans to increase its resources in this area and will be looking for acquisitions to expand its portfolio of mid-range software offerings.
The CEO of Computer Associates, Mike Gregoire, said in a statement: "We believe that PC-based mid-range software represents a significant growth opportunity for Computer Associates. We plan to invest heavily in this area to benefit from the growing demand for these products."
This decision to shift focus from mainframe software to mid-range software has caused concern among investors who fear that the company may lose its position in the mainframe software market, which has been the company's bread and butter for many years.
According to industry experts, the mainframe software market is a mature market with limited growth potential. The shift to PC-based mid-range software is a strategic move by the company to tap into new growth opportunities.
However, the initial reaction of the investors was negative, with the stock price dropping by over 3% immediately after the announcement. The investors are worried that the company may not be able to successfully transition from mainframe software to mid-range software.
The company's future prospects will largely depend on the successful execution of this strategy. The company's management has a proven track record of successful acquisitions and integration of new businesses into its portfolio. Therefore, investors are hopeful that the company will be able to successfully execute this strategy.
In response to the concerns raised by investors, the CEO of Computer Associates said: "We are confident that our strategy to shift focus to PC-based mid-range software will prove successful. We have a solid track record of successful execution, and we will continue to focus on our customers' needs to drive growth."
The shift to PC-based mid-range software is part of the company's larger strategy to transform itself into a leading software provider in the digital era. The company has been making significant investments in cloud, security, and analytics to increase its relevance in today's digital world.
The company's management team has identified mid-range software as a key growth area due to the increasing demand for such products. According to reports, the market for mid-range software is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.5% over the next five years.
In conclusion, Computer Associates' decision to shift its focus to PC-based mid-range software is a strategic move to tap into new growth opportunities. While the initial reaction of investors was negative, the success of this strategy will largely depend on the execution by the company's management team. The company has a proven track record of successful execution, and investors are hopeful that the company will be able to successfully transition to this new growth area.
