Computer Associates International (CA) announced on Monday that it will be launching a new one-stop internet business unit that will provide corporate web hosting and management services to companies worldwide. The move comes as companies look to digitize their operations and strengthen their online presence in today's highly competitive business environment.
The new business unit, called CA Hosted and Managed Services, will provide a comprehensive suite of services that include web hosting, website design and management, e-commerce solutions, and domain name registration. With this new offering, CA aims to help businesses reduce their IT infrastructure costs and simplify their operations by outsourcing their web hosting and management needs to a single vendor.
"We see a tremendous opportunity in the market for companies that are looking to digitize their operations and expand their online presence," said Michael Christenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of CA. "By launching CA Hosted and Managed Services, we are positioning ourselves as a one-stop-shop for companies that need a reliable and efficient partner for their web hosting and management needs."
According to a recent report by the research firm Gartner, the global market for cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is expected to grow by 24% this year, reaching $81 billion. This trend reflects the growing preference among businesses to outsource their IT infrastructure needs to third-party vendors, rather than invest in their own hardware and software.
"With the shift to cloud-based infrastructure, businesses are looking for vendors that can provide a complete suite of services, from infrastructure to applications," said Christenson. "By offering a one-stop-shop for web hosting and management, we are positioning ourselves to be the vendor of choice for businesses that are seeking a comprehensive solution to their digital needs."
The new business unit will be led by Andrew Morrison, a veteran in the web hosting and management industry who previously served as Chief Technology Officer at Rackspace, a leading provider of managed hosting solutions. Morrison will be responsible for driving the growth of the CA Hosted and Managed Services business and for ensuring that the company delivers high-quality services to its customers.
"I am thrilled to be joining CA and to be leading the launch of this new business unit," said Morrison. "CA is a respected brand in the industry, and I believe that we have a unique opportunity to help businesses take advantage of the benefits of cloud-based infrastructure and to simplify their IT operations."
The launch of CA Hosted and Managed Services is part of the company's broader strategy to strengthen its presence in the cloud infrastructure market and to expand its offerings beyond traditional software solutions. In recent years, CA has acquired a number of companies in the cloud infrastructure space, including Automic, Veracode, and Xceedium, and has invested heavily in developing its own cloud-based products and services.
"Our goal is to be the leading provider of cloud infrastructure solutions for businesses worldwide," said Christenson. "With the launch of CA Hosted and Managed Services, we are taking a major step toward achieving that goal and delivering value to our customers."
