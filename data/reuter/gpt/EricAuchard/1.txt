Computer Associates announced a $1.2 billion move to acquire Cheyenne Software, marking one of the most significant investments within the technology space this year. The blockbuster deal aims to extend Computer Associates’ reach within the high-growth data management and storage markets.
Cheyenne is among the immediate rising stars in the data management space, driven by its backup and know-how solutions. The acquisition will provide Computer Associates with increased ability in developing software systems for information and storage management within companies worldwide. The move fits perfectly with Computer Associates' strategy of acquiring innovative, disruptive entities to augment its product offerings.
The investment is expected to result in significant growth opportunities for Computer Associates, as well as Cheyenne's shareholders and clients. According to Merrill Lynch analysts, the investment will generate an annual return of 45% for Computer Associates, well ahead of the company's current average.
"The acquisition of Cheyenne further strengthens our process-driven enterprise solutions focus and expands our direct sales and distribution capabilities, in addition to providing an immediate broadened family of products for our customers," said Charles Wang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Computer Associates.
A company spokesperson says that both Cheyenne and Computer Associates staff and customers will enjoy significant benefits from the acquisition. The employees of Cheyenne will benefit from Computer Associates' resources and expertise, which augments and develops their innovative product offerings.
The acquisition marks another step towards a consolidation of the data management software industry. Cheyenne is the third storage company to be acquired by Computer Associates in the past year, following in the footsteps of Sterling Software, and Platinum Technology. The three companies were acquired within twelve months at a total cost of $12 billion. The data management industry, furthermore, has recently seen a tremendous spike in demand for cloud computing and data analytics. The growth of computing has resulted in a considerable increase in the need for data storage, recovery, and analysis capabilities.
Going forward, the merging of Cheyenne with Computer Associates is set to provide users with an extensive range of hardware and software modules to allow for more extensive management of network systems and applications offered by the two firms. This expansion of the product range may enable corporations to minimize their overhead costs through consolidating computing requirements, as well as reducing time and operational expenditure.
The purchase agreement is in the form of stock, the price to be determined by the level of Computer Associates' market capitalization over the three-month period preceding the announcement. The deal will be concluded before the end of the year subject to the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Cheyenne Software's shareholders.
The acquisition represents a significant shift for Computer Associates and the industry as a whole. With the ever-increasing need for data storage and management, the deal with Cheyenne is set to further strengthen Computer Associates’ hold over the market, as well as signify major changes within the sector.
