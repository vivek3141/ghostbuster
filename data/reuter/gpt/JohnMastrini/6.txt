Prague, Czech Republic - The former president of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel, has strongly condemned the 11-year prison sentence passed on Chinese dissident Wang Dan. Havel, who himself spent years in jail as a political prisoner before leading the overthrow of communism in Czechoslovakia, called the verdict "a gross violation of human rights and a blatant suppression of dissent".
Wang Dan, a prominent student leader during the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, was arrested last year for his support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. He was charged with "inciting subversion of state power" - a common charge used by the Chinese government against political dissidents - and sentenced to prison by a court in Shanghai.
Havel, who was a vocal critic of China's human rights record during his presidency, said that the sentence was "an affront to anyone who values freedom of expression and political dissent". He called on the international community to condemn China's actions and to pressure the Chinese government to release Wang Dan and other political prisoners.
"Civil society and the rule of law are fundamental to any democratic society. The Chinese government must respect these values and stop its persecution of human rights defenders," Havel said in a statement.
Wang Dan's case has drawn international attention and criticism, with many human rights groups and foreign governments calling for his release. The European Union has also expressed concern about his sentence, calling it "a grave violation of human rights".
Amnesty International has called Wang Dan a "prisoner of conscience" and said that his prosecution was "politically motivated". The organization has also called on China to release all political prisoners and to respect the rights of its citizens to free expression and peaceful protest.
China has defended its actions, saying that it is "strongly opposed to any interference in its internal affairs". The Chinese government has also accused Wang Dan of being a "separatist" and a "threat to national security".
Havel said that such accusations were "outrageous" and that Wang Dan was simply exercising his right to free expression. "Wang Dan is a peaceful activist who stands for democracy and human rights. He should be celebrated, not punished for his views," Havel said.
Havel's condemnation of the verdict is seen by many as a powerful statement of solidarity with political dissidents in China and around the world. It is also a reminder of the universal principles of freedom and democracy that he championed throughout his life and that continue to inspire people across the globe.
