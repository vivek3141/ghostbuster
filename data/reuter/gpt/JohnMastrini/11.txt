Czech inflation slowed to 8.7 percent in October, in line with expectations, according to data published by the Czech Statistics Office on Tuesday.
Inflation eased from 9.4 percent in September as food price growth moderated. Prices of vegetables and fruit grew at a slower pace, while meat prices fell slightly.
The moderation in price growth was also helped by a slight appreciation of the Czech crown against the euro.
"The inflation rate in October 2021 was affected by a slowdown of food price growth, a slight appreciation of the Czech crown, and increased base effects," the statistics office said in a statement.
Although inflation moderated, it remains well above the Czech National Bank's target range of 2 percent, with some economists predicting that it could reach 10 percent by the end of the year.
The central bank has raised interest rates by a total of 200 basis points to 1.25 percent since August to combat inflationary pressures, and is expected to raise rates further when it meets on 16 December. Czech policymakers have repeatedly stated that they will do whatever it takes to bring inflation under control.
"The inflation outlook is still unclear, but the central bank will continue to use monetary policy to contain inflationary pressures," said Petr Zahradník, head of macroeconomics at ING in Prague.
Despite the high inflation rate, the Czech economy has been performing well, with GDP growth expected to reach 5.5 percent this year, one of the highest rates in the European Union.
"The Czech economy is proving to be very resilient despite the inflationary pressures. The current account surplus remains large, and exports have been holding up well," said Zahradník.
The rise in inflation has also impacted consumers, particularly those on low incomes, as the cost of basic goods and services has risen sharply. The government has introduced measures to mitigate the impact of inflation on vulnerable households, including subsidies for heating and energy bills.
In response to the inflationary pressures, some Czech businesses have also raised prices, including food retailers, who have been accused of profiteering from the pandemic.
Despite the challenges posed by inflation, Czech policymakers remain optimistic about the country's economic prospects, with the central bank predicting that inflation will fall to around 2.5 percent by the end of 2023.
"Our economy is well-positioned to weather the inflation storm, and we are confident that we can bring inflation under control while maintaining strong economic growth," said Czech Finance Minister, Alena Schillerová.
