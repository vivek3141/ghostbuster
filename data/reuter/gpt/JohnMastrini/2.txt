Manila, Philippines - The Czech company CKD has won a $200 million contract to supply modern trams to the Manila metro project in the Philippines. The contract was awarded by the Department of Transportation (DOTr), which aims to improve the public transport system by introducing new and eco-friendly trams.
CKD is a well-established manufacturer of modern trams, and its products are known for their high-quality, reliability, and safety features. The company has experience working with transportation projects in various cities, including Dubai, Warsaw, and Oslo.
Under the terms of the contract, CKD will manufacture and supply 30 modern trams to Manila. The vehicles will be equipped with air conditioning, CCTV cameras, GPS navigation, and other advanced features to ensure passenger comfort and safety. The trams will also be designed to be environmentally friendly, with low noise levels and reduced carbon emissions.
The Manila metro project is an ambitious initiative aimed at improving the traffic situation in the city, which is known for its heavy congestion. The project includes the construction of new railway lines and the upgrading of the existing infrastructure to provide faster, more efficient, and reliable public transport services.
The new trams supplied by CKD will be used on Line 2 of the Manila Light Rail Transit System (LRT-2), which is currently undergoing an upgrade. The line stretches from Santolan Station in Marikina to Recto Station in Manila. The addition of the modern trams is expected to help increase the capacity of the line and reduce waiting times for passengers.
The DOTr expressed its satisfaction with the outcome of the bidding process and the selection of CKD as the supplier of the trams. "We are confident that this partnership with CKD will bring us closer to our goal of providing world-class, efficient, and sustainable public transport to our citizens," said DOTr Secretary Arthur Tugade.
The news of the contract award was also well-received by CKD's management. "We are honored to have been selected to supply modern trams for the Manila metro project," said CKD CEO Pavel Smetana. "We look forward to working closely with our local partners to ensure that the trams meet the highest standards of quality, comfort, and safety."
The delivery of the 30 trams is expected to begin in 2023 and be completed by 2024. The introduction of the new vehicles is expected to mark a significant milestone in the development of Manila's public transport system and provide a better commuting experience for its residents.
