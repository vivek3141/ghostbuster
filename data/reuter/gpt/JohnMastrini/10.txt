During a NATO meeting held in Brussels yesterday, Italy has expressed its support for the integration of Slovakia and Romania into the alliance as full members.
The Italian Defence Minister, Lorenzo Guerini, said that Italy had been advocating for the enlargement of NATO for a long time, and that Slovakia and Romania would make excellent allies. Guerini also emphasized the strategic importance of expanding NATO's presence in Eastern Europe to counterbalance the growing influence of Russia in the region.
The Italian minister's comments were echoed by several other NATO representatives, including the US Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin. Austin praised Slovakia and Romania for their contributions to NATO's operations and said that their full membership would strengthen the alliance's capabilities.
The integration of Slovakia and Romania into NATO has been a topic of discussion for some time, but it has not yet been finalized. Both countries have been working closely with NATO for years and have participated in many of the alliance's missions, including in Afghanistan and Kosovo.
In recent years, Russia's aggressive actions in Eastern Europe have prompted NATO to increase its presence in the region. Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia are already NATO members, and the addition of Slovakia and Romania would further strengthen the alliance's position.
However, there are still some concerns about the integration of these two countries. NATO's enlargement may provoke a negative reaction from Russia, which has already criticized the alliance's expansion in the region.
Moreover, the integration of Slovakia and Romania could also face opposition from some NATO members who are hesitant to take on new commitments and financial obligations.
Despite these challenges, Italy's advocacy for Slovakia and Romania's integration into the alliance appears to have gained some momentum at the Brussels meeting, suggesting that it could become a reality in the near future.
