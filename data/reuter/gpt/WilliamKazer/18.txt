China is buzzing with confidence as it assures the world that it is capable of repaying its huge foreign debts despite reaching $109.5 billion by the end of 2020. Experts say that this assurance is not unexpected since China has become one of the world's largest economies and has consistently experienced economic growth for decades.
Foreign debts have been a crucial source of investment for China, and many said that such a phenomenal accumulation of debt was inevitable. The expectations, however, had been that China would strengthen its policies to ensure that it could service its debts adequately.
As expected, China has devoted significant resources and determination into paying off its debts. Experts expect that the Chinese government will continue to focus on economic growth and the service of foreign debts, as it has for the last several years. And with China being one of the largest markets in the world, servicing its debts is crucial for its growth and the global economy.
In addition, the Chinese government has been proactive in ensuring financial stability at home and abroad. It has implemented strict regulations to control borrowing, which have helped to safeguard the Chinese economy from any unwanted financial turmoil.
China surpassed the US to become Europe's largest trading partner in 2020. Although China's economic growth slowed due to the pandemic, it is recovering at an impressive rate. The superpower is now among the fastest-growing economies globally, which has sparked tremendous confidence in its ability to repay its foreign debts.
Furthermore, China's confidence in its ability to repay its foreign debts is fueled by its impressive foreign investment. The country has a tremendous focus on infrastructure development and has invested heavily in foreign countries, including developing economies.
China also boasts of a massive foreign exchange reserve of over $3 trillion, which experts believe is a source of confidence for the country. This reserve provides stability for the government and reassures its creditors that it can service its debts even in tough times.
In conclusion, despite reaching $109.5 billion in foreign debts, China is confident in its ability to repay them. With its strong focus on economic growth and strict regulations to control borrowing, it is expected to continue servicing its debts adequately. China's massive foreign exchange reserve and proactive measures have also contributed to its ability to project confidence in its ability to repay its foreign debts.
