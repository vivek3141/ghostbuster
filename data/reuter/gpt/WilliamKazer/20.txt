China Vows to Conclude Probe of Disgraced Former Beijing Party Chief
Beijing, China â€“ The Communist Party of China (CPC) has pledged to conclude its investigation into Guo Jinlong, a former party chief of Beijing who was removed from his post in 2017 amid allegations of corruption.
According to state-run media, the CPC's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) announced on Tuesday that it had wrapped up its probe of Guo and would hand the case over to judicial authorities for further investigation and potential prosecution.
The news comes as part of the CPC's ongoing anti-corruption campaign, which has aimed to root out graft and misconduct among party officials at all levels.
Guo, who served as party chief of Beijing from 2012 until his removal in 2017, has been under investigation for several years over allegations of corruption and abuse of power.
At the time of his removal, Guo was accused of being linked to the disgraced former security chief Zhou Yongkang, who was subsequently sentenced to life in prison for corruption and other offenses.
While Guo has not been formally charged with any crimes, he has been subject to a range of disciplinary measures, including suspension from his position as a member of the National People's Congress.
Despite his troubles, Guo has maintained his innocence and insisted that he has not engaged in any illegal activities.
In a statement released on Tuesday, the CCDI said that its investigation had uncovered "serious violations of discipline and law" by Guo.
"Guo Jinlong has committed a series of violations of political discipline, organizational discipline, and anti-corruption laws," the CCDI said. "His actions have seriously harmed the interests of the party and the state."
The CCDI did not provide specific details of the allegations against Guo, but said that it had found evidence of "improper personal conduct" and "abuse of power."
The announcement of the investigation's completion comes amid a broader crackdown on corruption in China, which has seen hundreds of officials at all levels of government and party expelled or punished for wrongdoing.
The campaign, which has been led by President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012, has been described by analysts as the most sweeping effort to root out corruption in China's modern history.
Critics, however, have accused the campaign of being politically motivated and lacking transparency, with some observers suggesting that it has been used as a tool to eliminate potential rivals of Xi.
The CCDI's announcement did not specify what legal action, if any, would be taken against Guo following the conclusion of the investigation.
Under Chinese law, the maximum penalty for corruption is the death penalty, although this is reserved for the most serious cases and is rarely used.
More commonly, officials found guilty of corruption are sentenced to lengthy prison terms and are often stripped of their assets and positions.
The investigation into Guo is seen as an important test of the CPC's commitment to its anti-corruption campaign, which has been touted as a key pillar of the party's efforts to maintain its grip on power.
The party has said that it will continue to pursue corrupt officials "without mercy or leniency" in order to maintain its credibility and legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese public.
It remains to be seen what will become of Guo, but his case is likely to be closely watched by both China's political elite and the international community.
