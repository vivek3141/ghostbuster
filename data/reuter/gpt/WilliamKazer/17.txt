China's state-backed conglomerate CITIC Corp has disclosed its plans to shift its focus to the financial sector in a bid to increase its profit contribution to the company. The Beijing-based company has stated its goal of having 70% of its profit coming from financial services in the next few years.
CITIC Corp, which originally started out as an investment arm of the Chinese government and later diversified into various sectors such as energy, real estate, and infrastructure, has struggled to keep up with rising competition in recent years. In 2019, the group's total profit fell by 44%, causing major concerns for the company.
However, CITIC's current move to streamline its businesses and focus on improving its financial services could help the conglomerate reposition itself and overcome the difficulties it has been facing. The company has already made significant progress in the financial sector, with its two main arms, CITIC Securities and CITIC Bank, achieving phenomenal growth in recent years. 
CITIC Securities, the country's leading securities firm, reported a net profit of 24.5 billion yuan ($3.5 billion) in 2019. Its strong performance was mainly due to the steady increase in trading commissions, stable brokerage fees, and growth in asset management business. CITIC Bank, on the other hand, saw its net profit rise by 5.9% to 59.9 billion yuan ($8.5 billion) last year, thanks to higher retail banking revenue and interest income.
CITIC Corp's Chairman, Zhao Yiming, stated that the company's shift to the financial sector would involve a "three-step" process that includes streamlining its operations, investing in technology, and expanding its financial services. The company will also focus on innovation and the development of new fintech products to stay ahead of the competition.
The company plans to boost its wealth management business and expand its offering of asset management services for both individual and institutional clients. It is also looking to leverage its extensive network and expertise in China's real estate market to provide new mortgage products.
CITIC Corp's move to focus on the financial sector aligns with the Chinese government's push to create a more dynamic and efficient financial market and reduce the overreliance on traditional banks. The move also comes at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions in the global economy, leading investors to seek safe-haven assets and higher returns.
In conclusion, CITIC Corp's shift to the financial sector is aimed at addressing the challenges that the company has faced in recent years. The conglomerate's focus on innovation, expanding its financial services, and promoting digitization is expected to enhance its profitability, and provide new sources of revenue in the coming years. The move also aligns with China's ambition of creating a more dynamic and efficient financial market, which is well-positioned to weather future economic shocks.
