Beijing, China - The joint venture between Volkswagen AG, the largest car manufacturer in Europe, and China's state-owned First Automotive Works (FAW) has denied reports about its possible closure, despite headwinds from the ongoing trade war.
Recently, rumors surfaced that the German automaker's joint venture with FAW could be shut down for refusing to localize an electric car platform in China, which would make it harder for the company to compete with local rivals in the world's biggest auto market.
However, in a statement released on Monday, Volkswagen-FAW said that it was "untrue" that the alliance's partnership faced the possibility of being dissolved.
"The reports are totally groundless. The joint venture is operating actively and orderly as always," the statement said, adding that it would "continue its strategic partnership in China."
Despite a challenging year for automakers, Volkswagen-FAW is performing relatively well. The company said it sold 2.28 million vehicles in China from January to October this year, up 0.7% compared to the same period last year.
It is worth noting that Volkswagen is a leading automaker in China, having sold over four million cars there in 2018. The German car giant also has joint ventures with two other Chinese carmakers, SAIC Motor Corp and JAC Motors.
Nonetheless, the auto industry is facing intense competition in the world's second-largest economy, as local players such as BYD Co, Geely Automobile Holdings, and BAIC Motor continue to ramp up their production of electric vehicles.
To cope with the shifting market landscape, Volkswagen-FAW has been building local production capacities and developing its electric vehicle technology. The joint venture also said earlier this year that it would invest around $2.5 billion in the development of new energy vehicles, and set a sales goal of one million such vehicles annually by 2025.
Despite the ongoing trade war between China and the United States, Volkswagen-FAW's operations appear to be stable, with the company expressing optimism about its future prospects in the Chinese market.
"The joint venture will keep up with market changes and customer demand to bring more high-quality products to the Chinese market," the statement said.
