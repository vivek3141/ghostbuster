China’s economy has been feeling the strain of the ongoing trade war with the United States and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its domestic consumption. To counter the economic slowdown, the Chinese government is considering a range of stimulus measures to boost growth. However, the country’s central bank remains cautious about the potential risks of another debt-fueled spending spree.
On September 18, 2020, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) announced that it would leave its benchmark lending rate unchanged for the fifth consecutive month, signaling that it is in no rush to ease monetary policy. The decision came after a meeting of the bank’s monetary policy committee, which concluded that the current stance of the policy is appropriate to support growth and maintain financial stability.
The PBOC has already taken a series of steps to ease monetary conditions, including cutting the reserve requirement ratio for banks and injecting liquidity into the financial system. However, the bank has been cautious about lowering interest rates, which could make it more challenging to deal with high levels of corporate and local government debt.
Despite this caution, the Chinese government is reportedly considering new stimulus measures to boost the economy after GDP growth slumped to a record low of 6.8% in the first quarter of 2020. Measures under discussion include increased infrastructure spending, tax cuts, and subsidies for small businesses. However, the government is also wary of the risks of another debt-fueled spending spree and may take a more targeted approach to stimulus measures.
One option being discussed is a so-called “dual circulation” strategy, which aims to reduce reliance on exports and encourage domestic consumption by promoting innovation, technology, and self-sufficiency in key sectors. This approach could involve increased spending on research and development, vocational training programs, and measures to boost demand for high-end goods and services.
Another strategy could be to increase investment in “new infrastructure” projects, such as 5G networks, artificial intelligence, and renewable energy. This could create new jobs and boost productivity while also addressing long-term challenges such as environmental sustainability and digital transformation.
However, the success of any stimulus measures will depend on a range of factors, including the severity and duration of the ongoing pandemic and the effectiveness of policies to stimulate domestic demand and support businesses. In addition, the China-U.S. trade war remains a major risk to the country’s export-oriented economy, which has been hit by higher tariffs and reduced demand for Chinese goods.
Overall, China faces a delicate balancing act as it seeks to support growth while also avoiding a repeat of the debt-fueled spending binge of 2008-09. By taking a cautious and targeted approach to stimulus measures, the government hopes to steer the economy towards more sustainable and innovative growth in the years ahead.
