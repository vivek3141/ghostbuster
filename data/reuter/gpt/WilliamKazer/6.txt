In a recent development, China has urged its banks to extend credit lines to boost its exports, which were hit hard by the ongoing pandemic. A senior trade official of China, Liu Fuxue, revealed this call to banks to support the country's export-oriented economy.
China's exports had been declining since January 2020, when the novel coronavirus outbreak forced businesses to shut temporarily. While the situation has now improved and businesses have resumed operations, demand for China's exports has not yet recovered.
To cope with the situation, China is seeking to develop new trade channels and partnerships while also calling on its banks to step up their support for exporters. Liu Fuxue, a deputy head of the China International Trade Representative Office, urged banks to extend credit lines to support exporters and urged them to work with businesses to resolve any issues that arise.
"China's exporters are facing a tough time, and it's important that credit lines remain open to help them overcome these difficulties," said Liu Fuxue.
According to data released by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, China's exports to the United States, the European Union and Japan in 2020 fell by 5.6%, 4.9%, and 1.3% respectively. The country's total exports saw a decline of 1.8% in 2020.
Analysts believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on China's export-oriented economy, and it may take some time to recover. However, China's call to banks to extend credit lines to exporters may provide some support to businesses during this difficult time.
It remains to be seen if the banks respond to China's call for support. But if they do, it may provide a much-needed lifeline to the country's struggling exporters.
