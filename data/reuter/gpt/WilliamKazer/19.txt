China is planning to list more railway companies on its stock exchange and create a fund specifically aimed at attracting foreign investment, according to a recent announcement by a senior official.
Liu He, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and vice premier of the State Council, stated that the government is looking to further expand the country's railway industry and open it up to foreign investors.
"The railway sector is one of the key areas where China has made remarkable achievements, and there is still great potential for development," Liu said during a recent press conference in Beijing.
He added that the government is planning to introduce more railway-related firms to the stock market, in a bid to make it easier for investors to access these companies and further promote their growth.
Currently, China has several major railway firms listed on the stock exchange, including China Railway Group and China Railway Construction Corporation, both of which are listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
According to Liu, the government will focus on developing high-speed rail, urban rail transit, and railway infrastructure, as well as modernizing the railway freight transport system.
In addition, the government is also planning to establish a new fund that will be dedicated to attracting foreign investment into the country's railway sector. This fund will be managed by the China Railway Corporation and will be used to finance new projects and support the development of existing ones.
"Through the establishment of this fund, we hope to create more opportunities for foreign investment in China's railway industry and promote international cooperation in this field," Liu said.
China's railway sector has seen significant growth in recent years, with the country now having the world's longest high-speed rail network and the second-largest railway system in the world. The government has been investing heavily in the sector, with plans to spend more than $500 billion on rail infrastructure by 2025.
The move to list more railway companies and create a dedicated fund for foreign investment is part of a broader push by the Chinese government to further open up its economy to foreign investors.
China has been looking to attract more foreign investment into its economy in recent years as part of its efforts to shift towards a more consumption-driven growth model and reduce its dependence on exports.
Earlier this year, the government unveiled a new foreign investment law aimed at further opening up the country's economy and providing greater protection to foreign investors.
The law, which will come into effect on January 1, 2020, will streamline foreign investment procedures, improve transparency, and provide greater predictability for investors.
The move has been welcomed by foreign investors, who have called for greater access to China's market and a level playing field for all businesses operating in the country.
Overall, China's plans to list more railway companies and create a fund for foreign investment are likely to be seen as a positive development by foreign investors. However, the success of these initiatives will depend on a range of factors, including the quality of the projects being offered and the level of transparency and predictability of the investment environment.
