In recent years, China has been rapidly expanding its space capabilities by launching hundreds of satellites into orbit. However, multiple launch failures have occurred in the country, causing China to turn to Russia for help.
This, in turn, has benefited Russia's commercial space drive as China's setbacks have created new opportunities for Russian companies to step in and offer their services. With its proven track record of successful launches, Russia is well-positioned to capitalize on China's struggles.
One of the major recent setbacks for China was the failure of its Long March-5 rocket on July 2, 2017, which was intended to carry a large communications satellite into orbit. The failure led to delays in China's space program as well as increased costs.
China has turned to Russia for help in launching its satellites, and Russian companies have stepped up to meet the demand. One example is the launch of the Luch-5B satellite on November 28, 2017, which was carried out by the Russian Proton-M rocket.
Another example is the recent agreement between the China Great Wall Industry Corporation and Russia's Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center, which will see Russia launching China's communication satellites into orbit.
While China's setbacks have certainly presented opportunities for Russian companies, it is also worth noting that China remains a major player in the space industry. The country has set ambitious goals for its space program, including a plan to send a rover to Mars in 2020 and to establish a permanent space station by 2022.
Despite the setbacks, China is still investing heavily in its space program and will likely continue to do so in the coming years. As such, Russia's commercial space drive will have to continue to evolve if it hopes to remain competitive in the space industry.
Overall, China's setbacks have benefited Russia's commercial space drive by creating new opportunities for Russian companies. However, it remains to be seen how China's space program will continue to evolve and what role Russia will play in the industry moving forward.
