An International Monetary Fund (IMF) employee's prison sentence has been reduced following a visit to Beijing by French President Emmanuel Macron.
Christine Lagarde, the former head of the IMF, was found guilty of negligence in a French arbitration case involving state-owned bank Crédit Lyonnais and businessman Bernard Tapie in 2008. She was handed a suspended sentence of eight months in 2016.
However, her sentence was reduced on Friday to one year of probation following the intervention of Macron. According to a statement from the Elysée Palace, Macron had discussed the case with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to China last week.
"Lagarde's handling of the arbitration case was not acceptable and she has acknowledged her responsibility and apologized," the statement read. "However, the sentence handed down was disproportionate. President Macron has therefore requested clemency for her and this request has been granted by the French justice system."
Lagarde welcomed the decision, saying it would allow her to continue her work at the IMF without the distraction of a legal case hanging over her head.
"I am very grateful to President Macron for his support and to the French justice system for their consideration of my case," she said in a statement. "I will continue to serve the IMF to the best of my ability, which is my honor and duty."
Lagarde was appointed head of the IMF in 2011, becoming the first woman to hold the position. She was reappointed in 2016 for a second term, which is due to end in 2021.
The case against Lagarde stems from her time as French finance minister under President Nicolas Sarkozy. She was accused of negligence for allowing an arbitration panel to award Tapie €404 million ($453 million) in compensation for the disputed sale of sportswear maker Adidas.
Lagarde said she believed the panel's decision was the best outcome for the state. However, critics said the process was rigged in Tapie's favor, as he was a supporter of Sarkozy.
Tapie, who was also found guilty in the case, has been ordered to repay the compensation. He has denied any wrongdoing and is appealing the decision.
