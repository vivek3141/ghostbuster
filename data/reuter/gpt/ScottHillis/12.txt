Beijing – Despite a detente in bilateral trade tensions, Chinese officials issued a warning on Wednesday that more potential economic roadblocks loom between the world’s two largest economies.
The U.S. and China have been slowly warming their frosty relations, after a long trade war that saw the Trump administration slapping tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods. The Biden administration has backed off some of those, most recently in a proclamation lifting punitive tariffs on Canadian aluminum.
China’s Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Gao Feng, speaking at a routine press briefing, said both sides need to work together in order to create a fair and stable trading environment. “China and the US have different economic and social systems,” Feng said. “We shouldn’t want or expect to address every single issue within the scope of a single meeting or in a short while. The two sides should take realistic measures to prevent the escalation of trade friction.”
Feng noted that China has been following through with commitments made in the phase one agreement signed by China and the Trump administration last year, including increasing purchases of U.S. goods. The agreement saw China pledge to buy an additional $200 billion of American goods and services over two years.
But while China has made progress toward the agreement, other trade tensions continue to simmer. The U.S. and China also are at odds over the latter’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, its handling of Hong Kong and human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.
“We need to expand market access and mutually beneficial cooperation, and make cooperation the centerpiece of Sino-US economic and trade relations,” Feng said. “The two sides should jointly promote the healthy development of the global economy.”
Meanwhile, there are concerns that the ongoing trade tensions may escalate once again as China has unveiled a new five-year plan for economic and social development, which aims to reduce China’s reliance on the West, increase domestic consumption and build a self-sufficient technology ecosystem. This shift could limit foreign access to Chinese markets, which pose a problem for American firms.
Many observers believe that the Biden administration will continue some of the trade policies of its predecessor, as China currently sits under a cloud of sanctions that have only increased under Biden, including sanctions on Chinese companies that supply technology used to oppress Muslims in Xinjiang.
According to a joint report by the National Bureau of Statistics and the United Nations Development Programme, the value of U.S. trade with China has fallen by about 10% since 2018. However, some analysts predict that the Biden administration will still have to address outstanding issues in the U.S. relationship with China to avoid further escalation of tensions.
Whether China’s concerns will amount to anything substantive remains to be seen. However, officials in Beijing do want the world to know that they stand ready to confront any new barriers to trade or commerce with the US.
