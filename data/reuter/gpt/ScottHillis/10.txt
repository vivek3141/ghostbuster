In a move that is likely to add fuel to the already tense relationship between China and the Dalai Lama, Beijing has once again urged Tibetans to embrace atheism as a counter to what it calls the "reactionary" influence of the exiled spiritual leader.
According to the state-controlled media, China's State Administration for Religious Affairs has launched a campaign to promote atheism in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, home to the majority of Tibetans. The campaign was launched in response to the Dalai Lama's latest visit to the region, which was viewed by Beijing as an attempt to expand his influence over Tibetans.
China, which has long accused the Dalai Lama of fomenting separatism in Tibet, sees atheism as a key tool in curbing his influence. Officials have said that religion, particularly Tibetan Buddhism, has become a source of conflict in the region, and that atheism is the best way to promote stability and unity.
"In order to maintain social harmony and stability in Tibet, it is necessary to give full play to the positive role of atheism in guiding the masses," said a spokesman for the State Administration for Religious Affairs. "Atheism can help to eliminate superstition and backward thinking, which are the root causes of instability and division."
This is not the first time that China has tried to promote atheism in the region. In the 1950s and 1960s, during the early years of Communist rule, religion was suppressed and monasteries were destroyed. Thousands of Tibetan monks and nuns were killed, and many more were forced to flee the country.
However, in recent years, China has relaxed its stance somewhat, allowing for the practice of religion under government control. However, the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 and has since lived in exile in India, has been a persistent thorn in China's side, speaking out against Chinese rule in Tibet and calling for greater autonomy for the region.
The latest move by China is likely to add to the tension between the two sides, and it remains to be seen how Tibetans will respond to the campaign. While some may see atheism as a welcome alternative to the often-restrictive and sometimes-oppressive nature of religion under Chinese rule, others are likely to view it as an attempt to erode Tibetan culture and identity.
The Dalai Lama himself has dismissed China's efforts, saying that true stability in Tibet can only come about through respect for human rights and genuine dialogue.
"By promoting atheism, China is only trying to suppress the culture and identity of the Tibetan people," he said in a statement. "True stability will only come about when the rights of all Tibetans are respected, and they are given the freedom to practice their religion and preserve their culture."
Despite the Dalai Lama's calls for dialogue and reconciliation, relations between the two sides remain strained. China has accused the Dalai Lama of being a "splittist" and has refused to engage in any meaningful dialogue with him or his representatives. Meanwhile, the Dalai Lama and his supporters continue to call for greater autonomy for Tibet and for an end to what they see as Chinese oppression.
The latest move by China is likely to further entrench the two sides, and it remains to be seen whether the campaign to promote atheism will help to bring about the stability and unity that Beijing is hoping for, or whether it will only serve to deepen the divisions between Tibetans and the Chinese authorities.
