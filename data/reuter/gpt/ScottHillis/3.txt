In a surprise move, China has stepped back from its warning to Hong Kong regarding freedom of expression limits. The warning had been issued earlier this week, stating that pro-democracy protests and criticism of the government were forbidden. However, after a strong backlash from Hong Kong residents and international criticism, China seems to have reconsidered its stance.
The controversial warning, issued by the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, had sparked protests and denunciations from pro-democracy activists, politicians and media figures in Hong Kong. They accused China of trampling on the city's promised autonomy and freedoms under the "one country, two systems" framework.
Critics argued that the warning could be used to target pro-democracy protests, given the city's long-running anti-government demonstrations. The warning stated that the central government "will never tolerate any acts that challenge the central governmentâ€™s authority or the basic system of the country" and that Hong Kong "must strictly enforce national security laws."
However, on Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that "Hong Kong, as a highly autonomous region of China, has a special constitutional status," while highlighting that the National Security Law does protect freedom of expression.
"Regarding the expression of views by Hong Kong residents, as long as it does not violate the law, it is protected by the law," Lijian said. "At the same time, we also hope that all sectors in Hong Kong can respect and abide by the law, and jointly safeguard Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability."
The change in tone by China has been welcomed by most Hong Kong residents and activists, who have been calling for more respect of the city's autonomy and for the government to listen to their demands. The backlash against China's warning was swift and loud, with many denouncing the move as an attack on freedom of speech and the autonomy of Hong Kong.
"The warning came as a shock and a big blow to the freedom of expression, especially in a city where protests and criticism of the government are common," said a Hong Kong resident, who wished to remain anonymous. "It's good that China has realized its mistake and acknolwedged that the people of Hong Kong are entitled to their rights and freedoms."
Despite the climbdown by the Chinese government, many remain skeptical of the move and wary of how the National Security Law could be used in the future to curb dissent and pro-democracy movements.
"The fact is that the National Security Law has already severely curtailed freedom of expression and political participation in Hong Kong," said a pro-democracy activist. "This warning only confirms our worst fears that China is determined to suppress any challenges to its rule and maintain control over Hong Kong."
The National Security Law, which was imposed on Hong Kong by Beijing in June 2020, has been criticized by many as a tool to suppress dissent and opposition to the Chinese Communist Party. The law bans acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers, and has been used to arrest and detain dozens of activists and journalists.
In conclusion, the recent backtracking by China on its warning to Hong Kong on freedom of expression limits is a welcome development, but it remains to be seen how it will play out in practice. Critics of the National Security Law remain concerned about its impact on Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms, and fear that it will be used to suppress dissent and opposition in the future. For now, many Hong Kong residents and activists will continue to call for greater respect for the city's rights and freedoms, and for genuine democracy to be implemented.
