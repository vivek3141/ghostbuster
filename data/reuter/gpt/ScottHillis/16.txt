In a bid to take its basketball game to the next level, China has launched a new basketball league that features American coaches and players. The move signals China's growing interest in basketball and its ambition to challenge the dominance of the NBA globally.
The new league, called the Chinese Basketball Association-American League (CBAA), was launched on Monday in a grand ceremony in Beijing. It is a joint venture between the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and a consortium of American investors.
The CBAA will feature six teams, each with four American players and one American coach. The teams will play a 30-game season, with playoffs and a championship series to determine the victor.
The league has attracted a number of high-profile American players and coaches. Former NBA coaches Mike Brown and Kenyon Martin are among the coaches, while former NBA players Larry Sanders and Josh Smith are among the players.
The CBAA has also attracted interest from Chinese companies, which are eager to get involved in the league. Among the sponsors are tech giant Tencent and sports apparel company Li-Ning.
The launch of the CBAA comes at a time when basketball is experiencing a surge of interest in China. The country has become one of the largest markets for basketball outside of the United States, with millions of fans tuning in to watch NBA games.
The Chinese government has made it clear that it wants to develop its own basketball talent, and the CBAA is seen as a way to provide top-level competition for local players.
"The CBAA is an important step in China's basketball development," said CBA vice president Li Jinsheng. "We want to show that we can compete at the highest level, and we believe this league will help us do that."
The CBAA is expected to generate significant revenue for both American and Chinese investors, with ticket sales, TV coverage, and merchandising all potential sources of income.
Basketball fans around the world will be watching closely to see how the CBAA develops and whether it can challenge the dominance of the NBA.
