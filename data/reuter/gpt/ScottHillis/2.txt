On Monday, China's former President Jiang Zemin warned the nation's military personnel against the dangers of non-compliance, citing their "sacred duty" to obey their political masters, and stay loyal to the Communist Party.
Jiang's comments came during a speech delivered in Beijing during a special gathering of senior military officials. Jiang was commemorating the upcoming 60th anniversary of the founding of the PLA, or People's Liberation Army, during the civil war.
The retired leader urged soldiers at all levels to follow the central leadership, including People's Republic of China Central Military Commission, headed by the country's president, Xi Jinping.
"In the new period, the military must fully understand the importance of politics, always bear in mind the fundamental mission of the party and the people," Jiang stated.
"For the people's military, forever obeying the party's commands, being able to fight and win battles and being politically savvy are the most fundamental and critical qualifications soldiers should possess." Jiang further added.
China's military modernization and its rise as a global superpower have brought the PLA to the forefront of global discussions in recent years. President Xi has emphasized the need for the military to be more politically reliable and loyal to the party throughout his presidency.
Xi has streamlined the decision-making process of China's Central Military Commission by consolidating power, and has also championed the creation of the Joint Battle Command, responsible for directing China's armed forces.
As for Jiang, he enjoyed strong influence over China's political and military elite during his time as president. He is credited with revitalizing the PLA during the late 1990s and is considered a key figure in shaping China's position within the international community from the 1990s onwards.
Despite this, rumors of a lingering rift between Jiang and Xi Jinping have occasionally surfaced in Chinese media. However, Jiang's appearance and remarks on Monday suggest this tension is unlikely to escalate into more significant white rapids.
Media outlets in China have been marking the lead up to the 60th anniversary of the founding of the PLA with several articles, speeches, and events. A large military parade is expected to take place in Beijing on Tuesday.
Earlier, Jiang had praised China's military development over the years, calling it "remarkable" and a source of great pride.
"The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation could not be achieved without strong national defense. The great rejuvenation of the Chinese military could not be achieved without the development of the country's broader social system and economy," Jiang noted.
Military analysts point out that Jiang's speech not only serves as an endorsement of Xi's leadership, but also as a message to potential detractors within the military ranks.
"There's a significant effort underway to make the Chinese military a more professional and reliable force that upholds international norms and laws. This drive will not progress without a clear message that obedience to the party is non-negotiable," said Kenneth Allen, a China political analyst based in London.
"[Jiang's] speech serves as both a warning and a call to all soldiers that no one is above the Party's authority," added Allen.
Chinese leaders have always attached great importance to political conformity within the military, and Jiang's speech comes at a time when China's PLA is swiftly expanding and modernizing amidst a shifting global landscape.
China's military might is often seen as a formidable challenge for the US military. However, Jiang stressing political loyalty is a reminder that domestic development in China continues to take precedence.
