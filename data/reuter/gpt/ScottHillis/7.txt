In a sharp call for increased transparency in Chinese listed companies, a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official has urged China to adopt more open reporting practices, raising concerns over inadequate disclosure standards and the risks to foreign investors.
Echoing the concerns of many investors, Paul Hastings, director of the SEC’s Office of International Affairs, said that high-quality disclosure is particularly crucial for those investing across borders and this is something still lacking in many Chinese firms.
Addressing a conference in Beijing, Hastings urged China to adopt international standards, asserting that trustworthy financial information is fundamental to creating a sustainable and healthy capital market.
He expressed his concerns about the lack of transparency, requesting that China take a disciplined approach towards their financial disclosure practices, especially for cross-border investors who are particularly reliant on the accuracy of public information.
For years, the US has tried to get China to agree to its own demands for more transparency. However, Hastings’s call for China to adopt international standards is the latest sign of tension concerning one of the most contentious issues in the economic relationship between the US and China.
There has long been criticism among Western investors that Chinese public companies have opaque and inadequate accounting practices, which translates into a real risk for investors looking to do business in China.
Many have also expressed their concerns about the number of Chinese companies that are listed on US stock exchanges, pointing out that these companies may not be trustworthy in their reporting practices. This has led to increased interest in better regulation and oversight of Chinese investment.
But Hastings’s comments come at a time of heightened tension between the world’s two largest economies. The Trump administration has accused China of unfair trading practices and has imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese goods.
The US President has also issued executive orders aimed at limiting the amount of securities investments Chinese companies can make in US companies, which has fueled concern among international investors about the potential impact of this tension on foreign investment in China.
However, Hastings emphasized the importance of transparency in global capital markets, urging China to adopt international standards and best practices. This, he said, would help build trust with investors and create a sustainable environment for cross-border investments, which is essential for the continued growth of the global economy.
