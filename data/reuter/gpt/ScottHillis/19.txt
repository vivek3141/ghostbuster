In a prelude to the visit by former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to China, the Chinese government has criticized the U.S. decision to impose sanctions on Chinese textiles, saying that the move violates the principles of free trade and harms the interests of both countries.
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said that it "strongly opposes the U.S. unilateral sanctions on Chinese textiles, and reserves the right to take countermeasures." The statement added that "such acts will only damage the positive momentum of China-U.S. economic relations, and eventually harm the interests of both countries and their people."
The U.S. sanctions, which were announced last week, target six Chinese companies and an economic entity for allegedly using forced labor in the production of textiles and other products. The move came after the U.S. government blacklisted several Chinese firms in December for their alleged involvement in human rights abuses in Xinjiang, a Muslim-majority region in northwest China.
China has repeatedly denied allegations that it uses forced labor in Xinjiang, and has accused the U.S. of interfering in its internal affairs. The two countries have been locked in a bitter trade dispute since 2018, with both sides imposing tariffs on each other's goods worth billions of dollars.
Despite the latest tensions, Chinese officials have expressed hope that Christopher's visit will help improve the bilateral relationship. The former U.S. diplomat, who served as Secretary of State under President Bill Clinton, is scheduled to meet with Chinese officials in Beijing over the next few days.
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a press briefing on Tuesday that "we hope that relevant U.S. personnel can engage in constructive dialogue with China, and strengthen communication and coordination on issues of mutual concern." Zhao added that "we also hope that the U.S. side can respect China's sovereignty, security, and developmental interests, and stop interfering in China's internal affairs."
Christopher's visit comes amid concerns about the future of the U.S.-China relationship under the administration of President Joe Biden. While the Biden administration has signaled a more multilateral approach to foreign policy than his predecessor, Donald Trump, it has also pledged to hold China accountable for its alleged human rights abuses and unfair economic practices.
Christopher is not expected to hold high-level talks with Chinese leaders during his visit, but his trip is seen as a sign of the Biden administration's commitment to engaging with China on important issues. Analysts say that the visit could lay the groundwork for future negotiations between the two countries on trade, human rights, and issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite the current tensions, Chinese officials have expressed optimism about the future of the bilateral relationship. In his statement on Tuesday, the Commerce Ministry's spokesperson said that "China believes that as long as both sides can uphold the spirit of mutual respect, equality, and non-interference, and properly handle differences, China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation will have a bright future."
