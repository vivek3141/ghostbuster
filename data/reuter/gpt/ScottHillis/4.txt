Beijing, China - Exiled Chinese human rights activist, Chen Guangcheng, has spoken out against the decision to charge detained dissident Wang Dan with capital crimes. Wang Dan, one of the leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, was arrested in March 2021 and has been detained ever since.
Chen, who is known for his fight against forced abortions and who fled to the United States in 2012 after years of house arrest, released a statement expressing his concern over the charges against Wang Dan. According to Chen, Wang Dan had been charged with "endangering national security," which could result in a death penalty.
"Wang Dan is a man of courage and principle who has stood up for justice and freedom at great personal risk," Chen said. "He deserves to be recognized for his efforts, not punished for them."
Chen's statement comes amid a growing crackdown on dissidents in China, which has seen the country's government ramp up its efforts to suppress any voices of dissent. Several other high-profile figures have been arrested in recent months, including prominent businessman and government critic Ren Zhiqiang, who was sentenced to 18 years in prison for corruption and bribery.
In his statement, Chen also drew a comparison between Wang Dan and the famous Chinese pro-democracy activist, Liu Xiaobo, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 while serving a prison sentence. Liu Xiaobo died in 2017 while still in custody.
"We cannot let another Liu Xiaobo happen," Chen said. "Wang Dan must be allowed to speak his mind, without fear of retribution."
The charges against Wang Dan have also attracted criticism from outside China, with the European Union issuing a statement expressing concern over his detention and "arbitrary detention of other human rights defenders in China." The EU called for the release of Wang Dan and other detained activists "immediately and unconditionally."
The charges against Wang Dan come amid a heightened tension between China and the United States, which have been at odds over a range of issues, including trade, human rights, and the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. In recent weeks, the U.S. has stepped up its criticism of China's treatment of dissidents, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeting in defense of Wang Dan.
"We stand with Wang Dan and all those who fight for freedom and human rights in China," Pompeo wrote on Twitter.
Despite the mounting pressure, China has shown little sign of relenting in its crackdown on dissidents, as it continues to seek to exert control over all aspects of society. And as the country's leaders adopt an increasingly authoritarian approach, activists like Wang Dan find themselves at risk of being silenced forever.
"The Chinese government must be held accountable for its actions," Chen said. "We cannot let them get away with this."
