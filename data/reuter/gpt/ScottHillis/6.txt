The Colombian Foreign Minister, Claudia Blum, recently expressed her country's desire for closer cooperation with China in cracking down on the narcotics trade. Blum, who arrived in Beijing for a five-day official visit, said that Colombia is determined to work with the Asian giant to curb the production and trafficking of illicit drugs, considering the positive results that their partnership could achieve on the matter.
In a ceremony held at the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the Colombian Foreign Minister stated that "Colombia's commitment to fight drug trafficking with all its strength is the same as China's commitment to build a community with a shared future for mankind." She added that the challenge facing both countries is a significant one that can only be surmounted through togetherness and collaboration.
Blum's visit to China comes amid growing concerns over a surge in cocaine exports from the Andean nation to Asia, including China. The country intercepted the largest shipment of cocaine worth $37mn last year, 800kg of the drug, hidden in fruit boxes coming into China from Colombia.
China, on the other hand, has been stepping up its fight against the illegal drug trade. Chinese President Xi Jinping launched a nationwide campaign aimed at eliminating drug abuse in 2016, and Beijing has recently announced new measures to reinforce its crackdown on illegal drug production, trafficking and use.
Blum expressed Colombia's willingness to enhance information exchange and intelligence cooperation on drugs, strengthening their judicial cooperation and explore the possibility of joint operations against narcotics trafficking syndicates. She said that the two countries already share common ground in the drug war and could achieve more success in combating the drug menace.
In her talks with top Chinese officials, including State Councilor and Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, Blum emphasized the need to expand cooperation in culture, trade, education and sustainable development between the two countries.
The Colombian Foreign Minister concluded her visit to China by visiting the headquarters of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, where she discussed opportunities for cooperation between Colombia and Alibaba Group to boost exports from her country to China through e-commerce channels.
The Colombian Foreign Minister's visit to China is part of a larger strategy to attract foreign investment into Colombia and strengthen trade relationships with countries in the Asia-Pacific region. She believes that her visit to China will help secure and advance Colombia's interests in key areas, including drug control, trade, and investment.
With the growing concern over the narcotics trafficking crisis, countries must continue to work together to counter the threat posed by illicit drugs. China and Colombia's partnership on the matter will shed more light on tackling the illicit drug trade and its consequences, making both countries safer and prosperous.
