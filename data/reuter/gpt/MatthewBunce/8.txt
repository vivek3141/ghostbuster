Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, has managed to maintain steady shipments of cocoa from its major port in Abidjan despite the Covid-19 pandemic. Currently, the port maintains a stockpile of 90,000 tonnes of cocoa, according to the managing director of the cocoa and coffee council, Yves Kone.
Despite the fear of disruption to the cocoa industry due to the pandemic, business at Ivory Coast's major port remains relatively unaffected. In fact, government efforts to contain the virus have been impressive, and it has allowed the country to maintain its position as the world's leading exporter of cocoa.
The government has implemented strict transportation protocols for trucks entering and leaving the country in an effort to curb the spread of the virus without disrupting exports. Additionally, cocoa farms and processing plants have remained open and have continued to operate normally. This has ensured a continued flow of cocoa from the country to international markets.
The Ivory Coast's cocoa industry is a significant contributor to the country's economic growth and development. The country produces over 40% of the world's cocoa, and it is a crucial source of income for thousands of farmers and their communities.
Despite the current stable situation, the industry has faced challenges in the past, most notably the issue of child labor. The government has addressed this issue by implementing programs such as school enrollment campaigns and the provision of farming equipment to help reduce the responsibility of children on cocoa farms.
In conclusion, while many industries have been negatively impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, Ivory Coast's cocoa industry appears to be weathering the storm. The country's ability to maintain steady shipments and a substantial stockpile of cocoa is a testament to the government's effective response to the pandemic. As a result, the Ivory Coast's cocoa industry is well-positioned to continue to supply the global market with one of the world's favorite sweets.
