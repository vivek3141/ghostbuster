In a major decision, cocoa producers have reached a compromise on non-cocoa fats in chocolate in the European Union (EU) and other markets. The compromise was reached at the recently concluded International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) meeting in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
After years of debate, the ICCO has come to an agreement on the inclusion of non-cocoa fats in chocolate, which has long been a controversial issue among cocoa-producing countries. While some argued that non-cocoa fats damage chocolate’s quality and undermine the value of cocoa, others argued it was necessary as a replacement for expensive cocoa butter.
Under the new agreement, chocolate with up to 40% non-cocoa fats will be permissible in the EU, which is the largest chocolate market in the world. However, such chocolate products must be labeled as such, and it cannot be marketed as “chocolate” but rather as “chocolate substitute” or “chocolate-like product.”
This compromise has been accepted by cocoa-producing countries, including Ivory Coast, Ghana, and Cameroon. Commenting on the agreement, Ivory Coast’s representative at the ICCO meeting said, “We believe this is a fair and pragmatic agreement that balances the interests of both cocoa producers and chocolate makers.”
In addition to the EU, other markets that have agreed to the compromise include the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. However, China and Japan have still not accepted the new rules, both of which are significant markets for the chocolate industry.
The agreement also includes a clause that calls for an investigation into the impact of non-cocoa fats on the environment, farmers, chocolate quality, and consumers. The results of the study will be presented at the next ICCO meeting, to be held in two years.
The decision has been welcomed by the chocolate industry, which had been pushing for the inclusion of non-cocoa fats for a long time. The International Association of Chocolate Producers said in a statement, “This decision will provide greater flexibility for chocolate makers to produce high-quality products with consistent organoleptic properties.”
However, not everyone is pleased with the compromise. Cocoa advocacy groups and some chocolate makers have criticized the move, saying it devalues cocoa and creates confusion among consumers. Many believe that allowing non-cocoa fats will lead to cheaper chocolate products flooding the market, thereby hurting farmers who rely on cocoa for their livelihoods.
In conclusion, the decision to allow non-cocoa fats in chocolate has been a long time coming, and the new rules are likely to have a significant impact on the global chocolate industry. While the compromise may not have pleased everyone, it is a step towards resolving a long-standing controversy that has divided cocoa-producing countries and chocolate makers for years.
