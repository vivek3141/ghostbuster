Ivory Coast, the world's leading producer of cocoa, is also one of the largest coffee producers globally, and the industry has faced a lot of mixed fortunes over the years. Now, the industry is facing fresh uncertainties over returns as Caistab, the coffee regulatory board, implements market reforms.
Caistab, in a bid to tackle years of low prices for coffee in the country that has nearly killed the industry, has opted to permit direct exports to roasters, a move that has been lauded by many in the industry. However, this decision also means that the board will lose its current monopoly, leaving growers to determine their prices with roasters directly.
This move is likely to cause significant disruptions in the industry, as farmers struggle to navigate the rough waters of pricing and marketing, with the unpredictable global coffee market only adding to the uncertainties.
The chair of Caistab, Dr. Gervais Coulibaly, acknowledges that this is a significant transition, requiring that both growers and exporters adjust to the new dynamics. "We are witnessing the birth of a new era for coffee in Ivory Coast. However, it requires the full support and participation of everyone in the industry to succeed," he said.
The reforms present exciting opportunities for the coffee industry, including the chance for farmers to increase their earnings by selling directly to roasters while avoiding intermediaries and middlemen. That said, the move away from a board monopoly means that there will be no guarantee of minimum prices as in previous years.
There are also concerns that some farmers may undercut their prices, leading to a race to the bottom and low profitability for everyone involved. This is already happening in some regions, where some farmers and exporters are bypassing rules and regulations to offer beans at lower prices.
Fidele N'Zue Job, a senior coffee industry analyst, told reporters that the current situation would be challenging for many but highlighted that the new system might bring in some benefits in the long run. "In the short term, there will be disruptions. In the long term, farmers will have access to better markets, more price transparency and therefore possibly better prices, "he said.
To ensure a successful transition, Caistab has invested in capacity-building programs to empower farmers to negotiate better prices for their produce. The board has been training farmers on grading and quality control, and financial management while also working on introducing sustainable coffee farming practices.
The coffee industry in Ivory Coast is vital to the country's export earnings, and any changes made that negatively impact the sector could be disastrous. Therefore, all stakeholders in the industry must come together to ensure the reforms succeed without putting the livelihoods of farmers in jeopardy.
