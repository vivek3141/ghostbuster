Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, is expected to see a significant drop in cocoa output this year, with buyers down 30% from last year, according to experts. The country, which produces around 40% of the world's cocoa, has been hit by a combination of lower prices, poor weather conditions and a shortage of labor due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The country was predicting a bumper harvest of around 2.2 million tonnes of cocoa beans, up from last year's output of 2.1 million tonnes, which was itself a record high. However, experts have revised their forecasts downwards after a poor start to the season, with data from the National Cocoa and Coffee Council (CCF) showing that farmers had sold just 258,000 tonnes of cocoa beans by the end of November, compared with 292,000 tonnes during the same period last year.
"The situation this year is quite worrying," said Ramanou Bamba, a cocoa expert and consultant based in Ivory Coast. "The lack of rain in some areas has affected the development of the cocoa pods, while the COVID-19 pandemic has also affected the availability of labor."
Bamba added that the lower prices received by farmers for their cocoa beans had also dampened their enthusiasm to harvest, with many choosing to hold out for better prices later in the season. This has led to a shortage of ripe cocoa pods, which are necessary for processing into cocoa butter and powder.
"In some areas, farmers have decided to leave the cocoa pods on the trees for longer, hoping that the prices will improve later in the season," Bamba said. "This means that they are not picking the pods when they are fully ripe, which in turn affects the quality of the beans."
Another factor contributing to the drop in output has been the shortage of labor caused by the pandemic. Many migrant workers from neighboring countries such as Burkina Faso and Mali have been unable to cross the border due to COVID-19 restrictions, leaving farmers with fewer workers to harvest their crops.
"Farmers are finding it hard to get the labor they need, especially for the more labor-intensive tasks such as pruning and harvesting," Bamba said. "This is hampering their ability to produce high-quality cocoa beans."
The drop in output is a blow for Ivory Coast's cocoa industry, which is a major source of revenue for the country. Cocoa exports generate around 40% of the country's foreign exchange earnings, and the sector employs around 6 million people, many of whom are smallholder farmers.
The country has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused a slowdown in economic activity and led to a drop in demand for cocoa. The pandemic has also disrupted global supply chains, making it harder for exporters to transport their goods to overseas buyers.
Despite the challenges facing the industry, experts say that there are opportunities for growth in the sector, particularly in the area of value-added cocoa products. Ivory Coast has traditionally focused on exporting raw cocoa beans, but there is increasing demand for processed cocoa products such as cocoa butter, powder and chocolate from emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil.
"Ivory Coast has the potential to become a major player in the production of value-added cocoa products," said Jérôme Kouame, a cocoa trader based in Abidjan. "The country has a strong agricultural base, and there is growing interest among consumers for high-quality, sustainable cocoa products."
However, realizing this potential will require investment in infrastructure and technology, as well as increased cooperation between farmers, exporters and the government.
"The cocoa sector in Ivory Coast has a lot of potential, but there are also many challenges that need to be addressed," Bamba said. "Investment in infrastructure, technology and research is crucial to improving the productivity and quality of the cocoa sector, and fostering sustainable growth in the industry."
Despite the challenges facing the industry, farmers remain optimistic about the future of cocoa in Ivory Coast. Many believe that the sector has weathered many storms in the past and will continue to be a major provider of jobs and income for the country.
"Cocoa is a resilient crop, and farmers have learned to adapt to changing conditions over the years," said Jean-Baptiste Kouassi, a cocoa farmer from Bonoua, a town in southern Ivory Coast. "We are confident that with the right support and investment, the sector will continue to thrive in the years to come."
