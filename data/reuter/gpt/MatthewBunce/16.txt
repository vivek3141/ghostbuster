Abidjan, Ivory Coast - Ivory Coast cocoa shipments are estimated to reach around 120,000 tonnes by the end of November, an increase of nearly 7% compared to the same period last year. According to the Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC), the country has exported about 2.001 million tonnes of cocoa beans since the start of the 2020-2021 season, which began in October 2020.
The global demand for cocoa has been increasing, which has led to an increase in production and shipments from West African countries like Ivory Coast, which accounts for around a third of the world's cocoa production. This year's cocoa season in Ivory Coast is off to a good start, with reports of favourable weather conditions and high yields in many regions. 
The chairman of the CCC, Yves Brahima Koné, has said that cocoa farmers are doing their best to ensure high-quality production. Speaking about the increase in shipments, he said that it is a testament to the hard work of the country's farmers and to the government's efforts to boost production and improve the livelihoods of farmers.
"This increase in exports is a clear indication that the country's cocoa sector is thriving," said Koné. "Our farmers have worked hard to produce high-quality cocoa beans that meet the standards of international buyers. The government has also invested heavily in the sector, providing farmers with the necessary support to increase production and improve their income."
However, the Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on the sector, with border closures and transport disruptions causing delays and an increase in costs. The CCC has implemented measures to ensure the safety of farmers and workers, including the provision of masks and hand sanitizers, and the implementation of social distancing measures.
The demand for cocoa is expected to remain high in the coming years, due to the growing popularity of chocolate and other cocoa-based products. As the world's largest cocoa producer, Ivory Coast is well-positioned to take advantage of this trend and increase its exports.
The government of Ivory Coast has set an ambitious target of producing 2 million tonnes of cocoa by 2022. To achieve this goal, it has launched several initiatives to improve the sector, including the construction of new warehouses and the training of farmers in modern farming techniques.
In conclusion, the news of an increase in cocoa shipments from Ivory Coast is good news for the country's farmers and the cocoa industry as a whole. Ivory Coast's commitment to increasing production and improving the quality of its cocoa beans will ensure that it remains a key player in the global cocoa market.
