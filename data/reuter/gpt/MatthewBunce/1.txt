Abidjan, Ivory Coast - Donor sources and exporters have reported that revisions to the coffee and cocoa auction system in Ivory Coast are now awaiting approval from the government.
The coffee and cocoa sectors are the major contributors to the economy of Ivory Coast, with the country being the world's leading producer of cocoa. The previous auction system for these two commodities, which has been in place for over 50 years, has been criticized for its lack of transparency and efficiency.
The proposed revisions, which have been championed by both exporters and donor organizations, aim to address these issues and improve the competitiveness of the industries. The changes include introducing electronic trading platforms, better regulation of the grading process, and increasing access to information for farmers.
Exporters and donor organizations have hailed the proposed changes as a step towards improved efficiency and transparency in the industry.
According to the President of the National Federation of Coffee and Cocoa Exporters of Ivory Coast (FENACOVICI), Karamoko Bamba, the approval of the revisions would be a significant development for the industry. "This is a great initiative that will not only improve the competitiveness of our exports but will also increase revenues for our farmers," he said.
Despite the broad support for the revisions from industry stakeholders, there have been concerns raised over the potential impacts on smallholder farmers.
Critics argue that small farmers may be at a disadvantage in the new system, leading to the concentration of market power in the hands of large-scale producers. Some also suggest that the increased access to information for exporters could result in lower prices for farmers.
In response to these concerns, the government has stated that it will work to ensure that small farmers are not negatively impacted by the proposed changes.
"We are committed to ensuring that the interests of all stakeholders are taken into account," said the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Kobenan Kouassi Adjoumani. "We will consult with all parties involved to ensure that the new system is fair and equitable for all."
The revisions to the auction system have been years in the making, with the government seeking to improve the sector's performance in the face of rising competition from other countries. The changes have been supported by donor organizations such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank, which have provided funding for the project.
The proposed revisions were initially scheduled to be implemented by the end of 2019, but have been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other logistical challenges.
While the revisions have not yet been officially approved, industry stakeholders remain optimistic about their prospects for adoption. "We are hopeful that the government will see the value in these changes and give their approval soon," said Bamba.
In the meantime, exporters and farmers are continuing to face challenges in the sector, with the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic uncertainty leading to reduced demand for coffee and cocoa exports.
However, some have suggested that the proposed revisions could provide a much-needed boost for the industry, particularly in the long term.
"If these changes are implemented successfully, it could completely transform the coffee and cocoa sectors in Ivory Coast," said one industry expert. "It could help to position the country as a major player in the global market and contribute significantly to its economic development."
