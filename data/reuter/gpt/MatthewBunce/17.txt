The world's largest cocoa producer, Ivory Coast, has recorded a significant decrease in its cocoa arrivals for the 1996/97 season. When compared to the previous year, the country's cocoa arrivals have decreased by approximately 10 percent.
The decrease in cocoa arrivals comes as a surprise as analysts earlier predicted that production would show a significant increase. However, the country's harvest season, which began in October, has been plagued with delays and drier than expected weather conditions.
According to Reuters, the data from the country's marketing board - the Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC) - showed that cocoa arrivals had reached 1.24 million tonnes by January 31. This is a significant decline from last year's figures, which stood at 1.38 million tonnes for the same period.
Cocoa prices have also been affected by the decrease in production. Prices at the New York Stock Exchange are currently trading at $2,436 per tonne - a decrease of 13 percent since the beginning of the year.
Despite the decline in cocoa arrivals, the CCC has stated that it expects production to recover in the coming months. The marketing board attributes this to a possible change in weather conditions as well as an increase in farmgate prices.
Farmgate prices refer to the price at which farmers sell their cocoa beans to middlemen who then sell to the marketing board. The CCC has increased the farmgate price from 750 CFA francs ($1.28) per kilogram to 825 CFA francs ($1.41) per kilogram in a bid to encourage farmers to sell their beans to the board.
It is also anticipated that the country's cocoa arrivals will get a boost in February and March when the bulk of the season's crop is expected to arrive. The CCC's managing director, Yves Brahima Kone, confirmed this in a recent statement where he acknowledged the current lull in production but emphasized that "the volumes of cocoa to be exported over the rest of the season should be very satisfactory."
An increase in production would be welcomed news for the Ivorian government, which is heavily reliant on cocoa exports for foreign currency earnings. In 2019, cocoa accounted for 40 percent of the country's export earnings, with the government aiming to boost cocoa exports to two million tonnes by 2020.
The Ivorian government has implemented several measures to improve the yield and quality of cocoa, including the establishment of a cocoa regulator, the Cocoa and Coffee Council, which controls and oversees the country's cocoa sector.
There have also been efforts to improve the lives of cocoa farmers, who form the backbone of the industry. In 2018, the government set up the National Agricultural Insurance Fund, which provides insurance coverage for farmers in the case of adverse weather conditions or other emergencies such as pest outbreaks.
While the country's cocoa exports have suffered a setback this season, there is optimism that production will pick up in the coming months. However, with the unpredictability of weather patterns and ongoing issues with cocoa smuggling across the borders with Ghana and Burkina Faso, the country must continue to implement measures that will protect and support its vital cocoa sector.
