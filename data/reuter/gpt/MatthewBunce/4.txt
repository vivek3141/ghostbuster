The annual cocoa marketing season in Ivory Coast has started with an unchanged farm-gate price and a lowered export tax. However, the confusion arose due to the freight rates. 
The West African country, which is the world's largest producers of cocoa, has maintained the farm-gate price at 1,000 CFA francs ($1.74) per kilogram. The government has also reduced the export tax from 24% to 20% to incentivize producers amid demand for the Ivorian bean.
The Ivorian cocoa regulator, the Coffee and Cocoa Council, guaranteed farmers receive the same price as they did last season. Government officials said the move was aimed at supporting farmers, who were hit by drought and scammers in the past.
"Farmers received good prices last year. We need to keep them at the same level so they can continue their work efficiently," said Alain Richard Donwahi, chairman of the council.
Despite the price remaining unchanged, some Ivorian farmers are not happy. While the price of cocoa has increased globally, they believe the government should provide a boost to match up with the prices worldwide. They have called for an increase of at least 100 CFA francs.
"We believe the government is taking advantage of our silence to keep the price unchanged. The global market has improved; we want our government to do the same," said Gustave Kone, a cocoa farmer in the southeast.
Meanwhile, the government's move to lower the export tax from 24% to 20% aims to boost the country's cocoa exports amid increased global demand. Some traders have welcomed the move, saying it will help increase supply and improve access for local exporters.
However, the lowered tax comes amid a surge in freight rates, which have jumped over 40% since April due to a shortage of shipping containers and the pandemic. This has caused confusion among Ivorian exporters as shipping lines are demanding higher fees, which will offset the lowered tax.
"We are grateful for the lowered tax, but the freight rates are too high. We will be forced to pay more for transportation, which is not helpful," said Jean-Claude Kassi, a cocoa exporter in Abidjan.
The country is expecting to produce 2.3 million tonnes of cocoa in the 2021-2022 season, which started on Oct. 1. The government aims to export 85% of this crop. Ivory Coast is also hoping to benefit from Cote d'Ivoire's new electronic cocoa buying system, which will enable buyers to rapidly buy beans by pricemaking.
