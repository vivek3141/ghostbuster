Ivorian exporters are up in arms over the government's plan to hold them liable for income taxes owed by their upcountry buyers. The plan, which was announced by the Ivorian Revenue Service (IRS), has been met with fierce opposition from a united front of exporters.
The new policy requires exporters to obtain proof of tax payments from upcountry buyers before exporting goods. If the buyers fail to provide proof of payment, the exporter will be held liable for the unpaid tax.
According to the IRS, the new policy aims to improve tax compliance and reduce the amount of tax evasion by upcountry buyers.
However, exporters argue that the policy is unfair and will hurt the industry. They argue that they have no control over the tax compliance of upcountry buyers and should not be held responsible for their actions.
"Exporters are not tax collectors," said John Koffi, CEO of the Ivorian Cocoa Exporters Association. "Our job is to export goods, not to ensure tax compliance of upcountry buyers. It's not fair to hold us responsible for their actions."
The Ivorian government has been trying to improve tax collection in recent years, especially in the cocoa sector. Cocoa is one of the country's main exports and a major source of revenue. However, tax evasion is a widespread problem in the sector, especially among upcountry buyers who purchase cocoa from smallholder farmers.
The government's effort to improve tax compliance has been gaining traction in recent years, but the new policy has been met with resistance from exporters who fear it will hurt their business.
"Exporters are already struggling with a lot of challenges, including high transportation costs, delays at the ports, and low prices for their goods," said Koffi. "Adding this new burden on them is unfair and will make it even more difficult for them to do business."
Exporters are now calling on the government to reconsider the new policy and come up with a more equitable solution to the tax problem.
"We understand the government's need to improve tax compliance, but this policy is not the answer," said Koffi. "We need to work together to find a solution that is fair for everyone involved."
The Ivorian government has yet to respond to the exporters' demands. However, the issue is expected to be discussed further in the coming weeks as the government and exporters look for a way forward.
In the meantime, Ivorian exporters are hoping that the government will listen to their concerns and come up with a solution that is fair and equitable for all parties involved. They argue that their industry is crucial for the country's economy and should not be burdened with undue taxes and responsibilities.
"We want to work with the government to improve tax compliance, but not at the expense of our industry," said Koffi. "We hope that a solution can be found that benefits everyone involved."
