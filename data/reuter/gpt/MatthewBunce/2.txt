Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, is considering a small cut in cocoa freight rates for the 1996/97 shipping season. This move is set to cushion local exporters from rising costs, and to make the country's cocoa more competitive on the international market.
Ivory Coast's cocoa freight rates, which are set by the government, are among the highest in the world, costing shippers up to $80 per tonne. This has led to complaints from local exporters who say that high rates are making it difficult to compete with other cocoa exporting countries. Keeping these rates unchanged could also mean a significant loss in revenue for the country.
According to industry sources, the proposed cut would see freight rates fall to between $70 and $75 per tonne for the 1996/97 shipping season, down from the current rate of $80. It is believed that the decision to cut rates was influenced by a recent drop in global cocoa prices, which has led to concerns about the country's cocoa exports.
This move comes as cocoa prices have hit a five-year low. In September, cocoa futures fell to $1,946 per tonne in London, its lowest level since late 2013. This has led to a number of concerns in the cocoa-producing regions of West Africa, with many farmers struggling to make a living. Lower cocoa freight rates could help to alleviate some of these concerns by increasing the competitiveness of Ivorian cocoa on the global market.
Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer, accounting for over 40% of world supply. The country's cocoa is highly sought after for its quality and flavour, making it a valuable commodity on the international market. However, the high cost of shipping has made it difficult for local exporters to compete with other countries such as Ghana, which has lower shipping costs.
The proposed cut in cocoa freight rates has been welcomed by local exporters, who say that it will help to make Ivorian cocoa more competitive on the international market. It is also seen as a way to increase revenue for the country, which relies heavily on cocoa exports for its economic growth.
"We welcome this decision by the government to cut cocoa freight rates," said a spokesperson for the Ivorian Cocoa Association. "This will help to make our cocoa more competitive on the international market, and will benefit both local exporters and the country as a whole."
However, there are concerns that the proposed cut may not be enough to make a significant impact on the country's cocoa exports. Some experts argue that more needs to be done to address the underlying issues affecting the cocoa industry in Ivory Coast, such as poor infrastructure and low productivity levels.
"There is no doubt that lower cocoa freight rates will help to make Ivorian cocoa more competitive," said Samir Nasr, a commodity analyst at Standard Chartered Bank. "But there are other issues that need to be addressed in order to really boost the country's cocoa exports. These include improving transport infrastructure, increasing productivity levels, and ensuring that farmers are getting a fair price for their cocoa."
Despite these concerns, the proposed cut in cocoa freight rates is seen as a positive step for Ivory Coast's cocoa industry. It is hoped that it will help to make Ivorian cocoa more competitive on the global market and increase revenue for the country.
