Ivory Coast, one of the world's largest cocoa producers, has approved revised electronic auction rules aimed at curbing overbidding and ensuring a fair market price for farmers.
According to the country's coffee and cocoa council (CCC), the new rules will require bidders to pay a deposit equivalent to the value of 30% of the amount they purchase on the platform.
The deposit will be used to pay for any cocoa that the bidder fails to purchase after participating in the auction, the CCC said in a statement.
This move comes after the CCC received complaints from cocoa farmers about overbidding by buyers and a lack of transparency in the sale process.
"The new measures will ensure more transparency and fairness in the auction process, which will ultimately benefit farmers by getting them a fair price for their cocoa," said the CCC's head, Yves Brahima Koné.
The CCC has been utilizing electronic auctions since 2012, which were intended to create a more transparent and efficient system for cocoa sales. However, the system has been criticized for favoring big buyers and overbidding.
Under the new rules, buyers will be limited to purchasing no more than 120 lots during a single auction, or approximately 240 metric tons of cocoa. This will prevent large buyers from dominating the auction and pushing prices up, which would negatively affect smaller buyers and farmers.
"We are confident that the revised electronic auction system will lead to more competition among buyers, benefitting farmers and the cocoa sector as a whole," said Koné.
Ivory Coast is a crucial player in the global cocoa market, producing over 2 million metric tons of cocoa beans annually. The country's cocoa exports are worth an estimated $3 billion, representing a significant portion of Ivory Coast's economy.
The country's cocoa sector has been plagued by numerous challenges, including low prices, climate change, and child labor. Recent efforts have focused on improving working conditions for farmers and addressing child labor in the cocoa industry.
In addition to the new electronic auction rules, Ivory Coast has also implemented various measures aimed at improving the lives of cocoa farmers. For example, the country recently launched a program to help farmers switch to more sustainable cocoa farming practices. The program provides farmers with seedlings and training on how to grow cocoa in a way that is more environmentally friendly and sustainable.
Overall, the new electronic auction rules represent a positive step forward for Ivory Coast's cocoa sector. The rules will help ensure a fair price for farmers and improve the overall transparency and efficiency of the auction process.
However, some experts have warned that the new rules may not be enough to address the root causes of overbidding and other challenges in the sector. More efforts are needed to address issues such as child labor and low prices, which continue to plague the cocoa industry in Ivory Coast and other cocoa-producing countries.
Regardless, the revised electronic auction rules are a significant achievement for the country's cocoa sector and represent a positive step forward in efforts to improve working conditions and the lives of cocoa farmers.
