Abidjan, Ivory Coast - The Inter-African Coffee Organization (IACO) gathered in Abidjan, Ivory Coast this week for its annual meeting to discuss the troubling trend of low world coffee prices. Representatives from 25 African coffee producing countries attended the conference, along with industry experts and economists.
IACO Secretary-General, Josefa Sacko, opened the conference by highlighting the current state of the coffee industry. "The coffee sector is facing hard times with low coffee prices impacting the incomes of millions of families across Africa," she said.
The conference focused on the need for greater cooperation among coffee-producing countries to address the issue of low prices, which are largely due to an oversupply of coffee beans on the world market. The growing popularity of alternative beverages such as tea, as well as changing consumer preferences, have also contributed to the decline in coffee prices.
Delegates discussed the possibility of introducing measures to stabilize the market, such as the creation of a common fund for coffee farmers or the establishment of a minimum price for coffee beans. However, many experts pointed out that such measures would require the cooperation of major coffee producing countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Vietnam, which are not currently involved in the discussions.
IACO also focused on the importance of improving the quality of African coffee to increase demand and command a higher price. The organization plans to work with smallholder coffee farmers to provide training and support in good agricultural practices, as well as help them access international markets.
The conference also addressed issues related to climate change, which has significant implications for coffee production in Africa. Droughts, severe weather conditions, and the spread of pests and diseases are all affecting coffee quality and quantity. IACO emphasized the importance of adopting climate-smart practices to promote sustainable coffee production.
The conference concluded with a call for greater collaboration and coordination among African coffee producing countries, as well as with the international community to address the issue of low coffee prices. "The coffee industry plays a critical role in the economies of many African countries," said Sacko. "We must work together to ensure that the sector remains sustainable and benefits farmers and communities for generations to come."
