Ivory Coast's leading agro-industrial company, Société Internationale de Plantations d'Hévéas (SIFCA), announced its intention to liquidate its loss-making subsidiary, SAPH, but assured the public that it would not have any impact on port arrivals.
According to a spokesperson for SIFCA, the decision to liquidate SAPH was made due to the subsidiary’s inability to meet its financial obligations, including debt repayment and salaries of its workers.
"SAPH has been facing serious financial challenges for some time, and despite SIFCA's efforts to turn things around, we have realised that it is no longer viable to maintain the company’s operations," the spokesperson stated.
SIFCA has assured the public that the liquidation process would not affect port arrivals or the operations of other subsidiaries in Ivory Coast.
"SIFCA will continue to operate its other subsidiaries, including the palm oil producer Société Africaine de Plantations d'Hévéas (SAPH), which has been performing well. The liquidation of SAPH will not have any impact on our ability to supply our products to the market," the spokesperson added.
SIFCA is considered a key player in the Ivory Coast's agricultural sector, with a diversified portfolio of activities ranging from rubber plantations to the production of palm oil, sugar, and cocoa. The group owns several subsidiaries in Ivory Coast and neighboring countries, including Liberia, Guinea, and Ghana.
SAPH, which operates rubber plantations across the country, has been struggling financially for years, with debts reportedly amounting to over XOF 50 billion (approximately $93 million). The company has also been hit by falling rubber prices, low productivity, and high operational costs.
"In recent years, SAPH has been struggling to remain competitive due to various factors, including the high operational costs, the scarcity of labor, and the low prices of rubber in the international market," said a report by the International Rubber Study Group (IRSG).
The report noted that Ivory Coast and other African countries were facing increasing competition from Asian producers in the global rubber market, which had led to declining prices and reduced demand for African-grown rubber.
SIFCA, which owns a 51% stake in SAPH, has been trying to overhaul the subsidiary's operations, including reducing its workforce and cutting costs. However, these efforts have not been enough to save the loss-making company.
The liquidation process is expected to take several months, during which SIFCA will work to settle SAPH's outstanding debts and provide support to its employees.
"SIFCA is committed to supporting the affected workers by providing severance packages, retraining programs, and other forms of support to help them find new opportunities," the spokesperson said.
The announcement of SAPH's liquidation has raised concerns about the state of Ivory Coast's agricultural sector, which has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and falling commodity prices.
Ivory Coast, the world's leading producer of cocoa, has seen a decline in cocoa prices in recent months, with farmers struggling to make ends meet. The pandemic has also disrupted global supply chains, affecting the export of agricultural products from Ivory Coast and other African countries.
However, SIFCA remains optimistic about the future of the sector, citing the potential for increased demand for sustainably produced palm oil and other agricultural commodities.
"SIFCA remains committed to investing in Ivory Coast's agricultural sector and creating opportunities for the country's farmers and workers. We believe that with the right policies and investments, Ivory Coast can continue to be a major player in the global agriculture market," the spokesperson said.
