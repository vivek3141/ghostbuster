In a significant development in the broadcasting industry, DIRECTV's consortium has won the rights to offer Direct-to-Home (DTH) television services in Chile, beating its rivals. The consortium, which comprises subsidiaries of AT&T, Chilean retailer Falabella, and Chilean investment firm Inversiones Forestal, had applied for the license last year in October.
After a thorough evaluation process, the Chilean Telecommunications and Transportation Ministry has given the green light for DIRECTV to offer DTH television services in the country. The consortium will serve more than 1.2 million households across Chile, expanding DIRECTV's existing reach in the Latin American market.
This marks a significant milestone for the company, as DIRECTV had faced tough competition from its rivals, including Movistar and VTR, when it applied for the license. According to industry experts, the consortium's strong financial backing and expertise in the broadcasting industry played a crucial role in securing the license.
"This is a significant win for DIRECTV," said John Stankey, CEO of AT&T. "We are excited to bring our industry-leading entertainment experiences to more people in Chile. This is a testament to our commitment to investing in Latin America and to delivering the best content to our customers."
With the DTH television service, customers can access high-quality programming, including sports, entertainment, movies, and more, through a satellite dish and receiver. DIRECTV will offer customized packages that cater to the needs of Chilean households, providing a diverse range of content for viewers of all ages.
In addition, the consortium's entry into the market is expected to stimulate competition, leading to improved service quality, expanded product offerings, and more competitive pricing. This benefits consumers and drives growth in the broadcasting industry.
The consortium plans to invest significantly in infrastructure, including building a state-of-the-art broadcast center in Santiago. It also intends to collaborate with local content providers, promoting Chilean culture and helping to create job opportunities in the country's entertainment industry.
In conclusion, DIRECTV's consortium winning the rights to offer DTH television services in Chile is a significant achievement for the company and a positive development for the broadcasting industry. The consortium's strong financial backing and expertise in the broadcasting industry position it well to deliver high-quality entertainment experiences to Chilean households, benefitting both consumers and the wider industry.
