The state of Florida is preparing to take on the tobacco industry in a new legal battle, using a tough anti-racketeering law to hold them accountable for the harm caused by their products.
The move comes after years of litigation over the health risks associated with smoking, with the tobacco companies being accused of hiding the dangers of their products and deliberately targeting young people with their marketing campaigns.
Now, Florida is taking a different tack, using the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act to go after the industry. The act was originally passed in the 1970s to combat organized crime, but has since been used in a number of high-profile cases, including against the tobacco industry in the late 1990s.
The state's attorney general, Ashley Moody, announced the new lawsuit on Monday, saying that it was time for the tobacco companies to "pay for the damage they have caused." She accused them of engaging in a "decades-long conspiracy to mislead the public" about the risks of smoking and of targeting young people with their advertising.
The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses in Florida, which the state estimates to be in the billions of dollars. It also seeks to prevent the companies from continuing to engage in these practices in the future.
The tobacco industry has already come out in opposition to the lawsuit, with the industry trade group, the National Association of Tobacco Outlets, calling it "baseless" and accusing the state of "trying to balance its budget on the backs of smokers."
But supporters of the lawsuit say that it is long overdue. Dr. David M. Kessler, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and a prominent anti-tobacco advocate, called it a "bold and necessary step" in holding the industry accountable.
"This is an industry that has lied for decades about the health risks of its products, and has deliberately targeted young people with its advertising," Kessler said. "It's time for them to pay the price for what they have done."
The lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal challenges facing the tobacco industry, which has long been a target of regulators and health advocates. In recent years, some states have also been pushing for tougher regulations on e-cigarettes, which have become increasingly popular among young people.
But the tobacco industry remains a powerful force in American politics, with deep pockets and a well-organized lobbying effort. It remains to be seen whether Florida's latest legal challenge will succeed in holding them accountable for the harm caused by their products.
