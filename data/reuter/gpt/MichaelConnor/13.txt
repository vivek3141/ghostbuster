Time Warner Inc. announced that it will be launching a new sports news service, CNN/SI, in December to compete directly with the Walt Disney Co.’s ESPNNEWS channel in the United States.
CNN and Sports Illustrated had earlier teamed up for an online website that provided an in-depth coverage of sports events around the world. However, the new television channel CNN/SI is expected to take the venture to a new level.
The channel will broadcast news, highlights, and analysis of various sports events around the world. The prime focus for the channel will be college and professional sports in the United States. 
CNN already has a significant presence in the US with a large viewership, and the addition of CNN/SI to their network is expected to benefit the company. The channel’s sports coverage is also expected to keep viewers engaged as sports news has always been a popular topic among Americans.
CNN/SI is set to join the likes of Fox Sports and NBC Sports Network, which have also become established players in the sports news industry in the US. Meanwhile, ESPNNEWS led by Walt Disney Co. remains a popular choice in the country.
With the growing popularity of multiple sports other than the mainstream ones like football, baseball and basketball, the demand for sports news channels and websites has become paramount. These ventures attract a considerable number of viewership, which makes them a viable business opportunity for media companies.
Time Warner’s decision to launch a new sports news service is an aggressive step to tap into this growing market. By focusing on college sports in particular, CNN/SI could also potentially gain a loyal fan base that could drive viewership and increase profits.
It remains to be seen how successful CNN/SI becomes once it launches in December. However, the competition between Time Warner Inc.’s new venture and Walt Disney Co.’s ESPNNEWS is set to heat up for the foreseeable future.
