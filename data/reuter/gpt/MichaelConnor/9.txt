Silver King, the parent company of HSN (Home Shopping Network), has acquired the popular home shopping network in a stock-swap deal worth $1.27 billion. The move is aimed at expanding the company's reach into the world of broadcast television and establishing itself as a major player in the home-shopping industry.
The deal, which was finalized earlier this week, will see HSN become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Silver King. The acquisition gives Silver King access to HSN's vast customer base of 90 million households across the United States, as well as its established distribution networks and relationships with major vendors.
The move is part of a broader strategy by Silver King to expand its presence in the broadcast TV market, where it is already a leading player. The company owns a number of TV stations across the country and has long been involved in the production and distribution of programming.
According to a statement released by the company, Silver King sees HSN as a "perfect fit" for its existing operations. The statement suggests that the two companies will work closely together going forward to create new programming and expand their reach into new markets.
"We believe that with the combined resources of Silver King and HSN, we can create a powerful new force in the world of broadcast television," said Silver King CEO Michael E. Fuchs in the statement. "We are excited about the potential for this merger and look forward to working together to deliver innovative new programming to viewers across the country."
The merger comes at a time of rapid growth for the home-shopping industry, which has seen a surge in popularity in recent years as consumers have shifted to online and mobile shopping. HSN, which was founded in 1985, has been at the forefront of this trend, with a range of innovative programming and a focus on high-quality products.
The company's CEO, Mindy Grossman, expressed her excitement about the merger in a statement, saying that it "represents a compelling opportunity for both companies to build on their respective strengths and create a powerful new force in the industry."
As part of the deal, HSN shareholders will receive shares of Silver King stock in exchange for their shares of HSN. The exact terms of the exchange will be determined in the coming weeks, but it is expected to be completed in the near future.
The acquisition is subject to approval by both companies' boards of directors, as well as any necessary regulatory approvals. The two companies have said they expect to complete the deal by the end of the year.
