Sunbeam Corp. – the American conglomerate specializing in household appliances, kitchenware, and bedding products – has announced its plans to implement a drastic restructuring strategy, which will result in the loss of 6,000 jobs and the elimination of almost 90% of the company's product lines.
The move is part of Sunbeam's efforts to streamline its operations and focus on its most profitable businesses. The company has been struggling to compete in an increasingly crowded marketplace, faced with stiff competition from rivals like GE, Whirlpool, and Samsung.
The restructuring plan, which was announced in a press release on Monday, will see Sunbeam reducing its workforce by around 20%, closing several manufacturing plants, and outsourcing some of its operations to third-party suppliers. The company will also be slashing its product offerings from the current 825 to just 100.
"We believe this restructuring plan is necessary to ensure the long-term viability of our business. It will allow us to focus our resources on the areas of the company where we can make the most impact and drive growth," said Michael Bauer, CEO of Sunbeam Corp.
The restructuring is expected to cost the company around $400 million, including severance payments and other related expenses. Sunbeam will also be taking a one-time $300 million write-down on its inventory and other assets.
The news sent shockwaves through the industry, with many industry analysts speculating about the long-term implications of the move.
"While it's clear that Sunbeam needed to take drastic action to reposition itself for the future, the scale of these cuts is somewhat surprising. It remains to be seen how the market will react," said John Smith, an analyst at Wall Street firm AT&T.
Sunbeam Corp. was founded in 1897 as the Chicago Flexible Shaft Company, and has since grown to become one of the largest manufacturers of household appliances and other consumer goods in the world. Its products include everything from toasters to electric blankets and air purifiers.
The company has struggled in recent years, however, faced with falling demand for some of its products and increased competition from both established players and new entrants in the marketplace. Between 2015 and 2020, Sunbeam's revenues declined by almost 10%, from $2.8 billion to $2.5 billion.
It remains to be seen how the restructuring will affect the company's long-term prospects, and what it means for the thousands of workers who will be losing their jobs. Sunbeam has said that it will be providing severance packages and job placement assistance to affected employees.
"We understand that this is a difficult time for our employees and their families, and we are committed to ensuring that they receive the support they need during this transition," said Bauer.
The company's shares were down more than 5% in pre-market trading on Tuesday, reflecting concerns among investors about the impact of the restructuring on Sunbeam's bottom line.
However, some analysts have expressed optimism that the restructuring could pay off in the long run. By focusing on its most profitable businesses and streamlining its operations, Sunbeam may be able to achieve greater efficiencies and improve its overall financial performance.
"Sunbeam has some strong brands and a loyal customer base. By simplifying its product lines and eliminating unprofitable businesses, the company could position itself for a brighter future," said Tom Anderson, an analyst at Morningstar.
In the end, the success of Sunbeam's restructuring will depend on a variety of factors, including the state of the economy, consumer sentiment, and the company's ability to execute on its strategy. For now, investors and employees alike will be watching closely to see how things unfold for the beleaguered manufacturer.
