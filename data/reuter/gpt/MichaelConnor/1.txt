Fox News to File Antitrust Suit Against Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting System for Blocking Channel in New York City
In a move that is sure to shake up the media industry, Fox News is set to file an antitrust suit against Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting System (TBS) for allegedly blocking Fox News from gaining access to their cable television lines in New York City.
According to Fox News, which is owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, TBS has refused to negotiate with its competitor to carry its channel on Time Warner Cable systems in New York City, a market that is vital to Fox News’ success.
“In an effort to maintain their dominance in the market, Time Warner and TBS have taken illegal actions against Fox News, including refusing to negotiate in good faith for the carriage of our channel in New York City,” said a Fox News spokesperson.
“This anti-competitive behavior is not only harmful to Fox News, but to viewers as well who are being denied access to our high-quality programming.”
The suit, which is set to be filed in federal court in New York, seeks to force TBS to negotiate in good faith with Fox News for the right to carry its channel on Time Warner Cable’s systems in New York.
It also seeks damages for the alleged harm caused to Fox News by TBS’ allegedly unfair and illegal business practices.
The lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal battles between Fox News and its competitors, as the news network seeks to carve out a bigger slice of the market.
In recent years, Fox News has increased its audience share, overtaking competitors like CNN and MSNBC, but the network still struggles to gain access to key markets, particularly in New York City.
According to industry analysts, Fox News’ lawsuit is likely to face an uphill battle, as the legal standard for proving antitrust violations is high.
“To succeed in an antitrust lawsuit, Fox News will need to show that TBS has engaged in a pattern of illegal conduct that has harmed competition in the market,” said legal analyst John Smith.
“But given that TBS is a major player in the media industry, and that there is intense competition for access to cable TV systems, Fox News will need to make a strong case to win the suit.”
Despite the challenges, Fox News remains committed to its fight against TBS, believing that it is in the best interests of its viewers and shareholders.
“We will not stand idly by while our competitors use illegal tactics to block us from the market,” said the Fox News spokesperson.
“This lawsuit is about fairness, competition, and ensuring that our viewers have access to the best programming possible. We look forward to presenting our case in court and proving that TBS has engaged in illegal and anticompetitive behavior.”
