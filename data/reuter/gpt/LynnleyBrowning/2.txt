Russia is grappling with yet another devastating grain harvest for the second year in a row. The country is the world's largest wheat exporter, but its agricultural industry has been hit hard by poor weather conditions, including drought, heat waves, and wildfires.
According to the Russian Agricultural Ministry, the country's grain harvest is expected to fall by 12% this year, to around 117 million tonnes. This is a significant drop from the record 135 million tonnes harvested in 2017.
The poor harvest is expected to hit Russia's economy hard, as agriculture is an important sector for the country. The agricultural industry accounts for about 4% of Russia's GDP and employs around 10% of the population. The drop in the grain harvest is also expected to lead to a rise in food prices, which could hit consumers hard.
To help offset the drop in its own harvest, Russia is expected to increase its imports of wheat and other grains. The country has already become a major importer of wheat, with around 7 million tonnes expected to be brought in this year. This will be a significant increase from last year when Russia only imported around 2 million tonnes of wheat.
Analysts predict that Russia's wheat imports could continue to grow in the coming years. The country has been hit by increasingly frequent and severe weather events, which have made it more difficult for farmers to grow crops. Poor infrastructure, including limited irrigation systems and a lack of storage facilities, has also contributed to the country's agricultural issues.
The government has pledged to invest more in agriculture, but it is unclear how much of an impact this will have. Russia has a history of supporting its agricultural industry, but many critics argue that the government's policies are outdated and do not reflect the realities of modern farming.
The poor grain harvest is also expected to have wider implications for the global agricultural industry. Russia's exports have helped to keep global wheat prices low in recent years, but the drop in production could lead to increased prices for consumers around the world. This could be particularly hard on countries that rely heavily on wheat imports, such as Egypt and Iraq.
Overall, Russia's second consecutive bad grain harvest is a worrying sign for the country's economy and its agricultural industry. Increased imports may help to offset some of the damage, but there are concerns that the country's infrastructure and policies may not be able to keep pace with the changing climate and growing demand for food.
