Russia Lowers Electricity and Rail Transport Prices to Boost Industrial Output, Causing Concern for Western Economists
The Russian government has announced a plan to lower electricity and rail transport prices in the country. This move is aimed at boosting the country's industrial output, which has been struggling due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and a decline in oil prices. While the move is seen as a positive initiative for Russia's economy, it has caused concern among western economists who fear that it could lead to unfair competition among countries.
The announcement was made by Russia's Deputy Prime Minister, Dmitry Kozak, who said that the new measures would reduce electricity prices for industrial users by up to 20%. Railway transport costs will also be lowered, resulting in a 10% reduction in transportation costs for goods. Kozak said that the measures would be in effect from January 1, 2021, and would remain in place until 2024.
The move has been welcomed by Russian businesses, particularly those in the industrial sector. The lowering of electricity and rail transport costs is expected to boost productivity, increase competitiveness, and create more jobs in the country. The government hopes that the move will attract more investors, which will, in turn, stimulate economic growth. The State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, has already approved the measures.
However, western economists are wary of the move, fearing that it could lead to unfair competition among countries. The lowering of electricity and rail transport costs could give Russian businesses an advantage over their foreign competitors, who may not have access to such low prices. This could lead to foreign businesses losing market share and potentially causing job losses in other countries.
The move has also been criticized by the European Union, which has accused Russia of using unfair trading practices to gain an advantage in the market. The European Union has expressed its concern that the new measures could violate World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. The Union has warned that it would take appropriate measures if the measures are found to be in violation of the WTO regulations.
Russia has defended the measures, stating that they are in line with international trade rules. The country has pointed out that several other countries, including China, have implemented similar measures to boost their economies. Russia has also said that the measures will not be discriminatory and will apply equally to both domestic and foreign businesses operating in the country.
The move comes at a time when Russia's economy has been struggling due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and a decline in oil prices. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) has contracted by 3.1% in the year 2020, according to a statement by the Russian Ministry of Economic Development. The government hopes that the new measures will help revive the economy and ensure growth in the coming years.
The lowering of electricity and rail transport costs is not the only initiative that the government has taken to boost Russia's economy. The country has also announced a package of measures, including tax incentives, investment in infrastructure, and support for small and medium-sized businesses. The government has also increased spending on healthcare, education, and social welfare to support those affected by the pandemic.
Despite the concerns raised by western economists and the European Union, the Russian government remains hopeful that the new measures will provide the much-needed boost to the country's economy. The country is also hoping that the measures will help it become more competitive in the global market and attract more investment. With the announcement of these measures, Russia has taken a significant step forward in its efforts to revive its economy and emerge as a major player on the world stage.
