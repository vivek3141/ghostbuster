Russian Diamond Giant ARS Close to Signing Deal with De Beers, but Government Struggles for Control
The Russian diamond industry has been a dominant player in the global market for decades, with companies like Alrosa (ARS) being among the largest producers in the world. Recently, ARS has been in talks with De Beers, the South African diamond giant, about a potential deal that could see the two companies cooperate and share resources. While negotiations are almost complete, the Russian government is struggling to maintain control over the industry.
According to sources close to the companies, a preliminary agreement has been reached that would allow De Beers to sell rough diamonds to ARS, which would in turn supply them to the global market. The deal would be beneficial for both companies, as De Beers could benefit from ARS's extensive network of buyers and ARS could increase its production capacity. In addition, the deal would strengthen ties between Russia and South Africa, which have historically been strong trade partners.
However, the Russian government is not as enthusiastic about the deal as the two companies. ARS is majority-owned by the state, and the government is concerned about losing control over the diamond industry. The Russian parliament has already passed a law giving the state more power over the mining and sale of diamonds, and there is pressure on ARS to ensure that the deal with De Beers does not violate this law.
At the same time, the Russian government is trying to exert more influence over the industry through other means. In July 2021, it was announced that a new state-owned company called the Diamond Corporation would be established to oversee the diamond industry, with the goal of increasing control and transparency. The corporation would be owned by several state-owned banks and companies, including ARS, and would oversee all aspects of the diamond trade.
Some experts are skeptical about the Diamond Corporation's ability to successfully govern the industry. "The creation of a state-run diamond corporation in Russia is likely to lead to further bureaucracy and inefficiency," said analyst Olesia Safronova. "If the goal is to increase efficiency and transparency, more private sector involvement would be beneficial."
The situation is complicated further by the fact that ARS is not the only major player in the Russian diamond industry. There are several other large companies, both privately and state-owned, that compete for market share. The government's attempts to exert more control over the industry could be seen as a way to consolidate the industry under state control, which could limit competition and potentially harm the industry in the long run.
Despite these concerns, the deal with De Beers appears to be imminent. Sources say that negotiations are in the final stages and that an official announcement could be made soon. The deal would be a major boon for ARS, which has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and the global economic downturn. It would also be a significant win for De Beers, which has been seeking to expand its presence in Russia for several years.
However, the question of government control remains. If the deal violates Russia's new diamond law or if the government feels that it undermines their control over the industry, it could be revoked. It remains to be seen how this will play out, but experts say that the situation is a reminder of the challenges that arise when dealing with the Russian government.
"The Russian government is always looking for ways to exert more control over strategic industries," said Safronova. "Companies doing business in Russia need to be aware of this and navigate the complex regulatory environment carefully."
