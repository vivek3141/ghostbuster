Russia's recent decision to liberalize its gold market has generated great interest and speculation among economists and investors alike. However, sources suggest that the move is unlikely to create an "El Dorado of the East" anytime soon. 
In December 2020, Russia passed a law permitting individuals to own and trade gold freely. Previously, owning gold in Russia was restricted to certain entities, such as banks and jewelry manufacturers. While the new law is certainly a step towards liberalization, some experts argue that it falls short of creating a truly open gold market. 
One of the main limitations of the new law is that it only allows purchases and sales of gold within Russia. This means that individuals cannot freely import or export gold. This is a key disadvantage compared to other global gold hubs, such as London or Dubai, where gold can be easily traded and transported worldwide. Additionally, while the new law allows individuals to own gold, it does not provide any tax incentives or exemptions. This may discourage some potential investors who may be deterred by additional costs or complications. 
Another potential hurdle to developing a thriving gold market in Russia is the lack of infrastructure and services. Currently, there are relatively few options for buying or selling gold, and many of these are restricted to physical purchases. Digital gold platforms, such as those found in other jurisdictions, have yet to gain a foothold in Russia. Furthermore, there is a lack of assurance around the quality and authenticity of gold products available in Russia. This may further deter investors who want to ensure the security of their holdings. 
Despite these challenges, there are some signs that the new law could spur growth in the gold market. Some experts point to the popularity of gold in Russia, where it has long been a preferred investment option for individuals. Increased availability of gold products could encourage even more people to invest in the metal. Additionally, the new law could help to promote transparency and reduce the risk of illicit gold trading. 
In the longer term, some analysts suggest that Russia could potentially become a significant player in the global gold market. The country has the world's second-largest gold reserves, after China, and has been steadily increasing its gold holdings over the past several years. If the government continues to support liberalization and investment in gold infrastructure, it could attract significant investment and interest from international players. 
In conclusion, Russia's recent liberalization of its gold market is unlikely to create an immediate "El Dorado of the East". However, it does represent a significant step towards increased openness and transparency in the gold market. While there are challenges to be addressed, there is also potential for growth and development in the sector in the coming years. As always, investors will need to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of investing in this changing market.
