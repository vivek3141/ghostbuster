The aluminium industry has expressed concerns over the ability of Kontsern Alyuminiy, the world's largest aluminium producer, to control output levels and support world prices, according to industry sources.
Kontsern Alyuminiy, based in Russia, has been facing rising costs due to the US sanctions and the supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, the company has been increasing its output in recent years, leading to a glut in the aluminium market and putting pressure on global prices.
Industry experts warn that if Kontsern Alyuminiy continues to ramp up production, it could fuel overcapacity and cause a price crash similar to what happened in 2015, when China flooded the market with cheap aluminium.
"Kontsern Alyuminiy has been increasing its output levels for the past few years, even as the rest of the industry has been struggling. This has put pressure on global prices, making it difficult for other producers to compete," said an industry analyst who wished to remain anonymous.
"In light of the current economic climate, it is crucial for the industry to maintain a balance between supply and demand. If Kontsern Alyuminiy continues to produce at these levels, it could jeopardize the entire aluminium industry and lead to a crash in global prices."
Kontsern Alyuminiy has responded to these concerns by stating that it is committed to ensuring the stability of the aluminium market and will work with other producers to maintain a balance between supply and demand.
"We understand the importance of maintaining a stable aluminium market, and we recognize the concerns raised by our industry counterparts. We will continue to work closely with other producers to ensure that demand is met without causing any disruptions in the market," said a spokesperson for Kontsern Alyuminiy.
However, industry insiders remain sceptical of the company's ability to control output levels, given its history of increasing production even in difficult economic conditions.
"Kontsern Alyuminiy's track record suggests that it prioritizes output over market stability. It will be difficult to trust the company to put the interests of the industry ahead of its own profits," said another industry expert.
Others have suggested that a more regulatory approach may be necessary to ensure that Kontsern Alyuminiy and other producers do not overproduce and cause a price crash.
"The aluminium industry needs to take a more proactive approach to regulating production levels and ensuring that the market remains stable. This could include setting production quotas or introducing other regulatory measures to prevent overcapacity," said a third industry analyst.
The aluminium industry is a crucial part of global manufacturing, used in everything from cars and airplanes to household appliances and construction materials. If prices crash due to overproduction, it could have a profound impact on the global economy and lead to job losses and economic instability.
As such, it is imperative that Kontsern Alyuminiy and other industry players work together to ensure that production levels are controlled and the market remains stable. Failure to do so could result in a repeat of the 2015 price crash, which the industry is still struggling to recover from.
