Moscow, Russia â€“ The Russian government has announced its preference for domestic companies to lead major energy deals worth billions of dollars, sidelining Western majors.
The move comes amid growing economic uncertainties and mounting pressure from the West over sanctions and allegations of involvement in recent cyberattacks.
"The priority for participation in energy projects will be given to Russian companies, which have gained extensive experience and competence in implementing large-scale energy complexes, have advanced technologies and highly qualified personnel," said Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
The announcement is expected to have far-reaching implications for Western energy giants, including ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total, and BP, which have been banking on their expertise and advanced technology to lead major oil and gas projects in Russia.
The move is also seen as a significant departure from Russia's previous policy of engaging with foreign partners to pursue its energy ambitions.
Observers say the decision is driven by the need to protect Russia's strategic interests in the energy sector amid rising economic challenges and geopolitical uncertainties.
"Russia is facing multiple challenges, including economic slowdown, declining oil prices, and sanctions. The move is aimed at ensuring Russia's energy security while protecting against economic risks," said Alexei Mukhin, director-general of the Center for Political Information in Moscow.
Russia's announcement comes as the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has hit the global economy hard, causing oil prices to plummet.
The situation has been compounded by the ongoing trade war between the US and China, which has intensified economic uncertainties, leading to a drop in energy demand.
As a result, Russia, which exports more than 60% of its crude oil and natural gas to Europe, has been hit hard, forcing the country to take measures to cushion itself against the economic fallout.
One of the measures taken by the Russian government is to give priority to domestic companies in major energy deals, thereby strengthening its economic and strategic position in the sector.
Russia's decision is also seen as a response to mounting pressure from the West over sanctions and allegations of involvement in recent cyberattacks.
The US has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russia, targeting its energy sector and companies like Gazprom, Rosneft, and Novatek.
In response, Russia has been looking to reduce its dependence on Western countries for investment and technology, as it seeks to withstand the impact of sanctions and reduce geopolitical risks.
The move to prioritize domestic companies in energy deals is a step toward achieving that goal and strengthening Russia's control over its energy sector.
However, this decision is not without risks, as it could lead to a further decline in foreign investment in the country's energy sector.
Western energy majors have been working with Russian companies to develop their oil and gas resources, leveraging their expertise and advanced technology.
However, Russia's preference for domestic companies could mean that foreign partners will have to take a back seat, making it harder for them to gain access to Russia's vast reserves.
Moreover, the move could lead to a decline in the quality of projects, as domestic companies lack the resources and technology of their foreign counterparts.
Despite the risks, Russia's decision to prioritize domestic companies in energy deals is a clear indication of its determination to protect its interests in the sector, amid rising geopolitical tensions and economic challenges.
It also underscores the need for Western energy majors to reevaluate their strategies in Russia, as the country moves to assert its control over its energy resources.
