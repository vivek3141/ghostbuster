The ongoing General Motors (GM) strike in Canada shows no signs of stopping anytime soon, according to Jerry Dias, the President of the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) union.
"I wish I could tell you we're close, but we're really not," Dias said during a recent press conference. The strike, which began on September 17, has affected more than 3,000 workers at a GM plant in Oshawa, Ontario.
The workers are striking for better job security and a reversal of GM's decision to close the Oshawa plant, which makes the Chevrolet Impala and Cadillac XTS sedans. The plant was supposed to close in December of this year, but the CAW wants GM to keep it open and assign new products to it.
Dias said that the two sides are still far apart on these issues, and that GM hasn't budged on its decision to close the Oshawa plant. "They're holding firm to their position," he said.
In addition to Oshawa, the GM strike has affected workers at two other Canadian plants in St. Catharines and Windsor, who have been temporarily laid off due to a lack of parts from the Oshawa plant.
Dias said that the CAW is doing its best to support the striking workers, but that it's difficult to sustain a long strike. "It's a game of attrition," he said.
The strike has already caused a ripple effect in the Canadian auto industry, as suppliers and dealers who rely on GM are feeling the impact. According to a report from Bloomberg, the overall economic impact of the strike could be as much as $5 billion.
Despite these consequences, Dias said that the CAW will continue to fight for the workers' demands. "We're not going to roll over and give up," he said.
The Oshawa plant has been part of Canada's auto industry since 1907, and its closure would be a significant blow to the area's economy. The CAW has argued that GM has a responsibility to the workers and the community, and that the company should keep the plant open for the long term.
For now, however, the strike continues with no end in sight. Dias said that he doesn't expect a resolution anytime soon, and that the CAW will continue to negotiate with GM in the hopes of reaching a deal.
