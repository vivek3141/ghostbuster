Ford Motor Company and the Detroit Lions are reportedly in talks over a multi-million dollar naming rights agreement for the Lions' new stadium currently under construction in downtown Detroit. Sources close to the negotiations have revealed that the deal could be worth up to $150 million over a 20 year term.
The new stadium is expected to be the centerpiece of a revitalized downtown area and is scheduled to open in 2022. It will replace the Lions' current home at Ford Field which opened in 2002 and seats just over 65,000 fans. Details of the new stadium's capacity, design and features have not yet been made public.
If completed, the deal would be the latest in a string of high-profile sports naming rights agreements between auto manufacturers and professional sports franchises, with recent examples including Mercedes-Benz's naming rights for the Atlanta Falcons' Mercedes-Benz Stadium and Audi's deal with Major League Soccer's D.C. United for Audi Field.
Representatives of Ford and the Detroit Lions declined to comment on the reports of a naming rights deal, citing ongoing negotiations. However, both parties have previously expressed a desire to expand their partnership, with Ford already serving as the Lions' official vehicle since 2014.
The potential partnership would not only bring in significant revenue for both Ford and the Lions, but it would also create a strong Detroit-based branding opportunity that could reiterate the recent resurgence of the city as a major economic player in the United States.
The new Detroit stadium naming deal is yet to be finalised. Still, the possibility is already generating excitement among fans, businesses and city leaders alike. Detroit's recent revitalisation, coupled with Ford's long history in the city, has set the stage for a truly significant partnership that could benefit both the automaker and the city for years to come.
