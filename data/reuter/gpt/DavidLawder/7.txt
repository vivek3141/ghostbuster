Ford Motor Company has announced that it has secured naming rights for the new Detroit Lions stadium. The automaker reportedly paid $40 million for a multi-year deal that will give it exclusive rights to name the venue.
The new stadium, which is currently under construction, is expected to open in time for the 2022 NFL season. The current home of the Lions, Ford Field, will be demolished after the new stadium is completed.
The deal marks a significant investment by Ford in its hometown of Detroit, where it was founded over a century ago. The automaker, which has been struggling in recent years, is looking to revitalize its brand and reach new customers through this sponsorship.
"We are thrilled to partner with the Detroit Lions and be a part of this amazing new stadium," said Jim Farley, CEO of Ford. "This is a huge moment for our company and for the city of Detroit."
The new stadium will have a seating capacity of 70,000 and will feature state-of-the-art amenities and technology. It will also be a hub for entertainment and events in the city, hosting concerts, conventions, and other major events.
The Lions organization is also excited about the partnership with Ford and the potential benefits it could bring. "This is a tremendous opportunity for our team and our fans," said Rod Wood, the Lions' president. "We are proud to have Ford as our partner and look forward to working together to create an unforgettable experience for everyone who visits the new stadium."
The naming rights deal is just one of several major investments that Ford has made in Detroit in recent years. The company has also invested in a new innovation hub in the city, as well as a new factory to produce electric vehicles.
Ford's investment in Detroit comes at a time when the city is experiencing significant growth and development. The city has seen a resurgence in recent years, with new businesses and residents moving in and a renewed focus on revitalizing downtown and other neighborhoods.
The naming rights deal is expected to bring in significant revenue for the Lions organization, which has struggled on the field in recent years. The team is hoping that the new stadium and partnership with Ford will help to draw more fans and improve their performance on the field.
Overall, the deal is seen as a win-win for both Ford and the Lions. It represents a major investment in the city of Detroit and has the potential to bring significant benefits to both companies. As the new stadium takes shape and prepares to open its doors, all eyes will be on the partnership between Ford and the Lions, and the impact it will have on the city and the NFL.
