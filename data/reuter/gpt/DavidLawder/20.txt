General Motors (GM), one of the largest automobile manufacturers in the world, is facing scrutiny from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) over reports of spontaneous airbag deployment in some of its vehicles.
The NHTSA launched an investigation into the issue after receiving complaints from customers who claimed that the airbags in their GM cars had deployed unexpectedly, without any warning or indication of an accident.
The agency has received at least 15 complaints related to the issue, which involve the 2019 and 2020 model years of several GM vehicles, including the Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra, and Cadillac CT4.
In one incident reported to the NHTSA, a driver of a 2020 Cadillac CT4 was traveling at a low speed when the airbags suddenly deployed, causing him to lose control of the car and crash into a parked vehicle.
Another driver of a 2019 Chevrolet Silverado reported that the airbag in his vehicle deployed while he was driving on the highway, causing him to lose control of the car and veer off the road.
The NHTSA said that it is investigating whether the airbag control modules in the affected vehicles are faulty, causing them to deploy the airbags without any input from the driver.
"We are aware of the reports of unexpected airbag deployments in GM vehicles and we are investigating this issue to determine the root cause," said a spokesperson for the NHTSA. "We take this matter very seriously and will take all necessary action to ensure the safety of the driving public."
GM said that it is cooperating with the NHTSA investigation and is committed to the safety of its customers.
"We are aware of the NHTSA investigation regarding certain GM vehicles and we are fully cooperating with the agency," said a spokesperson for GM. "We take these matters seriously and are committed to the safety and quality of our vehicles."
The NHTSA investigation into GM comes as the agency is stepping up its oversight of automakers in the wake of several high-profile vehicle recalls and safety issues in recent years.
In May, the NHTSA ordered automakers to recall nearly 70 million vehicles with potentially defective Takata airbags, which have been linked to at least 27 deaths worldwide.
Last year, the agency also fined Fiat Chrysler $105 million for failing to complete 23 recalls covering more than 11 million vehicles with safety defects.
The NHTSA investigation into GM is also likely to increase scrutiny of the company's safety practices, which have come under fire in recent years over its handling of the faulty ignition switch issue, which resulted in at least 124 deaths and hundreds of injuries.
GM has since settled a number of lawsuits related to the issue, paying out billions of dollars in compensation to victims and their families.
The company has also worked to improve its safety practices, hiring a new chief safety officer and implementing new procedures to better monitor and address safety issues in its vehicles.
Despite these efforts, the NHTSA investigation into the spontaneous airbag deployment issue is a reminder that automakers still have work to do to ensure the safety of their vehicles and their customers.
"As vehicles become more advanced and complex, it is essential that manufacturers prioritize safety and take swift action when issues arise," said the NHTSA spokesperson. "We will continue to monitor this issue closely and take all necessary action to protect the public."
