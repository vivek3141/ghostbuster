In a surprise move, a senior US official has praised China's approach to arms control, but at the same time raised concerns over the risk of proliferation. The comments were made during a visit to Beijing by the US Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, Bonnie Jenkins.
Jenkins, who is one of the highest-ranking officials in the US government working on arms control, met with senior Chinese officials to discuss a range of issues related to weapons of mass destruction, nuclear disarmament, and missile defense.
In a statement released after the meetings, Jenkins said that China's commitment to arms control was "commendable" and that the country had made "significant progress" in this area in recent years.
"China has demonstrated a responsible approach to arms control and non-proliferation," Jenkins said. "Their commitment to reducing the risk of nuclear war and preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction is commendable."
Jenkins also praised China's participation in international arms control regimes, such as the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), and said that China's efforts to promote nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation were "critical" to achieving a world free of nuclear weapons.
However, Jenkins also raised concerns over the risk of proliferation, particularly in the context of China's growing military capabilities and ambitions.
"In light of China's growing military capabilities and aspirations, the risk of proliferation remains a concern," Jenkins said. "It is important that China continues to work with the international community to ensure that weapons of mass destruction do not fall into the wrong hands."
Concerns over proliferation have been a key issue in US-China relations in recent years, with Washington accusing Beijing of not doing enough to contain the spread of nuclear technology and materials to other states or non-state actors.
China, for its part, has denied these allegations and has insisted that it is committed to preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and promoting disarmament.
During her visit to Beijing, Jenkins also discussed the issue of strategic stability with Chinese officials, including the importance of arms control agreements such as the New START treaty, which expires in 2021.
The New START treaty, signed by the US and Russia in 2010, limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads each country can possess and sets caps on the number of deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and heavy bombers.
Jenkins said that the US was committed to extending the New START treaty and urged China to join the US and Russia in negotiating a new trilateral arms control agreement.
"Strategic stability is critical to global security, and the New START treaty has been a key factor in maintaining this stability," Jenkins said. "The US is committed to extending the treaty, and we urge China to join us and Russia in negotiating a new trilateral arms control agreement."
Overall, the visit by Jenkins to Beijing was seen as a positive step in US-China relations, particularly in the area of arms control. However, as both countries continue to modernize their military capabilities and pursue strategic ambitions, the risk of proliferation and the need for effective arms control will remain a key concern for policymakers on both sides.
