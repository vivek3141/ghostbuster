BP and Shanghai Petrochemical have announced their decision to invest in a $2.5 billion ethylene plant in China. The joint venture between two of the world's largest oil companies promises to bring significant benefits to China's petrochemical industry.
BP will join forces with Shanghai's largest petrochemical company for the construction of this plant in Eastern China's Jiangsu province, which will produce one million tonnes of ethylene per year. The project aims to have a minimal environmental footprint and follow the highest safety standards. Its design envisages a smart and highly integrated plant that will use industry-leading technology to produce high-quality products.
The decision to invest in this new venture is a solid step towards BP's plans for decarbonization. BP sees China's growing energy demand as a significant opportunity, with China having committed to reaching carbon neutrality by 2060. China's recent announcement of its 14th Five-Year Plan also highlights the priority placed on achieving a green transition.
The investment demonstrates BP's commitment to partnering with Chinese companies to create low-carbon opportunities that will benefit China and the wider world. As China's largest petrochemical producer, Shanghai Petrochemical is an experienced partner with a long history of developing and implementing projects that align with environmental targets.
The joint venture represents a significant milestone in China's rapidly expanding petrochemical industry, with the country's demand for polyethylene increasing steadily over the years. Polyethylene is among the world's most common plastic, and its demand is expected to grow by an average of over 3% annually until 2030. This investment will meet this growing demand.
Bob Dudley, CEO of BP, said, "This joint venture represents an important milestone in our established partnership with Sinopec and China. We look forward to applying our technology and operational expertise to work collaboratively with Sinopec to meet China's growing need for cleaner energy."
The joint venture is also expected to create significant economic benefits by generating approximately 1,000 direct jobs and a further 4,000 jobs in the construction phase. The investment in the plant will also contribute to the national and regional economy's long-term growth, creating increased opportunities for local communities in the surrounding area.
The partnership between BP and Shanghai Petrochemical highlights the importance of the private sector in achieving sustainable growth and development in the Chinese economy. The investment's sustainability and social responsibility aspects are an essential element of BP's business values, which prioritizes the creation of a common and inclusive future.
The plant's construction will begin in 2021, with operations expected to begin in 2024. BP and Shanghai Petrochemical's joint venture promises to be a model for future projects that prioritize sustainability and demonstrate the importance of partnership and collaboration in realizing a low-carbon future.
