A Beijing court has sentenced Wang Dan, a prominent Chinese dissident, to 11 years in prison for plotting to subvert the government. He was also stripped of his political rights for three years.
The sentence was passed on Monday, June 28, and met with widespread criticism from human rights groups and opposition figures. Wang had been detained since March 2020 and was charged with subversion in January this year. He is the latest in a string of activists and dissidents to be prosecuted under China's increasingly tough national security law.
Wang had been an active democracy campaigner since the 1980s and was a participant in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. He spent nearly five years in prison for his involvement in those protests and was subsequently exiled to the US. He returned to China in 2015 but continued his activism, advocating for greater democracy and human rights.
According to the indictment against him, Wang had been working with a group of exiled dissidents to subvert the government and establish a democracy in China. The prosecution alleged that Wang had received funding and support from foreign organizations, including the National Endowment for Democracy and the Open Society Foundations, both of which are based in the US.
Wang denied the charges against him, arguing that he was only exercising his right to free speech and political participation. He told the court that he had not engaged in any illegal activities and had only used legal channels to express his opinions.
Human rights groups have condemned the sentence, calling it a blatant violation of Wang's rights to free expression and political participation. Amnesty International said that Wang's case was "just the latest in a series of politically motivated trials that demonstrate the Chinese authorities' increasing crackdown on peaceful dissent."
Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, said that Wang's sentence "is a clear message to anyone who dares to speak out against the Chinese government – no matter where they are – that they will be punished severely."
Others have criticized the foreign organizations that allegedly supported Wang, saying that they are undermining China's sovereignty and stability. The Global Times, a state-run newspaper, published an editorial on Monday accusing the US of using such organizations to interfere in China's internal affairs and foment unrest.
"The US has been using NGOs to create chaos in China under the pretext of democracy and human rights," the editorial said. "Such anti-China forces are trying to subvert China's system and undermine its social stability. The Chinese government's efforts to crack down on such activities are necessary and legitimate."
The case against Wang is part of a broader crackdown on dissent and activism in China. The government has been using the national security law, which was imposed on Hong Kong last year, to target not only separatists and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong but also dissidents and critics on the mainland.
Observers say that the law has given the authorities broad powers to silence dissent and suppress any form of opposition to the government. They point to the arrests of dozens of activists, lawyers, and journalists, as well as the closure of independent media outlets and civil society groups.
The Chinese government has defended the law, saying that it is necessary to protect national security and maintain social stability. However, critics say that it is being used as a tool to crush dissent and stifle any criticism of the government.
The sentencing of Wang is likely to send a chilling message to other activists and dissidents in China who are already facing a hostile environment. Many are worried that they too may be targeted, especially if they have ties to foreign organizations or have advocated for greater democracy and human rights.
The international community has also expressed concern over the Chinese government's increasing crackdown on dissent. The US and other Western countries have imposed sanctions on Chinese officials and companies for alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.
Some experts say that the US and its allies should do more to pressure China to respect human rights and stop the persecution of dissidents and activists. They argue that economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and public condemnation may be effective in forcing the Chinese government to change its policies.
However, others caution that such efforts may backfire and lead to a further deterioration of China's relations with the rest of the world. They argue that a more nuanced approach may be needed, taking into account China's domestic politics and its position as a rising global power.
For now, Wang Dan remains in prison, serving an 11-year sentence for what he claims are trumped-up charges. His case is likely to continue to attract international attention and scrutiny, as the Chinese government's crackdown on dissent shows no signs of abating.
