In a recent interview with CNBC, prominent U.S. businessman, Jack Ma, has urged China to make real changes to their economy in order to continue to grow and evolve as a world power, as well as to be accepted as a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Ma, who is the co-founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant, Alibaba Group, stated that "it's not just about making promises or writing documents, it's about making real changes in the economy" in order to meet the requirements for joining the organization.
China's economic growth has been a topic of discussion for many years, with some arguing that the country has grown too quickly without enough regulation, leading to issues such as environmental concerns and a lack of protection for intellectual property rights.
Ma stated that China needs to prioritize the environment, as well as focus on innovation in their economy, in order to continue to grow and evolve in a sustainable manner.
"I think innovation is the key to the future of China," said Ma. "It's really important to have more entrepreneurs because they are the ones that will create the new industries of the future."
Ma's comments come amid ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, with both countries imposing tariffs on each other's goods. However, Ma sees this as an opportunity for China to shift their focus from exports to domestic consumption.
"The trade war is actually a great opportunity for China," said Ma. "If we can build up a consumption-driven economy, then we won't be dependent on exports anymore."
China has made efforts to open up their economy in recent years, including lifting restrictions on foreign investment and reducing tariffs on certain products. However, critics argue that these measures are not enough.
Ma stressed the importance of China's participation in the global economy, stating that "China can't be isolated from the world. We need to work with other countries, not just the U.S., to be part of the global economy."
In addition to calling for change in China's economy, Ma also criticized the U.S.'s approach to the trade war, stating that "nobody can stop the globalization" and that "the world needs an open trading system."
As the trade war continues, it remains to be seen if China will take Ma's advice and make real changes to their economy. However, with Ma's influential position in the world of business, his comments are sure to spark further debate and discussions about China's role in the global economy.
