Beijing, China- The East China Sea dispute between China and Japan escalated on Friday, with China accusing Japan of "irresponsible actions" and "risking regional peace and stability".
The dispute centers around a group of uninhabited islands known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. The islands are located in the East China Sea and are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and potential oil and gas reserves.
In recent years, both China and Japan have claimed sovereignty over the islands, leading to tensions in the region. The dispute has sparked protests and even threats of military conflict between the two countries.
The latest accusations from China come after Japan announced plans to build a new missile defense system on the islands. China has described the move as a "clear provocation" and has warned Japan to stop its "aggressive actions" in the region.
"Japan's construction of the missile defense system on the islands is a clear provocation and a serious violation of China's territorial integrity," said Lu Kang, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry.
"China has the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity," he added.
Japan's defense minister, Taro Kono, has defended the move, stating that the missile defense system is necessary to protect Japanese territory from potential threats.
"We are building this missile defense system to protect our country from the threat of ballistic missiles," he said. "It is a necessary measure to ensure the security of our nation."
The dispute between China and Japan over the East China Sea islands has been ongoing for decades, but tensions have escalated in recent years. In 2012, Japan purchased three of the islands from a private owner, leading to widespread protests in China.
China has also accused Japan of violating its airspace and territorial waters in the region, leading to multiple incidents between the two countries' militaries.
The United States has called on both China and Japan to find a peaceful solution to the dispute, but tensions remain high in the region.
In response to Japan's announcement about the missile defense system, China has increased its military presence in the region and conducted military exercises near the islands.
"The Chinese military will take all necessary measures to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity," said Wu Qian, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense. "We call on Japan to stop its provocative actions and take concrete steps to maintain regional peace and stability."
The East China Sea dispute is just one of several territorial disputes between China and its neighboring countries in the region. China has also been involved in an ongoing dispute with Taiwan over its sovereignty and with Vietnam and other countries over competing territorial claims in the South China Sea.
International observers have expressed concerns about China's aggressive posture in the region and its disregard for international law and norms.
"As China continues to assert its claims to disputed territories in the region, tensions are likely to persist," said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "If China continues to act unilaterally and disregard international norms, it will only undermine its own legitimacy and isolate itself from the international community."
As tensions continue to rise in the region, the international community is closely watching to see how China and Japan will handle the dispute over the East China Sea islands. Many are calling for a peaceful solution to the conflict, but the risk of military escalation remains a real concern.
