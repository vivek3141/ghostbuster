Australia is playing a leading role in the push to keep the global nuclear test ban treaty alive, with Foreign Minister Marise Payne urging United Nations member states to support a new General Assembly resolution on the issue.
Speaking at a virtual meeting of high-level officials on Wednesday, Minister Payne warned that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) was under threat due to the failure of some countries to ratify the agreement.
"We need to continue our efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, including by maintaining the moratorium on nuclear testing," she said. "That is why we are calling on the international community to support this new resolution, which reinforces our collective commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons."
The CTBT, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1996, bans all nuclear explosions for both civilian and military purposes. To date, 184 countries have signed the treaty, including Australia, but only 170 have ratified it.
Among the countries that have not ratified the CTBT are the United States, China, India, Israel, North Korea, and Pakistan, which are all considered to possess nuclear weapons. Russia has signed but not ratified the treaty.
The failure to ratify the treaty by some countries has led to concerns about the possibility of a renewed nuclear arms race. In August, the US carried out its first underground nuclear test in 28 years, prompting condemnation from arms control activists.
Minister Payne said that the new resolution, which is expected to be put to a vote in the General Assembly in November, would reiterate the importance of the CTBT and call on all countries to ratify it.
"We urge all states that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the CTBT without delay," she said. "Australia continues to strongly support the objectives of the CTBT and we remain committed to playing our part in ensuring a safer world for us all."
The push for the new resolution comes amid growing concerns about the state of global arms control. In August, the US withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which had been in place since 1987, citing alleged Russian violations of the agreement.
The US has also requested talks with Russia on the extension of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads each country can possess. The treaty is set to expire in February 2021, and there are fears that it may not be renewed.
Australia is not a party to the START treaty, but Minister Payne said that it was an essential part of the global arms control architecture.
"Australia has consistently called on the US and Russia to extend the New START Treaty for a further five years," she said. "The treaty has helped to support strategic stability and reduce the risk of nuclear conflict between the US and Russia. Its renewal would be an important step towards securing a safer world for us all."
The new resolution on the CTBT is expected to receive widespread support from UN member states, but it remains to be seen whether it will have any effect on the countries that have not ratified the agreement.
In the meantime, Australia and other supporters of the treaty will continue to push for its universal ratification, as well as for the renewal of other key arms control agreements.
"The challenges we face in maintaining international peace and security are significant," Minister Payne said. "But we remain committed to working with our partners to address them, and to promoting a world free of nuclear weapons."
