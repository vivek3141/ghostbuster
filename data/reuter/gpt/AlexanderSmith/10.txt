Halifax Building Society, one of the largest mortgage lenders in the United Kingdom, has announced that it will no longer operate as a mutual society, moving instead to become a public limited company. The move is expected to provide the company with greater flexibility to raise capital and invest in new technologies, whilst also protecting it from potential takeover attempts.
For several years, Halifax's board has contemplated the decision to convert to a public limited company, with the vote finally landed in favour of the proposal following a successful ballot carried out amongst the company's 360,000 members. Whilst hesitant about the move in the past, Halifax's board members recognised the need to make a change in light of recent industry changes.
The transformation means that the Halifax Building Society will complete what has been described as the ‘last of the great building society conversions’, with the society becoming Britain's first local savings and loan institution to convert into a public limited company. The decision to convert has already been approved by the UK financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
Following this decision, Halifax will now require approval from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) before completing the transformation. Halifax's chairman, Mark Wrigley, said in a statement, "We are thrilled that our members have endorsed this important decision. The conversion of the Halifax Building Society into a public limited company will allow the bank to keep pace with the changes taking place within the banking industry whilst being able to continue to offer great value savings and mortgages to our customers. We are confident that our new structure will allow us to remain independent and avoid any future takeover attempts."
The move follows a wave of closures in recent years from UK building societies. Many smaller mutual societies have suffered as a result of the competitive nature of the mortgage market and the low interest rates imposed by the UK government to help revive the economy. On the other hand, Halifax has fared relatively well, with the company successfully competing with rival lenders for a significant proportion of the UK mortgage market.
One of the biggest advantages of becoming a public limited company will be for Halifax to raise new capital from institutional investors, allowing the company to invest in new technology to improve customer experience and secure its competitive position. Halifax's board has also noted that the change will allow the bank to operate in a similar way to other large UK lenders.
Whilst the move has been largely welcomed, some members have voiced concerns over whether the conversion will leave customers worse off. As a building society, Halifax's owners were its customers, meaning that profits were returned to members through reduced interest rates on their mortgages or better savings rates. After the conversion to a public limited company, there will be a significant increase in shareholders who, some argue, may be more focused on keeping profits for themselves rather than providing the best products and services to customers.
However, Mr Wrigley reassured members that despite the conversion, the bank remains committed to offering excellent products at competitive rates. "We are proud of our customer service record and are confident that this change will enable us to maintain our commitment to our customers. Our excellent track record of providing good value products and services, coupled with our strong capital base, sets us apart from our competitors and makes us confident in our ability to continue to grow and expand while remaining independent."
The PRA is set to make a decision on Halifax's conversion in the coming weeks, with the building society set to become a public limited company by the end of the year, following official approval. Once the transformation is complete, Halifax will become one of the UK's largest listed banks and will, in the eyes of many, cement its place as one of the leading mortgage lenders in the country.
