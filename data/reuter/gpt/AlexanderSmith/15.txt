Invesco Plc, the worldwide independent investment management company, has announced that it will merge with AIM Management Group Inc. to create one of the largest and most comprehensive investment management businesses in the world. The merger is anticipated to create a company with assets under management (AUM) exceeding $1.2 trillion, boosting Invesco's existing AUM of around $980 billion with AIM's $200 billion.
In a joint statement, the two companies revealed that the merger is expected to enable them to expand their range of investment solutions further, broaden distribution channels and leverage their respective investment capabilities and expertise to present superior investment opportunities for their customers globally.
"The merger of Invesco and AIM offers both companies a unique opportunity to leverage our shared strengths and capabilities to meet the evolving investment needs of institutional and retail investors worldwide," said Martin L. Flanagan, the president and CEO of Invesco. "Combined, our firms will serve a vast array of clients across geographies, time zones, and investment landscapes, while providing innovative solutions through enhanced scale and capabilities."
"This merger strengthens AIM's global footprint and expands our investment capabilities to provide our mutual fund shareholders with an even more extensive and diversified world-class range of investment solutions," said John Hawke, AIM's chairman and CEO.
Invesco, which was founded in 1935 and is headquartered in the United Kingdom, has over 7,000 employees worldwide and operates in 20 countries. It provides investment solutions for institutional clients and individual investors in numerous investment categories, including active, passive, and alternative strategies. AIM Management Group, based in Houston, is one of America's leading investment managers, providing investment advisory services to individuals, family offices, pension plans, and endowments.
Following the completion of the merger, Invesco's equity investment capabilities would be super-enhanced, as AIM Management Group's long and strong track record in managing growth equity investments would be added to its top-notch range of investment solutions.
The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be completed in Q4 2021. However, the financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed.
If completed, the merger will create a new investment management giant with offices all over the world, generating powerful expertise in key areas of the world's financial markets. Additionally, the merger is expected to provide a unique opportunity to capture cost synergies and growth opportunities, which would benefit both firms' clients, shareholders, and employees.
