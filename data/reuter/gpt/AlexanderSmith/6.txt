Cable & Wireless Communications (CWC) has achieved a landmark merger during a time when consolidation in the telecommunications industry has become key to survival. The British telecoms company has undergone a transformation after merging with Liberty Global's subsidiary, Virgin Media. This merger has enabled CWC to become Britain's largest cable television company, and operate under the Virgin Media brand.
The merger will create a formidable rival to other telecommunications providers such as BT and Sky. The combination brings together both companies' expertise and networks in providing broadband, cable, mobile, and landline services. By uniting, Virgin Media and CWC have produced an empire that delivers a collective portfolio of TV, broadband, phone and mobile services to around 6.5 million households.
Cable & Wireless has significantly expanded their television services since the merger that took place on June 2015. The merger enabled CWC to offer more television channels, alongside their broadband and phone services, which have been in heavy demand due to the lockdown. The company has tripled the amount of its TV subscribers over the past year, placing it ahead of the competition.
The new company will also provide many added benefits to its customers, including the ability to bundle mobile and fixed-line services. In addition, the company will have access to over 15,000 Wi-Fi hotspots across the United Kingdom. Virgin Media also has plans to expand into 5G, and with the addition of CWC's mobile network, the combined company has the potential to launch Britain's first converged 5G offering.
"We are incredibly excited to be expanding the Virgin Media brand in the UK through our merger with CWC,” said Lutz Schüler, CEO of Virgin Media, “We will be able to meet the increasing demand for ultrafast broadband, as well as offering a comprehensive range of products and services to UK consumers and businesses."
Mike Fries, CEO of Liberty Global, also said: "This is a significant opportunity for Virgin Media and CWC to combine their industry-leading services to provide a range of integrated communication and entertainment packages to UK consumers."
Virgin Media and CWC have faced some backlash from adversary competitors over their merger plans. BT Openreach and Sky believe the merger will produce a powerhouse that will dominate the market, leaving little space for smaller rivals. Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, has suggested that the deal could threaten competition in the UK.
However, the CEO of Virgin Media believes the merger will encourage the competition and create more opportunities for smaller companies. “We’re confident the merger will help drive competition, innovation, and investment in the UK.” Mr Schüler has promised that the merged company will go above and beyond to deliver for customers.
The new merger has become one of the most significant developments in the telecommunications industry in recent years. It has created a new world of possibility for CWC, which grew into the billion-dollar company over the years. The merger has enabled the company to expand its service portfolio, making it more competitive in what is becoming an increasingly challenging marketplace.
The future is looking bright for Cable & Wireless Communications, which has transformed into a new behemoth of the telecommunications industry. As the company continues to grow and innovate, it is sure to face many challenges, but its leadership is confident in its ability to overcome them and continue providing world-class services to its customers.
