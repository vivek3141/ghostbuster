In light of recent high-profile incidents in the financial sector, regulators and politicians are putting pressure on financial firms to implement razor-sharp management practices. The demand for heightened oversight and better risk management is amplified as the financial world is changing rapidly and the consequences of bad management decisions can have a catastrophic impact not only on the firms themselves, but also on the global economy.
In the wake of scandals such as the Archegos Capital Management implosion and the GameStop saga, regulatory authorities are calling on firms to not only strengthen their balance sheets but also integrate robust risk management techniques. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has proposed a series of new rules that would require companies to have more effective risk assessment and controls in place, and to disclose more information on their trading activities. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has recently declared that firms should prioritize “early detection, strong internal controls, and diligent preparation” in order to stay ahead of potential risks.
Financial institutions have been under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers as well. Senators Sherrod Brown and Elizabeth Warren have been particularly vocal, pushing for tighter regulation over Wall Street. Senator Brown, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, has stated that he believes “big banks need to do more to protect the economy from risky behavior, and regulators need to hold them accountable when they don’t.” Meanwhile, Senator Warren has been a vocal critic of both the SEC and the Federal Reserve, arguing that they have been too soft on financial institutions.
The calls for sharper management are also being echoed by investors. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently stated that he expects companies to have “stronger risk management processes and protocols,” and that he believes it is a necessary factor for companies to be added to BlackRock’s investable universe. This is a significant statement given BlackRock’s enormous influence over the world of finance, with assets under management of more than $9 trillion.
Moreover, these heightened expectations are leading to increased demand for professionals who can help firms manage risk more effectively. That includes an array of positions, from auditors and compliance officers to risk managers and lawyers. In fact, recruiting firms have stated that they have seen a significant uptick in requests for individuals with these kinds of specialized skill sets.
There is no doubt that the challenges facing financial firms are substantial. However, those that develop and implement sound risk management frameworks will be able to operate more effectively, in a more transparent manner. The benefits of such a shift may not always be immediately apparent, but the long-term consequences of failing to address them will undoubtedly be felt deeply.
In conclusion, the calls for “razor-sharp” management in the world of finance are not going away. Regulators, lawmakers, investors, and even recruiting firms are all emphasizing the need for financial firms to prioritize risk management. In a rapidly changing world, firms that do not adapt to these new realities will find themselves increasingly marginalized, while those that adopt these practices will be better positioned to not only weather any potential crises but also thrive in a more uncertain world.
