Cable & Wireless shares have soared after the company announced a deal to merge with Liberty Global's Virgin Media, creating the UK's largest cable operator.
The deal, valued at $31 billion, will combine the two companies’ expertise in TV, broadband, and mobile services. The newly formed company will be called Virgin Media O2, with Liberty Global retaining a 50.1% stake and Telefonica, the owners of O2, holding 49.9%.
The announcement has sent Cable & Wireless shares up by 21%, with investors eagerly anticipating the benefits of the merger. The new company will have a total customer base of around 46 million across the UK and Ireland.
The merger will also bring together two of the UK's biggest brands, Virgin and O2, which are both known for their quality products and superior customer service. The new company is expected to invest heavily in improving its network infrastructure, providing customers with faster and more reliable internet speeds.
“This is a transformational merger that will create a true national champion in the UK telecommunications industry, with a strong balance sheet, significant synergies, and a clear leadership position in the market,” said Mike Fries, CEO of Liberty Global.
The merger is also expected to create significant cost savings for the companies, with estimated synergies of around $7.6 billion over the next five years. These savings will be achieved through cross-selling opportunities, improved network efficiency, and the consolidation of back-office functions.
The deal has been approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to be completed by mid-2021, subject to regulatory approval. The merger will also require approval from the European Union, which will assess the deal's impact on competition.
The announcement of the merger has been welcomed by industry experts, who have praised the companies' strategic vision and the potential benefits of the deal. The merger is seen as a response to the growing competition from telecoms giants such as BT and Sky, who have been investing in their networks and expanding their services in recent years.
“This merger is a game-changer for the UK telecoms industry, providing a new challenger to BT and Sky, with a broader range of services and a stronger competitive position,” said James Barford, analyst at Enders Analysis.
The new company is also expected to increase competition in the mobile market, which is currently dominated by the big four players, O2, Vodafone, EE, and Three. The merger will give Virgin Media O2 access to O2's mobile network, enabling it to offer a wider range of mobile services to its customers.
The merger is also expected to create new job opportunities, with the new company planning to hire around 2,000 new staff in the UK over the next two years. This will include hiring new engineers to improve its network infrastructure and customer service agents to support its growing customer base.
The announcement of the merger has been warmly welcomed by customers across the UK, who are excited about the new company's potential to deliver better-quality services. The new company aims to become a national champion, focused on delivering the best possible experience for its customers.
In conclusion, the merger between Cable & Wireless and Liberty Global's Virgin Media is a significant development in the UK telecoms industry, creating a new challenger to BT and Sky. The newly formed company, Virgin Media O2, has the potential to become a national champion, with a strong balance sheet, significant synergies, and a clear leadership position in the market. The merger is expected to bring significant benefits to customers, including faster internet speeds, improved mobile services, and better customer service. It is an exciting time for the UK telecoms industry, and customers can look forward to a new era of improved services and increased competition.
