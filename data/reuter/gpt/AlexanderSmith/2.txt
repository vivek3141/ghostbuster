Liberty International Holdings has announced its entry into the British pensions market through a partnership with Hermes Investment Management and BT’s Pension Scheme.
The deal involves the acquisition of Hermes’ multi-employer pension trust, which has more than 100,000 members and assets under management of £3.5bn ($4.8bn).
Liberty International Holdings, a financial services company headquartered in Bermuda, said the partnership would enable it to expand its presence in the UK and provide enhanced services to its clients.
“The acquisition of Hermes’ pension trust and our partnership with BT’s Pension Scheme reinforces our commitment to offering high-quality retirement solutions and growing our business in the UK,” said Jason McDonald, CEO of Liberty International Holdings.
“We are delighted to partner with Hermes, a respected leader in the pensions industry, and BT’s Pension Scheme, one of the largest schemes in the UK.”
The partnership will see Liberty International Holdings take on responsibility for administering and managing the pension trust, while working with BT’s Pension Scheme to provide investment management and advice.
“This partnership brings together the strengths of three organisations to deliver better outcomes for pension scheme members,” said Saker Nusseibeh, CEO of Hermes Investment Management.
“We look forward to working with Liberty International Holdings and BT’s Pension Scheme to ensure the continued success of the multi-employer pension trust.”
BT’s Pension Scheme, which has more than 300,000 members and assets under management of £55bn ($76bn), said the partnership would enable it to focus on its core business.
“We are pleased to partner with Liberty International Holdings to ensure the continued success of our multi-employer pension trust,” said Paul Spencer, chief investment officer of BT’s Pension Scheme.
“This enables BT’s Pension Scheme to focus on the delivery of our core mission – meeting our members’ retirement needs securely and sustainably.”
The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
Liberty International Holdings has been expanding its business in recent years, with a focus on providing retirement solutions. Last year, it acquired a controlling stake in a Brazilian life insurance company and entered the Indian market through a joint venture.
The move into the UK pensions market comes as the industry faces increased scrutiny over issues such as governance, investment fees, and the use of default funds.
However, experts say that partnerships between industry participants can lead to better outcomes for pension scheme members.
“Partnerships between asset managers and pension schemes can bring benefits such as improved investment performance, cost savings, and better risk management,” said Moira O’Neill, head of personal finance at interactive investor.
“However, it’s important that pension scheme members are kept informed about any changes to their investments, and that their interests are put first.”
