Invesco Ltd. has announced its plans to acquire AIM Management in a deal worth $1.6 billion. The merger will create one of the world's largest investment management companies with $1.2 trillion in assets under management.
The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approval. Following the completion of the merger, the new company will operate under the Invesco name and be based in Atlanta.
In a statement released on Tuesday, Invesco CEO, Martin Flanagan said, "We believe this combination will create a best-in-class investment management firm that will be well-positioned to serve clients globally." He added, "This deal aligns with our strategy to enhance our investment capabilities, meet evolving client needs, and create significant value for our shareholders."
AIM Management, based in Houston, is an investment management firm with a focus on delivering innovative and customized investment solutions to its clients. The company manages assets across a range of asset classes, including equities, fixed income, and real estate.
Invesco, on the other hand, is a global investment management firm with a focus on active management. The company offers a range of investment solutions across equities, fixed income, and alternative strategies. Invesco has a presence in more than 25 countries, with offices in Atlanta, New York, London, and Hong Kong, among others.
The merger is expected to bring significant benefits to both companies. Invesco will gain access to AIM Management's expertise in private markets, including real estate and private equity. This will enable the company to expand its alternatives offering, which has become increasingly popular with investors.
AIM Management, on the other hand, will benefit from Invesco's presence in key markets around the world. The merger will enable AIM Management to expand its global distribution capabilities and access new clients in regions such as Europe and Asia.
The deal comes at a time when the investment management industry is going through a period of rapid change. Investors are increasingly turning to cheaper, passive investment solutions such as exchange-traded funds, putting pressure on active investment managers like Invesco and AIM Management to deliver returns that justify their higher fees.
The merger will create a larger, more diversified investment management company that is better positioned to navigate these changes and deliver value to investors. The new company will have a broader range of investment capabilities, enabling it to offer customized solutions that meet the evolving needs of its clients.
In a joint statement, the CEOs of Invesco and AIM Management, Martin Flanagan and Lisa O'Connor, said, "We believe this merger will create a company uniquely positioned to provide clients with the investment solutions they need to succeed in today's changing market environment."
The announcement of the merger has been welcomed by investors and analysts, who see it as a positive move for both companies. Shares of Invesco rose by 5% following the announcement, while shares of AIM Management were up by 6%.
The merger is the latest in a series of deals in the investment management industry. In March, Franklin Templeton completed its acquisition of rival investment manager Legg Mason in a deal worth $4.5 billion. In January, Morgan Stanley completed its acquisition of E*TRADE Financial in a deal worth $13 billion.
The Invesco-AIM Management merger is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approval. The new company will have a presence in more than 25 countries and manage assets of $1.2 trillion, making it one of the largest investment management firms in the world.
