KPMG, one of the world's largest professional services firms, is on track for revenue growth thanks to its investment in infrastructure and technology, according to the firm's chairman, Bill Thomas.
Thomas spoke to reporters at the firm's annual results briefing in London on Wednesday, announcing that KPMG's revenue had increased by 3.7% to Â£2.3bn in the UK last year.
He attributed the growth to the firm's investment in new technologies and infrastructure, which he said had helped to drive efficiencies and improve client services.
"Our investment in technology and infrastructure has enabled us to modernise our business and build deeper relationships with our clients," Thomas said. "We're seeing the benefits of this in our revenue growth and our ability to deliver more value to our clients."
KPMG has been investing heavily in new technologies in recent years, including artificial intelligence and advanced data analytics, which the firm says are helping it to deliver more innovative and efficient services to its clients.
The firm has also been investing in infrastructure to support its growing business, including a new office in London's Canary Wharf and a new data centre in Bristol.
Thomas said that the investments were starting to pay off, with the firm seeing strong growth in a number of key areas, including audit and advisory services, as well as tax and financial reporting.
The firm's success has also been bolstered by its focus on sustainability and corporate responsibility, which Thomas said had become increasingly important for clients and employees alike.
"We recognise the importance of sustainable business practices and the role that we can play in promoting them," he said. "This is not only good for our clients and the environment, but it's also good for our business by attracting and retaining the best talent."
Despite the positive results, Thomas acknowledged that the firm still faced challenges, including ongoing uncertainty over Brexit and the increasing regulatory pressures facing the accounting industry.
He called for greater clarity on Brexit and urged the government to provide more support for UK businesses to help them navigate the complexities of the UK's departure from the EU.
He also stressed the need for the accounting industry to maintain high standards and regain public trust, following a number of high-profile scandals that have undermined confidence in the sector.
"We recognise that we have a responsibility to rebuild public trust in our profession and to ensure that we maintain the highest ethical and professional standards," he said.
Overall, however, Thomas was optimistic about KPMG's future prospects, saying that the firm remained committed to delivering innovative and efficient services to clients, and to investing in the technologies and infrastructure that would help to drive growth.
"We're confident that our investment in the future will continue to pay off, not just in terms of revenue growth but also in terms of our ability to make a positive impact on the world," he said. "That's what our clients want, and that's what we're here to deliver."
