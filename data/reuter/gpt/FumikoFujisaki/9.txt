Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. is set to acquire a majority stake in CIGNA's Japanese unit as part of its ambitious growth strategy.
The Japanese insurer is expected to complete the acquisition of 51% of CIGNA Life Insurance Co. by the end of 2021, pending regulatory approval.
Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. aims to steer growth with the acquisition, as it enters into the health and life insurance sector along with its traditional property-casualty insurance business.
The move will also help CIGNA streamline its operations following a strategic review of its international insurance portfolios.
CIGNA Life Insurance Co., which has roots in Japan dating back to 1987, provides various life and health insurance products, including individual life insurance, universal life insurance, and medical insurance.
The insurance unit has suffered some hit in recent years due to changes in financial regulations and low-interest rates.
Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. seeks to invigorate the unit with increased capital while taking advantage of the growing demand for health and life insurance among the country's aging population.
"As the Japanese market continues to evolve, we are excited to partner with CIGNA to offer a wider range of products to strengthen our customer experience and competitive advantage," said Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co.'s President and CEO, Akio Kiyotani.
The deal also marks the latest move in a wave of consolidation in the Japanese insurance industry driven by changing demographics and intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The deal follows Nippon Life Insurance's announcement in September 2020 that it would acquire 85% of the shares in MassMutual Japan Ltd., the Japanese unit of U.S.-based MassMutual Financial Group.
The acquisition by Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. is expected to enhance the company's position in the competitive insurance market, with CIGNA also benefiting from a considerable capital injection to enhance its operational efficiency.
The terms of the transaction have not been disclosed. Still, Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. is expected to receive the financial backing required to grow its position in the Japanese insurance market better.
