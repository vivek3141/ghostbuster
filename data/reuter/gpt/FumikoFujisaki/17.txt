Analysts Say Collapse of Real Estate Company Borrowing From "Jusen" Mortgage Firms Has Limited Impact on Financial Industry
The collapse of a Japanese real estate company that borrowed heavily from "jusen" mortgage firms is unlikely to have a significant impact on the country's financial industry, analysts have said.
Real estate company, Sekisui House filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, with debts of around 2.3 billion yen (USD 20.8 million). The company had borrowed money from "jusen" mortgage firms â€“ entities that were established in the 1980s to support the country's then booming property market.
In the years that followed, however, many "jusen" firms themselves became overextended, and the Japanese government was forced to intervene in the late 1990s, bailing out the struggling institutions.
Today, "jusen" firms are largely defunct, but some continue to exist and lend money to companies like Sekisui House, which is said to have borrowed some 40 billion yen (USD 362 million) from the firms.
While the collapse of a company with such large debts would once have been a major concern for Japan's financial industry, analysts say that the impact of Sekisui House's bankruptcy is likely to be limited.
"The 'jusen' system is almost ancient history, so in terms of the wider financial system, the impact of Sekisui House's collapse is limited," said Tetsuo Ishihara, a senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
"The debts held by 'jusen' are already fully reserved, so the bankruptcy of a company like Sekisui House is unlikely to cause any significant problems," Ishihara added.
Indeed, the Japanese government has already indicated that it does not intend to take any action in relation to Sekisui House.
"We are not considering any measures such as a bailout or support for Sekisui House," Minister of Finance Taro Aso told reporters recently.
The collapse of Sekisui House is a reminder, however, of the dangers associated with excessive borrowing, particularly in the property sector.
In recent years, Japan's property market has seen a surge in prices, fueled in part by the government's economic stimulus measures. The boom has raised concerns that the country could be in the early stages of another property bubble, with house prices in some areas of Tokyo, for example, soaring by more than 30% in the past year.
Such a bubble, if it were to burst, could have wider implications for Japan's economy, which is already battling sluggish growth and deflation.
"Japan's economy is highly vulnerable to a property slowdown," said Ishihara. "If prices were to drop suddenly and significantly, it could have a big impact on the economy as a whole."
To prevent such a scenario, the government has introduced measures aimed at curbing speculation in the property market, including tighter restrictions on loan-to-value ratios and tighter regulations for real estate investment trusts.
Some analysts, however, have criticized the government for not doing enough to tackle the issue of excessive borrowing in the property sector.
"Japan's property market is still highly speculative, and that's a real problem," said Martin Schulz, senior economist at Fujitsu Research Institute.
"Until the government takes more decisive action to address this issue, there is a risk that companies like Sekisui House will continue to get into trouble, and that could have wider implications for the economy as a whole," he added.
Despite these concerns, however, most analysts are positive about Japan's economic outlook in the medium term, with GDP forecast to grow at a healthy rate of around 1.5% this year.
"Japan's economy is in a much better shape than it was 10 years ago," said Ishihara. "Of course, there are risks, but overall, the outlook is positive."
