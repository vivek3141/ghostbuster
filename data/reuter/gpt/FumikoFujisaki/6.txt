Nippon Life Insurance has recently announced its plan to set up a joint venture in the Philippines. This will make it the first Japanese insurer to sell life policies internationally.
The notable move by Nippon Life Insurance is part of its expansion plan in the Southeast Asian region. Currently, the company has a strong presence in Japan and North America and has been looking to grow its market share in other areas.
In a press release, Nippon Life Insurance revealed that it has formed a partnership with distribution network Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. The joint venture will provide life insurance services in the Philippines, catering to the country's rapidly expanding life insurance market.
With the country's middle class expanding, there is a growing demand for insurance products that provide income protection and coverage for medical expenses. The joint venture between Nippon Life and Insular Life Assurance aims to provide Filipinos with affordable and comprehensive insurance solutions that align with their financial goals.
Nippon Life Insurance has been on the lookout for opportunities to expand into the Southeast Asian market. The company has consistently cited the region's large and growing middle class as one of its key reasons for expansion.
The joint venture will enable the company to leverage Insular Life's strong market presence and distribution network in the Philippines. Insular Life is one of the oldest and largest insurance companies in the Philippines, with more than 100 years of experience in the life insurance market.
The partnership with Insular Life will also allow Nippon Life Insurance to tap into the Philippines' growing insurance market. The country's insurance industry has been growing at an annual rate of 6% for the past decade and is projected to reach a value of $18 billion by 2022, according to a report by global research firm Timetric.
Nippon Life Insurance has been expanding its business globally over the past decade, with a particular focus on Asia. In 2017, the company acquired a 40% stake in India's Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management. This marked the first time a Japanese insurer acquired a stake in an Indian asset management firm.
Moreover, the joint venture with Insular Life Assurance will allow Nippon Life Insurance to be present in the Philippines, which is the third-fastest growing economy in Asia. With its strong economic growth and expanding population, the Philippines presents a significant opportunity for Nippon Life Insurance.
In conclusion, the joint venture between Nippon Life Insurance and Insular Life Assurance is a significant development in the international life insurance industry. It presents a valuable opportunity for Nippon Life to expand its international business and tap into the rapidly growing Southeast Asian market. Additionally, it is an excellent opportunity for the Philippines to receive affordable and comprehensive insurance solutions that meet the financial goals of every individual.
