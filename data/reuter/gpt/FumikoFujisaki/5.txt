As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rock the global economy, Japan's top brokerage firms are feeling the impact of persistent market volatility and uncertainty. However, industry analysts are predicting that two out of the country's "Big Four" brokers are set to regain their financial health in the current business year, ending March 2021.
Nomura Holdings Inc. and Daiwa Securities Group Inc. are the two brokerage firms that analysts believe will be able to cope with the ongoing economic challenges and turn their fortunes around.
Nomura Holdings, which suffered heavy losses in previous years, is predicted to swing into a profit this year, thanks to a series of restructuring efforts and cost-cutting measures. The firm has also benefited from its exposure to growing industries such as renewable energy and asset management.
Daiwa Securities, meanwhile, is also expected to recover from a slump in profits caused by sluggish markets and low interest rates. The company has been expanding its insurance and real estate businesses and is likely to benefit from a rebound in the Japanese economy.
However, analysts caution that any recovery will be gradual and will depend on a number of external factors such as vaccine development, government stimulus measures, and global market conditions.
"The brokerage business is heavily dependent on market conditions, and the pandemic has made it more complex than ever before," said Masahi Yoshikawa, an analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. "The recovery will not be fast, but we believe that it is possible for these firms to regain their financial health in the coming years."
Japan's "Big Four" brokerage firms, including Nomura, Daiwa, SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. and Mizuho Securities Co., have been struggling to cope with the prolonged economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the firms have diversified into new businesses, including overseas operations and asset management, they have still been hit hard by the sharp decline in trading activity and a decrease in demand for investment products.
However, some analysts see potential for these firms to emerge stronger from the crisis by focusing on strategic investments and adapting to changing customer needs.
"Brokerages will need to have a more innovative approach to customer service and adapt to changing market conditions if they want to compete effectively in the future," said Yoshikawa. "There are still opportunities for these firms to grow and succeed, but it will require a certain level of agility and adaptability that may not have been their strong suit in the past."
The pandemic has also brought new challenges and opportunities to the brokerage industry, with many firms investing in technology and digital platforms to reach new customers and improve their communication and collaboration with clients.
"COVID-19 has accelerated the trend towards digitalization in the financial industry, and we are seeing more brokerage firms invest in cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data analytics," said Hiroki Kawai, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute.
"By embracing technology and innovation, these firms can offer more personalized and efficient services to their clients, and gain a competitive edge in the marketplace."
In conclusion, as Japan's "Big Four" brokerage firms struggle to navigate the ongoing economic challenges, analysts see potential for Nomura and Daiwa to regain their financial health in the current business year. However, any recovery will be gradual and dependent on a number of external factors, including market conditions and government policies. The brokerage industry will also need to adapt to a rapidly changing landscape, embracing innovation and digital transformation to stay ahead of the curve.
