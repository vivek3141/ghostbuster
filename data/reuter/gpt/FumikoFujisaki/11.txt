Tokyo, Japan- Nomura Securities, one of Japan's leading investment banks, has announced that its overseas subsidiaries have seen a significant surge in profits. The positive results were led by Europe, where the bank has been expanding its operations in recent years.
According to Nomura's latest financial report, profits from the bank's overseas subsidiaries increased by 43% to ¥18.5 billion ($172 million) in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021. The bank's expansion into Europe and the Americas was a key driver of this growth, with Europe alone accounting for around half of the increase.
Nomura has been focused on expanding its operations overseas in recent years, and these results show that the strategy is beginning to pay off. The bank has a significant presence in London, where it employs over 3,000 people, and has been seeking to expand further in Europe through acquisitions and partnerships.
The bank's success in Europe was driven by its strong performance in investment banking and sales and trading businesses. Nomura has been involved in several high-profile deals in Europe in recent years, including the initial public offering of German online retailer Zalando and the sale of British telecoms firm EE to BT.
In addition to Europe, the bank's subsidiaries in the Americas also saw significant growth, with profits up 27% to ¥2.4 billion ($22 million). The bank has been expanding its presence in the US, where it acquired boutique investment banking firm Greentech Capital Advisors last year.
Nomura's traditional stronghold in Asia also performed well, with profits from its subsidiaries in the region up 5% to ¥7.5 billion ($70 million). The bank's operations in Asia have seen increased competition in recent years, as other foreign banks seek to expand in the region.
Nomura's strong performance overseas comes at a time when the bank is seeking to recover from a series of high-profile setbacks. In March, the bank was hit by a $2 billion loss related to its involvement in the collapse of US hedge fund Archegos Capital Management. The incident led to the resignation of several top executives, including CEO Kentaro Okuda.
Nevertheless, Nomura remains optimistic about its future prospects. "We have been pushing ahead with our strategy of growing our overseas operations, and these results show that it is beginning to bear fruit," said CFO Takumi Kitamura. "There are still challenges ahead, but we believe that we are on the right path to long-term success."
Nomura's success overseas is also good news for Japan's economy, which has been struggling in recent years. The Japanese government has been seeking to encourage more companies to expand overseas in order to boost economic growth, and Nomura's results show that this strategy can be effective.
In conclusion, Nomura Securities' overseas subsidiaries have seen a significant increase in profits, with Europe leading the way. The bank's expansion into Europe and the Americas has paid off, with investment banking and sales and trading businesses driving growth. The bank's success comes at a time when it is seeking to recover from a series of setbacks, and demonstrates that its strategy of expanding overseas is working. Japan's government will no doubt be pleased with the bank's results, as it demonstrates that its strategy of encouraging more companies to expand overseas can be successful.
