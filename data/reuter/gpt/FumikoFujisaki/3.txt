In response to the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Japan has established a panel of experts to tackle the issue of problem loans and to increase liquidity in the country's real estate market.
The panel, which includes officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and the Financial Services Agency, among others, will examine the impact of the pandemic on the real estate market and propose solutions to assist struggling businesses and borrowers.
One of the main challenges facing Japan's real estate market is an increase in problem loans, particularly in the commercial real estate sector. The pandemic has led to a decline in consumer spending and business activity, resulting in financial strains for many property owners.
According to the Bank of Japan, the ratio of problem loans in the commercial real estate sector increased from 4.6% in December 2019 to 6.6% in June 2020. This upward trend is expected to continue as the pandemic continues to impact the economy.
To address this issue, the panel will consider measures to support distressed borrowers, such as loan restructuring and debt forgiveness. It will also explore ways to increase the availability of financing for businesses and individuals who are struggling to obtain credit.
In addition to addressing problem loans, the panel will also aim to increase liquidity in the real estate market. This will involve promoting investment in real estate and encouraging the development of new properties.
One potential solution that the panel may consider is the introduction of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), which allow investors to gain exposure to the real estate market without requiring large amounts of capital. REITs have been successful in other countries, such as the United States, and could provide a boost to Japan's struggling real estate market.
Another potential solution that the panel may consider is the relaxation of regulations around foreign investment in the real estate market. Currently, foreign investors face significant restrictions when investing in Japanese real estate, which limits the amount of capital that can be injected into the market.
By relaxing these regulations, Japan could attract more foreign investment, which could increase liquidity and spur development in the real estate sector.
The establishment of the panel was welcomed by industry experts, who have been calling for government intervention to address the challenges facing Japan's real estate market.
"Given the current economic environment, it is essential that the government takes action to support struggling businesses and borrowers," said Masahiro Mochizuki, a senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co.
"By increasing liquidity and promoting investment in real estate, the government can help to stabilize the market and support economic growth."
The panel is expected to submit its recommendations to the government by the end of the year. While it is too early to predict the exact measures that will be adopted, experts are hopeful that the panel's work will lead to a more stable and vibrant real estate market in Japan.
Overall, the establishment of the panel is a positive step towards addressing the challenges facing Japan's real estate market. By taking a collaborative and proactive approach, the government can help to stabilize the market and support economic growth in the years to come.
