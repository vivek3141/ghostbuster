Tokyo, Japan - Sueno Kosan, one of the largest trading companies in Japan, is facing bankruptcy worth $5.5bn, adding to the growing list of firms struggling in the country's financial industry.
The company, which is a major player in the energy, minerals and agricultural sectors, has struggled financially since the global oil price crash in 2014, and is now facing mounting debts and ongoing delays in projects.
Industry experts have described the news as a significant blow to the Japanese economy, which has been struggling with a sluggish growth rate and weak consumer spending for years.
"The collapse of a major player such as Sueno Kosan is a worrying sign for Japan's future economic outlook," said Keiji Tachibana, an economist at the Tokyo Institute of Technology.
The news follows a string of high-profile bankruptcies in the country's financial sector, including those of Toshiba and Takata last year, which had a significant impact on the country's stock market.
"Sueno Kosan's bankruptcy will undoubtedly affect Japan's financial stability and raise concerns among investors," said Hiromi Saito, an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities.
The firm's troubles began in 2014 when the global oil price crash severely impacted its oil and gas business, leading to a downturn in profits.
The company attempted to diversify its portfolio into new industries, including renewable energy, but many of these projects faced delays and falling demand.
The firm's accumulated debts now stand at around $5.5bn, including bonds and loans from Japan's major banks.
Sueno Kosan has been seeking additional financing and has engaged in discussions with potential investors, but the lack of concrete progress has forced the company to consider bankruptcy as an option.
The collapse of the company is set to affect hundreds of thousands of customers who have invested in the firm's bonds, as well as its employees and suppliers.
The Japanese government is set to announce a rescue plan for the company, with measures including financial assistance and the possibility of a bailout.
However, many experts have warned that the government's efforts may not be enough to prevent further bankruptcies in the country's financial industry.
"The government's response is a step in the right direction, but it is not a permanent solution," said Tachibana.
Experts point to the need for greater regulation and oversight in the country's financial sector, with concerns over lax corporate governance measures and a lack of transparency in reporting financial data.
The fall of Sueno Kosan is a stark reminder of the need for Japan's financial industry to reform and adapt to an increasingly global and complex economic environment.
