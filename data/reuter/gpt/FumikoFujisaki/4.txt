A government panel in Japan has urged the full deregulation of markets in order to avoid falling behind globally as other countries make strides in various industries. The report published earlier this month contains recommendations for a range of deregulations, including those related to agriculture, construction, and healthcare.
The report, titled "Japan's Growth Strategy: Beyond COVID-19", is the result of a review by the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, which advises the Prime Minister's office on economic matters. The panel was chaired by Kazuo Momma, former executive director of the International Monetary Fund.
In his introduction to the report, Momma writes that Japan "needs to take bold measures to create new growth engines that will ensure a prosperous and sustainable future." He argues that full deregulation is necessary in order to allow new industries to flourish and create new jobs.
The report identifies several areas where deregulation could have a significant impact on Japan's economy. One of the areas highlighted is agriculture. Currently, Japan heavily regulates its agricultural industry, including the prices of rice and other crops. The report argues that these regulations are outdated and prevent the industry from reaching its potential.
The panel recommends that the government abolish all agricultural regulations, including those related to the production and sale of rice. This move would allow new players to enter the market and encourage innovation and competition.
Another area where the panel recommends deregulation is construction. Currently, Japan's construction industry is heavily regulated, including the approval process for new buildings. The report argues that these regulations stifle innovation and increase costs.
The panel recommends that the government streamline the construction approval process and abolish all regulations related to building codes. This would encourage new players to enter the market and allow for the development of new technologies and construction materials.
The healthcare industry is also identified as an area where deregulation could lead to significant growth. Currently, healthcare regulations in Japan restrict the use of telemedicine and limit the roles of non-physician providers, such as nurse practitioners.
The panel recommends that the government lift all restrictions on telemedicine and expand the roles of non-physician providers. This would improve access to healthcare in rural areas and allow the industry to adopt new technologies and practices.
The report concludes by stating that full deregulation is necessary if Japan is to remain competitive in the global marketplace. The panel argues that by adopting a "growth-oriented approach", Japan can create new growth engines and build a more sustainable economy.
Reaction to the report has been mixed. Some analysts argue that full deregulation could lead to social and economic inequality, while others applaud the panel for taking a bold stance on the issue.
Critics of the report argue that the panel has not taken into account the potential negative consequences of full deregulation. For example, deregulation of the healthcare industry could lead to increased costs for patients and a decrease in the quality of care.
Regardless of the criticisms, the report is likely to generate debate and discussion in Japan's political circles. As the country looks to recover from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, deregulation is likely to be a key issue in the coming years.
