The Japanese financial industry is slowly recovering following the impact of the pandemic, but smaller banks and loan institutions are experiencing lingering pain. The gradual recovery can be attributed to various factors, including fiscal stimulus measures, a rebound in exports, and rising demand for digital banking services.
According to Bank of Japan data, aggregate lending by Japanese banks to the private sector grew by 6.2% YoY in May 2021, the fastest pace in almost three decades. The rise in lending activity has been driven by the country's massive stimulus packages, including debt payments for small enterprises hit by the pandemic.
"Japan's economic recovery has been supported by stimulus measures, and the country is benefiting from a global rebound in economic activities," said Yoshimasa Maruyama, a senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
Additionally, a rebound in exports has been a significant driver of economic growth. Japanese exports surged by 49.6% YoY in May, driven by strong demand for semiconductors, cars, and steel products. The pick-up in exports has been attributed to resurgent consumer demand, particularly in the United States, China, and Europe, where vaccination rates have been high.
However, for smaller banks and loan institutions, the road to recovery has been challenging. These organizations have often been overlooked in the pandemic response as larger institutions and corporations attract the lion's share of government support. As a result, many smaller banks and loan institutions are struggling to stay afloat.
For these organizations, the pandemic has led to a rise in non-performing loans. According to a report by the Bank of Japan, non-performing loan ratios for regional banks and credit unions rose to a seven-year high of 1.84% in March 2021, up from 1.69% in December 2020.
The pain has been particularly felt in rural areas, where many small businesses have been unable to stay open during the pandemic. In response, banks have been tightening their lending standards, making it harder for entrepreneurs to access much-needed funds.
Some banks have also been forced to merge or restructure as they grapple with increasing pressure from low-interest rates and a shrinking customer base. For instance, Hachijuni Bank, located in Niigata Prefecture, will merge with five other regional banks in October to create a new banking group.
"Small banks face a structural challenge, and their business models need to change to ensure their survival," said Tsuyoshi Ueno, a senior economist at NLI Research Institute.
There are also concerns that smaller banks and loan institutions may be left behind in the rise of digital banking. Many younger Japanese consumers prefer to bank online or through mobile apps, which poses a challenge for smaller institutions that lack the resources to invest in such technology.
While the pandemic has accelerated the move towards digital banking, many smaller banks are struggling to keep up. The cost of developing and maintaining digital banking services can be prohibitively high, pushing many smaller banks out of the market.
Moreover, there is a risk that smaller banks' lack of digital capacity could lead to their exclusion from more extensive lending networks in the future, further compounding their problems.
The Bank of Japan is attempting to address these issues by increasing its support for smaller banks. The central bank launched a new loan program in May, aimed at providing cheaper funding to lenders that focus on small and medium-sized businesses.
"At a time when the economy is still struggling with the impact of the pandemic, we believe that this measure will support lending activities and stabilize financial markets," said Governor Haruhiko Kuroda.
The loan program aims to encourage smaller banks to increase their loans to SMEs, thereby supporting entrepreneurship and innovation. It is hoped that this support will help smaller lenders transition to new business models and invest in digital banking technologies.
In conclusion, while the Japanese financial industry is slowly recovering from the pandemic, smaller banks and loan institutions are facing significant challenges. The pandemic has highlighted the need for these banks to transition to new business models, including digital banking, to remain competitive in a rapidly-evolving industry.
The Bank of Japan's new loan program is one step towards addressing these issues, but more needs to be done to ensure that smaller banks do not get left behind in the recovery process. Ultimately, the success of Japan's financial industry depends on its ability to support all institutions, helping to foster a stable and thriving economy.
