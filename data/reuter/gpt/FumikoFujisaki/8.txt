Nomura Securities, one of Japan's largest brokerage firms, recently posted a half-year loss of Â¥62.6 billion ($591 million) for the period ending September 30th, 2020. This comes as a surprise to many industry experts, as Nomura's main competitors - Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho Financial Group, and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group - have all reported profits during the same period.
Nomura's disappointing results can be largely attributed to a decline in revenue from its overseas operations, particularly in the United States where it has been struggling to turn a profit in recent years. The company's revenue from its Americas division fell by 18.5% compared to the same period last year, and its European division saw a 21.4% decline in revenue.
In addition to this, Nomura also faced increased costs from restructuring and layoffs, which were implemented in an effort to cut costs and improve profitability. The company's CEO, Kentaro Okuda, acknowledged the challenges the company has been facing during a recent earnings presentation. "We realize the need for urgent action to improve our overseas performance," he said.
Meanwhile, Nomura's competitors have managed to weather the volatility of the financial markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, for example, saw profits rise by 2.2% during the same period, largely due to a surge in trading revenue. The company's president, Hironori Kamezawa, credited the strong results to "robust investment banking and markets businesses."
Similarly, Mizuho Financial Group posted a 14.8% increase in profits, with its trading revenue nearly doubling from the previous year. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group also reported a 23% increase in profits, largely driven by investment gains from its securities portfolio.
The divergence in performance between Nomura and its competitors highlights the challenges faced by Japanese financial institutions, particularly when it comes to expanding overseas. While Nomura has been struggling to compete with the likes of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in the highly competitive U.S. market, its rivals have been able to leverage their global networks to generate profits.
To overcome these challenges, Nomura has announced plans to scale back its international operations. The company will be exiting some of its less profitable businesses and focusing on areas where it has a strong competitive advantage, such as equity and fixed income trading in Asia.
Despite the challenges facing the company, Nomura remains optimistic about its future prospects. "We are making steady progress in our cost-reduction measures," said Okuda. "We will continue to focus on areas where we have a competitive edge, while actively pursuing new business opportunities."
Investors, however, remain cautious about the company's prospects. Nomura's stock price has fallen by over 20% this year, and analysts have warned that the company could face further challenges if global markets continue to struggle in the wake of the pandemic.
Overall, Nomura's half-year loss is a setback for the company, but it provides an opportunity for management to reassess its strategy and refocus on its core strengths. This will require tough decisions and a willingness to cut back in areas where the company is struggling, but it is a necessary step to ensure long-term sustainability and growth for Nomura Securities.
