Tokyo’s property market seems to be gaining the attention of Asian investors despite high prices in the past, according to a recent report by Kennedy-Wilson Managing Director, Tetsuro Miyashita. The report suggests an upswing in Tokyo’s property prices and an increased interest in the market from Asian investors.
After years of stagnant economic growth, Tokyo’s property market has started to gain momentum as prices reached a new high following the country’s economic recovery. This has not deterred overseas investors, especially those from Asian countries, who are increasing their investments in Tokyo’s property market with renewed enthusiasm.
According to Miyashita, the biggest draw for the Asian investors is Tokyo’s economic growth and strong population growth. With an estimated population of 13.5 million, Tokyo remains Japan’s most populated city and, as such, is an attractive target for foreign property investors who see it as a potentially profitable investment opportunity.
“Japan's capital market is benefiting from the strong economy, with rental income expected to continue to rise. This increased interest in Tokyo’s property market has brought about significant changes as well, which is a good thing for the market," Miyashita said. 
Miyashita’s report revealed that investors are particularly interested in central districts such as Chuo-ku and Minato-ku, which are known as prime areas for business and commerce. Miyashita also pointed out that one of the reasons why investors are drawn to these regions is due to the high demand for office space in these areas. 
While Miyashita acknowledged that the prices of properties in Tokyo’s central districts were steeper than in previous years, he said, “For investors who have established businesses in Tokyo, investing in these regions still represents good value for money, given the prospects of steady income in rental revenue."
Miyashita suggested that the increased investment in Tokyo’s property market is not limited to well-established businesses and that there has been a surge of investors from developing economies around Asia. In particular, he cited an increase in the number of companies from India and ASEAN nations who are making significant investments in Tokyo’s real estate.
Furthermore, he said that these investments are not simply limited to commercial property but also extend to residential and holiday properties as well. Miyashita said that property investment is becoming an increasingly popular choice for holiday homes among Asian investors due to the city's rich culture, safe environment, and excellent transportation infrastructure.
Miyashita added that Tokyo’s property prices are expected to stabilize following the recent positive economic growth. A significant increase in supply, including the construction of several new office buildings and rental apartments in the coming years, would have a moderating effect on prices and potentially make them more attractive to a wider range of investors.
Such reports, however, highlight another aspect of Japan’s property market: the issue of aging buildings. According to Miyashita, there are concerns that many investor-owned properties are aging and that the associated costs of repairing and renovating these properties may outweigh the benefits.
Despite these concerns, the overall outlook for Tokyo's property market remains very positive, according to Miyashita. He said that Japan's strong economic resurgence, coupled with the increased interest from foreign investors, has created a platform for steady growth in Tokyo’s property market for years to come.
