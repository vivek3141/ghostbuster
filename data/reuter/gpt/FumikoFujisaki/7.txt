Tokyo-based banking giant Nomura Holdings Inc. has reported a first-half loss of ¥255.6 billion ($2.3 billion) for the fiscal year 2021, citing challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Nomura, Japan’s largest brokerage and investment banking firm, announced its earnings on Wednesday, adding to a mixed picture of financial results from major brokers globally. While some major brokerage firms are reporting profits, Nomura’s first-half results show that it is yet to recover from the pandemic’s impact.
According to Nomura, the loss was largely due to a hit of ¥165.7 billion ($1.5 billion) in credit valuation adjustment (CVA), a complicated accounting practice used to estimate potential losses on derivatives. It also includes goodwill impairment, which reflects a non-cash charge that lowers the value of an asset.
“We recognize the challenges we must address, such as improving our cost structure, while also enhancing risk management and rebuilding client trust following issues arising from the Archegos incident,” said Nomura CEO Kentaro Okuda.
Meanwhile, other major brokerage firms such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan Chase reported better-than-expected profits and revenue growth for the first half of 2021. These firms’ earnings surge is attributed to the improving stock market and investors’ increasing appetite for risky assets. In particular, investment banking divisions have seen a significant rise in income from advising mergers and acquisitions, and underwriting stock and bond deals.
Goldman Sachs has reported a net profit of $10.8 billion for the first half of 2021, the firm’s second-highest-ever half-year earnings. The firm’s investment banking division, which advises clients on deals, generated revenues of $6.5 billion, up 83% from the same period last year.
Morgan Stanley posted a net profit of $11 billion for the first half, more than double its earnings during the same period last year. While the firm’s banking division saw a revenue gain of 26%, its trading division took a hit of 27% on fixed income business.
JPMorgan Chase has also reported a strong quarter, with net income of $11.9 billion for the first half, up 139% from the same period in 2020. The bank reported a solid performance across all its business segments, with its investment banking division contributing to a bulk of the revenue growth.
“The results clearly demonstrate that our diversified business model is resilient in a challenging environment,” said Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase chairman, and CEO.
The improving global economy and a rebound in the stock market have helped many financial institutions recover from the pandemic’s impact. However, Nomura’s loss shows that some firms are yet to fully recover, while others continue to face headwinds.
Nomura has faced various challenges this year, including a loss of over $2 billion in the Archegos Capital Management downfall, which hit several major banks globally. The company has also been hit by a scandal involving insider trading, which resulted in the resignation of its executives.
Nomura has said it is taking measures to rebuild its business and restore trust among its clients and investors. The company has announced plans to cut costs by almost 20% and shut down or merge some of its overseas units to focus on its more profitable businesses.
“We remain focused on implementing our strategy of optimizing capital and resources, increasing operational efficiency, and enhancing our product and service offering to help clients achieve their investment goals,” Okuda said.
Despite the challenges, Nomura shares have continued to perform well, gaining over 30% year-to-date. However, the company’s recent loss has highlighted the challenges it faces in catching up with its rivals.
In conclusion, the first half of 2021 has been a mixed bag for major brokerage firms globally. Some, like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan, have reported better-than-expected earnings, thanks to the improving economy and the rebound of the stock market. Meanwhile, Nomura, one of the largest bank and investment firms, is yet to recover fully, reporting a significant loss this half year. It remains to be seen whether Nomura can turn things around and catch up with its rivals in the coming year.
