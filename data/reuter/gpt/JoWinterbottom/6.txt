Legal action to ban Resale Price Maintenance (RPM) on non-prescription medicines in the UK is likely to boost competition and benefit some stores, say analysts. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has proposed the ban, citing that it would save consumers around Â£90 million a year by ending the practice of fixing prices on over-the-counter (OTC) medicines.
RPM is a pricing strategy used by manufacturers to set minimum prices for their products and prohibit retailers from selling them below that threshold. In the pharmaceutical industry, RPM is common, especially for OTC medicines like painkillers, antihistamines, and cold and flu remedies. Currently, RPM accounts for around 80% of non-prescription drugs sold in the UK.
The CMA argues that RPM leads to higher prices for consumers and restricts competition among retailers, as they cannot offer discounts or undercut their competitors. In its recent market study, the CMA found that RPM increased the average price of some OTC medicines by up to 70%, compared to countries where RPM does not exist.
The proposed ban on RPM would be a significant step towards increasing competition and lowering prices for consumers in the UK. If implemented, it could lead to supermarkets and discount stores offering cheaper OTC medicines compared to high-street pharmacies. This could benefit consumers looking for affordable healthcare products, especially during difficult economic times.
Analysts predict that the ban is likely to benefit retailers with large store networks and market dominance, such as Tesco, Asda, and Boots. These stores could offer better deals on OTC medicines and win market share from smaller independent pharmacies. On the other hand, high-street pharmacies like Lloyds, Well Pharmacy, and Superdrug may face increased competition and pressure to lower their prices.
However, some industry experts argue that banning RPM could have unintended consequences and harm smaller pharmacies in rural areas. They argue that the ban may lead to a "race to the bottom" in pricing, where only large stores with economies of scale can offer the cheapest prices. Smaller pharmacies may find it difficult to compete and eventually go out of business, leaving some communities without access to OTC medicines.
In response, the CMA has proposed a transitional period of five years to give smaller pharmacies time to adjust to the new competitive landscape. During this time, pharmacies would still be allowed to set the minimum prices of their OTC medicines but would have to compete on price with other retailers.
The proposed ban on RPM also raises questions about the role of the pharmaceutical industry in ensuring access to affordable healthcare products. Some argue that governments should play a more active role in regulating drug prices and promoting competition in the market. Others argue that innovation and investment in new drugs require incentives for manufacturers and a balance between price and access.
The CMA has opened a consultation on the proposed ban and will consider feedback from stakeholders, including retailers, manufacturers, and consumers. If approved, the ban could come into effect in 2022, subject to parliamentary approval.
In conclusion, the proposed ban on RPM on non-prescription drugs in the UK is likely to boost competition and benefit consumers and some retailers. However, the ban may have unintended consequences for smaller pharmacies and raise questions about the role of the pharmaceutical industry in ensuring access to affordable healthcare products. It remains to be seen how stakeholders will respond to the proposal and what the final outcome will be.
