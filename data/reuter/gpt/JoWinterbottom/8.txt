BSkyB, the British satellite broadcaster has denied speculations regarding its plans to bid for Pearson, the London-based publishing company. The denial comes after rumors of BSkyB's interest in Pearson had hit the market, increasing the value of Pearson's shares by over 8% on Monday.
The news of the acquisition bid surfaced in The Sunday Times, which reported that BSkyB had hired advisers to examine a potential £9bn ($12bn) takeover bid of Pearson. However, BSkyB was quick to deny any intention of such an acquisition. In a statement, BSkyB stated that they "routinely consider various acquisitions and divestments," but they were categorically denying any plans for a takeover of Pearson."
On Monday, Pearson's shares went up by around 8.3% to 784.2p, valuing the company at £9.3bn ($12.2bn), its highest level in three years. This reflected the investors' view that Pearson would be an attractive acquisition target, particularly given its recent restructuring and job cuts as part of efforts to adapt to tougher market conditions.
Pearson is the world's largest education company and the owner of the Financial Times newspaper. However, in recent years, its profitability has been challenged due to a decline in print revenues and significant technology disruption in the education industry. The company has responded by revamping its focus on digital education products, selling off non-core assets, and cutting thousands of jobs.
BSkyB, on the other hand, is a satellite broadcaster that has transformed into a major producer of TV content in recent years. It has been expanding internationally and adding to its own portfolio of program commissions, such as Riviera and Jamestown. The company is owned by US media giant Comcast, which acquired it in late 2018 in a deal worth £30bn ($39bn).
Many investors see the potential acquisition of Pearson by BSkyB as a logical move. Pearson's education-focused assets, when combined with BSkyB's offerings, could create a powerful presence in the education media space. Pearson's recent pivot toward digital education content is also well-aligned with the online video market that BSkyB has been expanding into in recent years.
This acquisition would also expand the scope of BSkyB's offerings, potentially placing them in direct competition with Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Apple TV. Another driver of the acquisition could be the fact that Pearson, the Financial Times' parent, would give BSkyB an entryway into the financial media world, which could be lucrative.
However, the proposed takeover would face many obstacles. Some analysts believe that the UK government would be unlikely to approve the deal due to media ownership regulations. Also, it is uncertain whether Pearson's board would be willing to sell the company. Furthermore, there could be other interested bidders, potentially driving up the price of the acquisition.
Despite the uncertainty, there is no doubt that BSkyB's denial of the acquisition has disappointed some investors who saw the acquisition as an attractive proposition. They may also have been hoping for a repeat of Comcast's acquisition of Sky in 2018, which saw a bidding war with Fox that ultimately led to Sky becoming part of the Comcast empire.
For now, the speculation has caused an increase in the value of Pearson's shares, but only time will tell whether a deal will ever materialize.
