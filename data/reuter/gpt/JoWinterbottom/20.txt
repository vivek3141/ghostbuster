The British government has blocked bids for the water and sewage utility company, South West Water, opening the door for the creation of a multi-utility company.
The decision was made by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Kwasi Kwarteng, who cited concerns over "national security and public safety" as the main reasons behind the block.
South West Water, which provides water and sewage services to roughly 1.7 million customers in the south-west of the UK, had been put up for sale in November 2020 by its parent company, Pennon Group.
According to reports, two private equity firms, iCON Infrastructure and KKR, had made offers for the company, each believed to be worth around Â£2.5 billion.
However, the government's decision to block the sale has come as a surprise to many, with some experts suggesting that the move could signal a major shift in the UK's approach to regulating foreign investment in its critical infrastructure.
The decision has also led to speculation that the government may now be looking to encourage the creation of multi-utility companies, which would bring together water, gas, and electricity services under one roof.
Speaking to the media, Kwarteng said that the government was "committed to ensuring that our critical infrastructure remains secure and resilient", adding that "it is clear that certain foreign actors seek to acquire our critical national infrastructure through hostile takeovers".
He went on to say that "we will continue to take all necessary steps to protect our national security and ensure that our infrastructure is not vulnerable to foreign interference".
The move has been welcomed by some in the industry as a bold step to protect the country's critical infrastructure. However, others have expressed concerns about the impact that the decision could have on investment in the sector.
Commenting on the news, Tony Smith, CEO of the Consumer Council for Water, said that "the water industry is changing rapidly, and we need secure investment to ensure that we have the funds to build the infrastructure of the future".
He went on to say that "we understand the government's concerns around national security, but we urge them to take a balanced approach that does not deter much-needed investment in the sector".
Meanwhile, some experts believe that the decision to block the sale of South West Water could pave the way for the creation of multi-utility companies, which could bring together water, gas, and electricity services under one roof.
John Longworth, CEO of the business group, the Centre for Brexit Policy, said that "the UK is currently lagging behind other European countries in terms of the integration of different utility services", adding that "we need to encourage the creation of multi-utility companies in order to improve efficiency and reduce costs for consumers".
The news comes as the UK government looks to implement a range of measures designed to strengthen its approach to national security and foreign investment in critical infrastructure.
Last year, the government announced a new National Security and Investment Bill, which gives the government greater powers to review and block foreign investment in critical infrastructure, including water companies.
Under the new legislation, any foreign investment in water companies will be subject to mandatory national security screening if the company provides services to more than 50,000 people, or if it is involved in the supply of drinking water or wastewater treatment.
The decision to block the sale of South West Water could therefore be seen as a sign of the government's commitment to implementing this new legislation and protecting the country's critical infrastructure.
Overall, the government's decision to block the sale of South West Water is likely to have far-reaching implications for the water industry and the wider utility sector.
While the move has been welcomed by some as a necessary step to protect the country's critical infrastructure, others have expressed concerns about the impact that the decision could have on investment in the sector.
However, with the government looking to encourage the creation of multi-utility companies, it seems likely that the sector will continue to undergo significant changes in the years ahead.
