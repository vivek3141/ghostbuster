Allan Leighton is no stranger to the retail industry, having previously worked as the CEO of Asda, Co-operative Group, Royal Mail, and Pace. He was recently appointed as the new CEO of Asda, taking over from Roger Burnley. His appointment came at a critical time for the retailer, as it was struggling to keep up with its rivals in the fiercely competitive UK retail market.
Leighton's appointment was seen as a bold move by Asda's parent company, Walmart. He is known for his strong leadership skills and for turning around struggling companies. His approach is to focus on the customer and to make sure that the company is offering what the customers want, rather than what the company thinks they should have.
Since taking over as CEO, Leighton has been busy putting his stamp on Asda. He has a clear vision for the company, which is to become the best supermarket chain in Britain, not just the biggest. He wants to create a shopping experience that is second to none, with customer service at its heart.
One of Leighton's first actions as CEO was to launch a ‘New Way of Working’ initiative. This involved restructuring the company, with the aim of making it a more agile and efficient organisation. As part of this initiative, the company removed layers of management, allowing decision-making to be made faster. The move was also designed to empower store colleagues, giving them more responsibility, and allowing them to make decisions that are best for their customers.
Leighton's focus on the customer is also reflected in the company's new 'value proposition'. Asda has always been known for its low prices, but Leighton is keen to show that the company is about more than just price. As part of this, the company has launched a new ad campaign, which focuses on the quality of its products, as well as its low prices.
The campaign, which is called 'You Can Count on Us', highlights Asda's commitment to quality, and its focus on sourcing the best ingredients for its products. The company has also launched a new range of premium products, under the brand name 'Extra Special'. These products are designed to appeal to customers who are looking for something a bit more special, but who still want to save money.
Leighton is also keen to show that Asda is committed to sustainability. The company has launched a new plastic reduction strategy, which aims to reduce the amount of single-use plastic in its stores by 15% by February 2021. As part of this, the company is removing plastic from its own-brand products, and is encouraging its suppliers to do the same.
Leighton is also investing heavily in the company's online operations, as he sees this as a key growth area for the future. Asda recently launched a new 'toyou' service, which allows customers to send and collect parcels from Asda stores. This service is designed to make shopping more convenient for customers, and to drive footfall to Asda stores.
As part of its online strategy, Asda is also investing in its online grocery delivery service. The company has recently launched a new same-day delivery service, which is available in selected areas. Leighton sees grocery delivery as a key growth area, and he wants to make sure that Asda is well-placed to take advantage of this trend.
Leighton's approach seems to be paying off. Asda recently reported a 0.5% increase in like-for-like sales for the third quarter of 2020. This was an improvement on the previous quarter, when the company reported a 0.7% decline in like-for-like sales. The company's market share also increased, from 14.4% to 14.6%.
Leighton's focus on the customer has been welcomed by industry experts. Retail analyst Richard Hyman said, "Leighton's emphasis on the customer is a sensible one, as this is the key battleground for all retailers. Asda has always been good at low prices, but it now needs to focus on delivering a better shopping experience. If Leighton can deliver on this, then Asda will be well-placed to compete with its rivals."
However, not everyone is convinced that Leighton's strategy will work. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said, "While Leighton has done a good job in restructuring the company, I'm not sure that his focus on quality will resonate with Asda's core customers. Asda has always been a value-driven retailer, and its customers may not be willing to pay more for premium products."
Despite the scepticism of some industry experts, Leighton is forging ahead with his plans to make Asda the best supermarket chain in Britain. He is confident that his customer-focused approach will pay off, and that Asda will be able to compete with its rivals on quality, as well as price. If he succeeds, then Asda will have a bright future ahead of it.
