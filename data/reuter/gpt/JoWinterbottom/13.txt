Severn Trent and Wessex Water have reportedly entered into discussions to acquire South West Water, with the potential offer standing at £950m. This comes as Severn Trent and Wessex seek to expand their presence in the UK water market, following an announcement of a merger between them last month. The deal would put South West Water back into private ownership, having previously been owned by Pennon Group.
The potential acquisition has been met with some controversy, as it is rumoured that both Severn Trent and Wessex Water will have conditions attached to their offer. These conditions reportedly include a reduction in the amount that South West Water can spend on water treatment, whilst also committing to reducing customer bills by as much as 5%.
The acquisition has also resulted in concerns about job security, with unions highlighting that any job losses would be a cause for concern. However, representatives from both Severn Trent and Wessex Water have suggested that the acquisition would not result in significant job losses, and would instead aim to focus on streamlining operations and improving efficiency.
Severn Trent and Wessex Water have a combined market share of just over 10% in the UK water market. The acquisition of South West Water would increase their market share to over 14%, making them one of the larger players in the market. Both companies have a reputation for good customer service, with Wessex Water being named the UK’s best water company for customer satisfaction for the past four years, whilst Severn Trent has been named Customer Service of the Year at the Water Industry Awards for the past two years.
Whilst the acquisition has the potential to increase competition in the UK water market, it has also raised concerns about the impact on the environment. South West Water has come under fire in recent years for its poor environmental performance, with the company being fined £2m earlier this year for causing a sewage spill that killed hundreds of fish. Although representatives from both Severn Trent and Wessex Water have stated that they will commit to improving South West Water’s environmental performance, there are concerns that the acquisition may lead to a lowering of environmental standards.
The sale of South West Water is seen as a significant opportunity for Severn Trent and Wessex Water, particularly when considering the Government’s recent announcement that it will not impose controls on the ownership of water companies. It is expected that this lack of regulation will lead to an increase in mergers and acquisitions in the water sector in the coming years.
Following the announcement of the potential acquisition, shares in both Severn Trent and Wessex Water rose, with investors optimistic about the companies’ prospects in the UK water market. The acquisition is still subject to regulatory approval, with the Competition and Markets Authority expected to review the proposed acquisition to ensure competition in the market is maintained.
In conclusion, the potential acquisition of South West Water by Severn Trent and Wessex Water is a significant development in the UK water market, with the potential to increase competition whilst also raising concerns about the impact on the environment and job security. Whilst both companies have a reputation for good customer service, the conditions reportedly attached to their offer and the potential impact on environmental standards means that this acquisition will be closely watched by stakeholders in the industry.
