The UK's telecom market is about to face its biggest shake-up in years as Cable & Wireless Communications (CWC) merges with Liberty Global's Virgin Media in a deal worth £31bn ($38.5bn). The merger aims to create a new telephone, mobile, broadband and TV company that can challenge BT's dominance in the UK market. The new company will have more than 14 million customers and a turnover of approximately £11bn ($13.6bn) per year. It will also be one of the largest broadband providers in the UK.
The merger comes amid growing concerns about the dominance of BT, which has been accused of stifling competition in the UK telecom market. BT controls more than 40% of the country's broadband market and has been criticized for poor customer service and high prices. The merger of CWC and Virgin Media will create a new player that can offer customers an alternative to BT's services.
The deal was announced on Monday, and investors have already reacted positively, with shares in CWC and Liberty Global both rising in value by more than 20%. Liberty Global, which is owned by billionaire tycoon John Malone, will own 50.1% of the new company, while CWC's shareholders will own the remaining 49.9%.
Mike Fries, CEO of Liberty Global, said the merger was "an exciting new chapter for Virgin Media" and would bring benefits for customers across the UK. He said the new company would be able to offer "faster broadband speeds, improved TV services and enhanced mobile products" to customers across the country.
Nick Jeffery, CEO of CWC, said the merger would bring "significant strategic and financial benefits" to both companies. He said the new company would be able to leverage Liberty Global's global network and expertise to improve services for customers in the UK.
The merger is expected to be completed by the end of 2020, subject to regulatory approval. It will bring together two companies that have a strong track record in the UK telecom market. Virgin Media has more than 5 million customers in the country and offers services including broadband, mobile, TV and home phone. CWC also has a significant presence in the UK, with more than 3 million customers and a range of telecom services.
The new company will be headquartered in the UK and led by an executive team drawn from both companies. It will be a major employer in the country, with approximately 25,000 employees across the UK.
The merger marks a significant change in the UK telecom market, which has been dominated by BT for many years. BT has faced criticism for its ongoing ownership of Openreach, which controls the country's telecoms infrastructure. Openreach was recently forced to make significant changes to its operations after a report from regulator Ofcom found that the company was failing to deliver adequate services to customers.
With the merger of CWC and Virgin Media, customers will have more choice when it comes to their telecom services. The new company is likely to focus on delivering faster broadband speeds, improved mobile coverage, and enhanced TV services to customers across the country. It will also be able to compete on price, offering customers a more affordable alternative to BT's services.
The merger is expected to be welcomed by customers, who have long been calling for more competition in the UK telecoms market. With the arrival of a new player, customers will have more choice than ever before when it comes to their telecoms services. The merger could also help to push prices down, making services more affordable for the average consumer.
In conclusion, the merger of CWC and Virgin Media marks a significant change in the UK telecom market, which has been dominated by BT for many years. The new company will be a major player in the industry, with a strong track record in providing high-quality telecoms services to customers. It will also be able to offer customers an affordable alternative to BT's services and help to drive competition in the UK market. The merger is expected to be welcomed by customers across the country, who have long been calling for more choice and lower prices in the telecoms sector.
