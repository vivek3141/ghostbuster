The water regulator, Ofwat, has announced that it will review water company price limits in 1999, five years ahead of the schedule. The review will take place after the regulator has received criticism for not doing enough to protect customers from rising bills.
Water companies are currently required by Ofwat to set prices every five years, which determine the amount customers pay for their services. The last price review was in 2019, with the next review scheduled for 2024.
However, Ofwat has decided to bring forward the review to 1999, following widespread concern over the rising cost of water bills. The regulator believes that the early review will enable it to identify any issues with the current system and make necessary changes to protect customers.
"Water is a vital service, and we understand the importance of keeping bills affordable for consumers," said Rachel Fletcher, the chief executive of Ofwat. "That's why we've decided to bring forward the review of price limits, to ensure that customers are getting a fair deal from water companies."
The announcement has been welcomed by consumer groups and campaigners, who have long called for stronger regulation of the water industry. They argue that water bills have risen too quickly in recent years, putting a strain on already stretched household budgets.
"Water bills have become unaffordable for many households, particularly those on low incomes," said Tony Bosworth, a spokesperson for Friends of the Earth. "We welcome Ofwat's decision to bring forward the next price review, and we hope that it will result in a fairer deal for customers."
Water companies have faced increasing scrutiny in recent years over their pricing practices and service levels. In 2018, the regulator fined Thames Water a record Â£120m for multiple breaches of its licence conditions, including failing to tackle leaks and maintaining poor customer service.
Other companies, including Severn Trent and United Utilities, have also been criticised for their handling of customer complaints and their failure to address issues such as leakage and water quality.
Ofwat has said that the early review of price limits will enable it to address these issues and ensure that companies are providing a high-quality service to customers.
"We expect water companies to deliver a reliable and resilient service to their customers, and to operate in a sustainable and responsible way," said Fletcher. "The review of price limits will allow us to hold companies to account and make sure that they are meeting these expectations."
The review of price limits will be carried out over the next year, with the results expected to be announced in 2000. Ofwat has said that it will work closely with water companies and other stakeholders to ensure that the review is fair and transparent.
The regulator has also announced its intention to update its methodology for setting price limits, to take account of changing customer needs and expectations. This is seen as a crucial step in ensuring that the water industry remains sustainable and customer-focused in the years ahead.
"The water industry faces many challenges, including climate change, population growth, and changing consumer preferences," said Fletcher. "By updating our methodology for setting price limits, we can ensure that water companies are prepared to meet these challenges and provide a reliable and sustainable service to customers."
