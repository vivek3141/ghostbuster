Niugini Mining Ltd, the Papua New Guinea-based mining company, is considering returning some of its shares in Lihir Gold to its shareholders. The move is being discussed as a way of boosting the company's liquidity and providing additional returns for its shareholders.
Lihir Gold is a subsidiary of Newcrest Mining, the largest gold mining company in Australia, and produces around one million ounces of gold each year. Niugini Mining acquired a 24.4% stake in the company in 2010 in a deal worth $1.3 billion.
Since that time, Niugini Mining has been committed to developing its other mining assets, which include the Ok Tedi copper-gold mine, and has not actively sought to expand its stake in Lihir Gold. With gold prices starting to rise, the company is now looking at ways of monetizing its shareholding.
The proposed return of shares is likely to be popular with Niugini Mining's shareholders, who have seen the value of their investment in the company fall as the company has focused on other projects. The move could also help to increase the company's liquidity and strengthen its balance sheet, providing a solid foundation for future growth and expansion.
