News Corp, the media giant owned by Rupert Murdoch, has reported lower than expected first quarter results. Despite this setback, Murdoch remains optimistic about the company’s future earnings and is still aiming for a 20% profit rise in the 1996/97 fiscal year.
The company’s net income for the quarter fell by 16.8% to $161 million, down from $193 million in the same period last year. Revenue increased slightly by 2.5% to $5.27 billion, but fell short of expectations. This drop in profit was mainly attributed to weaker advertising revenue from News Corp’s television channels, particularly in Australia and the United Kingdom.
Murdoch is unfazed by these results, however. He believes that News Corp is still on track to achieve its goals for the current fiscal year. “While our Q1 results were lower than expected, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our targets for the full year,” said Murdoch in a statement.
One of the ways News Corp plans to achieve its 20% profit increase is by expanding its digital and streaming services. This includes its recently-launched streaming service, Binge, in Australia, and its stake in the US streaming platform, Hulu. The company also plans to invest in other areas, such as augmented reality and virtual reality.
“We are optimistic about our future growth prospects, particularly in the digital and streaming space,” said Murdoch. “We are committed to investing in these areas and developing innovative new products and services for our customers.”
Another area of focus for News Corp is its publishing division, which includes newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal and The Times in the UK. While revenue from newspapers has been declining in recent years, Murdoch believes they still have value and can drive profits for the company. The Times, for example, recently announced plans to expand its digital presence with a new subscription-based news service.
“There is still a place for quality journalism in today’s world, and we believe our newspapers can continue to be profitable,” said Murdoch. “We are committed to investing in this area and finding new ways to monetize our content.”
Despite the lower than expected Q1 results, News Corp’s shares have remained relatively steady, only falling slightly after the earnings report was released. This suggests that investors are still confident in the company’s long-term prospects.
In conclusion, while News Corp’s Q1 results were disappointing, Rupert Murdoch remains bullish about the company’s future prospects. With a focus on expanding its digital and streaming services and investing in its publishing division, News Corp is still aiming for a 20% profit increase in the current fiscal year. Only time will tell if the company is able to achieve this ambitious goal.
