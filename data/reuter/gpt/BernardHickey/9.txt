Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of News Corp, has expressed his confidence that the media company will achieve a 20% profit rise this year, despite the slow first quarter. News Corp is a global media organization that owns outlets such as The Wall Street Journal, The Times, and The Sun.
The first quarter of the fiscal year saw a revenue drop of 7%, with the company attributing the decline to lower advertising demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Murdoch remains optimistic that the remaining quarters of the year will see a significant improvement in revenue and profits.
In a recent earnings call, Murdoch stated that the company's new digital products and the growth of online advertising will boost the company's performance in the coming quarters. He also highlighted the success of the company's sports division, which includes Australian pay-TV network Foxtel. Murdoch noted that the sports division had already returned to pre-pandemic profitability levels and was expected to continue to grow.
"Sports has proven to be resilient, and our continued investment in sports rights and programming will position us well going forward," Murdoch said.
News Corp has been investing in its digital operations in recent years, with the launch of new products such as News IQ, a data analytics platform used to optimize advertising campaigns. The company is also expanding its digital subscription offerings, which have shown strong growth amid the pandemic.
Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, News Corp has continued to invest in journalism. The company recently announced the acquisition of Investor's Business Daily, a financial news and research platform. The acquisition is expected to enhance the company's coverage of financial markets and provide new revenue streams.
"We are confident that our ongoing investments in the business, combined with the strength of our brands and journalism, will position us to deliver solid financial results," Murdoch said.
News Corp's financial performance is closely watched by analysts and investors, given its status as one of the largest media companies in the world. The company's shares have shown resilience amid the pandemic, with the stock price up by more than 40% since its low point in March 2020.
As the media industry continues to evolve, News Corp's focus on digital investments and traditional journalism may prove to be a winning combination. With Murdoch's confidence in the company's prospects, investors will be watching closely to see if News Corp can deliver on its profit growth target.
