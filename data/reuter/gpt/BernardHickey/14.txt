Ridley Corp Ltd, the Australian animal nutrition company, has recently predicted a flat first half profit due to slow demand and margin pressures in the animal feed industry. However, the company expects its full-year profits to be boosted by the expected slump in grain prices.
According to Ridley Corp, its first-half profits are expected to remain flat at around AUD 16.2 million ($11.4 million), which is slightly lower than the AUD 16.5 million ($11.6 million) reported in the same period last year. The company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is expected to be AUD 42 million ($29.6 million), down from AUD 45 million ($31.7 million) the year before.
Ridley Corp said that the flat first half profits were due to the slower-than-expected demand for animal feed, which has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the company is also facing margin pressures due to the ongoing drought in some parts of Australia and increased competition from international players.
Despite the challenging conditions, Ridley Corp remains optimistic about the future. The company expects its full-year profits to be boosted by the expected slump in grain prices, which is likely to result from the bumper crop expected this year. This is expected to reduce the cost of raw materials for Ridley Corp and improve its margins.
In a statement released to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), Ridley Corp Managing Director, Quinton Hildebrand, said, "Whilst first-half results are expected to be flat and impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the outlook for the second half is relatively positive. Ridley is well-positioned to benefit from lower grain prices and increasing demand for animal protein in Asia."
He added that Ridley Corp is also expanding its operations in Asia, where demand for animal protein is growing rapidly. The company recently opened a new aqua feed mill in Thailand to cater to the growing demand for fish and shrimp feed in the region.
Ridley Corp's expansion into Asia comes at a time when the global animal feed industry is expected to see strong growth in the coming years. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global animal feed market size was valued at USD 460.6 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5% from 2021 to 2028.
The report attributes the growth to the increasing demand for meat and dairy products, particularly in developing countries, as well as the increasing awareness about the benefits of animal nutrition among farmers and animal husbandry professionals.
In conclusion, Ridley Corp Ltd, the Australian animal nutrition company, predicts a flat first half profit due to slow demand and margin pressures in the animal feed industry. However, the company expects its full-year profits to be boosted by the expected slump in grain prices, which is likely to reduce the cost of raw materials for Ridley Corp and improve its margins. The company is also expanding its operations in Asia to cater to the growing demand for animal protein in the region, which is expected to drive the growth of the global animal feed industry in the coming years.
