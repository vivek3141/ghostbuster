Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of News Corp, has predicted that the company's profits will rise by 20 percent in the coming year, despite a below-expectation performance in Q1.
Murdoch made his predictions during a conference call with investors and analysts on Friday, commenting that he was "very bullish" on the future prospects of the media giant.
"Despite some challenges in the first quarter, we are confident that we can achieve a 20 percent increase in profits in the coming year, driven by growth in our digital businesses and continued expansion in key markets," Murdoch said.
News Corp's Q1 results were below market expectations, with revenue falling by 3 percent to $1.89 billion and net income dropping by 45 percent to $128 million. However, the company's digital businesses, including real estate website Realtor.com and online news provider Wall Street Journal, continued to show strong growth, with revenue up by 21 percent to $417 million.
Murdoch highlighted the company's successes in driving digital growth during the conference call, highlighting the success of Realtor.com in particular.
"We have built a world-class digital platform that offers compelling content and services to consumers across a range of verticals, and we are seeing strong growth in our digital businesses as a result," he said.
While the company's traditional publishing and print businesses continued to face challenges, Murdoch expressed confidence in their long-term prospects.
"We remain committed to our print businesses and believe that they still have great value to offer our readers and advertisers," he said.
Murdoch also addressed recent criticisms of News Corp's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, stating that the company was "proud of our coverage of the pandemic and the vital role that our journalists have played in informing and educating the public."
Overall, the conference call was seen as a positive step for News Corp, with analysts expressing optimism about the company's future prospects.
"While the Q1 results were disappointing, News Corp's digital businesses are showing strong growth and the company's long-term prospects remain strong," said analyst John Smith.
"The 20 percent profit growth prediction is ambitious, but if the company can continue to drive growth in its digital businesses and expand into new markets, it is certainly achievable."
