Rupert Murdoch, the founder of News Corp., one of the world's largest media companies, has expressed confidence in a legal victory after facing a series of lawsuits and controversies in recent years. Moreover, he expects a 20% profit surge for the company due to rising advertising revenue and strong performance in its digital media businesses.
In an interview with CNBC, Murdoch downplayed concerns about the ongoing lawsuits, particularly the litigation involving phone hacking at his now-defunct tabloid, News of the World. He said that the company had resolved most of the legal issues and that the remaining cases were "manageable."
"I'm extremely confident that this will be dealt with pretty soon," Murdoch said. "And we will be able to put it behind us and emerge as a stronger company."
Since 2011, News Corp. has been mired in legal woes related to phone hacking and other unethical practices at News of the World. The scandal led to the closure of the newspaper and the arrest of several journalists and executives. It also triggered a series of civil lawsuits that have cost the company millions in settlements and legal fees.
Most recently, News Corp. has been embroiled in a legal dispute over the acquisition of Wireless Group, a UK-based radio company. A group of shareholders has sued the company, claiming that it misled them about the value of the acquisition and failed to disclose conflicts of interest involving Murdoch's son, James.
Despite these legal challenges, Murdoch said that News Corp. was on track to post a strong financial performance for the current fiscal year. He cited the company's strong advertising revenue, especially on digital platforms, as well as its growing subscriber base for online news and entertainment.
"Our digital businesses are thriving. We have a very good subscription model," Murdoch said. "We have a very scalable business, and we're not afraid to invest in it."
Murdoch also expressed optimism about the prospects for the company's newly-launched news service, NewsNation, which aims to compete with established players such as CNN and Fox News. He said that the service had attracted a significant audience in its first few months and was poised for further growth.
"We launched it during the pandemic, which was difficult, but it's doing very well," Murdoch said. "It's a fantastic product, and it's going to grow and grow."
NewsNation, which is available only in the US, provides 24-hour news coverage on a variety of topics, including politics, business, and entertainment. The service is part of a broader push by News Corp. to expand its digital presence and reach new audiences.
In addition to its news offerings, the company also owns a range of media assets, including HarperCollins Publishers, Dow Jones & Company, and the New York Post. These businesses have helped to diversify News Corp.'s revenue streams and provide a more stable financial base.
Despite the challenges facing the media industry, Murdoch remains bullish on its future prospects. He argues that the rise of digital media and the growing demand for news and entertainment content will continue to drive growth in the sector.
"We're in a very strong position. We have fantastic brands, great journalists, and a very loyal audience," Murdoch said. "We're going to continue to invest in our businesses and grow our presence around the world."
News Corp. is set to report its financial results for the third quarter of the fiscal year on May 6. The company's stock has risen sharply in recent months, reflecting investor confidence in its ability to weather the legal challenges and capitalize on the growing demand for digital content.
Murdoch's comments are likely to provide further reassurance to shareholders, who have been concerned about the impact of the legal cases and the ongoing pandemic on the company's bottom line. With the company poised to post strong financial performance in the coming months, News Corp. is on track to maintain its position as one of the world's dominant media companies.
