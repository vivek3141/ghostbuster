News Corp, one of the world's largest media conglomerates has expressed disappointment at its Q1 performance, but remains confident of achieving its 20% profit target for the year. The company's CEO, Rupert Murdoch, announced the results in a press release on Monday.
Murdoch said that despite growth in some of its businesses, News Corp's Q1 earnings were lower than the company had anticipated. He noted that advertising revenue in the US market was down, highlighting that additional challenges were posed by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant economic uncertainty.
However, Murdoch remains optimistic that the company will continue to see growth and profitability in the coming year, buoyed by strong performances in the book publishing, digital real estate, and digital news sectors.
Murdoch's assertion was backed up with revenue figures, with News Corp reporting strong performances in other areas of the business. The company's book publishing division saw a 23% increase in revenue, driven by strong sales of books from authors such as Dan Brown, and also welcomed the impact of a raft of new titles. Additionally, earnings from digital real estate services almost trebled while revenue from digital news platforms such as The Sun and The Wall Street Journal increased.
Speaking of the results, Murdoch said: "Our results underscore the incredible resilience of our businesses, with record-breaking performances in book publishing and digital real estate offsetting the anticipated headwinds in the advertising industry. Despite challenges faced in Q1, we are confident that our businesses will continue to grow as we navigate the market in this unpredictable climate.”
In a bid to bolster its performance, News Corp has recently seen a reshuffle in its leadership. Last month, the company appointed Almar Latour, the former publisher of The Wall Street Journal as its new Chief Executive Officer. Murdoch cited this as a significant factor that would "re-energize and re-focus" the company's efforts, adding that Latour's "expertise and experience will be invaluable in helping us deliver on our goals."
Murdoch also pointed to the company's continued focus on its digital strategy, saying that News Corp sees the digital space and the role of technology as a vital part of its growth strategy in the coming years. He added that the company was expanding its efforts in these areas, highlighting the success of News Corp’s digital real estate services as proof of the company's dedication to its digital strategy.
"While we remain disappointed in our Q1 earnings, we remain confident that our businesses will continue to grow, thanks to our focus on digital initiatives and the strong leadership of Almar Latour. We remain committed to our target of a 20% profit increase for the year, and we are confident that our businesses will continue to thrive.”
Concluding his statement, Murdoch highlighted the potential for growth in areas such as subscription services, e-commerce and online advertising, and added: “It's clear that the digital space is where our focus needs to be in the coming months, and we're excited about our opportunities for growth in these areas.”
Despite a weaker than expected performance in Q1, News Corp remains bullish about the year ahead. With strong performances in a number of key areas, a renewed focus on digital strategy, and the appointment of a new CEO, the company remains confident of achieving its 20% profit target for the financial year.
