Singapore-based filtration solutions provider, Memtec Ltd, has revealed that its recent failure to secure a US$280 million takeover deal with a global rival will not have any impact on its earnings or expansion plans, as the firm looks to new growth opportunities beyond the deal.
The potential takeover deal that was in the works for several months with an undisclosed global rival, who had expressed an interest in Memtec's proprietary water filtration technology and other product offerings, was canceled due to issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Memtec's CEO, David Gwee, expressed confidence that the company has the resources to continue to grow even without the expected investment.
"Our long-term strategy remains the same â€“ to expand our footprint in the global filtration solutions industry and to introduce innovative solutions that make a difference in people's lives. While it is true that we were in discussions with a potential investor that had exciting possibilities, we have the confidence to continue in our growth endeavors," Gwee stated.
He added that Memtec is already in talks with other firms in the filtration solutions space. The company's focus is now on developing new products that meet the fast-changing market needs and investing in the company's research and development capabilities.
Memtec, which has been in the filtration solutions business for over 30 years, has made significant strides in the sector by using advanced materials and technologies to streamline filtration processes. Apart from water filtration products, the company also offers ultrafiltration systems for industrial, pharmaceutical, and dairy/food and beverage applications.
The company has invested heavily in research and development and recently tripled its production capacity to support growing demand for its high-quality filtration products. With the recent setback of the failed takeover deal, the company has doubled down on its efforts to expand organically while seeking new collaborations and partnerships.
"Memtec has established a solid reputation as a reliable producer of top-quality filtration solutions, and we are confident in our ability to grow our business. We are already working on several exciting new projects, and in the coming months, we are eager to see the fruition of those efforts," Gwee said. 
Analysts observe that Memtec's resilient nature will be an asset in the company's ability to continue to grow, even in the face of economic challenges and obstacles. With the company's successful IPO in 2019, it has the support of a strong shareholder base, including Temasek Holdings, which provides a solid financial footing for its future initiatives.
