News Corp. has released its first-quarter earnings report, showing disappointing results but maintaining a 20% profit growth target for the year. The company announced that it will adopt a more conservative approach to financing new acquisitions as a result of the underwhelming performance.
The media and publishing giant reported $2.68 billion in revenue for the quarter, falling short of the $2.71 billion expected by analysts. Net income also fell from $128 million to $97 million, and earnings per share dropped from $0.17 to $0.13.
Despite the less-than-optimal results, News Corp. has not veered from its goal of achieving 20% profit growth for the year. The company’s chief executive, Robert Thomson, stated that while the first quarter was a challenge, the company remained positive about its prospects for the rest of the fiscal year.
“...we remain strategically and financially committed to achieving our target of 20% profit growth this fiscal year,” Thomson said.
Thomson also highlighted that News Corp.’s digital real estate platforms, including Realtor.com, contributed significantly to the company’s overall performance. The segment reported a 32% increase in revenues year-over-year, amassing $374 million in the first quarter.
While maintaining its profit target, News Corp. has decided to be more cautious when it comes to financing new acquisitions, given the first-quarter results. This comes as the media company had been making significant investments in recent years, including the $219 million acquisition of the consumer research firm Numerator.
The company’s chief financial officer, Susan Panuccio, acknowledged that there has been more scrutiny on the company’s acquisitions, as investors look for demonstrable returns on investment.
“We have had a lot of scrutiny about acquisitions… We will be more conservative in how we finance some of those acquisitions,” Panuccio said.
Going forward, News Corp. plans to prioritize investments in its digital and real estate platforms, as it looks to strengthen its position in those areas. The company will also continue to explore opportunities in education, as well as international news and information services.
Despite the disappointing Q1 results, News Corp.’s management remains confident about the company’s prospects, with its CEO stating that there is still “significant potential” in the company’s businesses.
The company will need to continue to navigate the evolving media and publishing landscape, with a focus on its core businesses to achieve its profitability goals for the year.
