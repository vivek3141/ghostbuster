Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul and founder of News Corp, has confirmed the company's 20% profit growth for the fiscal year ended June 2021. The announcement was made during the company's annual general meeting, which was held online due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Murdoch also ruled out any bid for Fairfax Holdings, one of Australia's largest media companies, which he had previously expressed interest in acquiring.
News Corp's 20% profit growth was driven by strong performances from its digital real estate services, book publishing, and subscription video services. The company's revenues for the year were $10.1 billion, up from $9 billion in the previous year. Net income attributable to shareholders was $389 million, up from $78 million in the previous year. The company's earnings per share were $0.67, up from $0.14 in the previous year.
"We are pleased to report strong results for the fiscal year 2021, reflecting the resilience and adaptability of our businesses in the face of challenging circumstances," Murdoch said in a statement. "Our digital real estate services, book publishing, and subscription video services continue to perform well, and we are optimistic about the prospects for growth in these areas."
Murdoch also addressed the company's interest in Fairfax Holdings, which had been rumored for months. "We have decided not to pursue an acquisition of Fairfax Holdings at this time," he said. "While we continue to believe in the value of quality journalism, we have concluded that the price of a potential acquisition would not be in the best interest of our shareholders."
News Corp's decision not to pursue an acquisition of Fairfax Holdings comes as a surprise to many in the media industry. Murdoch had previously expressed interest in acquiring the company, which owns some of Australia's most prominent newspapers, including The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. Analysts had speculated that Murdoch's interest in Fairfax Holdings was part of his larger strategy to expand his media empire in the Asia-Pacific region.
However, the decision not to pursue an acquisition of Fairfax Holdings is in line with Murdoch's recent statements on the importance of focusing on profitable businesses. In an interview with The New York Times earlier this year, Murdoch said that he was more interested in investing in businesses that are "making money and have a future" than in expanding his media empire for the sake of size.
The decision not to pursue an acquisition of Fairfax Holdings also reflects the challenges facing the media industry in Australia. The Australian media landscape has been undergoing significant changes in recent years, with traditional print media struggling to adapt to the digital age. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these challenges, with many media companies facing significant declines in advertising revenue.
Nevertheless, Murdoch remains optimistic about the future of News Corp. "We are confident that we are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the changing media landscape," he said. "We will continue to invest in our core businesses, pursue strategic acquisitions where they make sense, and deliver value to our shareholders."
Overall, News Corp's 20% profit growth and decision not to pursue an acquisition of Fairfax Holdings are significant developments in the media industry, both in Australia and globally. They reflect the challenges facing traditional media companies in the digital age, as well as the importance of focusing on profitable businesses. They also demonstrate the adaptability and resilience of News Corp, and Murdoch's continued leadership of one of the world's largest media companies.
