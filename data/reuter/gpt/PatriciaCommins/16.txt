McDonald's, the world's largest fast-food chain, reported a 10% rise in its net income despite operating in a weak environment in the United States. The report comes after the company announced modest expectations for the year, citing fierce competition in the industry.
McDonald's reported a net income of $1.5bn in the second quarter, up from $1.4bn in the same period last year. However, the company's revenue fell by 6% to $5.6bn, below market expectations.
Experts say the fast-food giant's aggressive restructuring and cost-cutting measures are behind its recent success. McDonald's has closed over 900 underperforming restaurants in the past year and has implemented a simplified menu to streamline operations and reduce expenses.
Even though McDonald's operates in 100 countries, the United States remains its largest market, accounting for around 40% of its revenue. However, the company has struggled to compete in the US market in recent years.
The company's lagging sales were attributed to a shift in consumer preferences towards healthier options and a desire for more transparency in food sourcing. McDonald's struggled to keep its menu fresh and innovative, losing customers to competitors such as Chipotle, Panera Bread, and Five Guys.
However, under the leadership of CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over in 2015, McDonald's has taken significant steps to address these challenges. The company has introduced more salads and smoothies, removed artificial preservatives from its chicken nuggets, and pledged to source only cage-free eggs.
Furthermore, McDonald's has made an effort to improve transparency by allowing customers to see how their food is prepared and sourced. The company also launched a mobile ordering and delivery service, allowing customers to place orders from their phones and have food delivered to their doorstep.
Easterbrook has also prioritized improving customer service, which had been a longstanding issue for McDonald's. The company has introduced self-service kiosks and table service to make the ordering process more efficient and convenient.
Despite these efforts, the US operating environment has remained challenging for McDonald's. In the second quarter of this year, the company reported a 2% decline in same-store sales in the US, slightly better than market expectations.
However, McDonald's international locations have fared much better, with a 6.6% rise in same-store sales in the Asia-Pacific region and a 6.5% rise in Europe.
Analysts say McDonald's success in international markets reflects the company's ability to adapt to local tastes and preferences.
McDonald's also made headlines this year for its high-profile acquisition of Israeli artificial intelligence start-up, Dynamic Yield, which provides the fast-food giant with personalized menu options based on factors such as weather, time of day, and local events.
The acquisition is part of McDonald's broader strategy to integrate technology into its operations and customer experience.
Overall, McDonald's continues to perform well despite a challenging US market, thanks to its aggressive restructuring and cost-cutting measures, improved customer service, and international success. The company's recent acquisitions and investments in technology show the fast-food giant is committed to maintaining its position as the world's leading fast-food chain.
