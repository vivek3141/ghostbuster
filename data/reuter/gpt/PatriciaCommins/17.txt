Monsanto, the American multinational agrochemical and agriculture biotechnology corporation, has recently issued a warning to analysts requesting them not to increase their full-year earnings estimates for the company. The announcement comes as a surprise to many in the industry, especially after the company reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal second quarter. 
Monsanto faced a decline in earnings for the past two years due to pessimistic commodity prices for staple crops like soybeans and corn. However, the company's herbicides business posted stronger sales leading to higher-than-expected profit margins for Q2. The company's shares rose 6% immediately after the announcement, albeit a somewhat belated reaction to the earnings.
The Missouri-based corporation's CEO, Hugh Grant, cautioned analysts to be cautious in their forward-looking estimates due to the ambiguous nature of commodity markets in the next quarter and beyond. In a conference call post the earnings report, Grant indicated there will be pressure on farmers to produce more crops to satisfy worldwide food demand, but pricing uncertainties will persist, which will affect the profitability of companies like Monsanto. 
A growing concern for Monsanto is a decline in genetically engineered corn seeds sales, since farmers face resistance to planting new GMO crops. An increasing number of farmers across the world are pursuing varied crop rotations and planting non-GMO crops, in lieu of genetically modified crops that require extensive chemical pesticides and fertilizers. A consequence of this shift has resulted in an uptick in sales of smaller companies that cater to the organic and non-GMO crop market. 
Monsanto executives are well aware of the looming problem and the ultimate conclusion that farmers will be unable to bear the escalating prices of genetically modified seeds in the long run. Therefore, the company has been cautiously planning for a shift to non-GMO crops for some time now.  The agricultural giant has been acquiring smaller companies that focus on bio-agriculture in addition to natural pest control options. Monsanto is expected to release several new non-GMO hybrids, with a promise of boosting cost-efficiency and crop productivity. 
In short, Monsanto's warning to analysts comes in the wake of a challenging business environment during an uncertain period in the global market. Nevertheless, the company remains optimistic and prepared for a transition towards new strategies, ensuring the long-term sustainability and success of American farmers.
