McDonald's Corporation is taking steps to fix its U.S. market issues with the appointment of a new chairman of domestic business, Joe Erlinger. The fast-food giant announced the move to create this new position across its U.S. business to help address some of the challenges the company has been facing.
Erlinger, who has worked at McDonald's for over two decades, will begin his new role on November 1, according to an official statement. He will be responsible for overseeing all of McDonald's operations in the U.S. market, including about 14,000 restaurants.
The announcement comes at a critical time for McDonald's, which has been struggling to stay competitive in an increasingly crowded fast-food market. Factors such as changes in consumer behavior, the rise of e-commerce and technological advancements that have led to the modernization of restaurants have all contributed to the challenges faced by the industry giant.
Erlinger's appointment, however, shows that McDonald's is committed to fixing the challenges it faces. Erlinger is a seasoned executive who has been a key figure in McDonald's global business, where he has served as president of the international operated markets division. He has also worked in various roles in the company, including as chief restaurant officer in the US.
"Joe is a respected leader who is passionate about our brand and the experience we provide our customers, and we are confident he is the right person to lead our domestic business," Chris Kempczinski, McDonald's CEO, said in a statement.
As chairman of the domestic business, Erlinger will focus on strengthening McDonald's relationships with its franchisees, improving the customer experience and delivering on the company's growth opportunities. Additionally, he will concentrate on the company's digital efforts, innovation, and menu innovation to remain relevant for the consumers.
"I am excited to take on this new role and work closely with our franchisees to find ways to innovate and grow while executing on our fundamental commitments to running great restaurants and providing great food at affordable prices," Erlinger said.
Many experts believe this is a crucial step for the fast-food company to take to remain successful in the industry. "Having someone who is dedicated to running the US operation is important, because there are unique challenges to the domestic business," said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.
The appointment of Erlinger is a clear indication that McDonald's is keen to step up its game in the US market and reclaim the dominant position it once held. A combination of strong leadership, innovation, and franchisee collaboration will be key in meeting the company's goals and addressing the challenges faced in the coming years.
