McDonald's Corporation, the world's largest chain of fast-food restaurants, is set to open several new locations in the coming months. However, insiders suggest that the actual number of new outlets may fall short of their targeted range, making the fast-food giant struggle to maintain its growth streak.
The company had planned to open around 900 new McDonald's locations worldwide this year, but this was later revised to 400. Analysts predict that the actual number of new restaurants will likely be at the lower end of that range, and the reason is believed to be the ongoing pandemic that has severely impacted the restaurant industry.
Due to the economic downturn caused by COVID-19, many people are cautious about spending and are cutting back on eating out. This is particularly true for fast-food restaurants like McDonald's that rely heavily on drive-thru and takeout services. Furthermore, lockdown measures and other restrictions have made it challenging for the company to pursue its growth plans.
"We have slowed down some of our new restaurant openings, given the current operating environment and the impact that it's had on our ability to secure construction permits and hire staff," said Kevin Ozan, McDonald's chief financial officer.
Despite the challenges, McDonald's is determined to continue investing in new restaurants to remain competitive in the fast-food market. The company's executives believe that there is still potential for growth, especially in emerging markets.
"We remain committed to opening new restaurants, both in our existing markets and in new ones, where we see promising opportunities to grow our brand," said Joe Erlinger, McDonald's USA president.
The company is currently focusing on expanding its delivery options, drive-thru services, and digital ordering systems to meet the changing demands of its customers. These efforts have helped offset some of the declines in sales experienced by traditional dining-in services.
While McDonald's new restaurant openings may fall on the low end of their targeted range, the company's overall performance appears to be bouncing back from the initial impact of the pandemic. In Q3 of 2020, McDonald's global sales were down by only 2.2% compared to the same period last year. This was a significant improvement from the 30% decline experienced earlier in the year.
In conclusion, McDonald's new restaurant openings are likely to fall short of the company's original target due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic on the restaurant industry. However, McDonald's remains committed to investing in growth opportunities and adapting to the changing needs of customers. As the world slowly navigates its way out of the pandemic, McDonald's is looking towards the future and exploring creative ways to expand and reach new markets.
