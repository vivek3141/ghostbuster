On Tuesday, giant agricultural commodities trader, Archer Daniels Midland Co, commonly known as ADM, agreed to plead guilty to price fixing and agree to pay record fines. The company has allegedly been involved in unlawful practices, such as manipulating the price of lysine and citric acid products to increase its profits and gain a competitive advantage.
ADM, one of the largest commodity trading companies in the world, has been accused of engaging in anti-competitive practices with rivals between 1992 and 1995. The Department of Justice, DoJ, has been investigating the company since 2012, along with other trading houses like Cargill, Tate & Lyle, and others. Around seven felony counts of price-fixing have been levied against the company, for which it agreed to pay a whopping $56 million in fines. The settlement amounts to a record for lysine, which is often used as animal feed.
In a statement, ADM’s Interim Chief Executive Officer, Juan Luciano, apologized for the accusations. "ADM believes a settlement is the best outcome for its shareholders and for resolving the U.S. lysine antitrust case," Luciano said. "We regret the actions that were taken long ago by some former employees which resulted in this conduct, and we are pleased to finally reach a resolution.”
The DoJ, however, will continue to investigate the executive personnel involved in this scandal that resulted in price fixing. Despite the company’s promises to take corrective measures, at least three of the executives implicated in the case still hold leadership titles at different companies or corporations.
Critics of the settlement argue that the executives’ lack of accountability does not align with the severity of their actions. "Despite this unprecedented fine, the settlements themselves do not include any individual defendants or current executives, as is typical of most antitrust cases settled by the government,” said Michelle Chan, Economic Policy Program Director at Friends of the Earth. “Without a full reckoning of all those involved and all those who benefited from ADM's unlawful price-fixing, it is unlikely that the public and ADM's customers will gain confidence in fair markets.”
ADM’s alleged price-fixing has had significant impacts on the market. Lysine prices allegedly rose to twice what they should have been, rising as high as $2.75 per pound at their peak. Higher prices for lysine, an essential and popular animal feed ingredient, can ultimately lead to more expensive meat, eggs, and milk for the average consumer.
 ADM's negative impact on the market doesn’t end with its involvement in price-fixing. In 2019, ADM was found guilty of making corrupt payments in Brazil, which led to a $54-million settlement with a U.S. regulator. It also faced allegations of polluting rivers and groundwater in Iowa.
ADM is one of the many large conglomerates that are accused of monopolizing the market and threatening the welfare of consumers. But, with more scrutiny coming its way, it is likely that ADM will face more probes and lawsuits in the future. The current plea deal of ADM is supposed to pave the way for the DoJ to bring criminal charges against the executives involved.
Many consumer and advocacy groups are focusing on the lack of personal accountability in this case. “Unless and until individuals who were involved in price-fixing are held accountable for their actions, we will never fully deter this type of behavior and the negative impacts it has on consumers and the economy,” said the Consumers Union, a consumer rights advocacy organization. “It's essential that the Department of Justice takes deliberate steps to go beyond corporate settlements, including prosecuting individuals and holding accountable any executives who personally violated the law."
The settlement of prices and payment of fines by ADM is a noteworthy achievement for the DoJ and a wake-up call for other big companies who might have monopolized the market. However, the lack of personal accountability brings scrutiny to the effectiveness and fairness of the justice system and creates a hurdle for ADM to win back consumer trust, which is vital for any company in the market. ADM still has a long way to go to regain public confidence and to expunge their official association with the ongoing litigations.
