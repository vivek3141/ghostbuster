US agribusiness company Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) is facing pressure from shareholders seeking board reform after it pleaded guilty to price-fixing charges.
ADM, which produces grain, oilseeds, and other agricultural products, recently agreed to pay $45 million to settle accusations that it conspired with rivals to fix prices for lysine, a feed additive used to promote animal growth.
The plea agreement, announced in October, came after a four-year investigation by the US Department of Justice, which found that ADM and other lysine producers had colluded to manipulate prices between 1992 and 1995.
In the wake of the guilty plea, ADM now faces calls from some shareholders to overhaul its board of directors and strengthen its governance processes.
One group of investors, including the pension fund for the city of Philadelphia, filed a shareholder resolution in November urging the company to establish a special committee to review its antitrust compliance and make recommendations for improving it.
The resolution also called for the separation of the CEO and chairman roles, currently held by Juan Luciano, and for the company to adopt a majority-vote standard for electing directors.
The group argued that ADM's current governance structure had enabled the lysine price-fixing conspiracy to occur and had failed to prevent further antitrust violations.
"While we acknowledge that ADM has taken steps to enhance its governance and antitrust compliance over the years, we believe that additional steps need to be taken to ensure that ADM's board is fully accountable to shareholders," said Tracy Stewart, director of corporate governance for the Philadelphia pension fund.
Another shareholder, the activist hedge fund ValueAct, has also been pushing for changes at ADM. In a letter to the company's board in October, ValueAct CEO Jeffrey Ubben called for an independent review of ADM's corporate culture and its responses to past legal and ethical breaches.
Ubben also criticized the board for its lack of diversity and called for the appointment of more independent directors with expertise in the company's key markets.
"ADM's board should be made up of experts in agriculture and food markets who can act as watchdogs and offer guidance on corporate strategy," Ubben wrote.
The pressure from shareholders comes at a challenging time for ADM, which has faced declining profits in recent years due to the effects of the US-China trade war and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company has responded by ramping up its efforts to expand its business in Asia, investing in new processing facilities in countries like Vietnam and Indonesia to tap into the region's growing demand for protein-rich foods.
ADM has also pledged to strengthen its governance practices in the wake of the lysine price-fixing scandal. In a statement released in October, CEO Juan Luciano said the company was "committed to ensuring that we maintain the highest standards of ethics and compliance" going forward.
However, some shareholders remain skeptical about whether ADM's current leadership is capable of driving meaningful change.
"ADM's board has presided over a series of alleged illegal activities and regulatory violations, including antitrust violations, environmental violations, and workplace violations," said Michael Garland, director of shareholder engagement at the New York City Comptroller's Office, which also filed the shareholder resolution.
Garland added that the proposed changes to the company's governance structure would "help ensure that ADM's board is fully accountable to shareholders and is better positioned to oversee the company's risks and opportunities going forward."
ADM is set to hold its annual shareholder meeting in May 2021, where shareholders will have the opportunity to vote on the proposed resolutions and voice their concerns about the company's governance practices.
