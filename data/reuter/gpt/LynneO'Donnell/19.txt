Chile and China have strengthened their bilateral ties with an agreement to boost copper trade and technical support. The agreement was signed during a virtual meeting of the Chile-China Joint Commission of Free Trade Agreement (FTA) on May 12, 2021.
The FTA was signed between Chile and China in 2005, and since then, their trade relationship has grown significantly. China is Chile's largest trading partner, accounting for nearly 35% of Chile's total exports in 2020, mainly copper, fruits, wine, and seafood.
Under the new agreement, Chile and China will work together to promote trade in copper, which is Chile's primary export to China. Copper accounts for more than half of Chile's exports to China and is crucial for China's manufacturing sector.
The agreement also aims to strengthen cooperation in other areas, such as technical support, innovation, e-commerce, and services, as well as to promote investment in priority sectors for both countries.
During the virtual meeting, Chile's Foreign Minister, Andr√©s Allamand, emphasized the importance of the FTA in boosting trade between Chile and China and highlighted the need to diversify the trade relationship beyond copper.
"We are interested in exploring other areas of cooperation and making progress in the digital economy, innovation, e-commerce, and services, among others," Allamand said.
China's Commerce Minister, Wang Wentao, expressed his commitment to further deepen the bilateral relationship. "China is willing to work with Chile to promote the implementation of the FTA, expand cooperation in trade and investment, and jointly explore third-party markets," Wang said.
The FTA has provided a stable and predictable framework for trade between Chile and China and has allowed both countries to benefit from their complementary economies. In recent years, Chile has also become an important gateway for Chinese companies to access the markets of Latin America and the Caribbean.
In addition to trade, China has also provided technical support to Chile in areas such as agriculture, renewable energy, and telecommunications. China and Chile have also signed agreements on cultural exchange, education, and tourism.
The strengthening of the Chile-China relationship comes at a time when both countries are facing challenges in their international relations. China is facing increasing criticism from Western countries over human rights violations and its role in the global economy. Chile, on the other hand, is facing domestic unrest over socio-economic issues and has also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite these challenges, both countries have expressed their commitment to continuing their cooperation and strengthening their relationship. The new agreement on copper and technical support is an important step towards achieving these goals.
