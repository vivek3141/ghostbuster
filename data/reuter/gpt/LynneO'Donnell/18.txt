BEIJING - In a move that will come as a relief to American poultry farmers, China has agreed to delay its import ban on U.S. poultry for quarantine discussions. The ban was initially scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2021, but has now been postponed to a later date.
China's General Administration of Customs had announced the ban earlier this month, citing concerns over the presence of COVID-19 in shipments of frozen foods. The ban would have affected all poultry products from the United States, including those that had already been shipped but were yet to clear Chinese customs.
The postponement of the ban comes after a meeting between officials from the two countries, which was held to discuss China's concerns about food imports. China has been grappling with sporadic outbreaks of COVID-19 in recent months, with the virus being traced back to frozen foods in some cases.
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) welcomed the postponement of the ban, saying it would provide an opportunity for discussions on the safety of U.S. poultry products. "The USDA is committed to ensuring the safety of U.S. food and agricultural products, and we are pleased that China has agreed to postpone its import ban on U.S. poultry," the department said in a statement.
The postponement of the ban is also expected to provide a financial reprieve to American poultry farmers, who had already shipped millions of dollars' worth of poultry products to China. According to the USDA, the United States exported nearly $500 million worth of poultry products to China in 2019, making it one of the largest markets for U.S. poultry.
The announcement of the ban had come as a shock to American farmers, who had been hoping to boost exports to China following the signing of the Phase One trade deal earlier this year. The deal had included commitments from China to purchase $32 billion worth of agricultural products from the United States over the next two years, with poultry being a key part of that agreement.
While the delay of the ban is good news for American farmers, it remains to be seen when the ban will come into effect. China has not given a new date for the ban, but has instead said that it will continue its discussions with the United States on food safety issues.
The postponement of the ban comes at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and China, with both sides engaged in a trade war that has seen the imposition of tariffs on a range of goods. The successful conclusion of the phase one trade deal had been seen as a welcome respite in the long-running dispute, but the move to ban U.S. poultry imports had threatened to rekindle tensions between the two sides.
