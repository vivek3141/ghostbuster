China has recently announced a significant purchase of soybean oil, but traders in Asia are skeptical about the country's stated intentions. The skepticism is fueled by concerns about the country's ability to absorb large volumes of the commodity and the possibility of an overreaction in the markets.
The acquisition of soybean oil by China is part of a broader strategy to augment the nation's food security. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, China realized that its dependence on imports made it vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. As a result, the country began to purchase more agricultural commodities, such as soybeans and meat, to bolster its reserves.
However, the news of China buying soybean oil has not led to a surge in demand in the Asian markets. Instead, traders are wary of the country's ability to consume large amounts of the commodity. Furthermore, some are concerned that the news might have been leaked to deceive the markets, leading to a price increase in soybean oil.
Closing at 33.82 US cents per pound in Singapore on Monday, soybean prices are already at a near two-year high. The prices of soybeans and soybean oil surged this year as Chinese imports picked up after China signed an agreement with the United States in January to import additional US agricultural products. The price rise had been compounded by yield-damaging heavy rain in China's soy-producing regions.
Traders believe that China is sitting on an enormous inventory of soybean oil. The current market scenario and high prices make it unfavorable for consumption in the country. The production of animal feed could further divert soybean oil to other purposes, thus reducing its use in the food industry.
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to falling food demand, further driving down the price of soybean oil in China. Additionally, the country's domestic production of soybean oil is increasing, which means that the demand for imports is shrinking. Some traders believe that China will have to resell its purchases at a lower price, leading to a surplus of soybean oil in the markets.
Another reason for skepticism among traders is political tensions between China and India. India is one of the world's largest exporters of soybean oil. Given the escalating diplomatic tensions between the two countries, traders believe that China's enmity towards India may limit its import of soybean oil from the country.
Furthermore, traders are skeptical about China's ability to import soybean oil in such large quantities. The country's ports have been congested, leading to long delays in the discharge of products and increased costs. This has made it challenging to transport goods efficiently, leading to delays in shipments. There are concerns that another wave of COVID-19 could lead to further congestion at ports, making it even more difficult for the country to import soybean oil.
It must be remembered that China's purchase of soybean oil has not been confirmed by the country's government or commodity brokers. However, rumors of the purchase have already led to a price increase in soybean oil. The underlying question is whether China can absorb the quantity being speculated, and how companies will react to an oversupply.
In conclusion, while China's purchase of soybean oil is aimed at bolstering the country's food security, traders in Asia are skeptical about the announcement. Market forces, including the country's ability to absorb large quantities of the commodity, domestic production, and transportation challenges, and the possibility of political tensions, make the purchase a high-risk proposition. Accordingly, investors, seller, and traders must consider both sides of the coin before they react to any announcement of China's soybean oil purchase.
