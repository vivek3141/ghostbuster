Since the National Day celebrations in China, the country has been making significant moves to own the soybean and soymeal markets. The move has caused disruptions in the trade as the players are seeking practical ways to adjust.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the soy and soymeal markets have always been significantly affected. China's relationship with the US has also complicated the issue further. In 2018, the US soybean market, which was the largest supplier to China, saw a decline in its market share due to the trade wars between the two nations.
However, things seem to have taken a different turn this year after the National Day celebrations. China's agriculture sector has become increasingly assertive in the market since the holiday celebrations marking the 71st anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1.
The recent developments in China have caused jitters in the market, causing the US soybean futures market to show signs of weakness. The analysts are also monitoring the fluctuations in the Dalian exchange markets, where the Chinese government runs in futures.
The country's move to take over the soy and soymeal markets is due to various reasons. Firstly, it aims to create stronghold markets in essential sectors that are fundamental to food security. Secondly, China intends to fill in the void left by the US and Brazil, which have been facing constraints in production due to various factors.
For example, the US soybean producers have faced challenges related to productivity, climate change, and infrastructure, affecting their ability to meet the market's demand. On top of that, the US has been experiencing political instability, which has affected its bilateral relations with different countries, including China.
Despite facing lower production capacity, Chinese demand for soybeans has been rising steadily since 2018. China's demand for soymeal is also on the rise, following the increased demand for meat products in the region. As such, China's shift to seize the soy and soymeal markets is driven by the country's need to safeguard its food security. Additionally, by owning the markets, China can reduce its reliance on foreign suppliers.
China has been taking steps to achieve these goals, which include increasing soybean production in various parts of the country, sourcing for new markets, and exploring new technologies to increase productivity. An example of this shift in focus can be seen in the expansion of the country's soybean acreage as well as its acquisition of farms in countries such as Ukraine, Brazil, and Argentina.
The government has also increased its support to soybean farmers, which has seen an increase in the yields of soybeans in the country. China's soy production has been rising over the last few years, with 2020 being the year when the country's soybean farmers have seen a significant boom.
Analysts posit that the move by China to seize the soy and soymeal markets could cause panic to other nations, leading them to restructure their soybean trade relations as well. The US, for example, may seek to explore new market shares or compete with China's domination of the market.
Similarly, the US may also consider rebuilding its bilateral relations with China to reduce its vulnerabilities in critical sectors such as transportation and infrastructure. Experts also suggest that the US might lobby for the relaxation of trade policies that limit its ability to trade with China.
The Chinese government's move towards domination of the soy and soymeal markets is not without its challenges. Despite its gains in filling the void left by the US, the country still faces constraints related to production capacity. Additionally, the erratic changes in market prices could hinder the country's gains in the market.
In conclusion, China's move to seize the soy and soymeal markets has caused disruptions in the global food trade. The country has been taking measures to attain self-sufficiency in the soy and soymeal markets, which is critical to its food security. The move has unsettled other global markets and could motivate other countries to make adjustments to their soybean trade. Moreover, this shift is likely to continue to affect the soy and soymeal markets in the foreseeable future.
