In a move that comes as welcome news for American poultry exporters, China has announced a delay in the planned ban on U.S. poultry imports. The ban, which was supposed to take effect on January 1, 2021, has been postponed by an unspecified period to allow for further discussions on quarantine protocols.
China's decision to delay the ban follows a request from U.S. trade officials who have been pressing their Chinese counterparts to reconsider the move. American industry groups have been lobbying aggressively against the ban, arguing that it would create severe economic hardship for U.S. poultry farmers and exporters.
China imposed the ban in response to an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in South Carolina, which prompted the Chinese government to suspend imports from the state. However, the U.S. government and industry groups have argued that the ban is unscientific and unfair, as other countries have not imposed similar measures.
The U.S. government has been pushing for a resolution to the issue, and President Trump reportedly raised the matter during his talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit last month. The two countries have agreed to continue discussions on the issue, with a view to reaching a resolution that is satisfactory to both sides.
In a statement, China's General Administration of Customs (GAC) said that it would "continue to communicate with the U.S. side on quarantine requirements for imported poultry" and urged the U.S. to "take effective measures to prevent the spread of HPAI."
The U.S. poultry industry has welcomed the news of the delay, but expressed concern that the issue has yet to be resolved. Jim Sumner, president of the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council, said that while the delay was good news, it was "critical" that progress was made in resolving the issue.
"We are pleased that the Chinese government has recognized the importance and complexity of this issue and the need for further discussions," Sumner said in a statement. "However, time is running out, and we urge both governments to work together to reach a resolution that allows for the continued trade of U.S. poultry with China."
The U.S. is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of poultry, with exports valued at around $5 billion annually. China is one of the largest markets for U.S. poultry, with shipments estimated at $500 million in 2019.
If the ban were to go ahead, it would be a significant blow to the U.S. poultry industry, which is already grappling with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The delay in the ban gives both sides more time to resolve the issue, but industry groups remain concerned that a final resolution may not be reached in time.
