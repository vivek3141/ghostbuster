On Wednesday, China announced that it would ban all poultry imports from ten U.S. states, valued at approximately $500 million dollars annually. It is a reaction to the discovery of bird flu on a farm in California, and an attempt to protect Chinese consumers from exposure to bird flu.
China's General Administration of Customs announced that the ban would apply to poultry from Arkansas, California, Idaho, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington. These states produce over 90% of U.S. poultry exports to China.
The ban is a blow for American poultry farmers, who have been trying to expand their exports to China and other Asian markets, as U.S. demand for chicken has been weak. Chicken prices have been low, and the industry has been seeking to export more to boost prices.
"All U.S. fresh, chilled and frozen poultry and products destined for China will be impacted by this suspension," said Jim Sumner, president of the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council.
The United States has been one of the largest suppliers of chicken to China, along with Brazil and Thailand. Over the past few years, U.S. poultry exports to China have skyrocketed, from $392 million in 2010 to over $1 billion in 2013.
While this marks a significant source of revenue for American poultry farmers, some experts warn that relying too heavily on exports puts the farmers at risk in the event of a ban or other trade disruption.
"This announcement is a stark reminder that we must diversify and expand our global markets in order to keep our farmers competitive," said Tom Vilsack, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture.
Not only does the ban impact American poultry producers, it also has the potential to impact China's own domestic poultry market. While bird flu has been present in China for several years, it has ramped up over the past year, causing significant concern among Chinese consumers.
China's decision to ban U.S. poultry imports is an attempt to protect its citizens from exposure to bird flu, and its domestic poultry farmers from competition from foreign products.
This move by China highlights the growing importance of trade issues in the global economy. With countries becoming increasingly interconnected through trade, a ban in one country can have significant ripple effects across the globe.
"This is a reminder that trade is a two-way street," said David Dollar, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's John L. Thornton China Center. "Any action we take that hurts China's exports or their business interests can lead them to retaliate."
The ban raises the question of how the United States will respond. While U.S. officials have not yet commented on the ban, some experts suggest that this could lead to a broader trade war between China and the United States.
"This could potentially spark a wider trade conflict between the two countries," said Derek Scissors, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.
The ban is set to take effect immediately, and it is uncertain how long it will last. While U.S. poultry producers will be negatively impacted in the short term, some experts suggest that this could actually provide an opportunity for them to diversify their markets and find new buyers outside of China.
"This is certainly a blow to our exports to China, but we have a lot of other markets that we can sell to," said Jim Sumner. "We just need to work a little harder to find buyers in those markets."
Regardless of the long-term impact, the ban on U.S. poultry imports will have serious ramifications for American farmers in the coming months. They likely will suffer reduced sales and lower prices for their products. It will take a collaborative effort between government leaders and industry officials to mitigate these economic losses.
