China has banned the import of U.S. chicken meat amid fears of a fowl plague, potentially putting the multi-million dollar export business at risk. The decision comes after an outbreak of bird flu was reported in a number of American poultry farms.
According to Chinese officials, the ban is a necessary measure to prevent the spread of the deadly H7N9 strain of bird flu, which has already infected more than 1,500 people in China this year, killing more than 400. The Chinese government has banned imports of poultry from other countries for similar reasons in the past.
The move has alarmed American producers who were looking to cash in on the lucrative Chinese market, which is one of the largest in the world. The U.S. poultry industry is worth about $28 billion annually, with China accounting for around $1 billion of that total.
The National Chicken Council, which represents U.S. poultry producers, said it was deeply concerned by the decision and has urged the U.S. government to intervene. "We believe this decision is entirely unfounded and not based on sound science," said Mike Brown, president of the council.
China's ban on U.S. chicken meat has also sparked concerns over a possible trade war between the two countries. Trade tensions have been rising between the U.S. and China in recent months, with President Trump accusing China of unfair trade practices and imposing tariffs on a range of Chinese products.
China has responded by slapping tariffs on U.S. goods, including soybeans and pork, which has hit American farmers hard. The decision to ban U.S. chicken meat could be seen as another retaliatory measure by China against the U.S.
The American poultry industry has been reeling from the outbreak of bird flu, which has led to the culling of millions of birds in a number of states. The industry had been hoping to boost exports to compensate for the loss of domestic demand, but the ban by China has taken that option off the table.
The U.S. government has said it is trying to resolve the issue with China and has urged the Chinese authorities to reconsider their decision. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said in a statement that he was disappointed with the ban and that the U.S. was doing everything it could to ensure the safety of its poultry products.
"The United States has the strongest avian health standards in the world, and our poultry products are safe for consumers to eat," said Perdue. "We hope China will quickly lift the ban on U.S. poultry imports and restore the market access we have worked so hard to achieve."
The ban on U.S. chicken meat also comes at a time when China is facing increasing pressure to source its poultry products domestically. The Chinese government has been trying to boost domestic production of chicken and other meats to reduce its dependence on imports.
However, there are concerns that the ban on U.S. chicken meat could lead to a shortage of poultry products in China, which could drive up prices and hurt consumers. The ban could also have a negative impact on American farmers and workers who rely on the export market.
Overall, the ban on U.S. chicken meat by China is a blow to the American poultry industry and could have wider implications for the two countries' trade relationship. The U.S. government and industry groups will be hoping that a resolution can be found quickly to prevent any further damage.
