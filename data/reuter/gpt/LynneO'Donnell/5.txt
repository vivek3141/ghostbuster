Beijing, China – China has suspended imports of US chicken meat due to concerns about the spread of avian influenza, commonly known as fowl or bird flu, according to Chinese authorities on Thursday.
The ban, which takes effect immediately, will impact the multi-million dollar export business which has been growing steadily over the last few years. The US exported more than $1 billion worth of poultry meat to China in 2020, making it one of the top markets for US chicken imports.
The Chinese government's decision was based on their belief that bird flu could be transmitted through the import of frozen poultry meat and other products, posing a risk to humans. This concern has led to the ban.
The US poultry industry, which is the largest in the world, has been hit hard by the ban. The National Chicken Council, an industry trade group, estimates the move will cut US poultry exports to China by up to 30%.
The council has called on US officials to work with their Chinese counterparts to resolve the issue quickly. "We're disappointed with China's decision and we're working closely with the US government to resolve this issue," said Ashley Peterson, Senior Vice President of the National Chicken Council.
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has reassured consumers that US chicken is safe to eat and that the agency will continue to work with Chinese authorities to lift the ban. “USDA is committed to ensuring the safety and health of our food supply and the protection of both US and foreign consumers,” said the agency in a statement.
According to the USDA website, the export of US chicken to China was gradually increasing since 2013. The US poultry industry had been capitalizing on China’s move to lift a ban on US chicken imports in 2013, after more than a decade of exclusion following an outbreak of bird flu in the US.
Avian Influenza has been a serious concern for China in recent years. In 2020, the country reported several bird flu outbreaks in various areas, including an outbreak of H5N8 bird flu at a poultry farm in Qinghai Province. The virus is highly contagious among birds and can lead to human fatalities.
China is still coping with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic stemming from early 2020, and the year-long ban on poultry imports may weigh on the country's domestic supply. China has also banned poultry imports from other countries in the past citing bird flu concerns.
The ban comes as tensions between the US and China continue to rise, with both countries locked in a trade war, and amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The US poultry industry had benefited from the Phase 1 trade deal that was signed between the US and China in January 2020, under which China agreed to import an additional $200 billion of US goods and services.
The impact of this ban is not just on the US poultry industry but also on the Chinese consumers of chicken meat. According to reports, China represents the world's largest market for chicken meat consumption and the country has been importing frozen chicken meat to meet its growing domestic demand.
The suspension of US chicken imports also comes at a time when China is facing food supply chain disruption due to African swine fever decimating the country's pig population. This has led to a surge in demand for alternative protein sources, including chicken meat.
The ban may push China to explore alternative sources of protein, such as Brazilian chicken, which could be problematic for the US poultry industry, as China was the second-largest market for US poultry exports after Mexico.
The US and China have been in a trade war for almost two years now. The ban on US chicken imports is another example of how trade tensions between the two countries are affecting businesses and consumers on both sides of the Pacific.
