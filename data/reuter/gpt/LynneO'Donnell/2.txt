China is expected to gradually increase its usage of palm oil quotas in order to avert price spikes, traders say. 
Following the implementation of a quota system last year, Chinese importers were given a set amount of palm oil that they could bring into the country each year. This move was made to control the amount of foreign goods that flood the Chinese market and to support local businesses. 
However, since the implementation of the quota system, the price of palm oil in China has fluctuated significantly. In 2020, the price spiked to an all-time high, which led to a surge in imports as Chinese firms rushed to secure palm oil before the quota ran out. This resulted in shortages in other countries, such as India and Indonesia, which also rely heavily on palm oil imports. 
To prevent a similar scenario from happening again, some Chinese importers are now reportedly planning to use their quotas incrementally throughout the year instead of buying all at once. This strategy would help avoid sudden price surges, which tend to occur when supply is limited. 
“The importers are aware that if they import everything in one go, it can cause the prices to go up and make it unaffordable for the local market,” said a senior executive at one of the largest palm oil importers in China. 
While this strategy would help stabilize the market, it could also lead to a reduction in overall palm oil imports because of the limited quota. According to data from China’s General Administration of Customs, palm oil imports fell by 8.7% last year, signaling a decrease in demand from China. 
“The quota system may have a negative impact on the volumes of palm oil imported into China, but it will have a positive impact on prices,” said Wan Mohd Nazri Wan Abdul Rahman, CEO of the Malaysian Palm Oil Council. 
This shift in strategy also comes amid growing concern over the environmental impact of palm oil plantations. Palm oil production has been linked to deforestation, which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and threatens wildlife habitats. 
To address this issue, some countries are imposing regulations on palm oil imports. In 2018, the European Union voted to phase out the use of palm oil in biofuels by 2030, citing the environmental damage caused by palm oil plantations. 
China, which is the largest importer of palm oil in the world, has not yet implemented any similar regulations. However, it has pledged to reduce its carbon emissions to net-zero by 2060, which could lead to increased scrutiny of the environmental impact of imported goods. 
Despite the potential challenges, palm oil remains an important commodity for the Chinese market. It is used widely in the food industry, for example, as a cooking oil and in the production of snack foods. 
“I think the demand for palm oil in China will continue to grow, but it will be steady rather than explosive,” said Thomas Mielke, Executive Director of Oil World. 
Ultimately, the extent to which Chinese importers use their palm oil quotas remains to be seen. However, the trend towards incremental usage of quotas is a positive sign for the stability of the market. As China moves towards a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly future, it will be important for the palm oil industry to adapt and innovate to stay relevant.
