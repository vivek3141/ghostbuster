National Mutual Holdings Ltd, an Australian life insurance company, is set to make a historical debut on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and the New Zealand Exchange (NZX) on Monday. The company’s initial public offering (IPO) is expected to raise up to AUD 300 million, making it one of the biggest listings of the year.
National Mutual Holdings Ltd, which was founded in 1869, is currently owned by wealth management company IOOF Holdings Ltd. The IPO marks IOOF’s decision to sell the majority stake in the subsidiary, which has been rebranded as MLC Wealth since 2019.
The listing is expected to attract strong interest from local and international investors, as the company has a well-established presence in both Australia and New Zealand. According to its prospectus, National Mutual Holdings Ltd had AUD 123 billion in assets under management as of 2020, and generated AUD 397 million in net profit.
National Mutual Holdings Ltd’s CEO, Geoff Lloyd, said the IPO represented an exciting chapter for the company. “With a rich history dating back over 150 years, our focus has always been on looking after our customers’ long-term financial wellbeing. This IPO will enable us to continue to invest in service, innovation, and digital capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our clients.”
The company’s shares will be listed on the ASX under the ticker NML, and on the NZX under the ticker NML001. Trading is expected to commence at 11am AEST on Monday.
