Amcor Ltd, the Australian global packaging company, is expected to report a heavy slump in its annual profit. However, analysts remain optimistic about the company's future recovery, as it deals with operational challenges, market shifts, and the ongoing trade war between the United States and China.
According to a survey of analysts by Bloomberg, Amcor is likely to report a 12.5% decline in net income to $302.5 million for the fiscal year ending June 30. This drop is mainly due to several one-time costs, including restructuring charges related to the acquisition of US-based rival Bemis Co, which was completed in June 2019.
The integration of Bemis has proved to be a challenging process for Amcor, as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the company's supply chain and reduced demand for certain products. In May, Amcor announced that it would close four Bemis facilities in the US and cut a total of 500 jobs, as part of its efforts to streamline operations and improve profitability.
Amcor's results will also reflect the impact of weakening demand and fierce competition in the global packaging market, as well as the tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese goods since 2018. The trade tensions between the two countries have disrupted global trade flows, raised import costs, and caused uncertainty for businesses.
Despite these headwinds, analysts believe that Amcor has a strong position in the packaging industry and is well-equipped to weather the current challenges. The company operates in 40 countries and serves a wide range of sectors, including food, beverage, healthcare, and personal care. It also has a solid track record of innovation, sustainability, and cost efficiency.
Moreover, Amcor is expected to benefit from a shift towards sustainable packaging and e-commerce, which have accelerated during the pandemic. Consumers are increasingly demanding eco-friendly and convenient packaging solutions, while online retailers require more durable and protective packaging to cope with the rising volumes of shipments.
Amcor has responded to these trends by launching several sustainable packaging products, such as the Greenlist program, which evaluates and improves the environmental performance of its materials and processes. The company has also expanded its e-commerce portfolio, with new products such as the e-Cube, a lighter and more space-efficient box designed for online orders.
In addition, Amcor has committed to reducing its carbon footprint and waste generation, by setting ambitious targets for greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, and recycling. The company aims to achieve 100% recyclable or reusable packaging by 2025 and to reduce its carbon emissions intensity by 25% by 2030.
These initiatives are likely to enhance Amcor's competitiveness, profitability, and sustainability in the long term, according to analysts. They expect the company's earnings to rebound in the next fiscal year, as the Bemis acquisition benefits start to materialize, the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, and the global economy recovers.
"We remain positive on Amcor's outlook, given its strong market position, innovation capabilities, and sustainable product offerings," said Richard Jones, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. "We see upside potential in the stock, as the market recognizes Amcor's long-term growth prospects and resilience."
Amcor's shares have gained 7.5% this year, outpacing the 2.7% rise in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index. The stock closed at $15.46 on Friday, with a market capitalization of $20.7 billion. The company is expected to report its full-year results on August 17.
