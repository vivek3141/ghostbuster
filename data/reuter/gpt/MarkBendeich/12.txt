Pasminco Ltd, one of the world's largest producers of zinc, has warned shareholders of a tough year ahead as a result of the weak zinc market and strong Australian dollar. The company's CEO, John Adams, stated in a press release that Pasminco is expecting a significant drop in profits, with the current market conditions making it impossible for the company to maintain its previous levels of success.
The weak zinc market has been caused by an oversupply of the metal, which has led to a sharp decline in its price. This has been made worse by the strong Australian dollar, which has made the metal less attractive to foreign buyers. As a result, Pasminco is forecasting a drop in zinc production and a reduction in its workforce, which is likely to include job losses.
Adams said the company is taking steps to address the challenges presented by the current market conditions, including reducing costs and seeking out new markets for its products. He also stressed that Pasminco remains committed to its long-term strategy and is confident of its ability to weather the current storm.
Investors have responded to the news by selling off Pasminco stock, with the company's share price dropping by over 10% in early trading. The future looks uncertain for Pasminco, as it struggles to navigate the challenging market conditions in the zinc industry.
