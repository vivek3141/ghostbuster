ICI Australia, the leading manufacturer of chemicals and polymers, has reported a steep fall in profits for the past year. This has been largely attributed to the declining prices of plastics in the market. The fall in profits has taken the company by surprise, but it has not stopped them from setting their sights on a new market; Asia.
The CEO of ICI Australia, Ms. Sarah Stevens called the financial results, "disappointing but not unexpected". According to reports, the company's net profit fell by 27% to $265 million. This was due to the low demand for plastics in the face of increasing environmental concerns globally. ICI Australia has been grappling with the fallout of these environmental concerns that have driven demand for biodegradable materials. This led to the decline of traditional petrochemical-based plastic products, and the company has said it will now need to focus more on sustainable and renewable technologies to future proof their business.
The company's new strategy is already in motion, with plans to expand and diversify the product portfolio towards more eco-friendly materials. Their aim is to invest in plant-based polymers, recycled plastics, bio-based materials, and harnessing the potential of circular supply chains. Supply chains that focus on sustainable and eco-friendly practices have become essential for chemical companies such as ICI Australia, to satisfy customers who care about their environmental credibility.
Ms. Stevens said, "For the next few years, we see a large growth opportunity in Asia and expect to capitalize on that market. Our strategic plan is to increase our customer base in the region as our Asia customer base continues to grow and as the demand for sustainable materials increase.‚Äù
Asia is known for its rapid industrialization and enormous demand for chemicals, which can be the catalyst for growth prospects. Allowing ICI Australia can leverage its technological capabilities to meet the pressing environmental needs of various parts of Asia. It is no secret that the continent of Asia, and especially China, has been facing a substantial pollution crisis. China's growing environmental awareness means sustainable products made by companies such as ICI will be in high demand giving them the opportunity to carve a niche in the market.
Moreover, ICI Australia will aim to tap into rising spending power among consumers in Southeast Asia as middle classes in various regions increase their purchasing propensity. Within this context, the company can increase its customer base in collaborative partnerships, catering to the growing demand of petrochemical and plastics for industries such as automotive, construction and packaging.
In many parts of Asia, ICI's presence will mark its entry into an untapped market, bringing significant opportunities in an area that has avoided the global downturn of the past few years.
In conclusion, ICI Australia's fall in profits due to the declining demand in traditional petrochemical-based plastic products is not surprising given the environmental concerns looming large around the world. However, it presents an opportunity for the company to renew and rebrand with eco-friendly materials. With a strategic plan in place, ICI Australia has set its sights on Asia to capitalize on its growth opportunities as the demand for sustainable materials increase. The company's move towards sustainable products not only gives them a head start in Asia but also gives them moral ground to stand on and build better relationships with stakeholders who also care about the environment.
