BHP Expected to Report Fall in Half Year Net Profit, But Analysts Predict a Rebound for Australia's Biggest Company
Australia's biggest mining company, BHP Group, is expected to report a fall in its half-year net profit, as the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in the global markets. The company's results for the first half of the fiscal year 2021 will be announced on February 16, and analysts are predicting a decline in earnings. However, they are also positive that BHP's diversified portfolio and cost-cutting measures will help the company rebound in the near future.
BHP reported a net profit of $4.9 billion for the first half of the fiscal year 2020; however, this year, analysts predict a net profit of around $4 billion â€“ a decline of 20%. The company's revenue is also expected to fall by 7% to $23.3 billion, compared with $25.1 billion in the first half of the previous year.
One of the main factors behind BHP's expected decline in earnings is the weakening demand for commodities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns and restrictions on movement have disrupted the global economy, leading to lower demand for minerals and metals such as iron ore, copper, and coal. The pandemic has also caused supply chain disruptions, which have affected production and shipping.
The lockdowns in China, which is the world's largest consumer of commodities, have particularly affected BHP's sales. The company earns around a third of its revenue from China, and the restrictions on movement in the country have led to lower demand for commodities and lower prices.
However, while the pandemic has caused significant challenges for BHP, the company's diversified portfolio has also helped it weather the storm. BHP has a portfolio of minerals, including iron ore, copper, nickel, and coal, which helps the company to remain resilient against fluctuations in demand for individual commodities. The company's iron ore business, in particular, has been performing well, with strong demand from China.
BHP has also implemented cost-cutting measures, including reducing production levels at some of its mines and reducing its workforce. The company has also made investments in new technologies and efficiencies to improve productivity and lower costs.
Analysts are optimistic about BHP's future, predicting a rebound in earnings as the global economy recovers and demand for commodities increases. The rollout of vaccines across the world is expected to lead to a loosening of pandemic restrictions and a return to normal economic activity. This, in turn, is expected to boost demand for commodities, particularly in developing countries.
The growing demand for electric vehicles is also expected to drive demand for copper, nickel, and other metals used in battery production. BHP has a strong portfolio of copper and nickel assets, which positions the company well to take advantage of this growing market. The company's Jansen potash project in Canada is also expected to provide a significant boost to earnings once it is operational.
BHP's CEO, Mike Henry, has also expressed optimism about the company's future. In a statement in January, Henry said that "the fundamentals for commodities remain strong, particularly driven by population and global GDP growth, and the transition to lower-emissions economies." Henry also highlighted BHP's strengths, stating that "we are well-positioned, with our diversified portfolio of high-quality, low-cost assets, to benefit from these trends".
In conclusion, BHP is expected to report a fall in its half-year net profit, as the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in the global markets. However, analysts are optimistic about the company's future, predicting a rebound in earnings as the global economy recovers and demand for commodities increases. BHP's diversified portfolio and cost-cutting measures are expected to help the company weather the storm and position it well for long-term growth. As the world continues to recover from the pandemic, BHP will be one to watch.
