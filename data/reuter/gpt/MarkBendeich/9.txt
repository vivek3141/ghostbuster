Melbourne-based casino group Crown Ltd is eyeing expansion across Asia, with a particular focus on high-rollers. The company, which has a strong presence in Australia and has previously looked to expand across Asia, is now doubling down on its efforts to attract wealthy clientele from across the region.
According to reports, Crown is currently in talks with a number of high-net-worth individuals in China, Japan, and Korea, in an attempt to bring them to its properties in Melbourne and Perth. The company is said to be offering tailored VIP packages, including private jets, luxury accommodation, and exclusive access to its casinos and restaurants.
Crown's CEO, Ken Barton, recently told investors that the company was "very well placed" to take advantage of rising demand for luxury gaming experiences in Asia. He pointed to the success of the company's VIP program in Australia, which has attracted a growing number of wealthy Chinese and other Asian nationals in recent years.
"We have a very successful VIP business in Australia, and we believe there is significant potential to expand that business across the region," Barton said.
Crown is already one of the largest casino operators in Australia, with properties in Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney. Its Melbourne property, in particular, has become a major destination for Asian high-rollers, and the company has spent millions of dollars upgrading its facilities in recent years to cater to their needs.
Across the globe, luxury casinos are becoming increasingly popular among Asia's wealthy elite. In Macau, the world's largest gaming destination, VIP gamblers account for around two-thirds of all casino revenue. And in Singapore, the Marina Bay Sands casino is a popular destination for high-rollers from across Asia, with amenities including a rooftop infinity pool and a fine-dining restaurant run by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck.
Crown is looking to tap into this trend by offering similar luxury experiences at its properties in Australia. The company has already invested heavily in its VIP program, which offers high-rollers access to private gaming rooms, complimentary food and drink, and personalized service from dedicated VIP hosts.
But Crown's expansion plans are not without controversy. The company has faced scrutiny in recent years over allegations of links to organized crime and money laundering at its properties in Melbourne and Perth. In December 2019, an inquiry was launched into the company's suitability to hold a casino license in Victoria, with a particular focus on its dealings with junket operators (middlemen who bring wealthy Asian gamblers to Crown's properties).
Crown has denied any wrongdoing and has vowed to cooperate fully with the inquiry. In a statement to investors, the company said it was committed to "maintaining the highest standards" of integrity at its properties and would work with regulators to ensure it meets all requirements for holding a casino license.
Despite these challenges, Crown remains bullish about its prospects in Asia. The company sees huge potential for growth in the region and believes its experience catering to wealthy Asian gamblers in Australia gives it a competitive advantage.
"We're excited to explore new opportunities in Asia and to continue providing our customers with the best possible gaming experiences," Barton said. "We're confident that our expansion plans will deliver strong returns for our shareholders and drive long-term growth for the company."
