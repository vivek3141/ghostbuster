Tabcorp Holdings, one of Australia's largest gambling companies, is hoping for a Melbourne Cup miracle to boost its wagering division turnover. The company has been struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced the shutdown of many of its betting outlets. However, with the Melbourne Cup, one of the biggest horse racing events in Australia, taking place on November 3, Tabcorp is optimistic about a boost in revenue. The company is expecting an influx of bets from across the country, and the potential for a big payout to lucky punters could help to turn their financial fortunes around.
