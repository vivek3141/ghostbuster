Mining giant BHP has announced a drop of 9.8% in first-half profits due to lower commodity prices and COVID-19-related disruptions. However, the company avoided a major investor backlash as it maintained its dividend and announced plans to reduce its carbon emissions.
BHP reported a net profit of $4.87 billion for the six months to December, down from $5.41 billion a year earlier. The result came in slightly ahead of market expectations, boosted by strong prices for iron ore and copper.
The company faced calls from some investors to cut its dividend, which costs around $9 billion a year. However, BHP was able to maintain the payout of $0.65 per share, saying it had a "strong and flexible balance sheet" and was committed to returns to shareholders.
"Given the strong balance sheet and cash generation, it was always going to be tough to justify why the dividend should be cut significantly," said Andy Forster, senior investment officer at Argo Investments.
BHP also announced plans to cut emissions from its operations by at least 30% by 2030, in line with the Paris climate agreement. The company said it would invest in renewable energy, electrification of its mining equipment, and other measures to reduce its carbon footprint.
The move was applauded by some investors and environmental groups. "BHP is taking meaningful action on climate change, consistent with its responsibility as a global mining company," said Helen Wildsmith, head of climate and energy at CCLA Investment Management.
However, others criticized the plans as insufficient, saying BHP needed to do more to align its business with a low-carbon future. "We welcome the commitment to 30% emissions reductions, but this is not enough to address the scale of the challenge we face," said Tim Buckley, director of energy finance studies at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.
BHP CEO Mike Henry acknowledged the company had more work to do on sustainability, but said the emissions target was "ambitious, tangible, and achievable". He also defended the company's role in supporting the transition to cleaner energy, saying demand for minerals such as copper and nickel would increase as the world moved towards electric vehicles and renewable power.
BHP's results were in line with other mining companies, which have benefited from strong demand for commodities but are facing increased scrutiny over their contribution to climate change. Rio Tinto and Glencore both reported strong earnings in recent weeks but are also facing calls to do more on sustainability.
BHP's shares closed up 1.2% on the Australian stock exchange, despite the profit drop, as investors welcomed the company's dividend and emissions plans. However, the stock has underperformed compared to rivals in recent months, reflecting concerns over the company's exposure to China and its reliance on fossil fuels.
