Hong Kong Legislative Council President Andrew Wong has caused significant controversy today after announcing his membership in the city's provisional legislature.
Mr. Wong, who has held his position as Legislative Council President since 2016, made the surprise announcement at a press conference earlier today. According to Wong, he joined the provisional legislature to ensure that the voices of Hong Kong citizens are heard and that their interests are protected.
The provisional legislature is a controversial body created by the Chinese government in 1997 with the handover of Hong Kong. It is dominated by pro-Beijing politicians and is not subject to democratic elections.
Wong's move has been met with widespread criticism from pro-democracy activists, who have accused him of betraying his role as a defender of Hong Kong's democratic institutions.
"Andrew Wong has abandoned his principles and sold out the people of Hong Kong," said Joshua Wong, a prominent pro-democracy activist in the city. "He has turned his back on the people of Hong Kong and sided with the Chinese Communist Party."
Many others took to social media to express their outrage at Wong's decision, with the hashtag #resignandrewwong trending on Twitter in Hong Kong.
Critics have pointed out that Wong's move is particularly problematic given his role as Legislative Council President, which is supposed to be an independent position that acts as a check on the power of the government. They argue that Wong's membership in the provisional legislature undermines the integrity of the Legislative Council.
"Andrew Wong is supposed to be a neutral arbiter of the Legislative Council, but his membership in the provisional legislature shows that he is anything but neutral," said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy legislator in Hong Kong. "This is a clear conflict of interest that will damage the reputation of the Legislative Council and the trust that Hong Kong people have in its democratic institutions."
Despite the criticism, Wong has defended his decision, stating that he believes the provisional legislature can play a valuable role in promoting the interests of Hong Kong citizens. He has also pledged to continue to act independently in his role as Legislative Council President.
"I understand that this decision may be controversial, but I believe that it is the right thing to do for the people of Hong Kong," Wong said in a statement. "I will continue to act with integrity and independence in my role as Legislative Council President, and I will work tirelessly to ensure that the voices of Hong Kong citizens are heard and their interests are protected." 
The move by Wong is likely to deepen the political divide in Hong Kong, with tensions already high between pro-Beijing and pro-democracy factions. Many fear that the situation in the city could escalate further if the government continues to suppress dissent and restrict civil liberties, as it has done in recent years.
