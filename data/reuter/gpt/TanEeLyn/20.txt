Washington D.C.- Amidst increasing concerns regarding the erosion of Hong Kong's freedoms, the United States has reminded China of its responsibilities to preserve the autonomy and civil liberties of the territory post handover.
On Thursday, U.S. envoy to East Asia, Daniel Kritenbrink told reporters at a briefing, "For the United States, Hong Kong's autonomy, its freedoms, and the quality of life of its residents are of great importance and will remain so."
He went on to reaffirm Washington's support for the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which laid out the terms of the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China in 1997. The agreement was designed to guarantee rights and freedoms to Hong Kong's citizens, including the right to vote, free speech, and an independent judiciary under the principle of "one country, two systems."
However, many Hong Kong citizens and international observers have grown increasingly concerned that China is steadily chipping away at Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms. In recent years, there have been numerous incidents of China trying to exert greater control over Hong Kong's political process, including the disqualifications of pro-democracy lawmakers and the passing of a national security law that criminalizes dissent.
Kritenbrink's remarks come just days after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken criticized China for its actions in Hong Kong in his first address to Congress. He called China's crackdown on Hong Kong's democracy movement "a direct assault on the autonomy promised to Hong Kong in the Sino-British Joint Declaration."
In response to Kritenbrink's comments, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, told reporters that "Hong Kong is clearly a matter of Chinaâ€™s internal affairs and does not tolerate any foreign interference."
However, human rights activists and pro-democracy advocates welcomed Kritenbrink's comments, saying they were an important reminder to Beijing that the international community was watching and holding China accountable for its actions in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong tweeted that the U.S. "should condemn and sanction those who undermine the freedom and autonomy of Hong Kong, despite the backlash from the Chinese Communist Party."
The U.S. has increasingly been taking a more active role in speaking out against China's actions in Hong Kong. In March, the U.S. imposed sanctions on senior Chinese officials responsible for implementing the national security law in Hong Kong. The U.S. has also vowed to continue providing support to Hong Kong's democracy activists and civil society groups.
With China's growing assertiveness both domestically and internationally, the situation in Hong Kong remains tenuous. However, the U.S. and other international actors continue to call on Beijing to uphold its commitments to preserving Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy, and to respect the rights of its citizens.
