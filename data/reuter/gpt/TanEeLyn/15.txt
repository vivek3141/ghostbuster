Hong Kong was in a state of chaos on Tuesday as protesters clashed with police over the selection of the city's future leaders. China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, had arrived in the city to oversee the selection process, sparking outrage amongst pro-democracy protesters.
The selection process for Hong Kong's leaders has been a contentious issue for years, with many calling for greater autonomy from the Chinese government. Last year, protests erupted after the Chinese government proposed a national security law that would allow them to crack down on dissent in the city. The law was eventually passed, and many pro-democracy activists were jailed or forced to flee the city.
Tuesday's protests were the largest the city has seen in years, with thousands of people taking to the streets to voice their anger over the selection process. The protesters, many of whom were wearing masks and carrying banners, were met by a heavy police presence. Riot police were seen firing tear gas and pepper spray at the protesters, who responded by throwing rocks and bottles at the police.
The clashes continued for hours, with both sides refusing to back down. The Chinese government issued a statement condemning the protests, calling them "illegal" and "violent." They also accused the protesters of trying to "subvert the rule of law."
Pro-democracy activists, however, argue that they are fighting for the freedoms and rights of the people of Hong Kong. They say that the Chinese government is trying to impose its will on the city, and that the selection process for the city's leaders is rigged in favor of pro-Beijing candidates.
The selection process itself is also a point of contention. Under Hong Kong's constitution, known as the Basic Law, the city's leader is chosen by a committee of 1,200 people, most of whom are pro-Beijing loyalists. Critics argue that this system is undemocratic and unrepresentative of the people of Hong Kong.
Wang Yi's arrival in the city was seen as a provocation by many pro-democracy activists, who see him as a symbol of Chinese interference in Hong Kong's affairs. His presence in the city is also a reminder of the Chinese government's growing influence in the former British colony.
The clashes between protesters and police on Tuesday are likely to further inflame tensions in the city. Many fear that the situation in Hong Kong could spiral out of control, leading to greater violence and instability in the region.
