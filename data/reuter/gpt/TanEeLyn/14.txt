In a historic meeting held in Hong Kong on Friday, November 22, pro-democracy protesters attempted to disrupt the proceedings. The meeting, which was hosted by Chief Executive Carrie Lam, was aimed at fostering cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland.
The protesters had gathered outside the venue, the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, demanding democratic reforms and calling for an investigation into police brutality during the ongoing protests. After attempts to block the entrance to the hall failed, they snuck in disguised as reporters, waving banners and shouting slogans.
The meeting proceeded as planned, but with an added sense of tension in the air. Police and security personnel attempted to remove the protesters from the hall, resulting in chaotic scenes. Some of the protesters were arrested, while others were escorted out of the building.
Speaking at the meeting, Lam called for calm and dialogue, saying that violent protests were not the answer to the current crisis. She urged the protesters to engage in peaceful dialogue and work towards a resolution that would benefit all of Hong Kong.
The protesters, however, remained undeterred. They have been staging massive protests in Hong Kong for months, calling for greater democracy and an end to China's encroachment on the city's autonomy. The protests began in June over a controversial extradition bill, which has since been withdrawn, but have turned into a wider movement for greater democratic freedoms.
The meeting on Friday was seen as a crucial opportunity for China to signal its commitment to the "one country, two systems" policy, which guarantees Hong Kong's autonomy from mainland China. However, the protesters saw it as an attempt by the Chinese government to further tighten its grip on the city.
Several prominent pro-democracy activists were also present at the meeting, including Joshua Wong, who was recently released from prison after serving a sentence for his role in the 2014 Umbrella Movement. Wong called for a dialogue between the government and the protesters, saying that the ongoing unrest was a result of a "political crisis" in Hong Kong.
The protesters have been using a variety of tactics to draw attention to their cause, including disrupting public transport and occupying university campuses. The police response has been criticized by human rights groups, who say that excessive force has been used against the protesters.
The international community has also been closely watching developments in Hong Kong. The US Senate recently passed a bill that would require the US government to annually review Hong Kong's autonomy from mainland China, and to impose sanctions on individuals responsible for human rights abuses in the city.
The Chinese government has condemned the bill, calling it interference in its internal affairs. But with the ongoing protests showing no signs of abating, the pressure on China to find a solution to the crisis is only increasing.
As the meeting in Hong Kong came to a close, the protesters outside continued to voice their demands. The standoff between the government and the pro-democracy movement shows no signs of ending, and the future of Hong Kong remains uncertain.
