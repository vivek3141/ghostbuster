Norwegian engineering company Kvaerner ASA announced that it is planning to increase its portfolio in the Asia Pacific region, which it believes will be a significant growth area in the coming years. The company, which specializes in the design, engineering, and construction of oil platforms and related structures, said it sees strong demand for its services in the region amidst a growing demand for oil and gas.
Kvaerner has been focusing on the Asia Pacific market for several years now, and it has secured several key contracts in the region. The company is currently working on several major projects in the region, including the Johan Sverdrup platform in Norway, which is set to be one of the largest oil platforms in the world.
The company recently signed a contract with Japan's Yinson to provide the engineering and procurement services for a new floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel that will be installed in the Marlim oil field in Brazil. The vessel will be built in Singapore, and the work will be handled by Kvaerner's office in Malaysia.
"We are very excited about the opportunities in the Asia Pacific region and are actively looking for new projects to add to our portfolio," said Kvaerner's CEO, Karl-Petter Løken. "The region is a key growth area for the oil and gas industry, and we believe that we can play a key role in helping our clients to meet their production goals."
Kvaerner's move to expand its portfolio in the Asia Pacific region comes as the company is already experiencing strong growth in other markets. The company recently secured a new contract for the engineering, procurement, and construction of a new oil platform in the Norwegian Sea, which is currently under development. The platform is set to be one of the largest in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, and it will be operated by Equinor.
Kvaerner has a long history of working in the oil and gas industry, with more than 40 years of experience in the field. The company has a reputation for delivering high-quality projects on time and on budget, and it has a strong focus on innovation and sustainability.
"We are confident that we have the expertise, experience, and technology to deliver world-class projects in the Asia Pacific region," said Løken. "We look forward to working with our clients to help them achieve their goals and to help them navigate the challenges of the industry."
