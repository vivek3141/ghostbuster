Hong Kong's pro-democracy campaigners are fearing for the region's freedom following the imprisonment of a Chinese dissident. Jiang Yefei, a prominent political activist, has been sentenced to 11 years' jail term on the grounds of opposing the Chinese Communist Party's authoritarian rule.
Jiang was charged with subversion after being found guilty of colluding with foreign forces to undermine the Chinese Communist Party's authority. He was arrested in Cambodia in 2019 and later deported to China, where he was imprisoned and subjected to a secret trial without adequate legal representation.
The verdict has sparked concerns among activists in Hong Kong, who say it is a warning shot to all those opposing Beijing's power. "The sentencing of Jiang Yefei is a clear message from the Chinese Communist Party that any act of dissent will not be tolerated," said Emily Lau, a former Democratic Party lawmaker in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong rights groups fear that the case could embolden Beijing to take a harsher stance on dissenters, particularly following the national security law imposed on the region last year. Activists say the law aims to silence any opposition to the Communist Party's rule in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong.
Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement has been on the decline since Beijing implemented the controversial security law, which criminalizes secession, subversion, and collusion with foreign forces. Hong Kong authorities have used the law to arrest several pro-democracy activists since it came into effect.
Since the security law was introduced in Hong Kong, many activists have fled the city, fearing prosecution. Jiang, a former journalist, was among several Hong Kong activists who had sought refuge in Cambodia, only to be deported to China.
Activists have slammed Cambodia's actions in deporting Jiang to China, saying it was a clear violation of international human rights law. "Cambodia's betrayal of Jiang Yefei sends a message - those fleeing political persecution cannot count on protection in Cambodia," said Elaine Pearson, the director of the Asia-Pacific division at Human Rights Watch.
The sentencing of Jiang has prompted fresh calls from activists and human rights groups to pressure Beijing to release all political prisoners and stop the persecution of human rights defenders. There are currently more than 600 political prisoners in China, according to the US-based Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD).
The sentencing of Jiang Yefei has put the world on notice that Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms are under threat. It is essential that the international community takes urgent action to stop the persecution of human rights defenders and press for the immediate release of all political prisoners in China.
