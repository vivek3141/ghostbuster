Air China, the country's flagship carrier, has announced that it will be expanding its international routes and adding five new planes to its fleet. 
The company's president, Cai Jianjiang, said the expansion will enable the airline to better serve its international customers and meet growing demand for travel and air cargo transportation. 
"We are excited to announce our plan to expand our international routes and to add more planes to our fleet," Jianjiang said. "This is a significant milestone in our journey to become one of the world's leading airlines."
According to Jianjiang, Air China will be adding two Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners and three Airbus A350-900s to its fleet in 2021. The company will use these new planes to expand its international routes to cities in Europe, the Americas and Australia.
In addition to expanding its international network, Air China will also introduce new services on its existing routes. This includes the launch of a new business class cabin on select flights, as well as enhanced inflight entertainment and Wi-Fi services.
The expansion comes as China's aviation market continues to rebound from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In recent months, domestic travel has picked up, with airlines adding more flights and introducing new destinations.
However, with international travel still facing restrictions in many countries, Air China's expansion is aimed at capturing a larger share of the global market once travel resumes.
Air China's announcement also comes at a time when many airlines around the world are struggling to stay afloat due to the ongoing pandemic. With its strong financial standing and expanding fleet, Air China is well positioned to weather the storm and emerge as a major player in the global aviation industry. 
As airlines around the world continue to grapple with the impact of the pandemic, Air China's expansion plans are a sign of optimism for the future of the aviation industry. With increased connectivity and new services, the airline is poised to capture the growing demand for air travel once international borders reopen.
