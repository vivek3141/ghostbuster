Pro-Taiwan Community in Hong Kong Flies Nationalist Chinese Flags for Last Time before China Takeover
Hong Kong’s pro-Taiwan community has been flying Nationalist Chinese flags on July 1, marking the 24th anniversary of former British colony's handover to China. This is the last time they will be able to fly the flags in the city before China takes over the region.
The move comes as tension rises between China and Taiwan, and as Beijing continues to exert its control on Hong Kong. The region has seen a significant erosion of its autonomy since the 2019 anti-extradition protests, which led to the imposition of a national security law.
For the past two decades, pro-democracy activists and supporters of Taiwan have waved the flags as a show of their support for the island’s independent and democratic system. Many fear that their rights and freedoms will be curtailed further under China’s rule.
The Nationalist Chinese flags, or the Republic of China flags, are different from the current flag of Taiwan, which features the image of a white sun with 12 rays on a blue field. The Nationalist Chinese flag features a sun with three touchpoints and blue and red stripes.
The pro-Taiwan community in Hong Kong acknowledges the complexity of the Chinese civil war and Taiwan's position in it. The Nationalist Chinese Party, or Kuomintang, lost the Chinese civil war to the Communist Party of China in 1949. After their defeat, they retreated to Taiwan and established the Republic of China, which they continued to claim as the legitimate government of mainland China.
Speaking to the press, a member of the pro-Taiwan community said, “Flying the Nationalist Chinese flag is a way to show that we support Taiwan’s democratic values and reject Beijing’s totalitarianism. We understand the complexities of Taiwan’s history and the evolution of its democracy.”
“The flag is a symbol of defiance against Beijing’s claim that there is only one China, and that Taiwan is part of it,” the member added.
Hong Kong police have banned the annual July 1 march for the second year in a row, citing the pandemic as a reason. Last year, the ban was due to the national security law.
Chinese authorities have intensified their rhetoric against Taiwan, with President Xi Jinping recently declaring that China would "never allow" Taiwan to be a separate state.
Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen has called on the international community to band together to defend democratic values and thwart China's aggression.
As the countdown to China’s takeover continues, the pro-Taiwan community in Hong Kong is making their voice heard. Flying the Nationalist Chinese flags is their way of reminding China that the fight for democracy and freedom will not be silenced.
