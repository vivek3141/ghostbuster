Britain and China have agreed to introduce a new anti-espionage law in Hong Kong to address concerns over national security. However, both countries have also expressed caution against making major legal changes to the city before the 1997 handover to Chinese sovereignty.
The announcement was made during the first round of talks between Britain and China over Hong Kong's future. The meeting, which took place in London, was attended by senior officials from both countries, including China's Deputy Foreign Minister, Qin Gang, and Britain's Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab.
The new law will be aimed at preventing foreign interference in Hong Kong's affairs, particularly from countries that do not have legitimate interests in the city. It will also include provisions to address cyber security and espionage.
Speaking at a press conference after the talks, Qin Gang said that the law would "strengthen Hong Kong's defense against espionage and other illicit acts, and promote national security."
However, both China and Britain warned against making any major legal changes to Hong Kong's autonomy before the 1997 handover, which will mark 50 years since the city became a special administrative region of China. The two countries also renewed their commitment to the "one country, two systems" principle, which allows Hong Kong to maintain a separate legal system from mainland China.
Raab said he had raised concerns about the proposed changes to Hong Kong's electoral system, which would allow the Chinese government to select the city's leaders. He said Britain wanted to see a "genuine choice" for the people of Hong Kong and that the electoral system should be "inclusive and democratic."
Qin Gang said that China was "committed to the sound and steady implementation of the 'one country, two systems' principle" and that the changes to Hong Kong's electoral system were "necessary and justified."
The talks also covered economic issues, including the possibility of a free trade agreement between Britain and China. Qin Gang said that China was "willing to speed up the negotiations" but added that there were "still some differences" between the two countries.
The talks come amid growing tensions between China and the West over issues such as human rights, trade, and the coronavirus pandemic. Last year, Britain offered residency and later citizenship to up to three million Hong Kong residents following China's imposition of a controversial national security law in the city.
The new anti-espionage law is likely to be seen as a further attempt by China to tighten its grip on Hong Kong. Critics have accused Beijing of eroding the city's autonomy and suppressing dissent.
In a joint statement, China and Britain said that they had "productive and frank discussions" and that they remained "committed to working together to promote stability and prosperity in the region." However, the statement also acknowledged that there were "complex issues" to be addressed and that "constructive dialogue" was needed.
