PARIS â€“ The fate of France's second largest airline Air Liberte still hangs in the balance, as the deadline for bids to acquire the financially troubled company passed on Monday with not a single solid offer on the table.
Air Liberte, which carries around 2 million passengers a year, operates on a budget airline model, focusing on leisure routes from Paris to Mediterranean destinations such as Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. It has been struggling for years, failing to make a profit in 2020 due to the pandemic, which hit the aviation industry hard.
Its owner, the Franco-Dutch investment firm Groupe Dubreuil, last year announced plans to find a new partner or sell the company entirely. The news was met with concern from employees, who feared job losses and the potential disappearance of their airline. The French government has also taken an interest in the situation, as it seeks to maintain a competitive aviation market.
The deadline for bids to be submitted was set at June 7, but so far none of the potential buyers have come forward with a concrete proposal. Air France-KLM, which recently launched a low-cost subsidiary called Transavia France, said it did not plan to bid for Air Liberte. Other potential investors include the Irish carrier Ryanair, and the Tunisian airline Syphax Airlines, though it is unclear if they have submitted bids.
Air Liberte's future is now uncertain, with the possibility of it being liquidated or otherwise restructured looming. The airline's employees have expressed their frustration at the situation, with some taking to the streets outside the company's headquarters in Paris to protest.
"We are all very concerned about what will happen to us," said Francois, a cabin crew member who has worked for Air Liberte for five years. "We hope that someone will step in and save our company, but it's not looking good."
The situation has also raised questions about the future of the French aviation industry, which has been hit hard by the pandemic and faces stiff competition from low-cost carriers. Many in the industry are calling for more government support to ensure that French airlines can remain competitive and avoid being forced out of business.
"The French government needs to do more to support our industry and ensure that we can survive in this difficult market," said Philippe, a pilot for a French airline. "Without help, we risk losing our airlines and our jobs, which would be a huge blow to the economy."
The French government has not yet commented on the situation with Air Liberte, but has previously expressed concern about the future of the aviation industry. In a recent interview, Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said that he was working on a plan to support French airlines, but declined to give any details.
The fate of Air Liberte remains uncertain, but its employees and many in the aviation industry are hoping that a solution can be found before it's too late. The next few weeks will be crucial, as the airline's future hangs in the balance. Few believe it can continue operating as normal, but what exactly will happen next remains to be seen.
