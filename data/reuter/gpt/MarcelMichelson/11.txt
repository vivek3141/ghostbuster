Seoul, South Korea – CEO and Chairman of Daewoo Electronics, Mr. Kim Gwang-soo, promised during a press conference on Monday that the acquisition of France’s Thomson Multimedia will result in job creation and investments in the European market. The pledge was made following Daewoo’s buyout of Thomson’s TV and video equipment business.
Daewoo Electronics has set its sights on increasing its presence in Europe and this acquisition allows the company to tap into Thomson’s established market share in the region. The South Korean company’s purchase of Thomson’s TV and video business includes the rights to the Thomson and RCA brand names and all related licensing agreements. While the financial terms of the sale were not disclosed, the deal is expected to complete by the end of this year.
Mr. Kim spoke at the press conference in Seoul, saying: “The acquisition of Thomson Multimedia marks a significant step forward for Daewoo Electronics as we expand our European customer base”. He also confirmed that the company plans to create new jobs and increase investment in France and other European countries to support the growth of the business in the region.
Thomson’s TV and video equipment business, founded in 1928, was one of Europe's largest and most recognizable manufacturers of consumer electronics. After experiencing financial difficulties, the company had previously tried to sell the same business to China's TCL in 2013, but the deal fell through.
Following Daewoo’s acquisition, it will inherit Thomson’s factories in China and Poland, as well as its extensive customer base in Europe. However, the purchase of the company also carries a risk as it makes Daewoo susceptible to fluctuations in the European market.
Mr. Kim acknowledged this risk during the press conference but expressed confidence in the company's ability to navigate these challenges. "We believe in the future of the European market and Thomson’s capabilities to excel in providing innovative products. We plan to maintain the brand’s intellectual property and continue the brand’s tradition of quality," he said.
The acquisition is a significant move for Daewoo Electronics as it seeks to expand its global reach and brand recognition. The company expects to invest heavily in research and development, in order to bring innovative products to market and remain competitive.
The deal could have wider implications for the consumer electronics industry as a whole, with some industry analysts speculating that Daewoo's acquisition of Thomson’s TV and video business could lead to more consolidation in the market. While there are no concrete plans for further mergers at present, some industry insiders believe that we could see more buyouts and consolidations in the future.
After the announcement, shares in Daewoo Electronics rose by 3 percent, reflecting investor confidence in the company’s ability to capitalize on the acquisition. However, some experts have warned that there are still potential risks associated with the purchase, including economic uncertainty in Europe and competition from other electronics manufacturers.
Despite these concerns, Mr. Kim remained positive and expressed his belief that the acquisition would be a game-changer for Daewoo Electronics. "We are excited to add Thomson Multimedia to our portfolio of consumer electronics brands. We believe that this acquisition has the potential to transform our business and drive growth for years to come," he said.
The acquisition of Thomson Multimedia is set to be completed by the end of the year, with the official transfer of ownership taking place after regulatory approval from France’s competition watchdog. The acquisition is the latest in a series of moves by Daewoo Electronics to expand its business and cement its position as a major player in the global electronics market.
