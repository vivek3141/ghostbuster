British Airways and Groupe Rivaud have made a joint bid for French regional airline Air Liberte. The airline, which was in financial trouble, was put up for sale earlier this year.
The bid is said to be worth around €10 million, and includes the purchasing of the airline’s fleet and taking on its employees.
Air Liberte currently operates flights from several French regional airports including Lyon, Marseille, Nice and Toulouse. The airline has faced stiff competition from other larger airlines in the region, which has resulted in declining passenger numbers over the years.
The deal, which is subject to approval from French authorities, would see Air Liberte merge with British Airways’ regional subsidiary, BA CityFlyer, which operates flights in Europe from London City airport. Groupe Rivaud, a French family-owned group that specializes in logistics, would also be a partner in the venture.
The proposed acquisition is part of British Airways’ strategy to expand its presence in Europe and offer more connectivity to its customers. By combining Air Liberte’s regional network with BA CityFlyer’s existing routes, British Airways hopes to offer more travel options for customers in France and other parts of Europe.
Commenting on the acquisition, British Airways’ CEO Alex Cruz said: “We are excited to work with Groupe Rivaud and create a stronger regional network in France, which will allow us to offer our customers more travel options. We believe that the acquisition of Air Liberte will be a great addition to our existing business and strengthen our position in the European market.”
Groupe Rivaud’s CEO, Alexandre Rivaud, echoed similar sentiments, saying: “We are delighted to partner with British Airways, which is one of the leading airlines in the world. Air Liberte has a rich history in the French aviation industry, and we look forward to working together to create a stronger and more successful airline.”
The move comes at a time when the airline industry is going through a period of consolidation and restructuring, as airlines seek to navigate the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The acquisition of Air Liberte by British Airways and Groupe Rivaud comes at a time when many airlines are seeking to expand their regional networks to capture market share.
British Airways’ bid for Air Liberte is the latest move by the airline to expand its presence in Europe. Earlier this year, the airline launched new routes to destinations such as Montpellier and Bordeaux in France, and Palermo and Catania in Italy.
The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval from French authorities, and if approved, is expected to be completed in the coming months.
In summary, British Airways and Groupe Rivaud have made a joint bid for French airline Air Liberte, which would see the airline merge with British Airways’ regional subsidiary, BA CityFlyer. The acquisition is part of British Airways’ strategy to expand its presence in Europe and offer more connectivity to its customers. The deal is worth around €10 million and is subject to regulatory approval.
