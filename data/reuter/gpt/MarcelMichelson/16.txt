Air France has announced that it is ready to take on competition from British Airways in the domestic market, following the recent acquisition of the French airline Aigle Azur.
The acquisition of Aigle Azur, which went bankrupt in September 2019, has given Air France a significant boost in its domestic operations. The deal included Aigle Azur's landing slots at Orly airport, which is a key gateway to tourist destinations in France and Europe. Air France also gained access to Aigle Azur's customer base, which includes a loyal following of business travelers.
Air France CEO, Anne Rigail, said in a recent interview, "The acquisition of Aigle Azur has given us a valuable opportunity to strengthen our position in the French domestic market. We are now able to offer more flights and destinations to our customers, particularly those who travel for business."
British Airways has been expanding its presence in the French market in recent years, following its acquisition of the low-cost airline, Monarch. The airline has been offering flights between London and Paris, as well as other popular destinations in France. However, Air France is confident that it can compete with British Airways in the domestic market, especially with its new acquisition.
"We welcome competition in the market as it keeps us focused on delivering the best possible service to our customers. We believe we are well-positioned to take on British Airways and other airlines in the French domestic market," Rigail added.
Air France has already announced plans to expand its domestic operations, with the addition of new routes and increased frequency on existing routes. The airline is also investing in new aircraft, such as the Airbus A220, a highly-efficient aircraft that is ideal for short-haul flights.
Air France is also planning to improve its customer service, with the introduction of new digital services and improved onboard amenities. In addition, the airline is working on reducing its carbon footprint by investing in sustainable aviation fuel and implementing measures to reduce its waste and energy consumption.
The French government has also shown its support for Air France in its bid to take on British Airways, with its recent announcement of a â‚¬7 billion aid package for the airline. The package includes loans and guarantees, as well as state equity investment, to help Air France weather the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Air France is confident that its strong brand, domestic network, and new acquisition, will give it an edge over its competitors in the French market. With the support of the French government and its commitment to sustainable aviation, the airline is poised to take on British Airways and other airlines in the French domestic market.
In conclusion, Air France's acquisition of Aigle Azur has given it a valuable opportunity to strengthen its position in the French domestic market. The airline is now poised to take on competition from British Airways, with plans to expand its domestic operations, improve its customer service, and invest in sustainable aviation. With the support of the French government and its commitment to innovation, Air France is confident it can stay ahead of its competitors and emerge as a leader in the French aviation market.
