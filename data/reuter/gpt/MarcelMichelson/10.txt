Daewoo has attempted to reassure the French government over its planned acquisition of Thomson Multimedia by denying any intention to move the regional headquarters from France. The move comes after French Industry Minister Christian Pierret expressed concern over the sale of Thomson’s television and consumer electronics division to the South Korean conglomerate.
Thomson Multimedia is the parent company of France’s top television maker, Thomson, and its sale prompted fears over job losses in the country. The French government, which owns 25% of the company, also expressed concern over the potential loss of industry know-how and the impact on the country’s electronic industry.
In response, Daewoo issued a statement saying that “there is no plan at all to remove the regional headquarters from France. On the contrary, we are going to reinforce the French site and enhance the competitiveness of the European market.” The statement also highlighted the complementary nature of the two companies’ products and the potential benefits of their joint research and development capabilities.
The proposed acquisition is part of Daewoo’s strategy to expand its electronics business globally. However, the move has sparked concerns among employees and unions at Thomson, who fear job losses and a dismantling of the company’s research and development operations in France.
Thomson Multimedia has undergone significant restructuring in recent years in order to focus on its core activities, with a primary focus on broadcasting technology and digital media. The sale of its television and consumer electronics division is part of this strategic shift and will enable the company to concentrate its resources on high-growth areas such as digital set-top boxes and mobile multimedia.
The French government has been working to secure the future of Thomson and its 14,000 employees in France. The company has been a major player in the country’s electronics industry for decades and is an important employer, particularly in areas such as the Loire region where it has manufacturing bases.
Speaking to reporters, Industry Minister Christian Pierret said that the French government wanted to ensure that the sale protected Thomson’s industrial facilities in France and the jobs of its employees. “We want there to be no loss of jobs or any relocation of activities outside France,” he said.
The acquisition of Thomson Multimedia is not the first time Daewoo has invested in the European market. In 1995, the company purchased the British car manufacturer, Rover, but ultimately failed to turn the struggling company around and sold it to BMW in 2000.
The deal with Thomson has yet to be finalised, as it requires approval from the French government, the European Union, and the United States Federal Trade Commission. The sale was initially announced in April 2000, but has been delayed due to regulatory issues.
Daewoo’s attempts to calm French concerns have been met with a mixed response. While some have welcomed the company’s commitment to maintaining the regional headquarters in France, others remain worried about the potential impact on jobs and the impact on the country’s electronic industry.
The sale of Thomson Multimedia is a significant moment for the French electronics industry, and the outcome of the negotiations will have a major impact on the future of the country’s technology sector. The French government has a responsibility to safeguard the interests of its workers and protect the country’s industrial base, while Daewoo must demonstrate its commitment to long-term investment in the region.
