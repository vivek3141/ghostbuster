PARIS â€“ French President Emmanuel Macron announced today the sale of state-owned industrial giant Thomson SA to a private consortium for the symbolic sum of one franc. The move has been described by the government as a bold step to revitalise France's defence and consumer electronics sectors, creating a major new force in the world defence industry.
Thomson SA was founded in 1893 and has a storied history of producing cutting-edge technology for both civilian and military use. The company's military division has been responsible for designing and manufacturing key weapons systems for the French armed forces, including the Exocet missile, while its civilian electronics division has been responsible for creating some of the most innovative consumer electronics products of recent years.
The buyer consortium, which will be led by private equity firm Bridgepoint and include several French and international investors, has promised to invest heavily in Thomson SA's R&D facilities and modernize its manufacturing processes to ensure that it remains at the forefront of technology development.
"The sale of Thomson SA is a vital move for the revitalization of France's defence and consumer electronics sectors," said President Macron in a statement announcing the deal. "Under our ownership, the company has been a cornerstone of the French industrial landscape for over 100 years, but we recognize that only through bold partnerships with innovative investors can we ensure that it continues to drive technological progress and competitiveness in the years to come."
The move to privatize Thomson SA is part of a wider strategy by the Macron administration to reduce the role of the state in key sectors of the economy to maximize efficiency and competitiveness. The government has vowed to reinvest the proceeds from the sale into a range of new initiatives aimed at accelerating innovation and supporting start-ups in the high-tech sector.
The decision to sell the company for a symbolic one franc has attracted some criticism, with some questioning why the government would not seek to maximize the price it received for such a valuable asset. However, most analysts have praised the decision, arguing that the benefits of creating a major new force in the world defence industry would outweigh any short-term financial gain.
"The sale of Thomson SA will undoubtedly be a major boost for the French defence industry," said Richard Aboulafia, a leading analyst in the aerospace and defence sector. "Creating a more streamlined, innovative and competitive industrial landscape will help to ensure that France remains at the cutting edge of military technology, and this move is a key step in achieving that goal."
The announcement of the sale has also been met with approval in the investment community, with many hailing it as a shrewd move that will generate significant returns for all stakeholders.
"Our consortium is incredibly excited to have acquired such an important and iconic company as Thomson SA," said a spokesperson for Bridgepoint. "We recognize the incredible value inherent in its brand, its technology and the expertise of its employees, and we are committed to unlocking that value through substantial investment in research and development, modernization of manufacturing processes and strategic acquisitions. We believe that, working together with the fantastic working force of Thomson SA, we can create a major new force in the world defence industry, capable of competing at the highest levels and driving technological progress in a range of key sectors."
The full terms of the deal are yet to be disclosed, but it is expected that the new consortium will take control of Thomson SA's operations in the coming months, with a view to driving innovation and growth in the years to come. With French defence spending set to rise significantly in the coming years, and with demand for cutting-edge technology and innovative consumer electronics products expected to remain strong, the future of Thomson SA looks bright under its new private ownership.
