France Telecom has announced that it is planning to expand its operations internationally in response to growing competition in France. The company, which is currently the largest telecommunications provider in France, has seen its market share eroded in recent years by new entrants offering cheaper and more innovative services.
In a statement to investors, France Telecom CEO Stephane Richard said that the company needed to diversify its revenue streams in order to remain profitable in an increasingly competitive market. "We know that the French telecommunications market is no longer enough for us to sustain our growth," he said. "We need to look abroad to find new markets and new customers."
Richard said that France Telecom would focus on expanding its operations in three key regions: Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The company already has a presence in many of these markets, but will be looking to invest in new infrastructure and partnerships to increase its market share.
Analysts have hailed the move as a smart strategy for France Telecom, which has struggled in recent years to keep up with lower-cost rivals. "France Telecom is facing a tough challenge in France, where margins are being squeezed and competition is fierce," said telecoms analyst Eric Debroise. "Expanding into new markets is a smart move, as it allows the company to tap into new sources of revenue and growth."
However, the move is not without risks. France Telecom will be entering markets where it has little experience or local knowledge, and will face stiff competition from established players. It will also need to invest heavily in infrastructure and technology to be competitive in these new markets.
Despite these challenges, France Telecom is bullish about its prospects. "We have a strong track record of success in the telecommunications industry, and we are confident that we can replicate that success in new markets," said Richard. "We believe that expanding internationally is the best way to ensure our continued growth and success in the years ahead."
