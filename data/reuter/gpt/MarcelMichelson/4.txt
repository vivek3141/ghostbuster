France is set to merge state-owned defence technology company Thomson SA with Lagardere Groupe, to create a leading force in the world defence industry. The announcement was made on Friday by French Defense Minister, Florence Parly.
The merger is expected to create a company worth over 10 billion euros, with a workforce of about 45,000 people. Defense Minister Parly said the new company would have the scale and innovation capacity to compete with the biggest players in the defence industry.
The merger will combine the strengths of Thomson SA, which specializes in defence electronics and systems, with Lagardere Groupe, a defense and media conglomerate that owns missile maker MBDA and military electronics firm Sagem.
"This merger is a major step towards creating a leading European player in the defence industry, which, in the face of growing competition, is essential to our sovereignty and our ability to defend ourselves," Defense Minister Parly said.
The proposed merger has received approval from the French government and will now go through a consultation process with employee representatives and industry stakeholders. The deal is expected to be completed by 2022, following regulatory approval from French and European authorities.
The new company, which will be headquartered in Paris, is expected to have a strong presence in the global defence market, with significant operations in the United States, the Middle East, and Asia. The merger is also expected to boost France's independent defence capability and help create jobs in the country.
The French government will have a 20% stake in the new company, with Lagardere Groupe holding a 10% stake and the remaining shares to be held by other investors. The merger will also involve the transfer of certain assets from Lagardere Groupe to Thomson SA, to create a more balanced and competitive company.
"The creation of this new defence giant is a significant milestone for our country, and I am confident that it will bring great benefits to our national security and economy," French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement.
The announcement of the merger comes as the global defence industry is undergoing a period of consolidation, with companies seeking to bolster their scale and capabilities to compete with larger rivals. The merger is expected to result in significant cost savings for the new company, through the consolidation of research and development, production, and procurement operations.
"The combined company will be able to deliver innovative and cost-effective solutions to customers, while creating value for shareholders and employees," said Jean-Yves Le Gall, CEO of Lagardere Groupe.
The new company is expected to have a broad portfolio of products and services, including electronic warfare systems, missile technology, communication systems, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance solutions. It will also have a strong presence in the naval and aviation sectors, with expertise in the development of advanced radar and sensor technologies.
The announcement of the merger has been welcomed by industry experts, who see it as a positive step towards strengthening France's position in the global defence industry.
"This merger will create a powerhouse in the defence industry, with the ability to compete with the biggest players in the sector," said Jane's Defence Weekly analyst, Ben Vogel.
The merger of Thomson SA and Lagardere Groupe is expected to significantly enhance France's military capabilities and create a leading force in the international defence industry. With the support of the French government and a broad portfolio of products and services, the new company is poised to play a key role in shaping the future of global defence.
