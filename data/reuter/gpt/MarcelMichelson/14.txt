British Airways and French bank Rivaud are reportedly joining forces to make a bid for Air Liberte, the French airline that has been struggling financially for some time now. According to sources close to the matter, the deal could be worth around 250 million euros.
This move comes after Air France-KLM, Europe's largest airline, cancelled a plan to buy the struggling French airline earlier this year. Air Liberte struggled to achieve profitability and has faced several financial challenges in recent years, including a lack of capital investment.
The partnership between British Airways and Rivaud is aimed at rescuing Air Liberte, which operates primarily in France and on some international routes. The airlines are looking to expand Air Liberte's and its ability to serve more destinations.
Both British Airways and Rivaud have significant experience in the aviation industry. British Airways is one of the largest airlines in the world, with a fleet of over 300 aircraft flying to more than 200 destinations worldwide. Rivaud is a commercial bank with extensive experience in financing aviation projects. 
The two companies plan to invest in Air Liberte to enable it to grow and become a leading airline in Europe. The partnership would also create new employment opportunities, which would be a welcome development in the current economic climate.
The deal between British Airways and Rivaud highlights the importance of finding new ways to support the aviation industry during the current crisis. With airlines facing unprecedented challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partnerships like this one could be the way forward.
The aviation industry has been hit particularly hard during the pandemic, with many airlines struggling financially due to a significant drop in passenger traffic. While travel is now beginning to pick up again, it will take time for the industry to fully recover.
The deal between British Airways and Rivaud is also a significant development in the context of Brexit. The UK's departure from the European Union has raised concerns about the country's ability to participate fully in the European market. However, this partnership demonstrates that British companies can still form partnerships with European companies to achieve their goals.
In conclusion, it is clear that the aviation industry is facing significant challenges during this time of uncertainty and disruption. However, partnerships like the one between British Airways and Rivaud offer hope for a sustainable future for the industry. By working together, companies can develop innovative solutions to the challenges they face, creating employment opportunities and driving economic growth. 
The bid for Air Liberte will be watched closely by industry experts and investors alike, as it represents a significant step in the ongoing efforts to support the aviation industry during this difficult time. If successful, it could pave the way for other strategic partnerships in the future, as companies seek to build a more resilient and sustainable aviation industry. The future of Air Liberte now hangs in the balance, but this move could be the start of a new chapter for the airline and the wider aviation industry.
