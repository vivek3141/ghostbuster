Paris, France - Jacques Maillot, the Chairman of Nouvelles Frontieres, has announced his plans to acquire AOM Airlines, a French airline company that has been struggling to stay afloat in recent years. The move is aimed at boosting the growth of Nouvelles Frontieres, which started as a small travel agency in the 1960s and has since grown to become one of the largest tour operators in Europe.
The acquisition of AOM Airlines is seen as a strategic move for Nouvelles Frontieres, as it will allow the company to offer a wider range of vacation packages to its customers. The acquisition will also give Nouvelles Frontieres access to AOM Airlines' network of flight routes, which includes destinations in Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean.
"We are excited to announce that we have entered into an agreement to acquire AOM Airlines," said Maillot in a statement. "We believe that this acquisition is an important step in our growth strategy and will allow us to offer our customers even more choice and flexibility when it comes to their travel plans."
AOM Airlines was founded in 1990 and has since struggled to keep up with the competition in the airline industry. The company has faced financial difficulties in recent years, and its passenger numbers have steadily declined. However, Maillot remains optimistic about the future of the airline.
"We believe that AOM Airlines has tremendous potential, and we are confident that with our expertise and resources, we can help the airline to thrive once again," said Maillot.
The acquisition of AOM Airlines is expected to be completed by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. The financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.
The news of the acquisition has been met with mixed reactions from industry experts. Some have praised Maillot for his foresight in acquiring a struggling airline, while others have expressed concerns about the challenges that Nouvelles Frontieres may face in turning around AOM Airlines.
"Acquiring a struggling airline is always a risky move," said aviation analyst Jean-Pierre Belon. "It remains to be seen whether Nouvelles Frontieres will be able to overcome the financial and operational hurdles that AOM Airlines has been facing."
Despite the challenges, Maillot remains confident that the acquisition will be a success.
"We have a proven track record of success in the travel industry, and we are committed to ensuring that AOM Airlines is a profitable and successful venture for our company," he said.
The growth of Nouvelles Frontieres has been impressive in recent years. The company has expanded its operations to include hotels, cruises, and other travel-related services. With the acquisition of AOM Airlines, the company is poised to become an even larger player in the travel industry.
"We are excited about the future of Nouvelles Frontieres and the opportunities that this acquisition will bring," said Maillot. "We look forward to continuing to provide our customers with unforgettable travel experiences, and we are confident that we will achieve great things together with AOM Airlines."
