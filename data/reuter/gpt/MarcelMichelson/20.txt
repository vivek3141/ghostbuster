Paris, France - The chairman of travel company Nouvelles Frontieres, Pascal Viguier, recently spoke about the company's decision to acquire troubled French airline AOM after dropping out of the Air Liberte deal.
Nouvelles Frontieres initially had its sights set on Air Liberte, but after negotiations fell through due to issues with the airline's debts and staff, the company shifted its focus to AOM.
In a statement released on Monday, Viguier stated that Nouvelles Frontieres had "identified a number of strategic opportunities" with AOM and believed the acquisition would benefit both companies.
"AOM has a strong presence in a number of key markets that are of interest to Nouvelles Frontieres, such as North and West Africa, the Caribbean, and Reunion Island," said Viguier. "We believe that by combining our strengths, we can create a stronger, more competitive entity that offers a wider range of travel options to customers."
The acquisition of AOM would come at a critical time for the airline, which has been struggling to stay afloat amid fierce competition and mounting debts. In recent months, AOM has been forced to cancel a number of flights due to financial difficulties, leaving thousands of passengers stranded and causing widespread frustration.
Viguier acknowledged the challenges facing AOM but expressed confidence in the airline's ability to turn things around.
"We understand that AOM has been going through a difficult period recently, but we believe that with our support and expertise, the airline can rebound and regain its position as a leading player in the French aviation market," he said.
The acquisition of AOM would be a major coup for Nouvelles Frontieres, which has been aggressively expanding its presence in the travel industry in recent years. The company has made a number of strategic acquisitions and partnerships, including the purchase of Belgium-based travel company Thomas Cook and a joint venture with Spanish hotel chain Melia.
Viguier emphasized that Nouvelles Frontieres' focus on growth and innovation would continue, with the company remaining committed to providing high-quality travel experiences for its customers.
"We're constantly looking for new ways to improve and evolve our business, whether it's through strategic partnerships, innovative technologies, or a continued focus on customer satisfaction," he said. "We believe that the acquisition of AOM is a significant step forward for us, and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead."
The acquisition of AOM is still subject to regulatory approval and is expected to take several months to complete. However, Viguier and the rest of the Nouvelles Frontieres team are optimistic about the outcome and are confident that the deal will ultimately be successful.
"We're committed to making this acquisition work and ensuring that both our companies are stronger and more successful together than they would be apart," said Viguier. "We believe that the future of the travel industry is bright, and we're excited to be a part of it."
