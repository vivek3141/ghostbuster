AT&T's New Chief Operating Officer Believes Execution is Key to Strategy Success
AT&T has hired Jeff McElfresh as its new Chief Operating Officer (COO), effective April 1. McElfresh previously worked as President of AT&T Technology Operations and has been with the company for nearly 25 years. 
In a recent interview, McElfresh expressed his belief that execution is key to strategy success.
"Execution is what sets companies apart," McElfresh stated. "You can have the best strategy in the world, but if you don't execute it well, it's not going to matter." 
AT&T has faced challenges in recent years, including declining revenue in its legacy wireline and satellite TV businesses. The company has also been under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management to reduce costs and improve shareholder returns. 
McElfresh acknowledged these challenges but expressed confidence in AT&T's strategy and ability to execute. He cited the company's acquisition of Time Warner and its focus on building a next-generation 5G network as examples of successful strategy execution.
"We've made some big bets, and now it's time to execute on those bets," McElfresh said. "We need to focus on building out our 5G network, expanding our fiber footprint, and driving innovation across the company."
McElfresh's appointment as COO is part of a larger restructuring effort at AT&T. The company is consolidating its WarnerMedia division, which includes HBO and CNN, and combining it with its entertainment division. The move is intended to streamline operations and better align the company's media and entertainment offerings. 
AT&T is also planning to launch a new streaming service, HBO Max, in May. The service will feature content from HBO, Warner Bros., DC Entertainment, and other properties owned by the company. 
McElfresh acknowledged the competitive landscape in the streaming industry but expressed confidence in AT&T's ability to succeed.
"We have some of the most valuable content in the world, and we're going to make it available to consumers in a really exciting way," McElfresh said. "We're confident that we can compete with anyone in the streaming space."
McElfresh's appointment comes as AT&T faces increased scrutiny from regulators. The company is currently in a legal battle with the Department of Justice over its acquisition of Time Warner. The DOJ has argued that the acquisition would harm competition and lead to higher prices for consumers. AT&T has disputed these claims and is fighting the case in court. 
McElfresh declined to comment on the legal battle but expressed confidence in AT&T's ability to navigate the regulatory environment. 
"We have a great legal team, and we're going to continue to work through the legal challenges," McElfresh said. "At the end of the day, we're focused on delivering value to our customers and shareholders, and we believe we have a strong plan to do that." 
Overall, McElfresh's appointment as COO and his focus on execution could be what AT&T needs to succeed in the competitive telecommunications market. As the company faces challenges in its legacy businesses and expands into new areas like streaming, McElfresh's leadership will be critical to AT&T's success in the years to come.
