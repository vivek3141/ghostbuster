In a move that is expected to create a telecommunications giant, WorldCom, Inc. has announced its purchase of MFS Communications in a $14 billion stock swap. The deal is the largest ever in the telecommunications industry.
WorldCom is already an established firm in the telecommunications industry and is the second largest long-distance carrier in the United States. MFS Communications, on the other hand, is a young company that has built a reputation for itself in the industry by providing fiber optic network services to businesses and government agencies.
In the deal, MFS shareholders will receive 1.3 shares of WorldCom's stock for each share of MFS stock they own. This values MFS shares at $51, a 34% premium over their closing price the day before the announcement.
Both companies' boards of directors have unanimously approved the deal, which is still subject to regulatory approval. The companies expect to complete the transaction by the middle of next year.
Industry analysts say the acquisition will allow WorldCom to expand its operations in the high-growth business of providing data, video, and voice services to corporate and government customers. With the addition of MFS's impressive fiber optic network, WorldCom will be better positioned to compete with larger rivals such as AT&T and Sprint.
"The acquisition of MFS Communications is a major step forward for WorldCom in our quest to become the world's leading provider of advanced telecommunications services," said Bernard Ebbers, WorldCom's president and chief executive officer. "This combination will create a company with unmatched capabilities to serve the growing data and communications needs of businesses and organizations around the world."
Analysts say the acquisition is part of a larger trend in the telecommunications industry, as carriers seek to expand beyond traditional long-distance services and into the lucrative business of providing high-speed data and Internet services to businesses and other large customers.
"This deal represents a significant shift in the industry, as major long-distance carriers move into new markets and compete head-to-head with the Baby Bells and other local phone companies," said Michael Bowman, an analyst with Salomon Brothers.
The merger also underscores the importance of fiber optic technology in the telecommunications industry. Fiber optic cable is capable of transmitting massive amounts of data, video, and voice signals at extremely high speeds, making it a critical component in the construction of advanced telecommunications networks.
By acquiring MFS, WorldCom gains access to an extensive fiber optic network that covers more than 2,000 miles of major U.S. cities and connects to a number of key international cities, including London, Paris, and Frankfurt.
"For WorldCom, this acquisition represents a major investment in the future of the telecommunications industry," said Ebbers. "We believe that fiber optic technology will be a critical component in the creation of advanced networks that will serve the needs of businesses and organizations of all sizes around the world."
Analysts say the acquisition will also be a major boost to MFS, which has faced fierce competition from larger rivals such as AT&T and Sprint in recent years. With WorldCom's extensive resources and experience in the telecommunications industry, MFS will be better positioned to compete in the fast-growing data services market.
"MFS has built a reputation as a first-rate provider of advanced telecommunications services, and this deal provides the company with the resources it needs to continue to grow and thrive in the industry," said Ebbers.
Overall, the acquisition is expected to be a major win for both companies, allowing them to better compete in a rapidly changing telecommunications market that is increasingly focused on high-speed data and Internet services.
"We're excited about the future of this new, combined company," said Ebbers. "Together, we have the resources, experience, and technology to create the world's leading provider of advanced telecommunications services."
