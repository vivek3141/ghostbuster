AT&T Chairman and CEO, Randall Stephenson, announced on Friday that he will retire from his positions in July, following a 13-year tenure with the company. The announcement marked a shift in the direction of one of the biggest telecommunications companies in the world, and triggered speculation about Stephenson's potential successors.
The 60-year-old CEO, who came up through the AT&T ranks, told investors during a call on Friday that he felt "the time was right" to step down from his positions. "I'm confident in the way I'm leaving the company and its future," he said. "AT&T is on course for a bright future."
Stephenson's decision to retire followed months of pressure from activist investor, Elliott Management, which owns a $3.2 billion stake in the company. The investor had called for a shake-up of the company's management and strategy, and sought to end AT&T's mergers and acquisitions spree, which included the $85 billion purchase of Time Warner.
Speaking about Stephenson's retirement, Jesse Cohn, a partner at Elliott Management, said in a statement: "His vision and leadership have been vital to the transformation of AT&T into a modern media company during a time of significant technological change."
Stephenson, who will remain as executive chairman of the board until January, will be succeeded by John Stankey, a 57-year-old entertainment industry veteran. Stankey currently serves as COO of AT&T and CEO of its WarnerMedia division. He is widely seen as Stephenson's heir apparent, having been put in charge of the company's content strategy and operations since 2018.
During Friday's call with investors, Stankey thanked Stephenson for his mentorship and leadership, and said he was "excited to continue driving the company forward." He also acknowledged the challenges facing AT&T, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downturn, but expressed confidence in the company's ability to come through those difficulties.
"AT&T has been through many challenges before, and we've always managed to emerge stronger," he said. "We will continue to invest in our infrastructure, content, and technology, while balancing the needs of all our stakeholders."
Stankey's appointment was welcomed by industry analysts, who praised his experience in the media and entertainment sectors. "Stankey has shown that he has a vision for the future of AT&T, and he has the skills to execute on that vision," said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson.
However, some analysts also said that Stankey's elevation could lead to further changes within the company, and potentially a sell-off of some of its businesses. "The market is expecting Stankey to take a harder line on under-performing assets," said Richard Kramer, an analyst at Arete Research.
Meanwhile, Stephenson's retirement sparked a flurry of speculation about his future plans, with some pundits predicting that he could run for political office, or take a role at a private equity firm. Stephenson, who has been an outspoken advocate for corporate tax cuts and deregulation, has previously been mentioned as a potential candidate for governor of Texas.
In the wake of the news, shares in AT&T rose by more than 1%, but the stock has struggled in recent years, as the company's debt levels have increased and revenue growth has slowed. AT&T is currently undertaking a major restructuring, which is expected to include significant job cuts and divestitures.
Whether Stankey can steer AT&T through those challenges remains to be seen, but the company is known for its resilience and its ability to adapt to changing market conditions. With the pandemic accelerating the shift to remote work and online entertainment, AT&T could be well-positioned for growth in the years ahead.
