AT&T Corp's new CEO and chairman to be a surprise, insiders say
There is speculation within the telecommunications industry that AT&T Corp will name a surprise candidate to replace outgoing CEO Randall Stephenson and chairman Jeff McElfresh.   While many candidates have been floated as potential replacements, according to insiders, none of them have been publicly confirmed by the company.
Stephenson, who has been with the company for 37 years and held the CEO position since 2007, is expected to retire in July of 2020. McElfresh, meanwhile, has been with the company since 1993 and was named CEO of AT&T Communications in October 2019 before being promoted to chairman in March 2020.
The search for Stephenson's replacement has been ongoing for several months, with both internal and external candidates being considered for the position. According to sources, the company has been looking for someone with both operational and strategic experience in the telecommunications industry.
Potential candidates named by industry pundits include Brian Lesser, founder and CEO of advertising technology company Xandr; John Donovan, former CEO of AT&T Communications; and Stankey, an AT&T executive who was recently named to lead the company's entertainment division.
Despite rumors that one of these individuals might be selected as the new CEO and chairman, insiders say the company is still considering other candidates. The company's board of directors has been meeting regularly to discuss potential candidates and to ensure AT&T is on track to achieve its strategic goals.
AT&T's incoming CEO and chairman will inherit a company facing significant challenges, including slowing subscriber growth in wireless, declining revenue in its pay-TV business, and ongoing competition from streaming services.
The company has also faced criticism from activist investors, who have called for changes to the company's management and strategy in order to unlock value for shareholders.
In response to these challenges, AT&T has undertaken a number of strategic initiatives, including the acquisition of Time Warner and the launch of its HBO Max streaming service.
Whoever takes over as the new CEO and chairman of AT&T will be expected to continue the company's efforts to adapt to changing market conditions and deliver long-term growth for shareholders.
AT&T has declined to comment on the rumors surrounding the selection of its new CEO and chairman, stating only that an announcement will be made in due course.
