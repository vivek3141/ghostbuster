MCI Uses Data Warehousing to Target Key Customers and Avoid Consumer Long Distance Telephone Market Trench Warfare 
In the highly competitive long-distance telephone market, companies are constantly seeking a competitive edge. One such company, MCI, is using data warehousing to target key customers and avoid market trench warfare. 
MCI's data warehousing initiative is part of a broader effort to increase its share of the long-distance telephone market. The company has found that traditional marketing methods, such as mass advertising and direct mail campaigns, are becoming less effective as consumers become more selective in their purchasing decisions. 
To stay ahead of the competition and successfully capture new customers, MCI turned to data warehousing. The company began collecting vast amounts of data on its customers, including their needs, preferences, and usage patterns. The data is then stored in a central data warehouse, where it can be analyzed and used to inform MCI's marketing and sales strategies. 
The data warehousing initiative has already had a significant impact on MCI's business. By using data analytics to identify and target key customers, MCI has been able to achieve a 25% increase in sales in recent months. Additionally, the company has been able to reduce its marketing costs by 15%, as it no longer needs to spend as much on mass advertising campaigns that have a lower return on investment. 
One key advantage of MCI's data warehousing strategy is that it enables the company to identify and target customers based on their individual needs and preferences. For example, MCI can use data on past customer usage to identify which customers are likely to require additional phone lines or other services in the future. The company can then target these customers with personalized offers and promotions, increasing the likelihood that they will become repeat customers. 
Another advantage of MCI's data warehousing strategy is that it enables the company to avoid market trench warfare. In the past, companies in the long-distance telephone market have engaged in intense price competition in an attempt to grab market share. However, this approach can be costly for companies and can ultimately lead to a decrease in profits. 
By using data warehousing to identify and target key customers, MCI can focus its marketing efforts on those customers who are most likely to respond to its offers. This approach allows the company to avoid engaging in costly pricing wars with its competitors and instead focus on delivering value to its most profitable customers. 
While MCI's data warehousing initiative has been successful so far, the company acknowledges that there are still challenges ahead. One key challenge is data quality. MCI must ensure that the data it collects is accurate and up-to-date, as inaccurate data can lead to ineffective marketing campaigns and lost sales. 
Another challenge is privacy concerns. As MCI collects more and more data on its customers, it must ensure that it is doing so in a responsible and transparent manner. The company must also ensure that it is compliant with all applicable data protection laws and regulations. 
Despite these challenges, MCI is optimistic about the future of its data warehousing initiative. The company believes that data warehousing will continue to play a critical role in its marketing and sales strategies, enabling the company to stay ahead of the competition and capture new customers. 
In conclusion, MCI's data warehousing initiative is a powerful tool for companies looking to stay ahead of the competition in the long-distance telephone market. By collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data on its customers, MCI has been able to identify and target key customers, reduce marketing costs, and avoid market trench warfare. While there are still challenges ahead, MCI is optimistic about the future of its data warehousing strategy and believes that it will continue to play a critical role in its success.
