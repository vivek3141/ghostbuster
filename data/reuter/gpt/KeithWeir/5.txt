Premier Farnell, the UK-based electronic component distributor, has reported a slight dip in profits for the first half of the year, leading to a drop in its share prices. The company revealed that its pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of July stood at £25.5m, a dip of 1.3% compared to the same period last year. This was slightly below the expected profits of £26.2m.
The company's shares immediately slumped by more than 10% on the news, leading the CEO to issue a statement assuring investors that the underlying performance of the business remained strong. Laurence Bain, the company's CEO, said that the results reflected the ongoing transformation of the business towards higher-margin products and an increased focus on e-commerce.
"The results for the first half of the year reflect the investments we have made in our core markets and digital capabilities," he said. "We remain confident in our growth prospects and the opportunities that we see ahead of us."
Despite the dip in profits, the company's revenue for the first half of the year increased by 4.1% to £395.1m, driven by strong sales in its component distribution and engineering solutions businesses. The company's gross margin also improved by 0.6 percentage points to 41.9%, indicating a shift towards higher-margin products.
However, some analysts warned that the dip in profits could indicate a softening in demand for electronic components, a key market for Premier Farnell. Others pointed to the impact of Brexit uncertainty and global trade tensions on the company's performance.
"The results for Premier Farnell are not unexpected in the current climate," said John Moore, an analyst at investment firm Brewin Dolphin. "Brexit uncertainty and the ongoing trade disputes between the US and China are having an impact on the global economy, which is being reflected in the company's performance."
Premier Farnell, which was acquired by US firm Avnet in 2016, has been focusing on driving growth through its e-commerce platform, element14, and expanding its product portfolio in high-growth areas such as Internet of Things (IoT) and automation. The company expects to continue to benefit from a growing demand for electronic components as digital transformation and IoT projects gain momentum in various industries.
Overall, while Premier Farnell's slightly below expected profits may have spooked some investors, the company's growth strategy and focus on high-margin products bodes well for its future prospects.
