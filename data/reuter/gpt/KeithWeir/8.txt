United News & Media has acquired Blenheim, a leading trade exhibition group, creating the world's largest trade exhibition group. The acquisition will bring together two of the industry's biggest players, and they vow to continue to provide exceptional services to clients, exhibitors and visitors.
The announcement was made after United News & Media signed on the dotted line for the Â£200m deal, which gives the media conglomerate access to Blenheim's extensive portfolio of events and world-renowned trade shows. The acquisition brings in show brands such as LISW (London International Shipping Week), Natural & Organic Products Europe, and the Toy Fair.
The merger is designed to strengthen the two companies' positions in the event industry, allowing them to pool resources, expertise, and assets. It is expected to help increase the range of opportunities for customers and enhance the quality of services provided. 
The combined enterprise will have a presence in over 20 countries, serving more than 50 sectors with over 350 events and exhibitions globally, including events in Asia, Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East.
Commenting on the acquisition, United News & Media's CEO, Roger Parry, said: "The acquisition of Blenheim consolidates our position in the global events market. By combining our expertise, we can offer our clients an unparalleled range of products and services."
"We are delighted to now be part of United News & Media, and we are excited about combining our expertise and our respective portfolios of leading exhibitions," commented Nick Field, CEO of Blenheim.
The acquisition is part of United News & Media's strategy to expand into new markets and geographies, and the company expects this acquisition to further accelerate its growth trajectory. This is the latest in a series of acquisitions by United News & Media, including the purchase of RBG, a leading provider of financial and business information, and PR Newswire, which provides news distribution services.
The event industry has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the majority of scheduled events cancelled or postponed. However, both companies are optimistic about the future of the events industry and are looking forward to new opportunities that may emerge in a post-pandemic world.
The acquisition of Blenheim by United News & Media is a significant development for the trade exhibition industry, and it will be interesting to see how these two titans of the trade exhibition industry navigate the rapidly changing business landscape in the years to come.
