Stakis Plc, one of the leading hotel and leisure companies in the United Kingdom, is set to expand its global presence by acquiring the Metropole and Princess Hotel chains from Lonrho Plc. The deal worth over $1 billion will also involve Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, a Saudi Arabian billionaire and member of the Saudi royal family, who will partner with Stakis to purchase the hotel chains.
The two hotel chains boast over 5,000 rooms in key locations across the United Kingdom, including London, Brighton and Manchester. The acquisition will enable Stakis to increase its hotel portfolio by over 25%, while also consolidating its position as a major player in the UK hospitality industry. 
Stakis Plc's Chief Executive, John Kelly, expressed his excitement at the acquisition, stating that "this is a significant step for Stakis, as it enables us to expand our presence in the UK market. We see great potential in these two hotel chains and look forward to integrating them into our existing portfolio."
Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, who is also recognised as one of the world's wealthiest investors, sees the acquisition as an opportunity to diversify his investment portfolio. "I am delighted to partner with Stakis in this venture, as it presents an opportunity for us to invest in a leading hotel company, with a strong track record of success in the hospitality industry," he said.
Lonrho Plc, the current owner of the Metropole and Princess Hotel chains, confirmed that the sale was part of its strategy to focus on its core businesses in Africa. Chairman of Lonrho, David Lenigas, stated that "the sale of Metropole and Princess hotels is in line with our strategic focus on Africa and represents a logical step in our reorganisation strategy. We believe the sale proceeds will enable us to make significant progress in our growth plans for our African businesses."
The deal is expected to be completed later in the year, following regulatory approval. Stakis will fund the acquisition through a mixture of debt and equity, with the support of its majority shareholder, Lloyds Bank. The partnership with Prince al-Waleed bin Talal will provide additional funding for the acquisition.
Stakis Plc's share price received a boost following the announcement of the acquisition, rising by over 5% in early morning trading. The strong performance of the company's shares reflects the confidence of investors in the growth potential of the hotel industry.
The UK hotel industry is currently experiencing strong growth, with a record number of international tourists visiting the country in recent years. This is due to a number of factors including the favourable exchange rate for the pound, the growth of the sharing economy and the increased investment in infrastructure.
The acquisition of the Metropole and Princess Hotel chains will enable Stakis to capitalise on this growth, by expanding its presence in key locations and leveraging its expertise in the hospitality industry. The company's strong brand reputation, combined with the financial backing of Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, is expected to be a key driver of success in the UK hotel market.
In conclusion, the acquisition of the Metropole and Princess Hotel chains by Stakis Plc and Prince al-Waleed bin Talal is an exciting development in the UK hotel industry. It presents an opportunity for Stakis to expand its portfolio and consolidate its position as a major player in the hospitality industry, while also enabling the company to benefit from the strong growth potential of the hotel market. The partnership with Prince al-Waleed bin Talal provides additional financial backing and expertise, ensuring that the acquisition is well positioned for success in the coming years.
