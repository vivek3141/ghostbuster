Pearson Plc, the British multinational publishing and education company, has announced a restructuring of its media empire that could involve the sale of several key assets, including Madame Tussaud's and its stake in Lazard Brothers.
The move comes as Pearson looks to focus more on its core business of educational products and services. The company has been struggling with declining revenues and profits in recent years, particularly in its global education division.
As part of the restructuring, Pearson is exploring options for its 50% stake in Lazard Brothers, the investment bank founded by the legendary financier Andre Lazard. The stake is valued at around £324m ($425m) and is held jointly with the Lazard family.
Pearson is also considering the sale of Madame Tussaud's, the world-famous wax museum based in London. The attraction has been a mainstay of the British capital for over 200 years, drawing millions of visitors from around the world each year.
However, in recent years, Madame Tussaud's has faced increased competition from other tourist attractions in London and elsewhere. Pearson owns the rights to the Madame Tussaud's brand and operates several other wax museums around the world.
The potential sale of Madame Tussaud's and the Lazard Brothers stake is part of a wider restructuring at Pearson that aims to simplify the company's operations and focus on its core business of education.
In a statement, Pearson CEO John Fallon said: "We are committed to focusing on our core business of helping people learn and access better opportunities in life, and we believe that streamlining our media assets will help us achieve this."
Fallon added: "Over the past few years, we've taken big steps to transform our core business, including digitalizing our products and services, and shedding non-core businesses. This new phase of our transformation will further simplify and streamline our operations, and allow us to focus even more on delivering innovative and effective learning solutions for our customers."
The potential sale of Madame Tussaud's and the Lazard Brothers stake comes as Pearson is poised to make a major investment in its education division. The company plans to pump £500m ($656m) into its digital learning products and services over the next few years, as it seeks to capitalize on the growing demand for online education.
Pearson has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, with school closures and disruptions to testing and assessment leading to a sharp decline in revenues and profits over the past year.
However, the company is optimistic about the future, as more and more people turn to online learning and digital products to further their education and skills.
"We believe that the future of education is digital, and we're committed to investing in innovative technologies and solutions that will allow us to deliver better educational outcomes for our customers," said Fallon.
The potential sale of Madame Tussaud's and the Lazard Brothers stake is expected to attract interest from a range of investors and buyers. However, Pearson is likely to take a cautious approach, seeking to maximize the value of its assets while ensuring they are sold to reputable buyers who will maintain their legacy and heritage.
Overall, the restructuring of Pearson's media empire is seen as a positive step for the company, allowing it to focus more on its core business and capitalize on the growing demand for digital education products and services.
