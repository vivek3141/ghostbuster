Shares in global education company Pearson Plc have fallen after the surprise appointment of a little-known insider as CEO. Andy Bird, who previously served as the company's chairman of Global Marketing and Solutions, will replace outgoing CEO John Fallon later this year.
Investors were caught off guard by the announcement, sending Pearson's share price down by as much as 5% in early trading. The company's board defended the appointment, stating that Bird had been chosen after an extensive search process that considered both internal and external candidates.
"We believe that Andy is the right person to lead Pearson into the next phase of its growth and development," said Sidney Taurel, Pearson's Lead Independent Director. "He has a deep understanding of our business and the needs of our customers, and his extensive experience in marketing and digital transformation will be invaluable as we continue to innovate and adapt to the changing education landscape."
Bird, who joined Pearson in 2017 after a long career at Walt Disney Company, said he was "honored and excited" to take on the role. He acknowledged that he faced a number of challenges in leading the company, which has struggled in recent years due to declining demand for traditional textbooks and the rise of online learning platforms.
"I know that Pearson has faced some tough times, but I also know that this company has a proud legacy of innovation and excellence," said Bird. "My goal is to build on that legacy and ensure that we continue to provide the tools and resources that educators and students need to succeed."
Bird's appointment has been met with skepticism by some analysts, who point out that he has never held a CEO position before and has limited experience in the education industry. Others have raised concerns about his lack of familiarity with Pearson's core businesses, particularly its higher education division, which has been a key driver of growth in recent years.
"The market is clearly not convinced that Andy Bird is the right person for the job," said Neil Campling, Head of Technology, Media, and Telecoms Research at Mirabaud Securities. "Investors are looking for someone who can deliver results quickly and turn Pearson's fortunes around."
Despite the initial market reaction, some experts believe that Bird's appointment could be a positive development for Pearson. They point out that his background in marketing and digital transformation could be valuable in helping the company pivot towards new business models and revenue streams.
"Digital disruption is sweeping through the education sector, and Pearson needs to adapt quickly if it wants to remain relevant," said Andrew McGettrick, President of the Association for Computing Machinery. "If Andy can bring fresh ideas and a new perspective to the table, then he could be just what the company needs."
Bird will officially take over as CEO on October 19, 2020. He will inherit a company that has faced a series of challenges in recent years, including declining revenue and a series of profit warnings. His success or failure in turning the company around will be closely watched by investors and educators alike.
