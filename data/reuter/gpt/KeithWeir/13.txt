Alex Mahon, the CEO of Channel 4, has urged the UK government to reject any plans for privatisation of the broadcaster. Speaking to the Broadcasting Press Guild, Mahon argued that Channel 4 provides vital public service broadcasting that would be endangered by private ownership.
Mahon stated, "A privatised Channel 4 would no longer have the same commitment to serving the public good. Our programming would be driven by profit rather than public service aims, and the unique and diverse voices we aim to represent would be lost."
The government has been considering options for privatising Channel 4 since 2016, when an independent review suggested that it could raise up to Â£1 billion. However, opponents argue that privatisation would lead to a decline in the quality of programming and a loss of independent political coverage.
In her address, Mahon rejected the argument that Channel 4 could not compete in a rapidly changing media landscape without privatisation. She pointed to the success of the channel's recent programming, including the drama series It's a Sin and the documentary series Black to Front.
She also highlighted the public support for Channel 4's public service broadcasting, citing a recent survey that showed 75% of respondents wanted the broadcaster to remain publicly owned.
Mahon acknowledged that Channel 4 faces challenges in a post-pandemic world, including competition from streaming services and declining advertising revenue. However, she argued that these challenges could be addressed through greater commercial flexibility within the current public ownership structure, rather than through privatisation.
Mahon's call was supported by industry figures, including the actor and comedian Stephen Fry, who tweeted his agreement: "I couldn't agree with her more. Channel 4 provides vital public service programming that enriches our cultural and civic life. Let's keep it public."
The government has not yet announced whether it intends to proceed with privatisation plans, but the continued opposition of Channel 4's leadership and public figures will add weight to the argument for public ownership.
