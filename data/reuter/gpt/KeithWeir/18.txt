The era of terrestrial television is about to go digital in the UK. Ofcom, the media watchdog, has opened up applications for new television channels which will use digital terrestrial technology to broadcast their content. The move to digital technology promises better picture and sound quality, more reliable reception, and more programming choices for viewers.
The channels will be known as "local television" and they will be available in cities and towns across the UK. Ofcom has identified 34 areas where the new channels can be launched. The channels will cater to local audiences, with programming tailored to the interests and needs of the communities they serve.
The new local television channels will be made possible by the creation of a new multiplex, or group of frequencies, that will be used exclusively for digital terrestrial television. Ofcom has licensed the company Comux UK to operate the multiplex, which will provide the infrastructure for the new channels.
Comux UK is a non-profit company that was created specifically to operate the multiplex. It will be responsible for the technical aspects of the new television service, including the transmission of signals and the provision of back-up facilities in the event of technical failure.
Ofcom expects the new local television channels to be launched in 2013. The watchdog has set out a number of criteria for the new channels, including a requirement that they offer at least four hours of original programming per day, including local news and current affairs. Ofcom has also said that the channels must be financially viable and sustainable, with revenue sources from advertising and other sources.
Ofcom has also said that it will be looking for applications from a range of potential operators, including existing television broadcasters, local and community groups, and new entrants to the market. The watchdog has encouraged potential applicants to be innovative and creative in their proposals, and to demonstrate that they have a strong understanding of the needs of their local communities.
The move to digital terrestrial television reflects a wider trend in the UK television industry. In recent years, there has been a marked shift away from traditional analogue broadcasting towards digital technologies. This has been driven by improvements in technology and changes in viewer habits, with more people turning to digital platforms such as on-demand services and streaming sites like Netflix.
The move to digital television also reflects a desire to address the needs of local communities. With the rise of national and international media, there has been a concern that local news and information is being overlooked. By creating new local television channels, Ofcom hopes to foster greater engagement and participation in local communities, and to ensure that local voices are heard.
Overall, the move to digital terrestrial television represents a major shift in the UK television industry. With the launch of the new local television channels, viewers can expect a greater choice of programming, improved picture and sound quality, and a more reliable television service. For communities across the UK, the new channels offer an opportunity to engage with local issues and to have their voices heard.
