In a major deal that is set to reshape the trade exhibitions industry, United News & Media announced that it has acquired Blenheim for an undisclosed sum. The deal will create the world's largest trade exhibition group, with a combined portfolio of more than 150 shows and 50,000 exhibitors.
United News & Media is a leading media and communications company with a strong focus on business-to-business events, while Blenheim is a global leader in organizing trade shows and corporate events. The acquisition is expected to create significant synergies and efficiencies, and will bolster United News & Media's position in key markets around the world.
"This is an exciting day for United News & Media and for the entire trade exhibition industry," said Simon MacKinnon, CEO of United News & Media. "With this acquisition, we are bringing together two of the biggest players in the industry to create a truly global powerhouse. We are confident that our expanded portfolio and combined expertise will enable us to better serve our customers and drive sustainable growth over the long term."
The new group will be headquartered in London, with additional offices in the US, Europe, and Asia. It will be led by a highly experienced management team drawn from both United News & Media and Blenheim, with a focus on delivering innovative, market-leading exhibitions that bring together buyers and sellers from around the world.
"We are excited to join forces with United News & Media and to be part of such a dynamic and forward-thinking organization," said James Brooks-Ward, CEO of Blenheim. "We share a common vision of creating world-class events that deliver real value to our customers and to the industries we serve. With this acquisition, we will be better able to achieve that vision and to drive growth across all of our markets."
The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the coming months. Once complete, the new group will be well positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for trade exhibitions and events around the world, particularly in emerging markets such as China, India, and Brazil.
Industry experts have welcomed the deal, noting that it will create a more competitive and innovative market for trade exhibitions. "This is a significant move that will create a world-class player in the industry," said Sarah Lowther, a trade show consultant. "The new group will have the scale, breadth, and expertise to offer customers a truly global platform for showcasing their products and services. This is great news for exhibitors, visitors, and the industry as a whole."
