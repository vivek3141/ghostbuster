United News & Media, a leading international media and communication company, has announced the acquisition of Blenheim, a premier trade exhibition company, creating the world's largest trade exhibition group. The deal, worth £600 million, will bring together two of the biggest players in the industry, with a combined portfolio of over 100 events and exhibitions across the globe.
The newly formed company, which will be called United-Blenheim, is set to dominate the industry, with a projected revenue of over £800 million and a market share of approximately 25%. United News & Media CEO, Lord Hollick, said: "This is a transformational deal for our company. It creates a unique global platform for us to build upon and strengthen our business in the fast-growing events and exhibitions sector."
Blenheim has a strong presence in the UK and Europe, with a number of flagship events such as the Chelsea Flower Show and the Grand Designs Live exhibition. The company also has a growing presence in Asia, with events in China, Hong Kong and Singapore. United News & Media, on the other hand, has a significant presence in the US, with events such as the New York International Auto Show and the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show.
The acquisition of Blenheim will significantly boost United News & Media's presence in Europe and Asia while adding some of the world's most prestigious events to its portfolio. Blenheim CEO, John Morgan, said: "Our merger with United News & Media creates a formidable force in the events industry. We share a common goal of delivering exceptional experiences for our customers and this deal provides us with the resources and expertise to take our business to the next level."
The combined company will be headquartered in London, with regional offices in Asia and the US. It will have a workforce of over 2,500 employees worldwide. The deal is expected to be completed in the next few months, subject to regulatory approval.
Industry analysts have lauded the move, describing it as a game-changer for the trade exhibition sector. Speaking to the Financial Times, Neil Saunders, managing director of retail consultancy GlobalData, said: "This acquisition gives United News & Media a significant competitive advantage. They now have a wider range of events in their portfolio and a stronger presence in key markets such as Europe and Asia."
The trade exhibition sector is considered to be one of the fastest-growing industries, with a projected growth rate of 5% annually over the next five years. The rise of e-commerce and digital marketing has prompted many companies to invest in trade shows and exhibitions as a way to engage with customers and build brand awareness.
The acquisition of Blenheim by United News & Media is a clear indication that the industry is evolving, with consolidation and mergers becoming more common as companies seek to expand their reach in a rapidly changing market. The newly formed United-Blenheim will undoubtedly be a force to be reckoned with, setting the standard for trade exhibitions across the world.
