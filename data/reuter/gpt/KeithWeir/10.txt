LONDON â€“ Pearson Plc, the British multinational publishing and education company, announced the appointment of Elizabeth Morrison as its new CEO yesterday. However, the news has not been well received by the market, with shares of the company tumbling by 5.1% in early trading today.
Morrison, an American citizen, is set to take over the reins from John Fallon, who is stepping down after seven years at the helm. Fallon had come under criticism in recent years for his handling of Pearson's shift from traditional publishing to digital education services, which has led to major restructuring and job losses.
However, many in the market were hoping for a British successor to Fallon, and the appointment of an American woman has come as a surprise. Some have raised concerns about Morrison's lack of experience in the UK education sector.
In a statement, Pearson defended the decision, saying that Morrison's "deep understanding of the education market and proven track record of driving transformation and growth make her the ideal candidate to lead Pearson."
Morrison, 52, holds an MBA from Harvard Business School and has held executive roles in a number of major US companies, including CitiGroup and PepsiCo. She has also worked in the education sector, most recently as the CEO of New York-based education technology company, Tutor.com.
Speaking to reporters, Morrison said that she was excited to lead Pearson and that she was committed to ensuring that the company continued to "deliver innovative solutions that help teachers and learners everywhere."
Despite her reassurances, some analysts remain skeptical about the appointment. "The market was looking for a British candidate with experience in the UK education sector and I think there's some disappointment that Pearson has gone for someone from outside the country," said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com.
Others have also pointed out that Morrison faces a number of challenges in turning around Pearson's fortunes. The company has struggled in recent years as the education sector has shifted towards digital learning, with revenues falling by 9% in 2019. Pearson has also been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, with school closures and cancellations of exams resulting in a further decline in revenues.
Morrison will need to address these issues head-on if she is to win over investors and revive the company's fortunes. She has already hinted at a more digital-focused strategy, saying that Pearson would be "innovating to meet learners' needs wherever they are in the world, by providing access to high-quality education resources that help them achieve their goals."
For now, however, the market appears to be cautious about Morrison's appointment. Pearson's shares have been falling steadily since the announcement yesterday, and investors will be closely watching the company's next move under its new CEO.
In conclusion, the appointment of an American woman as CEO of Pearson Plc. hasn't received a positive market reaction. Investors were hoping for a British successor to John Fallon, and Morrison's lack of experience in the UK education sector doesn't seem to have been taken well. Many are sceptical about her ability to turn around Pearson's fortunes, but time will tell whether she can live up to expectations or not.
