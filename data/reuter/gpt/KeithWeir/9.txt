Marjorie Scardino, the first female CEO of the Financial Times and former CEO of Pearson, has been appointed as the new CEO of Pearson. In an interview with the Financial Times, Scardino said that she plans to implement radical changes at the education company to address the growing inequality in education and improve the quality of education globally.
Scardino, who previously ran Pearson for 16 years, is known for her strong focus on education and literacy. During her tenure at Pearson, she helped to reshape the company into a digital learning and assessment platform. Scardino says that she plans to continue this focus on digital learning, but also wants to address issues around inequality and access to education.
"I think education is the most important thing that we can do in the world, and I'm passionate about it," said Scardino. "I think that education is the key to social inclusion, economic prosperity, and a good quality of life."
Scardino's plans for Pearson will include a focus on using technology to improve access to education for more people around the world. She sees technology as a powerful tool for democratising education and providing more opportunities for learners to access the resources and support they need to succeed.
"I think technology is absolutely essential to education, particularly to making education available to everyone around the world," said Scardino. "It can provide personalised learning that meets the needs of each individual student, regardless of where they are, what language they speak, or what resources they have access to."
However, Scardino also acknowledges that technology alone is not enough. That's why she plans to work on building partnerships and collaborations with governments, NGOs, and other stakeholders to mobilise resources and support to address the root causes of educational inequality.
"That's why we need to build collaborations and partnerships with everyone who cares about education, from policymakers to NGOs, to ensure that we have the resources and the support we need to make a real difference," said Scardino.
To achieve her vision for Pearson, Scardino says that the company will need to be more focused and strategic in its investments and efforts. This means divesting from non-core businesses and investing in areas where Pearson has a strong competitive advantage and can make the most impact.
"I think we need to focus on our core strengths, and really prioritise our investments and our efforts," said Scardino. "That means divesting from non-core businesses and investing in areas where we have a strong competitive advantage, where we can make the most impact, and where we can really change lives through education."
Scardino's appointment has been welcomed by education experts and advocates, who see her as a strong leader who can bring a fresh perspective and a renewed focus on education to Pearson.
"I think Marjorie Scardino is the right person to lead Pearson at this critical moment in time," said Sir Ken Robinson, internationally recognised authority on creativity and innovation in education. "Her passion for education and her track record of success in the industry make her ideally suited to drive change and create a more inclusive and equitable education system for all."
In conclusion, Scardino's appointment as the new CEO of Pearson marks a new era for the education company. Her vision and leadership will be critical in addressing the challenges facing education today and ensuring that more people around the world have access to quality education.
