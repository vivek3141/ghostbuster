British Biotech’s Marimastat anti-cancer treatment will be reviewed at the upcoming European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) conference in Vienna. The topical gel-based treatment, originally developed to treat breast cancer, has shown promising results in clinical trials.
Marimastat is a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, which means it targets enzymes that play a role in the growth and spread of cancer cells. In preclinical studies, it was shown to inhibit the growth of tumors and reduce the chances of metastasis.
The gel-based formulation allows the drug to be applied topically to the breast area, which could reduce the side effects associated with traditional chemotherapy treatments. The treatment is applied using a patch, applied to the breast area daily for two weeks prior to surgery.
The phase II clinical trial conducted on 209 women with breast cancer showed a significant improvement in disease-free survival and overall survival rates. After three years, the patients who received Marimastat had a 35% reduction in the risk of disease recurrence compared to the placebo group.
The treatment also showed promise in delaying the progression of triple-negative breast cancer, a particularly aggressive form of the disease with limited treatment options. The results of the clinical trial were published in the Lancet Oncology journal earlier this year.
Professor Judith Bliss of the Institute of Cancer Research, one of the lead investigators of the clinical trial, commented: "The results of this clinical trial demonstrate the potential of Marimastat to improve survival rates for women with breast cancer. It’s exciting to see a novel treatment like Marimastat showing such promising results."
The ESMO conference, which is being held from 25th September to 29th September, brings together leading oncologists and medical professionals to discuss the latest developments in cancer treatments and research.
The review of Marimastat is expected to generate significant interest among the healthcare community, with the potential to open up a new avenue of treatment for breast cancer patients.
"Marimastat has the potential to make a real difference to the lives of millions of women around the world who are living with breast cancer," said Dr. Tom Bradshaw, CEO of British Biotech. "We’re thrilled to have the opportunity to present our findings at the ESMO conference and look forward to discussing the potential of Marimastat with the oncology community."
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, with approximately 2.1 million new cases diagnosed each year. While traditional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy have improved survival rates, they are often associated with significant side effects.
The potential for a topical gel-based treatment like Marimastat to offer a more targeted and less invasive treatment option is a significant development in the fight against breast cancer.
The review of Marimastat at the ESMO conference will provide an opportunity for healthcare professionals to consider the potential benefits of the treatment and to discuss the next steps in its development. With the prospect of improving survival rates for breast cancer patients, the potential of Marimastat is a beacon of hope for millions of women around the world.
