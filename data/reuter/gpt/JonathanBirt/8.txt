Consumer goods company Reckitt & Colman has announced plans to give £152 million back to its shareholders through an innovative scheme. The scheme, called a "buyback", allows shareholders to sell their shares back to the company at a premium, giving them a cash windfall.
The announcement comes as Reckitt & Colman, the parent company of well-known brands such as Durex, Nurofen, and Vanish, reported strong financial results for the first half of 2021. The company's revenue was up 10.6% on the same period last year, thanks to increased demand for its products during the pandemic.
The buyback scheme is an alternative to paying dividends, which Reckitt & Colman has traditionally done. Dividends are payments made to shareholders out of a company's profits, but they are subject to taxation. Buybacks, on the other hand, are treated as a return of capital and are therefore not subject to tax, making them a more tax-efficient way of returning money to shareholders.
Under the scheme, which will run from 3rd September to 28th October, Reckitt & Colman will offer to buy back up to £152 million worth of shares. Shareholders will be able to sell their shares back to the company at a premium of up to 5% of the share price.
In a statement, Reckitt & Colman CEO Laxman Narasimhan said: "We are pleased to offer this innovative scheme to our shareholders as an alternative to dividends. We believe this demonstrates our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders in a tax-efficient way."
The buyback scheme is part of a larger trend among companies to find new ways of returning money to shareholders. With interest rates at historic lows and the pandemic causing uncertainty in the markets, many investors are looking for reliable ways to generate income.
According to data from the Office for National Statistics, UK companies spent a record £100 billion on buybacks in 2020, up from £56 billion in 2019. This trend is expected to continue as companies look for ways to deliver value to their shareholders.
However, buyback schemes are not without controversy. Critics argue that they can artificially inflate share prices and benefit shareholders who are looking to sell their shares, rather than those who are holding onto them. Some also argue that buybacks can be a sign that a company is struggling to find productive ways to invest its profits.
Despite these concerns, however, the Reckitt & Colman buyback scheme has been well-received by investors. Since the announcement, the company's share price has risen by over 2%, indicating that shareholders are optimistic about the scheme's potential to generate value.
Overall, the Reckitt & Colman buyback scheme is an interesting example of how companies are finding new ways to deliver value to their shareholders in a challenging economic environment. As the trend towards buybacks and other innovative schemes continues, it will be interesting to see how investors respond – and whether these schemes will become a permanent feature of the corporate landscape.
