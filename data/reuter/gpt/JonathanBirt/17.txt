Dominion Resources Inc, a US-based energy company, has expressed interest in bidding for East Midlands Electricity Plc, one of the largest electricity distribution networks in the UK. However, the company has stated that it will only proceed with the bid if the share price remains in a reasonable range.
East Midlands Electricity Plc serves over 4.9 million customers across the East Midlands region of England and has a regulated asset value of Â£3.4 billion. The company was recently put up for sale by parent company Western Power Distribution.
Dominion Resources Inc has a large presence in the North American energy market and has been looking to expand its business into Europe. In a statement released yesterday, the company said that it sees potential in the UK energy market and is interested in acquiring East Midlands Electricity Plc.
However, the company also stated that it will only make a bid if the share price remains reasonable. "We are attracted to the strategic fit of East Midlands Electricity Plc with our existing business and see potential for growth in the UK market," said a spokesperson for Dominion Resources Inc. "However, we will only proceed with the bid if the share price remains in a range that makes financial sense for our company."
The statement from Dominion Resources Inc comes amid speculation that the share price of East Midlands Electricity Plc could skyrocket if several other potential bidders enter the race. The company is seen as a valuable asset with a large customer base and a strong track record of profitability.
Several other companies, including National Grid and French utility company EDF, have also expressed interest in acquiring the electricity network. Analysts predict that bidding could become competitive, pushing the share price up considerably.
Dominion Resources Inc has stated that it is prepared to walk away from the bid if the share price becomes too high. "We are interested in this acquisition, but we will not overpay for the asset," said the spokesperson. "We will carefully evaluate the market and the potential value of the company before making any offer."
The bidding process for East Midlands Electricity Plc is expected to begin in the coming weeks. It remains to be seen whether Dominion Resources Inc will follow through with its interest and make a bid for the company, or whether it will be outbid by one of its competitors.
