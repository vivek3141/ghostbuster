London-based pharmaceutical company SkyePharma has predicted that 1998 will be a “magic year” of growth for its investors and shareholders, thanks to a number of upcoming product launches and partnerships.
SkyePharma has a strong track record of developing and commercializing innovative drug delivery technologies, including inhalation and oral formulations. Its current product portfolio includes treatments for respiratory diseases, pain management, and migraine relief.
The company has several major product launches scheduled for 1998, including a new inhaler for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which affects millions of people worldwide. SkyePharma’s new inhaler uses a unique dry powder formulation that is easier to use and more convenient for patients than traditional inhalers.
In addition, SkyePharma is entering into several partnerships and licensing agreements that will expand its product offerings and market reach. The company recently signed a deal with US-based drugmaker Elan Pharmaceuticals to develop novel drug delivery technologies for the treatment of neurological disorders. It also announced a licensing agreement with Italy’s Chiesi Farmaceutici for the distribution and marketing of a range of respiratory products in Europe.
“We’re very optimistic about our prospects for 1998 and beyond,” said SkyePharma CEO Jeremy Scudamore. “We have a number of exciting new products in development, as well as strong partnerships in place that will help us achieve our growth targets.”
Investors seem bullish on SkyePharma’s prospects as well – the company’s stock price has risen steadily over the past year, and analysts are predicting continued growth in 1998.
“SkyePharma has a strong pipeline of innovative products and a proven track record of commercial success,” said pharmaceuticals analyst Caroline Davis. “There’s a lot of excitement and anticipation among investors about what they will achieve in the coming year.”
For its part, SkyePharma is focused on continuing to develop technologies that improve the delivery and efficacy of medications for a wide range of therapeutic areas.
“We’re committed to staying on the cutting edge of drug delivery,” said Scudamore. “Our goal is to provide patients with better, more effective treatments that improve their quality of life.”
With a promising pipeline of products and strong partnerships in place, SkyePharma seems well-positioned to deliver on its promise of a “magic year” of growth for investors in 1998.
