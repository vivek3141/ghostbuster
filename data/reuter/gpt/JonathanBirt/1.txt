Chiroscience Group plc, a UK-based biopharmaceutical company, has announced promising results from pre-clinical testing of two new anti-cancer compounds. The compounds, known as CS01 and CS02, have shown encouraging levels of efficacy in laboratory trials against a range of cancer types. The company now plans to move both compounds into human trials in the near future. CS01 is an inhibitor of a key cancer pathway, while CS02 works by promoting cancer cell death. The company hopes that both compounds could ultimately provide new treatment options for patients with cancer.
