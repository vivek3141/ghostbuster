London – BP, the multinational oil and gas company, announced on Tuesday the release of their financial report for the third quarter of the year, highlighting their best-ever earnings for Q3, despite facing pressure on profit margins.
For the three months prior to 30 September, BP reported an underlying replacement cost profit of $3.8bn, a significant increase from last year's third quarter earnings of $2.3bn and exceeding market expectations. This was achieved despite a 17% decrease in oil prices compared to the same quarter in 2018, resulting in pressure on profit margins.
"We generated strong cash flow and delivered solid earnings in a challenging environment. This reflects the benefits of our focus on high value growth and delivery of the right kind of products, as well as our drive to continuously improve safety and efficiency,” said Bob Dudley, BP's CEO.
The company attributed the positive financial results to a number of factors. BP's upstream production and sales rose by 3% from the preceding quarter, boosted by higher production levels in Iraq and in the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, the company's downstream business, which includes the refining and marketing of petroleum products, performed well, with earnings of $2.6bn, up from $1.8bn in the previous quarter due to strong trading results.
BP's progress in developing its low-carbon business units was also highlighted. The company generated $500m in earnings from their alternative energy operations over the quarter, an increase of 40% compared to the same period last year. This was attributed to higher earnings from solar power and wind farms. Furthermore, the company is on track to meet its target of investing $500m per year in low carbon initiatives.
Despite the positive financial results, BP's state-of-the-art oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, Mad Dog 2, was temporarily shut down following Hurricane Barry in July. The company said that it was on track to extract oil from the facility by the end of 2021 but added that the estimated costs were likely to exceed $10bn.
In light of this, BP has committed to remain disciplined in terms of cost control and capital investment. The company is looking to sell $10bn worth of assets between 2019 and 2020, in an effort to improve its financial standing and reduce its debt.
BP's latest financial report followed strong earnings announcements by other major oil and gas companies including Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil. Despite uncertainties in the global economy and geopolitical pressures, these companies have managed to perform well and exceed market expectations.
"The industry has faced a more challenging external environment over the past few quarters, but BP's strong financial results demonstrate that the company is able to navigate and thrive in these circumstances," said Angus Rodger, a research director at Wood Mackenzie.
BP's shares were up by 2.5% following the announcement of the Q3 financial results. 
Overall, BP's focus on high-value growth, cost discipline and low carbon initiatives has helped deliver strong financial results, even in a challenging external environment. The company's commitment to continuing this steady growth trajectory is encouraging news for shareholders and investors alike.
