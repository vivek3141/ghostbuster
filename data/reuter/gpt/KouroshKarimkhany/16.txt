Apple Inc. announced a significant price cut on their Power Macintosh computers, reducing their prices by up to 30%. The move is seen as a response to competitors that are offering cheaper computers in the market. The price cut is expected to make the Power Macintosh much more affordable to potential buyers.
Apple is one of the major players in the personal computer market, and their Power Macintosh computer is one of their most popular devices. However, the company has recently been facing stiff competition from rivals such as HP and Dell, which offer a range of low-cost personal computers with comparable or better specifications.
The Power Macintosh is a high-end desktop computer designed for professionals, and it is known for its powerful performance and sleek design. However, its premium pricing has made it unaffordable for many potential customers, resulting in a drop in sales for Apple. The price reduction is expected to make the Power Macintosh more appealing to a broader range of customers and help Apple regain market share.
The price cut will impact all four models of the Power Macintosh computers, starting from the entry-level model to the high-end model. The base model, which was previously sold for $1,299, will now be sold for $899, while the top-of-the-range model, which was priced at $3,999, will now be available for $2,999.
In a statement, Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, explained the reason for the price cut. He said, "We're thrilled to offer our customers the world's best desktop computers at even more affordable prices. This will make our Macintosh computers accessible to an even broader audience."
The move by Apple has been welcomed by industry experts who see it as a smart move to stay competitive in the market. Analysts predict that the price cut will translate into increased sales for the company, which will help it maintain its position as one of the leading players in the personal computer industry.
According to IDC, Apple has a 7.5% share of the global computer market, compared to HP's 22.6% and Dell's 15.9% share. The price cut is expected to help Apple gain market share and close the gap with its rivals.
In conclusion, Apple's decision to slash the prices of its Power Macintosh computers is a strategic move that is expected to help the company remain competitive in the market. With the improved affordability, more people will be able to buy Macintosh computers, helping Apple increase its market share. It remains to be seen how the price cut will affect Apple's overall sales and profitability, but the move is undoubtedly a positive step for the company.
