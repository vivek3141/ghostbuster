Yahoo! Inc. reported better-than-expected Q3 results on Tuesday, thanks to a surge in internet ad revenue. The company had an earnings-per-share of $0.52, surpassing analysts’ expectations of $0.30 per share, and revenue of $1.31 billion, compared to expected revenue of $1.26 billion.
The surge in revenue was largely due to an increase in internet ad revenue, which saw a growth of 5% year-over-year, reaching $1.87 billion. The company’s mobile revenue also showed growth, accounting for 20% of the company’s total revenue, or $246 million.
Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer expressed her satisfaction with the company’s performance, saying, “I’m pleased with Yahoo’s Q3 results. This quarter, we achieved our highest quarterly revenue growth in almost nine years.”
Mayer attributed the growth to several factors, including the company’s focus on mobile, video, native and programmatic advertising, and the stabilization of search revenue. She also noted that Yahoo! was able to increase its user engagement, with an increase in the number of daily active users on mobile up 17% year-over-year.
Yahoo!’s Q3 results are seen as a positive sign for the company, which has faced challenges in the past few years. The company has struggled to compete with rivals such as Google and Facebook, and its performance has been affected by a decline in advertising revenue.
However, Yahoo!’s performance in Q3 suggests that the company is on the right track. The surge in ad revenue, particularly on mobile, suggests that the company is successfully adapting to changes in the advertising industry.
Analysts also see promise in Yahoo!’s Q3 results. According to Barbara Coffey, an analyst at Baseline Intelligence, “The results reflect the company’s focus on mobile engagement and content. Yahoo! appears to be growing in the areas it needs to grow to remain relevant.”
Yahoo!’s Q3 success is expected to be followed up with a number of new initiatives in the coming months. The company recently announced plans to launch a mobile messaging app, Yahoo Livetext, which allows users to send video and text messages. The company is also reportedly investing in a number of new content initiatives, including a live streaming partnership with the NFL.
Overall, Yahoo!’s Q3 results suggest that the company is on a positive trajectory. With growth in mobile and internet ad revenue, along with the company’s upcoming initiatives, Yahoo! may well be poised for a comeback in the coming months and years.
