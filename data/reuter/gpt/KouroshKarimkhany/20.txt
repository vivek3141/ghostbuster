American Express Co. is expected to acquire Intuit Inc., a financial management software company struggling with its financial performance and revenue growth. The acquisition is seen as a potential boost for the credit card giant in the business of financial management tools and applications.
As per multiple sources, the discussions between the two companies have been in progress for some time and a deal is expected to be announced soon. However, the exact financial terms and conditions of the deal are yet to be disclosed.
Intuit, which is known for its popular accounting software QuickBooks and the tax preparation product TurboTax, has been going through a patch of slow revenue growth in recent times. The company's earnings per share have missed the market estimates twice in the past year, and its growth rate has been lower compared to many of its peers in the technology industry.
The potential acquisition of Intuit is expected to fit in well with American Express' existing suite of business financial management tools and applications. Amex has been expanding into the digital financial management space in recent years, and is launching a new suite of digital payment and expense management tools under the brand name American Express One.
The acquisition of Intuit will help American Express add more features and capabilities to its suite of digital financial products, and it will place Amex in a stronger position to compete with its peers in the financial industry, such as PayPal, Square and others.
The proposed acquisition is also expected to bring many benefits to Intuit, which has been trying to revive its growth momentum and expand its customer base. Intuit's software tools and applications are primarily aimed at small and medium-sized businesses, and American Express' presence in this market segment could help Intuit gain more customers and expand its reach.
Moreover, American Express' vast customer base and marketing expertise could help Intuit promote its products and services to a broader audience. This could lead to higher revenues and long-term growth for Intuit.
In conclusion, the potential acquisition of Intuit by American Express is a significant development for both companies, which could benefit from each other's strengths in the financial management space. The financial terms and conditions of the deal are yet to be announced, but it is expected to be a positive development for both companies in the long run.
