The semiconductor industry's key indicator of computer chip demand reached its highest level of the year in September. The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) reported that global semiconductor sales grew by 4.5% year-over-year to $36.2 billion in September, which is the highest gain in monthly sales since March 2018.
The SIA also reported that sales increased by 0.6% sequentially, which is a modest growth rate compared to the previous seven months. However, what is significant about this increase is that it coincides with a period when the U.S. and China are locked in a trade war, which has imposed tariffs on semiconductor products and disrupted global supply chains.
The SIA's data supports other reports that suggest that the semiconductor industry is doing better than expected under the current economic climate. For instance, research firm Gartner had previously predicted that semiconductor sales would decline by 9.6% in 2019, but it now forecasts that sales will drop by 11.9%.
Despite the SIA's positive data, experts warn that the semiconductor industry is still facing several headwinds that could dampen its growth prospects. For instance, the industry is grappling with a slowdown in smartphone sales, which is one of its main drivers. Additionally, the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China is increasing the cost of producing computer chips and affecting the supply chain.
The SIA's data also suggests that the growth in semiconductor sales is being driven by memory chip products, which are used in computing devices and consumer electronics. "Memory chips have remained robust, and the data center market is strong," said Ajit Manocha, president and CEO of the SIA.
However, the SIA's report also noted that sales of microprocessors, which are used in automotive and industrial applications, declined by 7.6% year-over-year. This indicates that the trade war is affecting demand for chips across a variety of industries, which could have knock-on effects for the wider economy.
Despite the challenges that the industry faces, the SIA remains optimistic about its growth prospects. "Semiconductor sales have continued to grow this year, despite a challenging and uncertain global trade environment," said Manocha. "We remain cautiously optimistic that the industry will build on its recent gains."
Ultimately, the semiconductor industry's performance will depend on how well it can navigate the uncertain economic and political landscape in the coming months. However, the industry's key indicator of computer chip demand reaching its highest level of the year in September is a promising sign that it is weathering the storm relatively well.
