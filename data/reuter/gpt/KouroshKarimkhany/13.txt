The new servers will incorporate personal computer technology, making them faster, more efficient, and more cost-effective than traditional server systems.

They will feature the latest Intel processors, solid-state drives, and advanced memory technologies to deliver outstanding performance and reliability.
In addition to their technical capabilities, the Tandem PC Servers will also be highly customizable. Businesses will be able to choose from a range of operating systems, software applications, and storage options to create a server solution that meets their specific needs.
