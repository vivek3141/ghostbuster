Cupertino, California - Apple Inc. surprised the market on Tuesday by posting better-than-expected fourth-quarter profits, but analysts remain concerned about the company's future growth prospects.
The company reported earnings per share of $0.76 on revenue of $64.7 billion, beating estimates of $0.70 on revenue of $63.7 billion. iPhone sales, which accounted for almost half of Apple's revenue, were down 21% year-over-year, but were still better than many had anticipated.
Despite the positive results, some analysts remain concerned about Apple's long-term growth prospects. The company has relied heavily on iPhone sales for the majority of its revenue, and with that business showing signs of slowing down, investors have become increasingly worried about where the company will find new growth opportunities.
"Apple's Q4 results were better than expected, but there are still some concerns about the company's future," said Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson. "The company is facing a number of headwinds, including a slowing smartphone market, increasing competition, and regulatory pressure."
While Apple has been expanding into new areas like wearables, services, and home automation, these businesses are still relatively small compared to its iPhone business. Wearables and accessories, which includes products like the Apple Watch and AirPods, represented just 7.9% of the company's revenue in the fourth quarter, up from 6.5% a year ago. Services like Apple Music and iCloud made up 22.5% of revenue, up from 18.3% last year.
Despite their relatively small contribution to revenue, analysts say these areas could be key to Apple's future growth. The company has been pushing hard on services, launching new products like Apple TV+, Arcade, and News+. The company is also expanding into new markets like India, where it hopes to gain market share by offering lower-cost versions of its products.
"Apple's services business is growing at a healthy rate and is becoming an increasingly important part of the company's overall revenue mix," said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. "The company has an opportunity to monetize its massive user base through new services and products."
Apple is also facing pressure from regulators and lawmakers, who have been increasingly critical of the company's business practices. The European Union recently launched two antitrust investigations into the company's App Store and Apple Pay, while lawmakers in the U.S. have accused the company of anti-competitive behavior.
"While Apple's regulatory concerns may not have a significant impact on the company's near-term financial results, they could limit the company's ability to grow in the future," said Forte.
Despite these concerns, many analysts remain bullish on Apple's long-term prospects. The company has a massive cash hoard of $191.8 billion, which could be used for acquisitions or to invest in new businesses.
"While there are certainly challenges facing Apple, the company still has a lot of things going for it," said Ives. "Apple has a loyal customer base, a strong brand, and a history of innovation. The company has been successful in the past by entering new markets and developing new products, and there is reason to believe it can continue to do so in the future."
Apple CEO Tim Cook expressed optimism about the company's future in a statement accompanying the earnings release.
"We are proud to report a strong finish to an unprecedented year," he said. "We're optimistic about what the holiday quarter has in store, and we're looking forward to sharing our vision for the future with our customers and shareholders in the coming months."
