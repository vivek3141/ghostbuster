According to a new study, access to the internet has a positive impact on the learning outcomes of elementary school students. Researchers found that students with internet access at home scored higher on standardized tests and had higher overall GPAs than their counterparts who lacked internet access. The study suggests that internet access gives students greater access to information, educational resources, and support. With remote learning becoming normalized due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the findings of the study are particularly relevant, highlighting the need for equitable access to internet resources for all students.
