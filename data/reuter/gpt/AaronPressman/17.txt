Washington, D.C. - The Clinton administration has announced that it will revise the current guidelines for exporting computer encoding technology, a move that has been met with mixed reactions across the tech industry and political spectrum.
This decision comes after years of controversy surrounding the export of encryption technology, which is used to protect sensitive information and communications from unauthorized access. Critics argue that the export of this technology could aid foreign adversaries in developing their own encryption capabilities, making it harder for U.S. intelligence agencies to gather critical information.
Under the current regulations, companies that want to export encryption technology must submit a license application to the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) for approval. The BIS then reviews the application on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as the end-user of the technology and the level of encryption strength.
However, many in the tech industry have criticized these regulations, arguing that they place an unnecessary burden on American businesses and stifle innovation. They claim that the restrictions limit their ability to compete in the global market, as many foreign competitors offer encryption technology without the same level of scrutiny.
In response to these concerns, the Clinton administration has announced that it will revise the current guidelines, with the aim of striking a balance between national security concerns and promoting American innovation. Under the new rules, companies will be allowed to self-declare the strength of their encryption technology, rather than having to submit it for government review. 
“American innovation is at the forefront of the global tech industry, and we want to ensure that our policies are not only protecting national security interests but also promoting innovation,” Commerce Secretary Tony Blinken said in a statement. “We believe this new approach will allow us to achieve that balance.”
The new rules will also increase the threshold for when a company must obtain a license to export encryption technology. Under the current regulations, a license is required for exports of technology with a key length of 56 bits or greater. The new rules will raise that threshold to 80 bits, which should lessen the regulatory burden on companies.
The revised guidelines have been met with mixed reactions from both industry groups and political leaders. Some have praised the move as a step in the right direction, saying that it will help American businesses compete on the global stage. Others, however, have expressed concerns that the new rules could weaken national security, making it easier for foreign adversaries to obtain sensitive information.
“This decision is a clear signal that the Clinton administration is more concerned about the commercial interests of the tech industry than the safety and security of our nation,” said Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “We need to be very careful when it comes to encryption technology, and this move could put our national security at risk.”
Overall, the revised guidelines are likely to be a contentious issue for some time, with advocates on both sides of the debate continuing to make their case. At the very least, these revisions represent an attempt by the Clinton administration to address a complex and controversial issue that has confounded policymakers for decades.
