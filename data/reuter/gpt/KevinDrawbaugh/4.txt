The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced that it has approved a record number of drugs and medical devices. This news has come as a relief to the industry, which has been mired in controversy over the past few years due to the slow pace of FDA approvals.
The FDA approved a total of 59 new drugs in 2020, which is the highest number in the last decade. Additionally, it approved 132 medical devices, which is also a record number. These approvals cover a wide range of medical conditions, including cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and heart disease.
This news is being welcomed by industry insiders who have long criticized the FDA for the slow pace of approvals. They argue that the lengthy approval process has led to delays in getting new drugs and medical devices to patients who need them.
“Patients have been waiting too long for access to new drugs and medical devices,” said Daniel Carpenter, a professor of government at Harvard University. “This news is a welcome relief to a healthcare industry that has been struggling to keep up with demand.”
One of the reasons for the increase in approvals is the FDA’s “breakthrough therapy” program, which was launched in 2012. This program allows the FDA to expedite the approval process for drugs and medical devices that show significant promise in treating serious or life-threatening conditions.
In 2020, the FDA approved 11 drugs under this program, including one for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, which is a major breakthrough in the field.
“Breakthrough therapy is a game-changer for the industry,” said Mark McClellan, a former FDA commissioner and current director of the Duke Margolis Center for Health Policy. “It has allowed us to get treatments to patients more quickly and efficiently.”
The FDA also introduced a number of reforms in 2020 that have further streamlined the approval process. These reforms include a new process for reviewing and approving medical devices and a new initiative to reduce regulatory burdens on small businesses and startups.
All of these changes have been welcomed by the industry, which is hopeful that the FDA will continue to work towards improving the approval process for drugs and medical devices.
“This is a great step forward, but we still have a long way to go,” said Michael Carome, director of Public Citizen’s Health Research Group. “We need to continue to push for reforms that will ensure that patients get access to the treatments they need when they need them.”
In conclusion, the record number of drug and medical device approvals by the FDA in 2020 is being hailed as a significant achievement by the industry. It is hoped that the FDA will continue to make progress and improve the approval process for the benefit of patients everywhere.
