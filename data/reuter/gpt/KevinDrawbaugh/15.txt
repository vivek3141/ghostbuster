Eli Lilly & Co, one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the world, recently announced that it expects its marketing and administration costs to remain flat in the fourth quarter. This news comes as a relief to the company’s investors who were anticipating a rise in expenses due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
According to the company, the cost-saving measures it implemented earlier this year have been successful in keeping expenses under control. Eli Lilly has been reducing its sales and marketing budgets, scaling back travel, and implementing remote working arrangements across the board. The company has also put off non-essential projects and minimized hiring during the pandemic.
Eli Lilly spokesperson Scott MacGregor stated that the company’s move to work remotely has saved significant costs. He said, “We’ve been more efficient in terms of travel, and we’ve been more efficient in terms of our marketing efforts. We’ve also consolidated many of our operations which has been helpful.”
The company has also seen impressive results from its diabetes drug Trulicity and its cancer drug Verzenio. Both of these products have brought in strong sales despite the pandemic. Eli Lilly has also been developing a few potential COVID-19 treatments, which are currently in the late stages of clinical trials.
This announcement comes as the company has been facing mounting pressure from investors to reduce its overall expenses. Earlier this year, Eli Lilly pledged to cut $500 million in annual expenses by the end of 2021. With this news, it looks like the company is on track to meet its goal.
Overall, this announcement is a positive sign for Eli Lilly as it continues to navigate these uncertain times. The company’s ability to keep costs under control despite the challenges posed by the pandemic is a testament to its resilience and adaptability. It also bodes well for its future growth, as investors are likely to view the ability to keep expenses under control as a positive signal.
