US-based conglomerate 3M has reported a 16% jump in earnings for the first quarter of 2021 after spinning off its slow-growing data storage and imaging businesses. The company's stock rose by more than 2% in pre-market trading on Thursday after it beat Wall Street expectations on earnings and sales.
In a press release, 3M said it had earned $2.7bn, or $4.59 per share, in the first quarter of 2021, up from $2.3bn, or $3.88 per share, in the same period last year. The company's revenue rose by 9.6% to $8.9bn in the quarter, beating analysts' estimates of $8.4bn.
The report showed that the company's sales grew across all its businesses, led by a 13% increase in its healthcare unit, which saw strong demand for its medical masks and respirators due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The company's transportation and electronics business also grew by 7%, driven by demand for automotive and consumer electronics products.
3M's CEO Mike Roman said in a statement that the results showed the company's "continued focus on innovation and operational execution", adding that he was "pleased with the improvements we're seeing across the portfolio".
One factor behind the company's impressive results was the spin-off of its data storage and imaging businesses, which were slow-growing and dragging down its overall profitability. In March 2021, 3M completed the sale of these businesses to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management for $1.7bn.
The move was part of 3M's broader restructuring efforts aimed at focusing on faster-growing and more profitable businesses, such as healthcare, transportation, and consumer electronics. The company also plans to invest more in research and development to drive innovation and growth in these areas.
Some analysts have praised 3M's strategy, saying it will help the company improve its profitability and competitiveness in the long term. "There's no question 3M needed to get rid of those businesses," said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, in an interview with Reuters. "They were basically a drain on the company."
However, other analysts have expressed concerns that 3M's reliance on its healthcare business, which accounted for 23% of its sales in the first quarter, could be risky, given that demand for medical masks and equipment is likely to decline as the pandemic subsides.
"This performance is going to be hard to sustain," said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in an interview with the Financial Times. "As the pandemic comes under control, we're going to see a shift in end markets, and that's where the vulnerability is."
Despite these concerns, 3M remains optimistic about its future prospects, saying it expects to continue growing its businesses and improving profitability in the coming years. The company has set a target of achieving organic sales growth of 4% to 6% per year, and a return on invested capital of around 20%.
"We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong performance and sustainable growth over the long term," Roman said in the statement.
Overall, 3M's impressive earnings report is a positive sign for the company and its investors, who have seen the stock rise by more than 17% this year. With its focus on faster-growing and more profitable businesses, 3M looks set to continue to outperform its competitors and deliver value to its shareholders.
