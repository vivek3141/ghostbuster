Greenway Partners has announced that it has purchased an 8.5% stake in Outboard Marine Corp (OMC) for nearly $30 million, in a move that is expected to strengthen the company's position in the marine industry.
OMC, a leading manufacturer of outboard engines and boats, has been struggling in recent years due to increasing competition from other players in the market. However, the company has been making efforts to turn things around by investing in new technology and expanding its product line.
Greenway Partners, a private equity firm with a focus on sustainable investments, is hoping to capitalize on OMC's efforts and help accelerate its growth. The firm has a long history of investing in companies that are committed to protecting the environment, and it sees OMC as an ideal partner in this mission.
"OMC has a great reputation in the industry for quality and innovation," said Mark Williams, CEO of Greenway Partners. "We believe that by working together, we can help the company continue to grow while also ensuring that it remains a leader in sustainable practices."
The deal comes at a crucial time for OMC, which has been facing increased pressure from environmental advocates to reduce its carbon footprint. The company has responded by investing in new technologies that are designed to minimize emissions, such as its new Evinrude E-TEC G2 engine.
"We understand that our customers are concerned about the impact of boating on the environment," said OMC CEO Jeff Wasil. "That's why we're committed to taking a leadership role in developing technologies that are both eco-friendly and efficient."
Greenway Partners has been an advocate for sustainable investing since its founding in 2005. The firm has invested in a range of companies that are committed to reducing their environmental footprint, including renewable energy providers, waste management firms, and sustainable agriculture companies.
"We believe that sustainable investing is not only good for the planet, but also good for business," said Williams. "By investing in companies that are committed to protecting the environment, we're not only doing our part to create a more sustainable future, but we're also helping to create value for our investors."
The deal between Greenway Partners and OMC is expected to help both companies achieve their goals. OMC will benefit from the added investment and expertise provided by Greenway Partners, while Greenway Partners will gain a valuable stake in a company that is committed to sustainability.
"We're excited to be working with a company that shares our values and is committed to making a positive impact on the world," said Williams. "We believe that together, we can help OMC continue to grow and thrive in a sustainable and responsible way."
