Eli Lilly & Co is set to report an increase in its third-quarter profits, however, analysts have raised concerns over its profit margins. Lilly's shares rose nearly 1% on the back of the news.
Experts predict that the pharmaceutical giant will earn a net income of $1.58 billion, which is an increase of 8.1% from the $1.46 billion it reported in the third quarter of 2019. Revenue is expected to increase by 6.2% to $5.95 billion, up from $5.61 billion in the same period last year.
Lilly's earnings will be driven by a strong performance from its key drugs, including Taltz, a treatment for psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis, and Trulicity, a medication for Type 2 diabetes. These drugs have continued to generate strong sales despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite the positive outlook, concerns remain over Lilly's profit margins. The company faces increasing competition from rival firms, and there are worries that pricing pressures will erode its margins.
Lilly is also investing heavily in research and development, which is crucial to the future growth of the company. Research and development expenses are expected to increase to $1.56 billion, up from $1.46 billion last year, which could impact the company's bottom line.
Moreover, recent financial results from other drugmakers, including AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson, have shown that despite robust sales, pricing pressures and higher expenses have lowered their profit margins.
Lilly has already taken steps to address the issue, including entering into partnerships to share the costs of developing new drugs, as well as exploring the potential of emerging markets to generate higher sales.
Overall, the outlook for Lilly remains positive, as the company's strong pipeline and focus on innovation continue to drive growth. However, concerns over profit margins will need to be addressed to ensure the long-term success of the company.
