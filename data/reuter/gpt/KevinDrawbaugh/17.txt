St. Jude Medical Inc., a major medical device company, has come to an agreement to acquire the cardiovascular business of its rival, Thoratec Corporation, for $665 million.
This major acquisition will make St. Jude the top manufacturer of heart regulation devices in the industry. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the second half of 2015.
St. Jude Medical, based in St. Paul, Minnesota, is focused on providing medical devices for the cardiovascular and cardiac rhythm management (CRM) market. The company offers products such as pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices.
Thoratec Corporation, on the other hand, is a California-based company that specializes in the development and marketing of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices. These devices are used to help patients with heart failure who require additional circulatory support and may be candidates for heart transplantation. Some of Thoratec’s most popular products include the HeartMate II LVAD, HeartMate 3, and CentriMag.
By acquiring the cardiovascular business of Thoratec, St. Jude Medical will be able to offer a wider range of heart regulation devices to healthcare providers and patients. In particular, the acquisition will give St. Jude a leading position in the MCS market, which is expected to grow significantly in the coming years.
In a statement released by St. Jude Medical, CEO Daniel Starks emphasized the importance of the acquisition in expanding the company’s reach and capabilities. “This acquisition represents a significant step forward in our strategy to build a robust portfolio of products and therapies that can help patients with heart failure across the full continuum of care,” he said.
The Thoratec acquisition is not the only recent move made by St. Jude to expand its portfolio. Earlier this year, the company acquired NeuroTherm Inc., a leading provider of radiofrequency ablation systems used in the treatment of chronic pain. Additionally, St. Jude has invested heavily in research and development to create new products and technologies that can improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.
According to industry analysts, the acquisition of Thoratec’s cardiovascular business is a smart move for St. Jude Medical. The MCS market is expected to grow between 8% and 12% annually, and the acquisition will allow St. Jude to capitalize on this growth.
However, the acquisition is not without risks. St. Jude will need to integrate Thoratec’s cardiovascular business into its existing operations, and there may be some challenges in doing so smoothly. Additionally, St. Jude will need to continue to invest in research and development to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving healthcare market.
Despite these challenges, the acquisition is a major milestone for St. Jude, and underscores the company’s commitment to providing innovative medical devices that improve patient outcomes. As the company continues to grow and expand, it is likely to remain a major player in the healthcare industry for years to come.
