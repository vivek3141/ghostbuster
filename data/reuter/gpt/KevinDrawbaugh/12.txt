St. Jude Medical Inc's third-quarter profits were held back due to a missed heart valve sale to Iran and other factors, the company reported on Tuesday.
According to the report, the medical technology company's revenue for the third quarter grew only 3% to $1.54 billion, falling short of analysts' expectations of $1.57 billion. The company's net earnings for the quarter were reported to be $186 million, down from $198 million in the same period last year.
St. Jude Medical attributed the weaker-than-expected performance to several factors, including a missed heart valve sale to Iran due to the ongoing economic sanctions against the country. The company estimated that the lost sale contributed to a decline of about 1 percentage point in its revenue growth for the quarter.
In addition to the missed sale, St. Jude Medical also experienced slower-than-expected sales growth in its heart rhythm management division, which includes pacemakers and implantable defibrillators. The division's revenue grew only 2% to $754 million, falling short of analysts' expectations of $787 million.
St. Jude Medical's cardiovascular division, which includes its heart valve products, saw revenue growth of 7% to $460 million, but still missed analysts' expectations of $484 million.
The company's neuromodulation division, which includes devices for treating chronic pain, saw revenue growth of 6% to $249 million, in line with analysts' expectations.
In a statement, St. Jude Medical CEO Dan Starks acknowledged the challenges the company faced in the third quarter, but emphasized the company's confidence in its long-term growth prospects.
"While we are disappointed with our financial results this quarter, we remain confident in our ability to execute our strategy and deliver long-term growth," Starks said. "We continue to make significant investments in research and development, clinical trials, and commercialization efforts to drive innovation and growth across our portfolio of therapies."
St. Jude Medical also announced several new product launches and regulatory approvals during the quarter, including the US launch of its EnSite X3 mapping system for cardiac ablation procedures and the European approval of its Assurity MRI pacemaker.
Despite the weaker-than-expected performance in the third quarter, some analysts remain optimistic about St. Jude Medical's prospects. In a research note, Jefferies & Co analyst Raj Denhoy noted that the company's cardiovascular division "continues to perform well," and that the company's recent product launches "should help support growth in the coming year."
Shares of St. Jude Medical were down 2.2% in premarket trading on Tuesday following the release of the third-quarter earnings report. The company's stock has fallen about 10% since the beginning of the year.
