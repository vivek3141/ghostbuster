Airbus has set its sights for soaring heights in 1996, thanks to a bumper order from US carrier, USAir. The order for 121 new aircrafts is valued at $6.6 billion, and it's enough for the European jet maker to break the 1,000-order barrier that surpasses American arch-rival Boeing. The decision comes as a significant boost for Airbus as it continues to grow as a major global competitor.
The order is set to include A319, A320 and A321 models of aircraft, and it's a blow for Boeing, which has traditionally dominated the US markets for many decades. USAir stated that it chose Airbus for the flexibility it offered with the broad range of aircraft models available that could suit various routes and operational requirements.
The news of the order has been met with excitement in the aviation industry as this further cements Airbus' position as the world's leading aircraft manufacturer. As it stands, the company is responsible for more than 30% of the global market for commercial airline production. The brand's primary strength lies in its product diversity, which allows it to meet individual aircraft requirements of airlines across the world.
However, Airbus still has some significant decisions to make cautiously in 1996. With flexibility comes complexity, and Airbus will have to stay on top of the game, developing its products to meet the ever-changing market needs. The company will need to manage its investments and focus as it positions itself for growth and expansion worldwide.
Another critical decision the company faces is the question of ownership and governance. As Airbus continues to emerge as a front-runner in the aviation market, shareholders are seeking clarity over its ownership structure. The European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) and British defence company BAE Systems currently hold significant stakes in the company.
However, the French government owns shares as well, and with elections looming, Francois Mitterrand's successor could shift the political landscape for the aviation company. It emerges that the more minor shareholders are looking for a more transparent ownership structure and a less complex legal entity. There have been calls for EADS to buy out BAE Systems and take full control of Airbus, but this is yet to materialize.
Airbus has been making great strides and major gains in the Asian markets, particularly in China. However, the question of ownership has become more pressing as the company continues to expand globally. Airbus will need to ensure that it stays ahead of competition in China, maintaining a strong relationship with this key market as it looks to penetrate deeper into the aviation industry.
The Chinese make up for a significant chunk of the global economy, and their aviation market is set to become the world's largest in the next few years. They are also looking to grow their defense industry, as well as their aircraft manufacturing. Airbus will need to be on its toes to take advantage of this developing market and stay ahead of the curve.
Overall, Airbus looks set to continue its upward trajectory, and the bumper order by USAir will only serve to cement its position as the world's leading aircraft manufacturer. However, it will need to stay vigilant and keep ahead of the game if it is to secure its position. With competition from Boeing always looming, Airbus must ensure that it continues to diversify its products in response to market needs and maintain close relationships with emerging markets such as China.
On the question of ownership, Airbus will need to develop a more transparent and open structure that gives shareholders the clarity and transparency they seek. As the political landscape around the company shifts, how it manages its ownership structure will become increasingly important, and Airbus will need to manage its investors' expectations and make tough decisions to position itself for success in 1996 and beyond.
