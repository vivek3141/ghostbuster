French Utilities Giant Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE) has announced its financial results for the 2020 fiscal year which ended on December 31, and it's good news for investors. The company has posted higher profits, outperforming market expectations despite the challenging conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
CGE ended the year with revenues of €47.2 billion, a modest 2 percent decline from €48.2 billion in 2019. However, it saw a 5 percent increase in net operating profits, which amounted to €2.5 billion, up from €2.3 billion in the previous year. The company also reported an 8 percent rise in net profits, which totaled €1.5 billion.
The results were primarily driven by strong performances from its businesses in water and waste management, which remain the core areas of CGE's operations. The water division saw a 3 percent increase in revenues, while waste management revenues were up by 5 percent. However, the company's construction business saw a 19 percent decline in revenues as a result of the pandemic and economic uncertainty.
In response to the challenging market conditions, CGE has announced plans to reorganize its construction business, with the aim of improving its profitability and efficiency. The company said it will combine its construction activities under a single entity, which will be focused on delivering projects in France and select international markets.
The move will see the creation of a new business segment, CGE Construction, which will bring together three existing building companies – Eiffage Construction, Bouygues Construction, and Vinci Construction. The new entity will be headed by Frederic Imbrecht, who will report directly to the CGE group's CEO, Philippe Varin.
"We are convinced that a single construction entity with a clear, strategic focus will be better equipped to address the market challenges that lie ahead," said Varin in a statement. "By bringing together Eiffage, Bouygues, and Vinci, we aim to leverage their complementary strengths and create a leaner, more efficient construction business."
CGE's move comes at a time when the French construction industry is facing a difficult environment marked by slow economic growth and intense competition. The industry has also been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced many construction projects to be put on hold due to social distancing measures and supply chain disruptions.
While the pandemic has caused significant disruption to CGE's operations, the company has remained resilient thanks to its diversified business model, which spans a range of essential services. In addition to water and waste management and construction, CGE also operates in energy, transportation, and urban services.
Looking ahead, the company said it is well-positioned to support the transition to a low-carbon economy and play a leading role in the French government's drive to decarbonize the economy by 2050. CGE has already set itself ambitious targets to reduce its carbon footprint, including a pledge to become carbon-neutral by 2050.
CGE's shares rose by around 1 percent in early trading on Monday following the release of its results and reorganization plans for its construction business. The company's announcement was welcomed by investors, who see it as a positive step towards improving profitability and capturing new market opportunities.
CGE's success underscores the importance of adapting to changing market conditions and embracing new business models to remain competitive in today's fast-paced and uncertain world. By focusing on its core strengths and leveraging its diversified business model, CGE has demonstrated that it's possible to weather the storm and emerge even stronger on the other side.
