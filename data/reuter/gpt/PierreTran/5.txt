Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE), one of the largest utilities companies in France, has announced higher profits due to strong growth across its key segments. The company has also revealed plans to reorganise its troubled construction business, which has been a source of concern for investors for several quarters.
According to the financial reports released by CGE, the company recorded a net profit of €585 million in the first quarter of 2021, up by 10% compared to the same period last year. This result was driven by improved performance across the group's core businesses, including water, waste management, and energy.
In particular, CGE's water division saw a significant uptick in profits, increasing by 12% to €2.3 billion, due to strong demand for the company's services amid rising awareness around water scarcity and sustainability. Similarly, the waste management unit saw a 7% increase in profits to €690 million, underpinned by increased investments in recycling and waste-to-energy projects.
However, the company's construction business, which represents a small but critical part of CGE's portfolio, continued to underperform, recording a net loss of €40 million in the first quarter. This figure follows a string of disappointing results for the division, which has struggled with low margins, cost overruns, and project delays.
To address these challenges, CGE has announced plans to restructure its construction business, including the creation of a new subsidiary that will focus on high-margin construction projects, such as airports, railways, and power plants.
"We recognise that the construction industry is going through a difficult phase, with intense competition and margin pressures," said Jean-Pierre Fournier, chairman of CGE. "To address these challenges, we are taking steps to reorganise our construction business, streamline our operations, and focus on projects that offer higher profitability and better risk profiles."
Fournier added that the company was confident in its ability to turn the construction division around, citing a strong backlog of projects and a skilled workforce as key advantages.
Investors welcomed the news of CGE's strong profits and plans to restructure its construction business, with shares in the company rising by 3% in early trading on Tuesday. The company's stock has been under pressure in recent months due to concerns over the weak construction business, as well as uncertainty around the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the utilities sector.
However, analysts caution that CGE still faces a challenging operating environment, with mounting regulatory pressures, rising raw material costs, and a rapidly changing competitive landscape.
"The utilities industry is undergoing significant transformation, driven by the shift towards renewable energy, the digitisation of infrastructure, and increasing regulatory scrutiny," said Yves Noël, an analyst at investment bank BNP Paribas. "CGE will need to remain agile, innovative, and adaptable to capitalise on opportunities and mitigate risks in this dynamic environment."
Despite these challenges, CGE remains one of the strongest players in the utilities sector, with a sizable and diversified business model, a track record of innovation and investment, and a commitment to sustainability and social responsibility. The company operates across 70 countries and employs more than 300,000 people worldwide.
