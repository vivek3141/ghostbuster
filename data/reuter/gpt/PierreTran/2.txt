Shares in the Eurotunnel fell by 3% on Monday after the company announced a new restructuring deal with its creditor banks. The deal means that Eurotunnel will be required to pay back its debt a year earlier than originally planned.
The new restructuring deal is part of a wider effort by Eurotunnel to reduce its debt, which currently stands at around â‚¬3.2 billion. The company has been struggling financially in recent years due to a downturn in the European economy and increased competition from low-cost airlines.
Under the new deal, Eurotunnel will now have to pay back its debt by 2025, rather than 2026 as originally planned. The company will also have to pay higher interest rates on its loans.
Investors were disappointed by the announcement, as they had been hoping that Eurotunnel would be able to negotiate a more favorable deal with its creditors. As a result, shares in the company fell by 3% in early trading on Monday.
Eurotunnel CEO Jacques Gounon defended the deal, stating that it was necessary in order to reduce the company's debt and secure its long-term future.
"We have been working hard to secure the future of Eurotunnel, and this new restructuring deal is an important step in that process," he said. "While we understand that some investors may be disappointed by the terms of the deal, we believe it is the best option for our company and our shareholders in the long run."
Despite the disappointment of some investors, some analysts have praised Eurotunnel for taking proactive steps to reduce its debt and strengthen its financial position.
"Given the challenging economic climate in Europe, Eurotunnel has been doing a good job of managing its debt and restructuring its operations in order to stay competitive," said John Smith, an analyst with brokerage firm JPMorgan.
"It's not surprising that some investors are disappointed by the new deal, but I believe that Eurotunnel is positioning itself for long-term success by reducing its debt and increasing its profitability."
Overall, the new restructuring deal is seen as a necessary step for Eurotunnel as it seeks to navigate a challenging economic environment and remain competitive in the long term. While investors may be disappointed in the short term, many are optimistic about the company's prospects for the future.
