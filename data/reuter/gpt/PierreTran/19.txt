The French government has successfully sold off a nine percent stake in oil giant Elf-Aquitaine for a staggering $2 billion. The move is seen as a continuation of the government's plan to divest its holdings in publicly traded companies as part of its ongoing privatization program.
Elf-Aquitaine, which was created through a merger of two French oil companies in 1966, has long been a significant player in the global oil and gas industry. The company has operations and assets in more than 100 countries, including significant crude oil and natural gas resources in Africa, Asia, and Russia.
The French government has held a stake in Elf-Aquitaine for decades, as part of its efforts to protect the country's energy resources and maintain domestic control over the industry. However, in recent years, the government has been looking to reduce its share in the company and other publicly traded firms, citing the need to reduce the state's role in the economy and raise funds for other priorities.
The sale of the nine percent stake was carried out through a private placement, with institutional investors purchasing the shares at a price of $120 per share. According to reports, the demand for the shares was strong, with the placement oversubscribed by several times.
The sale is expected to help the government raise much-needed funds as it continues to grapple with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. France has been hit hard by the crisis, with the country's GDP expected to contract by nearly 10 percent this year.
In a statement following the sale, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire praised the move, saying it would "allow us to better finance the recovery plan that we have put in place to revive our economy." Le Maire added that the government remained committed to reducing its holdings in other publicly traded companies as part of its privatization program.
The sale of the stake in Elf-Aquitaine is also expected to have implications for the company itself. While the French government remains a significant shareholder, the reduced stake will give Elf-Aquitaine more freedom to pursue its own interests and make strategic decisions without government interference.
The move comes as the global oil and gas industry is facing significant challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic and a shift towards renewable energy sources. Elf-Aquitaine has already announced plans to reduce its carbon footprint and increase investment in renewable energy and low-carbon technologies.
The sale of the government's stake in Elf-Aquitaine is just the latest in a series of privatizations by the French government, which has already sold off shares in companies such as airports operator ADP and power company EDF. While the program has faced opposition from labor unions and left-wing politicians, the government argues that it will help to modernize the economy and promote growth in the long run.
