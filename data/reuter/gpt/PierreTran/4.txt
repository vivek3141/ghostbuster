PARIS - French telecommunications firms Bouygues and STET have joined forces to announce plans for a joint bid in the French telecoms market.
In a media statement released on Tuesday, the companies confirmed the joint bid and stated their intention to work together to win a significant share of the French market. Neither firm released any further details on the deal, but they said that they will provide important insights in the following weeks.
Bouygues, a well-known French construction and telecoms company, has been a significant player in the French telecoms market for years, with a significant market share. STET, on the other hand, is an Italian telecoms firm that provides fixed and mobile phone services, broadband internet and digital television. The two companies share a vision for the future of the French telecoms industry and believe, working together, they can accelerate their plans.
France is one of the largest telecoms markets in Europe, and the two companies believe that combining their resources and expertise will be more significant than operating separately. The move also comes after the French telecoms sector posted a weak earnings report for H1 2021. However, this collaboration will step Pan-European into the competition in one of the biggest markets in France, creating a challenge for other operators.
Marc Mastan, Chief Executive Officer of Bouygues, has said, "Our companies share a very similar approach to the market, and we believe that the combined strengths of Bouygues and STET will enable us to compete effectively in a highly competitive market." He further added, "Together, we can provide customers with the highest level of service and quality, as well as gain market share." 
The joint bid is expected to provide Bouygues and STET with a more substantial competitive advantage, enabling them to offer more benefits to their customers in terms of price, quality, and services. The deal will undoubtedly have a healthy impact on both the companies' bottom line.
Paolo Michelini, CEO of STET, said, "We believe that this strategic collaboration will be highly beneficial for our customers, shareholders and the broader telecommunication industry. Given the changing competitive landscape, we need to act quickly and effectively."
The joint bid is expected to shake up France's telecoms industry, as consolidation and collaboration become more commonplace in what is an increasingly competitive marketplace. However, it remains to be seen how this collaboration will change the French telecoms competitive landscape or panning out its impact on current market leaders in France.
Bouygues and STET have also pledged to maintain rigorous competition in the French telecoms market to ensure better service levels and fair pricing for customers. With their combined resources and competitive stance, they hold the potential to shake up the French market and force existing players to adapt their strategy.
