The French government is urging Air France to choose Airbus over Boeing as the airline prepares to renew its long-haul fleet. France's transport minister, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, said that the government will provide financial support to Air France if the airline selects Airbus for its new fleet. Djebbari also highlighted the importance of supporting the country's aviation industry during these challenging times.
Air France, which is part of the Air France-KLM group, is currently in talks with both Airbus and Boeing for the purchase of new planes to replace its ageing fleet. The airline is expected to announce its decision in the coming months. However, the French government has made it clear that it wants Air France to choose Airbus, which is based in France.
The decision to pressure Air France to choose Airbus over Boeing is seen as a move to support the French economy, which has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. The aviation industry, in particular, has suffered due to travel restrictions and a drop in demand for air travel. Airbus is a major employer in France, and the government is keen to support the company and its local supply chain.
In a statement, Djebbari said, "We want to support our national champions, and Airbus is one of them. We will do what it takes to ensure that Air France has the necessary financial support to renew its fleet with Airbus planes." Djebbari added that the government's support for Airbus will help to protect jobs and boost the country's economy.
Air France currently has a fleet of around 100 long-haul planes, including Boeing 777s and Airbus A330s. The airline has said that it plans to renew its fleet with more fuel-efficient planes to reduce costs and environmental impact. Air France-KLM has been hit hard by the pandemic, with the group reporting a net loss of â‚¬7.1 billion ($8.5 billion) in 2020.
Airbus, which is based in Toulouse, France, has been pushing hard to win the Air France contract. The company has launched a new version of its A350 plane, which is designed specifically for long-haul flights. The A350 is seen as a strong contender for the Air France contract, as it is more efficient than the Boeing 777, which is its main rival.
Boeing, for its part, has been struggling to recover from the fallout of two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX planes in 2018 and 2019. The company has also been hit hard by the pandemic, with airlines cancelling or delaying orders due to the drop in demand for air travel. Boeing is hoping to regain some ground by securing the Air France contract, which would be a major boost for the company.
The French government's move to pressure Air France to choose Airbus over Boeing is not without controversy. Some critics have accused the government of favouring domestic companies at the expense of competition and free trade. Others argue that Air France should be free to choose the best planes for its needs, without political interference.
Regardless of the criticisms, the French government's support for Airbus is likely to be welcomed by the company. Airbus has been lobbying hard for government support, as it seeks to weather the storm caused by the pandemic. With the backing of the French government, Airbus is in a strong position to win the Air France contract and secure its future in the aviation industry.
