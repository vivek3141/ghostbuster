PARIS, FRANCE - In a move to keep pace with its European airline rivals, Air France has announced a strategic partnership with both Delta and Continental airlines. The partnership is aimed at improving the alliance's competitive position in the market and providing greater options and connections for customers.
Air France, one of Europe's largest airlines, has seen increased competition in recent years due to the rise of low-cost carriers. The new partnership with Delta and Continental will allow Air France to expand its portfolio and offer more direct flights to key markets in the United States. This is expected to strengthen their presence in the transatlantic market, where they have been struggling to compete against their rivals.
"With this partnership, we are able to offer our customers more choices and connections than ever before," said Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air France. "We are confident that this will help us stay ahead of our competitors and provide our customers with the best possible experience."
The partnership will be based on a joint venture (JV), which will allow the three airlines to coordinate schedules, pricing, and sales. The JV will be subject to regulatory approval, but it is expected to be finalized by the end of 2021. The deal is expected to result in an estimated $1.5 billion in annual revenue for the partnership.
As part of the partnership, members of Air France's Flying Blue program will be able to earn and redeem miles on Delta and Continental flights. Passengers will also benefit from reciprocal elite status benefits, such as access to airport lounges and priority boarding.
"We are very excited to be partnering with Air France and Continental," said Delta CEO Ed Bastian. "By combining our strengths, we can offer our customers more options and seamless connections between our networks."
Continental CEO Jeff Smisek added, "This partnership will give our customers access to more destinations, which is essential in today's global economy. We are excited to be working with Air France and Delta to bring our customers even more choice and convenience."
The partnership is the latest example of the consolidation taking place in the airline industry. Airlines are increasingly forming alliances and partnerships in order to expand their reach and stay competitive. This also allows airlines to share resources and reduce costs.
With the growth of low-cost carriers, traditional airlines like Air France are forced to find new ways to compete. This partnership is expected to help Air France remain competitive by providing it with greater access to the US market.
"This is a smart move by Air France," said James Goodman, an airline industry analyst. "By partnering with two of the largest airlines in the US, Air France is positioning itself to better compete against its rivals. It should also help Air France to maintain its position as one of Europe's leading airlines."
The partnership between Air France, Delta, and Continental is expected to benefit all parties involved. It will enable the airlines to offer a more comprehensive network of flights, which will increase revenue and enhance the travel experience for passengers. The JV is expected to be a major milestone for Air France and its partners, and it will be interesting to see how it develops in the years to come.
