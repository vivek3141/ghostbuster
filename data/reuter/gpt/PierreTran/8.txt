French President Jacques Chirac has announced plans to create a national defence giant by merging aerospace and defence company Lagardere's Matra with electronics and defence systems firm Thomson-CFS. The move is aimed at strengthening France's military capabilities and its position in the global defence market.
According to reports, the newly merged entity will be named "French Defence Industries" and will be headed by Philippe Camus, the current CEO of Lagardere. The merger is expected to create a company worth around 17 billion euros ($20 billion), making it one of the largest defence firms in Europe.
In a statement, President Chirac emphasized the importance of the merger for the country's national security. "This merger will allow us to pool our resources, expertise, and technologies to become a major player in the global defence market," he said. "We must ensure that France has the means to protect itself and its allies."
The French government has been pushing for the consolidation of the country's defence industry for several years, citing the need to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and boost the competitiveness of French companies in the international market.
Thomson-CFS, which is currently owned by French aerospace group Thales, specializes in electronics and communication systems for defence and security applications. Its products include radar and sonar systems, radio communication systems, and electronic warfare technology.
Meanwhile, Lagardere's Matra division is primarily focused on aerospace and defence technology, including missile systems, drones, and satellites. The company also operates in the commercial aviation sector, with stakes in the development of the Airbus A380 and A400M planes.
The merger is expected to bring together complementary expertise from both firms, creating a wider range of products and services for the defence industry. French Defence Industries will also have the advantage of being vertically integrated, with capabilities spanning from research and development to production and maintenance.
The move has been welcomed by industry experts, who believe that it will give French defence companies a stronger position in the global market. "The merger of Thomson-CFS and Matra represents a significant step towards the consolidation of the French defence industry," said Jean-Pierre Loubinoux, President of the French Aerospace Industry Association.
However, the merger has also raised concerns about job losses and the potential impact on smaller suppliers in the French defence supply chain. Some critics have argued that the creation of a national defence giant could reduce competition and lead to a concentration of power in the hands of a few major players.
President Chirac sought to address these concerns in his statement, saying that the new company would be committed to maintaining jobs and supporting the development of smaller businesses in the industry. "We must ensure that the benefits of this merger are shared by all, and that it contributes to the growth and prosperity of our country," he said.
The merger is expected to be completed by the end of the year, subject to approval by regulators and shareholders. If successful, French Defence Industries is expected to become a major player in the global defence market, with the potential to compete with established giants like Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems.
