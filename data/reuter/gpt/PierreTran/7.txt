Top French aviation executives have raised concerns about the possibility of renewed turbulence with the United States over airlines market access rights. The warning comes in the wake of recent moves by the US government to revoke a grant of landing rights to a French airline.
The French aviation industry has enjoyed a long-standing partnership with US airlines, with over 25 million passengers flying between the two countries each year. However, recent developments have given cause for concern among industry stakeholders.
The US Department of Transportation recently revoked a grant of landing rights to one of the major French airlines, citing French regulations that limit the number of flights between the two countries. The move has been seen as an attempt by the US government to pressure France to increase market access for American airlines.
This development has sparked concerns that the US will retaliate against France, setting off a chain reaction that could lead to renewed turbulence in the aviation industry. French airlines are already struggling with the economic impact of the global pandemic and a potential trade war with the US could be catastrophic for the industry.
The French minister for transport, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, has said that he is deeply concerned about the risk of a trade war and has called for urgent talks with US counterparts. He stressed the importance of maintaining the French-American partnership as "crucial" not just for the aviation industry, but also for the wider economy.
Industry insiders have echoed these concerns, warning that the US could target other French airlines and even broader sectors of the economy. The aviation industry is a vital source of revenue for France, providing over 355,000 jobs and contributing over â‚¬53 billion to the country's economy.
The French government is expected to take a strong stance against any attempts to limit market access for its airlines, emphasizing the importance of free and fair competition in the aviation sector. However, with the threat of economic retaliation looming, the situation remains uncertain.
French aviation executives hope that urgent talks with US counterparts will produce a resolution before the situation escalates further. But with global economic uncertainty and political instability, the potential for renewed turbulence in the aviation industry is a very real possibility.
