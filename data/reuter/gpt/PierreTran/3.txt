Paris, France – Eurotunnel SA, the operator of the Channel Tunnel between France and the UK, has seen a significant drop in the value of its shares after announcing the terms of a restructuring deal with its creditor banks. The deal, which was made public on Tuesday, has left investors disappointed and concerned about the firm's future.
The company has been in negotiation with its creditor banks over the restructuring of its debt since early this year, with the aim of reducing its borrowing costs and improving its financial position. However, the terms of the deal have not been well received by the market, with Eurotunnel shares falling by 5.4% in early trading on Tuesday.
Under the terms of the agreement, Eurotunnel will be required to increase its debt by €3.4 billion ($4.1 billion), in order to pay off its existing creditors and provide the funding required to complete the construction of a third tunnel. The company will also have to pay additional interest charges on its new debt, which will further increase its costs.
Investors had been hoping for a more favorable deal, which would have allowed Eurotunnel to reduce its debt burden and improve its financial position. Many had also hoped that the company would be able to negotiate a better deal on interest payments, given its strong financial performance in recent years.
However, despite the disappointment of investors, Eurotunnel remains optimistic about the future. In a statement released on Tuesday, the company's CEO, Jacques Gounon, said the restructuring deal was necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the business.
"We have been able to negotiate a deal that will significantly reduce our debt and help us to complete the construction of our third tunnel, which will provide additional capacity and generate significant revenues for the business," he said. "While we understand the disappointment of some investors, we believe that the long-term benefits of this deal will outweigh the short-term impact on the share price."
Eurotunnel has been operating the Channel Tunnel since 1994, and has established itself as a key player in the transport industry. The company has seen steady growth in recent years, with revenues of €1.1 billion ($1.3 billion) in 2020, up from €968 million ($1.2 billion) the previous year.
Despite the recent fall in its share price, Eurotunnel remains a firm favorite with many investors, who believe that it has the potential to continue growing and generating strong returns in the years ahead. However, the company will need to continue to work hard to maintain its position in a competitive and fast-paced market, and to ensure that it remains at the forefront of technological and operational developments in the transport sector.
