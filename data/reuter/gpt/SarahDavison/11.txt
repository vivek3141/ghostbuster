The man dubbed as the "Architect of Hong Kong's Currency Link" defended the pegged exchange rate system's continued existence beyond the transfer of sovereignty to China. Joseph Yam, the former head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, expressed his confidence in the peg's stability and effectiveness as a tool for monetary policy.
Speaking at a forum on international finance, Yam pointed out that the currency peg had served Hong Kong well for over three decades, weathering political and economic crises while maintaining stability and consistency in exchange rates. He stressed that the peg remained essential to Hong Kong's role as an international financial hub and would continue to underpin its economic growth.
After British colonial rule ended in 1997, Hong Kong became a "special administrative region" of China with a separate governing system and limited autonomy. The peg system, established in 1983, linked the Hong Kong dollar to the US dollar at a fixed exchange rate and has remained in place despite the city's return to Chinese sovereignty.
However, the peg's future under the current geopolitical climate has come into question. The ongoing trade war between the US and China, coupled with the protests that have gripped Hong Kong over the past year, has created a volatile environment in which the city's traditional economic strengths such as financial services and tourism have been severely impacted.
Furthermore, the recent escalation in tensions between the US and China over Hong Kong's national security law has sparked concerns that the US government may consider revoking the city's special trade status, which could have severe implications for its economy and financial system.
Despite these challenges, Yam remained confident in the peg's stability and ability to weather any potential disruptions. He noted that the system had been tested before, such as during the Asian financial crisis in 1997, and had emerged stronger as a result.
Yam also emphasized the importance of maintaining Hong Kong's status as a global financial center, pointing out that the city's financial services industry accounted for over 20% of its GDP and employed over 250,000 people. He argued that the peg was key to maintaining investor confidence in Hong Kong and attracting foreign investment.
While acknowledging that some critics had called for a shift towards a floating exchange rate system, Yam argued that the benefits of maintaining the peg outweighed the risks. He noted that the peg had helped Hong Kong weather many difficulties over the years and that a switch to a new system could lead to economic uncertainty and instability.
Despite the challenges facing Hong Kong and its exchange rate system, Yam's support for the peg underscores its importance in both the city's financial system and its overall economic future. As Hong Kong continues to navigate a complex and evolving geo-political landscape, the exchange rate tool may yet prove to be a key factor in maintaining economic stability and supporting the city's ongoing growth.
