Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has announced that it is set to require all fund managers based in the Special Administrative Region to implement so-called "Chinese walls" to prevent unsanctioned trades.
The measure, which is set to take effect in early 2022, is aimed at preventing insider trading and other market manipulations by ensuring that information about certain trades is only accessible to employees who are authorised to carry out those transactions.
In a statement, the SFC said that the new requirements are part of its ongoing efforts to enhance the integrity and resilience of Hong Kong's financial markets.
"The SFC is committed to maintaining a fair, transparent and efficient financial marketplace in Hong Kong, and the imposition of Chinese walls is an important step in achieving that goal," said Ashley Alder, the SFC's Chief Executive Officer.
Under the new regulations, fund managers will be required to erect physical or electronic barriers between employees to prevent them from sharing information about certain trades. The exact scope of the "Chinese walls" will depend on the nature of the business and the types of information involved.
In addition to requiring fund managers to implement Chinese walls, the SFC also plans to step up its surveillance of trading activities to detect any potential breaches of the new rules. The regulator warned that any fund manager found to be in breach of the regulations could face severe penalties, including fines, suspension of its licence, or criminal prosecution.
Several fund managers have already expressed their support for the new measures, noting that they will help to enhance the integrity of Hong Kong's financial markets and bolster investor confidence in the region.
"The implementation of Chinese walls is a welcome development for the industry," said Greg Hsu, head of the asset management practice at Baker McKenzie in Hong Kong. "This is an important step in ensuring that fund managers operate in a transparent and fair manner, and it will help to build trust between investors and the financial sector."
Others have expressed some concerns about the potential costs and logistical challenges of implementing Chinese walls. Some fund managers have pointed out that erecting physical barriers could be difficult in certain types of office environments, while others have expressed concerns about the impact of increased surveillance on employee morale.
Despite these concerns, most experts agree that the benefits of the new measures outweigh the potential costs and complications.
"Chinese walls have been a common practice in many jurisdictions for many years, and there is no reason why they cannot be implemented effectively in Hong Kong," said Maurice Ngai, a partner at Deloitte in Hong Kong. "While there may be some initial costs and challenges associated with implementing the walls, the long-term benefits in terms of enhanced transparency and investor trust will be significant."
The move to implement Chinese walls comes as Hong Kong's financial markets are facing increased scrutiny from regulators around the world. In recent years, concerns have been raised about the risks posed by shadow banking activities, as well as the potential for market manipulation and insider trading.
In response to these concerns, the SFC has been working to strengthen Hong Kong's regulatory framework and to boost its enforcement capabilities. In addition to the new requirements for Chinese walls, the regulator has also introduced stricter rules governing the marketing of investment products and the disclosure of information by listed companies.
Overall, the SFC's efforts seem to be paying off, as Hong Kong's financial markets continue to perform well despite the COVID-19 pandemic and other global challenges. According to recent data, the city's stock market has seen steady growth over the past year, while the number of initial public offerings (IPOs) has also increased significantly.
Looking forward, the SFC and Hong Kong's financial industry will continue to face significant challenges, including the ongoing impact of the pandemic, rising geopolitical tensions, and regulatory changes in other jurisdictions. However, with its robust regulatory framework and commitment to transparency and integrity, Hong Kong is well positioned to weather these challenges and emerge as a key player in the global financial landscape.
