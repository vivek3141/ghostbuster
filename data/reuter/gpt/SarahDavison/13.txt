Harvard economist, Professor Larry Summers, has warned that the ongoing uncertainty in Hong Kong could compromise the city's position as the world's second most competitive economy, behind Singapore.
Professor Summers, who served as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton, told a forum in Hong Kong that the uncertainty created by the recent protests and turmoil could deter investment and undermine the city's economic fundamentals.
"Hong Kong has been a beacon of stability and a gateway to the Chinese market for many years, and its success is built on the rule of law, a transparent and efficient system of governance, and a world-class infrastructure," Professor Summers said.
"But the recent protests and the ongoing political uncertainty raise concerns about the future of those pillars, and if investors and businesses start to lose confidence in Hong Kong as a hub of commerce, it could damage the city's long-term prospects."
Hong Kong has been rocked by months of protests, triggered initially by a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to China's mainland for trial. The protests have evolved into a broader movement calling for democratic reforms, and have seen violent clashes between protesters and police.
The turmoil has taken a toll on Hong Kong's economy, with the government forecasting a contraction in gross domestic product for 2019, the first time since the global financial crisis in 2009.
However, Hong Kong still boasts many advantages that contribute to its competitive edge, including a highly educated workforce, attractive tax regime, and strategic location as a gateway to the Chinese market.
Singapore, which topped the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report for 2019, also faces its own challenges, including an aging population, a tight labor market, and rising geopolitical risks.
"Singapore has been very successful in building a knowledge-based economy and attracting global talent, but it also faces some structural challenges that could limit its long-term growth potential," Professor Summers said.
"Both Hong Kong and Singapore are facing headwinds, and they will need to be proactive in addressing these challenges and capitalizing on their strengths if they want to remain at the forefront of the global economy."
A recent report by the Asian Development Bank noted that while Hong Kong has a "highly competitive and open economy," it faces challenges in "adapting to new technologies and business models, enhancing labor productivity, and attracting and retaining talent."
The report called for Hong Kong to "redouble its efforts to create an innovation-friendly environment, invest in education and training, and promote a more diversified economic structure."
Professor Summers echoed those recommendations, noting that "the key to Hong Kong's success is its ability to adapt to changing circumstances and stay ahead of the curve."
"If Hong Kong can maintain its commitment to the rule of law, transparency, and openness, while also investing in innovation, education, and human capital, it could continue to be a powerhouse of the global economy," he said.
"However, if the current uncertainty persists or escalates, it could undermine the city's economic stability and diminish its competitive advantage. The stakes are high, and the time to act is now."
