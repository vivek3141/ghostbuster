In recent years, China has made concerted efforts to develop its own capital markets, using domestic savings instead of relying on foreign investment opportunities. This move is seen as a way to reduce the country's reliance on external capital and protect its economy from external shocks.
China's domestic savings have been growing rapidly in recent years, boosted by a surge in household wealth and rising disposable incomes. According to the country's National Bureau of Statistics, total domestic savings reached 264.11 trillion yuan (about $40.6 trillion) in 2020, up 7.8 percent from the previous year. This vast amount of money presents a significant opportunity for China to develop its capital markets and attract more investment.
The Chinese government has been working to channel this domestic savings into the country's capital markets. In recent years, it has introduced a series of measures designed to encourage individuals and institutions to invest in stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments. These measures include tax incentives, reduced trading fees, and the launch of new investment products.
At the same time, China has been reducing its reliance on foreign investment in its capital markets. According to a report by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, the proportion of foreign ownership of Chinese domestic bonds has fallen from nearly 9 percent in 2019 to just over 4 percent in 2020. This reduction is seen as a deliberate move by the Chinese government to insulate its economy from external risks, such as financial crises or political tensions.
China's efforts to develop its own capital markets have been met with some challenges. One of the biggest obstacles has been a lack of transparency and regulatory oversight. Critics argue that China's financial system is still too opaque and not open enough to foreign investors, which could limit its attractiveness as an investment destination.
Despite these challenges, many analysts believe that China's domestic savings represent a significant opportunity for the country to develop its own capital markets and reduce its reliance on external investment. They point to the country's large pool of domestic savings as a major advantage, as well as the government's commitment to developing its financial infrastructure.
One key area of focus for China's capital markets development is the bond market. According to a report by the Bank of America, China's bond market could become the world's largest within the next few years, overtaking the US market in size. This growth is driven by a combination of factors, including a growing demand for fixed-income securities, increased issuance of debt by Chinese companies, and a loosening of restrictions on foreign investment in the market.
To further develop its bond market, China has been introducing a range of new financial instruments and promoting greater transparency and disclosure among issuers. It has also been working to expand the market's investor base, including encouraging more foreign investment.
China's efforts to build its own capital markets are part of a broader drive to reduce its dependence on external investment and increase its self-sufficiency. It remains to be seen whether these efforts will be successful in the long term, but many analysts believe that China's vast pool of domestic savings presents a significant opportunity for the country to build a robust and sustainable financial system that will help support its continued growth and development.
