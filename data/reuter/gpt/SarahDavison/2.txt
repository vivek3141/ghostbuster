Hong Kong-based property firm, Wheelock, has announced that it is launching a search for a new partner following the exit of NatWest from their joint venture in fund management. The move comes as NatWest - formerly known as RBS - continues to reduce its presence in Asia.
Wheelock NatWest, an investment management company that was established in 2008, has managed over HKD 3.6 billion worth of assets in multiple funds including equity and real estate funds. However, with NatWest's exit, Wheelock intends to seek a replacement to maintain the continuity of the business.
"While we are sad to see NatWest leave, we understand their decision and are grateful for the valuable partnership that we have have had together," said Dickson Wong, CEO of Wheelock Capital Management. "We remain confident in the future of our investment management business and are actively looking for another partner who shares our vision and values."
The decision by NatWest to withdraw from its joint venture in Hong Kong is not surprising as the bank has been focusing on its core business in the UK. The move is also part of NatWest's overall strategy to simplify its operations and exit non-core businesses around the world.
The departure of NatWest will not have a significant impact on Wheelock's day-to-day business as the investment management company has been operating independently from NatWest for some time. The company has been taking active steps to ensure that the exit of their partner will not affect their existing clients or ongoing projects.
"We have already started the process of identifying and contacting potential partners for our fund management business," said Wong. "We are committed to ensuring a seamless transition and a continuation of the level of service our clients have come to expect from us."
The new partner will be expected to bring expertise and additional capital to help scale up Wheelock's business. The company has recently expanded their investment portfolio into the healthcare sector in Hong Kong and is looking to diversify their offerings in the region with the support of a new partner.
Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Wheelock remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of the investment management business in Hong Kong. The company has a strong track record in managing diversified portfolios for its clients and has been praised for its commitment to ethical and sustainable investments.
"We believe that there is still significant growth potential for our business in Hong Kong and the region," said Wong. "We are looking for a partner who shares our values and vision and can help us take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead."
The search for a new partner is expected to take several months, and both Wheelock and NatWest have expressed their commitment to ensuring a smooth transition for clients and employees during this period.
