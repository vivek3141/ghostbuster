Several prominent business groups in Hong Kong are pushing back against the idea of linking China's Most Favored Nation (MFN) status to Beijing's control of the city. The groups, including the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, argue that such a move would harm the city's economy and undermine its autonomy.
The issue has come to the fore in recent weeks as the United States has stepped up pressure on China over its treatment of Hong Kong. Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the U.S. would no longer treat Hong Kong as a separate entity from mainland China, and that it would impose sanctions on officials responsible for undermining Hong Kong's autonomy.
Some U.S. lawmakers have also proposed revoking China's MFN status, which would effectively end its favorable trade status with the U.S. and make it more difficult for Chinese companies to do business there. The idea has gained traction among some in Washington who believe that China's recent crackdown on Hong Kong is a violation of its obligations under the "one country, two systems" framework.
But Hong Kong's business groups have pushed back against the idea, arguing that it would be counterproductive and harmful to the city's economy. In a statement, the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce said that "any action that undermines the economic and trade ties between Hong Kong and the United States will inevitably have a negative impact on the economic well-being of Hong Kong."
The groups argue that Hong Kong has long served as a gateway for Chinese companies looking to do business in the West, and that any move to restrict trade with China would be a blow to the city's economy. They also say that the idea of revoking China's MFN status is flawed because it would punish ordinary Chinese people, who stand to benefit from increased trade with the U.S.
The controversy over China's MFN status comes at a time when Hong Kong is already grappling with the fallout from renewed political unrest. Protests erupted in the city last year over a proposed extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. The bill was later withdrawn, but the protests continued, with many calling for greater autonomy from Beijing.
In June, Beijing imposed a new security law on Hong Kong that critics say undermines the city's autonomy and restricts freedoms guaranteed under the "one country, two systems" framework. The move has sparked condemnation from the international community, with some countries imposing sanctions on Chinese officials.
For Hong Kong's business community, the controversy over China's MFN status is just the latest challenge in an already difficult year. The city's economy has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and many businesses are struggling to survive. With tensions between China and the U.S. showing no signs of easing, it remains to be seen how Hong Kong's business community will navigate the difficult waters ahead.
