Atlanta-based utility giant Southern Co has announced its acquisition of Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd, which is based in Hong Kong. The acquisition is a $2.7bn deal that will enable Southern Co to expand its operations both locally and internationally.
Southern Co is already one of the largest utility companies in the United States, with a market capitalization of over $63bn. The company operates in 17 states and has a customer base of over nine million. Its core businesses include electric power generation, transmission, and distribution, as well as natural gas distribution.
Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd, on the other hand, is known for its expertise in engineering and construction, as well as energy consultancy services. The company operates in several countries across Asia, including China, Indonesia, and the Philippines.
Through this acquisition, Southern Co will be able to leverage Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd's extensive network and expertise to expand its offerings and improve its global footprint. Southern Co CEO Tom Fanning expressed his excitement about the acquisition, stating that it would bring new opportunities for growth and innovation.
"Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd is an excellent fit for Southern Co," Fanning said in a press release. "We believe that together we will be able to deliver even more value to our customers and stakeholders, both in the United States and internationally."
The acquisition is expected to complement Southern Co's existing portfolio of power-generating assets and help facilitate its transition to a more diverse and sustainable energy mix. With the increasing demand for clean energy, the company is looking to expand its renewable energy portfolio, including wind, solar, and battery storage.
The acquisition comes at a time when Southern Co is focusing on modernizing its infrastructure and investing in new technologies that can help reduce carbon emissions and improve the reliability of its system. In 2020, Southern Co committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 50% below 2007 levels by 2030 and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Southern Co's acquisition of Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. Once the acquisition is completed, Southern Co will have significant opportunities to expand its business and generate long-term value for its stakeholders.
Through this acquisition, Southern Co is showing its commitment to growth and innovation, even as the utility industry faces increasing pressures to adapt to a changing energy landscape. As Southern Co sets its sights on a more sustainable and resilient future, the acquisition of Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd is a significant step forward in that direction.
