Hong Kong-based financial services firm Jardine Fleming Holdings has reiterated its commitment to regulatory compliance following an investigation by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) into allegations of front-running.
In a statement released yesterday, the firm said it had cooperated fully with the SFC's investigation and was pleased to have been cleared of any wrongdoing. However, it added that it would "continue to prioritize compliance and risk management in all aspects of our business."
Front-running is the practice of a broker trading in a security based on advanced knowledge of an impending transaction by a client. It is illegal in many jurisdictions, including Hong Kong.
The allegations against Jardine Fleming centered around a trade in Hong Kong-listed shares in August 2020. The SFC received information suggesting that Jardine Fleming had traded in the shares ahead of a large buy order from a client, potentially profiting from the price increase that would result from the order.
The SFC launched an investigation into the matter, which included a review of Jardine Fleming's policies and procedures around Chinese wall (the separation of different departments within a bank to prevent conflicts of interest). The regulator also interviewed staff members and reviewed trading records.
In its statement, Jardine Fleming emphasized that it had clear and robust policies and procedures in place to prevent front-running and other types of market abuse. The firm said it was "committed to maintaining a culture of compliance and ethical behavior" and would continue to invest in training and technology to support this.
Jardine Fleming's CEO, Michael Li, stressed that the firm's reputation for integrity and transparency was of paramount importance. "We take any allegation of impropriety very seriously and will always cooperate fully with regulators to ensure that the highest standards are maintained in our business," he said.
The SFC's investigation is part of a wider crackdown on market abuse in Hong Kong. The regulator has been taking a more aggressive approach to enforcement in recent years, with a particular focus on insider dealing and market manipulation.
Last year, the SFC fined Goldman Sachs HKD 350 million ($45 million) for its role in the 1MDB scandal, where the US bank's employees allegedly paid bribes to Malaysian officials in exchange for lucrative deals for the bank.
Hong Kong's financial market is heavily regulated, but there have been concerns in recent years about the effectiveness of the regulatory framework. The city's reputation as a financial hub has also been tarnished by political unrest and concerns about Beijing's influence.
Jardine Fleming's reiteration of its commitment to regulatory compliance is therefore timely, and may help to shore up confidence in Hong Kong's financial sector. The firm's statement suggests that it takes its responsibilities as a financial institution seriously, and is willing to invest in compliance measures to ensure that it meets the highest standards.
