NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of the UK-based NatWest Group, has announced it is acquiring Wheelock & Company Ltd's stake in their joint venture, with the transaction expected to be completed later this year. The acquisition will see NatWest Markets become the sole owner of the joint venture and marks a significant step in the bank's ambitions to expand its global presence in the financial markets.
The joint venture, which was formed in 2016, has been focused on providing financial and capital markets services in the Asia Pacific region. The partnership allowed both companies to leverage their respective strengths and expertise, with NatWest Markets bringing its experience in financial markets and Wheelock & Company Ltd providing its extensive network and regional knowledge.
However, the decision to acquire Wheelock & Company Ltd's stake in the joint venture was driven by NatWest Markets' strategic objectives and the opportunity to expand its business into the growing Asia Pacific region. The move aligns with the bank's goal of building a stronger, more diversified and sustainable business by investing in areas of growth and opportunity.
According to a statement by NatWest Markets, the acquisition of Wheelock & Company Ltd's stake in the joint venture will provide it with greater control over its business in the Asia Pacific region and enable it to invest further in the capabilities and resources needed to service its clients in the region. The acquisition, therefore, is expected to deliver significant growth to the bank and its clients as it enhances its ability to offer a wider range of financial products and services.
The acquisition will also enable NatWest Markets to strengthen its commitment to sustainability and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles. As part of the deal, NatWest Markets has committed to continuing to implement ESG policies and practices in the region, in line with its global sustainability strategy. It will also align with Wheelock & Company Ltd's strong ESG ethos, with the company being a well-respected leader in sustainability in the Asia Pacific region.
The acquisition of Wheelock & Company Ltd's stake in the joint venture is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in the second half of this year. The completion of the transaction will mark a significant milestone for NatWest Markets as it continues to execute its strategic plans and priorities. It also reinforces its commitment to expanding and strengthening its presence in key growth markets around the world.
In a statement, Johan Sehlin, Head of Asia Pacific at NatWest Markets, said: "This acquisition is an important step in our journey to build a stronger, more diverse and sustainable business. We are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and remain committed to delivering the best service and solutions to our clients in the region."
The acquisition of Wheelock & Company Ltd's stake in the joint venture will undoubtedly be a transformative moment for NatWest Markets as it seeks to build a stronger and more diversified business that can deliver for its clients in some of the world's fastest-growing and most dynamic markets. Its commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices will also ensure that it remains a leader in this field and is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for ESG-focused financial products and services.
