Indonesia's mutual funds industry is in dire need of government support to thrive, industry experts have said. According to them, the current business environment is stifling the growth of the industry, which has the potential to become a key pillar of the country's economy.
The recent pandemic has brought to the fore the importance of investment diversification among individuals, which is where mutual funds come into play. Mutual funds, which pool money from different investors to invest in a range of assets, are seen as a safer option than investing in individual stocks or bonds.
However, the mutual funds industry in Indonesia has failed to take off as expected due to various challenges. The industry currently accounts for only 2% of the country's capital market, compared to 20-30% in developed countries. Additionally, less than 1% of the country's population currently invests in mutual funds.
One of the major issues in the industry is the lack of investor awareness and trust. People are generally hesitant to invest in financial products due to a lack of understanding and the perception that they are risky. The government needs to step up its efforts to educate the public about the benefits of investing in mutual funds and how they can help grow their financial portfolios.
Another challenge is the regulatory environment. Indonesia's mutual fund industry is heavily regulated, which has made it difficult for companies to launch new funds or even make changes to existing ones. This has resulted in limited product offerings, which in turn has led to lower investor participation. The government needs to simplify the regulatory framework to encourage more players to enter the market and create innovative products for consumers.
Speaking about the need for government support, Agus Riyanto, Chairman of the Indonesian Mutual Funds Association, said, "The government should provide incentives to mutual fund managers who can deliver significantly better returns than market benchmarks. It can increase the thresholds for tax allowances for individual investors, provide tax incentives for mutual fund managers and reduce fees imposed by regulators."
Overall, there is immense potential for the mutual funds industry in Indonesia to flourish and contribute significantly to the economy. However, to achieve this, there needs to be concerted efforts from both the government and the industry players. With increased investor awareness, simplified regulations and government support, the mutual funds industry in Indonesia can become a major contributor to the country's economic growth.
