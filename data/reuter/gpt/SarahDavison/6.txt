Jakarta, Indonesia – A new cleansing process in Indonesia’s financial sector is paving the way for Islamic mutual funds to grow in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country.
The Indonesian financial sector regulator, the Financial Services Authority (OJK), recently announced a new set of policies aimed at improving Sharia compliance in the country’s banking and capital markets.
As part of these policies, OJK introduced a new system of certification for businesses and Sharia compliance experts, to ensure that all Islamic financial products in the country are fully compliant with Sharia principles.
This new system is already paying dividends for the country’s Islamic mutual fund industry. According to data from the OJK, assets under management in Sharia-compliant mutual funds grew by 34% in 2020, with total assets reaching IDR 33.9 trillion ($2.3 billion).
This growth was driven by a number of factors, including increased investor awareness of Islamic finance, greater demand for ethically responsible investments, and the fact that the new certification system is making it easier for investors to identify Sharia-compliant funds.
The OJK is also working to encourage further growth in the industry by developing new regulations that allow mutual funds to invest in a wider range of Sharia-compliant assets.
In the past, Islamic mutual funds in Indonesia were largely limited to investments in the country’s stock market, as there were limited opportunities to invest in other asset classes that met the strict criteria for Sharia compliance. However, OJK is now exploring the possibility of allowing mutual funds to invest in a wider range of Sharia-compliant assets, including commodities, real estate, and infrastructure.
This could open up a whole new range of investment opportunities for Sharia-compliant funds in Indonesia, allowing them to diversify their portfolios and attract more investors.
One of the key benefits of investing in Islamic mutual funds is their focus on ethical and socially responsible investing. Unlike conventional funds, which may invest in companies involved in activities such as gambling, alcohol, or tobacco, Islamic mutual funds are required to avoid any businesses that do not comply with Sharia principles.
This means that investors in Islamic mutual funds can be confident that their money is being invested in a way that aligns with their ethical and moral values.
The growth of Islamic mutual funds in Indonesia is also part of a wider trend in the global financial sector, as investors increasingly seek out ethically responsible investment options.
The global Islamic finance industry is expected to be worth $3.8 trillion by 2023, and Indonesia is well-positioned to be a major player in this market.
With a population of over 260 million, the country has the largest Muslim population in the world. This, combined with a rapidly-growing middle class and a strong appetite for Islamic finance, makes Indonesia a key market for the industry.
The growth of Islamic mutual funds in Indonesia is also part of a wider trend towards greater financial inclusion and democratization of the financial sector.
By making it easier for investors to access Sharia-compliant investment options, Indonesia is helping to open up the financial sector to a wider range of people, including those who may have previously been excluded from traditional financial services.
Overall, the growth of Islamic mutual funds in Indonesia is a positive sign for the country’s financial sector, and for the global Islamic finance industry as a whole.
As more investors become aware of the ethical and socially responsible nature of these funds, and as the industry continues to develop new investment opportunities and products, we are likely to see continued growth in the sector in the years to come.
