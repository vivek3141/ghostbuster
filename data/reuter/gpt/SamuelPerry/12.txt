Microsoft Corporation, the American technology giant, has launched an electronic commerce software and partner network for online shopping. The company announced its new products and services on Wednesday, August 25, 2021, in a bid to capture a growing market of online shoppers.
The electronic commerce software, called Dynamics 365 Commerce, is a cloud-based platform that enables businesses to manage their online stores, marketplaces, and in-store operations in one place. It integrates with other Microsoft products, such as Teams, Power Apps, and Power BI, to provide a seamless experience for retailers.
The Dynamics 365 Commerce software is designed to help retailers increase their sales, improve customer engagement, and streamline their operations. It enables retailers to create personalized shopping experiences for their customers, optimize their products and prices, and manage their inventory and logistics. It also provides real-time insights into sales and marketing performance, enabling retailers to make data-driven decisions.
The Dynamics 365 Commerce software is available in over 20 languages and has been designed to meet the needs of retailers of all sizes and types, from small businesses to large enterprises. The software includes features such as a point of sale system, a product catalog, a search engine, a shopping cart, and payment gateways.
Alongside the Dynamics 365 Commerce software, Microsoft has also launched a partner network for online shopping. The partner network is designed to connect retailers with other businesses that can support their online operations, such as payment providers, logistics companies, and marketing agencies.
The partner network is open to businesses of all sizes and types and allows retailers to access a range of services, including payment processing, fraud prevention, shipping and fulfillment, digital marketing, and customer service. The partner network is expected to expand over time, with more businesses joining as Microsoft develops new partnerships.
In a press release, Alysa Taylor, Corporate Vice President of Business Applications and Global Industry at Microsoft, said: "Online shopping is a growing market, and retailers need the right tools and partners to compete effectively. Our new software and partner network are designed to help businesses of all sizes and types to grow their online sales and engage with their customers in new ways."
The launch of the Dynamics 365 Commerce software and partner network comes at a time of rapid growth in online shopping. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift towards online retail, with many consumers choosing to shop online rather than in physical stores. According to eMarketer, online shopping in the United States grew by 32.4% in 2020 and is expected to continue to grow in the coming years.
Microsoft's new products and services are likely to be welcomed by retailers looking to improve their online operations. The Dynamics 365 Commerce software provides a range of features that will help retailers to manage their online stores more effectively, while the partner network offers access to a range of third-party services that can help retailers to improve their customer experience and grow their sales.
Microsoft's move into the electronic commerce market is also likely to drive competition among other technology companies, such as Amazon, Shopify, and Salesforce. These companies have already established themselves as leaders in the online shopping market, and Microsoft's entry could lead to more innovation and new solutions for retailers.
In conclusion, Microsoft's launch of the Dynamics 365 Commerce software and partner network for online shopping is a significant move into the growing online retail market. The new products and services provide retailers with a range of tools and partners to help them manage their online operations more effectively and grow their sales. As online shopping continues to grow, Microsoft's entry into the market is likely to drive competition and innovation, benefiting retailers and consumers alike.
