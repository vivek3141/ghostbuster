Hewlett-Packard (HP) has announced that it is set to unveil a new device that is aimed at revolutionizing the way people copy documents. This new device, which HP is calling the "Copy Exterminator," uses advanced technology to copy documents without the need for a separate copy machine. 
According to HP, the Copy Exterminator is a small device that is designed to be used with any standard printer. The device connects to a user's computer or mobile device through a USB port, and allows the user to quickly and easily scan documents and convert them into digital files that can be saved or shared. 
The Copy Exterminator is designed to be especially useful for businesses and organizations that rely heavily on copying documents. With the new device, these businesses will no longer need to invest in expensive copy machines or pay for costly copying services. Instead, they can simply use the Copy Exterminator to quickly and easily scan documents and create digital copies that can be shared with colleagues and clients. 
One of the key features of the Copy Exterminator is its speed. According to HP, the device is capable of scanning and digitizing a document in just seconds, making it faster and more efficient than traditional copy machines. Additionally, the device is easy to use and requires no special training or expertise. 
In a statement, HP's CEO Meg Whitman said that the Copy Exterminator is just one example of the company's commitment to innovation and to providing solutions that make life easier for people and businesses. "At HP, we are always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what is possible," she said. "The Copy Exterminator is just one example of how we are using advanced technology to solve everyday problems and make life easier for our customers." 
The Copy Exterminator is set to be unveiled at a special event in New York City later this month. HP has not yet announced pricing or availability for the device, but it is expected to be released in the coming months. 
Early reviews of the Copy Exterminator have been overwhelmingly positive, with many users praising its ease of use, speed, and efficiency. Some industry experts have even predicted that the device could completely revolutionize the way people think about copying documents, and could eventually render traditional copy machines obsolete. 
Overall, the announcement of the Copy Exterminator represents a major step forward for HP and for the technology industry as a whole. By using advanced technology to solve everyday problems, HP is proving that innovation is still alive and well in the tech world, and that there is always room for more game-changing products and solutions.
