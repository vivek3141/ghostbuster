Nolan Bushnell, the founder of legendary video game company Atari, is looking to make a big comeback with his new venture, which is set to launch high-tech jukeboxes and video games in public places that are connected to the internet. The ambitious project aims to disrupt the music and gaming industries by offering a new way for people to interact with each other and their favorite game titles.
The new company, called X2 Games, was founded by Bushnell and his partners to explore the potential of technology to create immersive gaming experiences that engage people in new ways. According to Bushnell, X2 Games' jukeboxes and video games will have the ability to connect people in public spaces, creating new forms of social interaction and entertainment.
The jukeboxes will be interactive, allowing users to choose from a wide range of music genres and artists, as well as offering video content and interactive games. The machines will be connected to the internet, allowing users to access social media and other online features while they enjoy their music and entertainment. The games, on the other hand, will be based on popular titles from the video game industry, such as Pac-Man, Space Invaders, and Missile Command.
The new machines are expected to be installed in public places such as shopping malls, movie theaters, and theme parks, providing a fun and engaging way for people to spend their leisure time. X2 Games is also looking to partner with music labels and video game publishers to offer exclusive content and titles to its customers.
"We are extremely excited about the potential of these new machines, which we believe will revolutionize the way people interact with each other and their favorite music and games," said Bushnell. "By combining the benefits of technology and entertainment, we aim to make billions of dollars in revenue and create a new form of social interaction that will bring people together in public places."
The X2 Games team is made up of experienced video game designers, developers, and business executives who have worked on some of the most successful video game franchises in history. Some of the team members include Zai Ortiz, an award-winning game designer, and Scott Brown, a former executive at Electronic Arts, one of the biggest video game companies in the world.
The company has already secured funding from venture capitalists and private investors, and is working on developing prototypes of its new machines. The first machines are expected to be available for purchase by the end of this year, with installation planned for early 2022.
Industry experts believe that X2 Games has the potential to disrupt the traditional music and gaming industries by offering a new way for people to engage with these forms of entertainment. The machines could also provide a new revenue stream for public spaces such as shopping malls, which have been struggling to attract customers in recent years.
"While there is always a risk in launching a new product in an already crowded market, Nolan Bushnell has a proven track record of success in the gaming industry," said Steve Bailey, an analyst at IHS Markit. "If X2 Games can deliver on its promise of offering a unique and interactive experience, then it could create a new market that will have significant potential for growing revenue."
For Bushnell, the new venture is a chance to make a big impact on the world of entertainment, just like he did when he co-founded Atari over 40 years ago. His vision for X2 Games is to create a new standard for social interaction and entertainment, using technology to bring people together in new and exciting ways.
"We want to inspire people to connect with each other in public places, to have fun and engage with their favorite music and games," said Bushnell. "By offering a new way for people to interact with each other and their surroundings, we hope to create a new culture of social interaction that will change the world."
