The tech industry in Silicon Valley has long been known for its innovation, entrepreneurship, and for playing a major role in driving the American economy. But now, the region has taken on a new identity - a political one.
It all started with the US Presidential elections of 2016, which shocked Silicon Valley to its core. The election of Donald Trump, who made no secret of his disdain for the tech industry and its liberal values, caused a wave of anxiety and fear to grip tech executives and venture capitalists (VCs) in the region.
This anxiety has only grown since Trump was impeached, and lately, as he has ramped up his attacks on the industry. Now, Silicon Valley is fighting back against what it sees as a significant threat to the American economy.
At the center of this political shift is a group called Tech for Campaigns. The organization was founded in 2017 by former Clinton campaign staffers, Jessica Alter and Ian Shakil, and has been working to get technology companies more involved in political campaigns.
Tech for Campaigns aims to harness the power of Silicon Valley to help Democratic candidates and progressive causes by providing them with cutting-edge digital tools and data analytics. By doing so, it hopes to level the playing field against the well-funded Republican campaigns and political action committees (PACs).
The response from Silicon Valley has been remarkable. For the first time, tech executives and VCs are speaking out publicly against government policies that they believe are contrary to their best interests. They are pumping millions of dollars into political campaigns and PACs, and are even seriously considering entering the political arena themselves.
Leading the political charge is Y Combinator, a startup accelerator that has produced some of the biggest names in tech, including Airbnb, Dropbox, and Reddit. Y Combinator has announced a new political action committee called YC PAC, which it says will focus on "providing funding, mentorship, and support to candidates and campaigns that are aligned with Y Combinator's values."
Other prominent tech companies that have thrown their weight behind political activism include Apple, Salesforce, and Airbnb. Apple recently pledged $100 million to a new Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, while Airbnb has committed to providing housing to 100,000 refugees and displaced people by 2022.
Meanwhile, Salesforce founder, Marc Benioff, has taken an even bolder step by purchasing Time magazine for $190 million. The move has been interpreted by some as an attempt to create a media platform that can counter the right-wing propaganda that is fueling Trump's campaign.
At the heart of these efforts is a deep-seated fear that the principles of American capitalism are under threat. Silicon Valley has long been seen as the epitome of the innovation-driven, free market approach to capitalism that has defined America's economic success for the past century.
But now, many tech executives and VCs fear that this way of life is being eroded by government policies that are hostile to their industry. This includes proposed changes to the H-1B visa program, which many tech companies rely on to attract top talent from overseas, and the rolling back of net neutrality regulations that protect an open and fair internet.
There is also a broader concern among Silicon Valley insiders that the US is losing its edge in the global technology race. China, in particular, has emerged as a formidable challenger to American dominance in tech, thanks to its massive population, strong government support, and a rapidly growing pool of highly skilled workers.
This has led some tech executives to argue that the US needs a more active government role in supporting innovation, rather than simply standing back and letting the market do its work.
One such executive is David Cohen, CEO of the venture capital firm Techstars. Writing in a recent op-ed for Forbes, Cohen argued that the US needs "bold, strategic investments in innovation" if it is going to stay ahead of global competitors like China.
These investments, he said, should come from the government and should be focused on high-risk, high-reward technologies like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and biotechnology.
It remains to be seen whether Silicon Valley's newfound political energy will translate into a significant shift in policy. But for now, it is clear that the industry's leaders are taking their role as political actors with increasing seriousness, and that they are no longer willing to sit on the sidelines while their interests are threatened.
