Redmond, Washington - Microsoft Corporation has decided to take on giants like Amazon and Alibaba. They plan to make it easier for retailers to sell their products directly to consumers using Microsoft's new electronic commerce software. The company recently announced the launch of its Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce. The software aims to empower retailers with a unified solution that will provide them with the ability to better manage the backend logistics of their business while still being able to offer personalized customer experiences.
Microsoft is partnering with a number of retailers and brands, including Louis Vuitton, Walgreens Boots Alliance, and Exxon Mobil, to name a few. The company wants to leverage its partnerships with retailers and brands in order to push the adoption of its new e-commerce technology.
Microsoft's Dynamics 365 Commerce platform is the perfect technology for retailers who want to unify their digital and physical channels. The platform makes the overall shopping experience seamless and transparent for customers and retailers alike. The platform integrates with a range of other popular Microsoft products like Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, and Microsoft Teams, streamlining business activities.
“The shift to a more digital commerce landscape has only accelerated over the past year,” Alysa Taylor, Microsoft Corporate Vice President, Business Applications, said in an interview. “There is a need for a more intelligent transaction fulfillment engine that helps retailers manage business-to-business and business-to-consumer commerce on a single platform. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce is the only retail platform that delivers a full range of capabilities in a single cloud solution, empowering retailers to deliver personalized, differentiated experiences that increase customer loyalty and business profits."
Microsoft is targeting both small and large scale retailers heading into the holiday season. According to a recent Salesforce research report, 70 percent of U.S. consumers plan to do most of their holiday shopping online this year. This makes it an ideal time for Microsoft to launch this new platform.
"Our partnership with Microsoft will help us to ensure our product selection continues to meet the diverse needs of our customers while giving them a superior and personal online shopping experience", said Carrie Gray, Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President at CVS Health. "Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce will allow us to integrate online and physical store experiences, enabling us to personalize our customer experiences even more."
The new software also comes with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, which allows retailers to offer personalized recommendations for products based on customer behavior. Retailers can also use this technology to enable a more seamless shopping experience for their customers. For example, they can use the AI technology to empower customers to complete purchases on their system without leaving a brand's site.
Microsoft also launched additional features that augments its Dynamics 365 for Retail e-commerce technology with the new Fraud Protection service and plans for a tighter integration with Adobe Experience Manager. The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection service helps retailers manage fraud and risk prevention. This technology will eliminate shipping fraud, account fraud, and account takeover activities that can be a struggle for retailers to manage. The retail-dedicated machine learning technology is built to encode data from retailers with contextual information.
Microsoft plans to continue expanding their partnerships with retailers and brands to further entrench Dynamics 365 Commerce in the market, while actively pushing for better online shopping experiences for consumers.
