Minneapolis-based retailer Dayton Hudson Corp. reported strong third-quarter results on Tuesday, indicating a promising holiday season for retailers. The company, which operates Target and Mervyn's department stores, saw earnings of $457 million, or 76 cents a share, up from $388 million, or 64 cents a share, the previous year.
The figures beat analysts' expectations, and were attributed to strong sales across all of Dayton Hudson's divisions, including its newer Marshall Field's chain. "We are very pleased with our third-quarter results, which reflect the progress we continue to make in our strategic initiatives," said Bob Ulrich, Dayton Hudson's chairman and CEO, in a statement.
One of the key drivers of Dayton Hudson's strong performance was its Target discount stores, which saw a 5.9% increase in sales at stores open at least a year, a key measure of retail health. Target has been investing heavily in its stores and e-commerce capabilities, and has been gaining market share from traditional retailers.
Meanwhile, Mervyn's saw a 2.4% increase in same-store sales, while Marshall Field's saw a 2.5% increase. Dayton Hudson's credit card business also saw strong growth, with profits up 25% from the previous year.
The strong results come as retailers gear up for what is expected to be a highly competitive holiday season. With Thanksgiving falling later than usual and a shorter period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, retailers are hoping to get a jump on sales with early deals and promotions.
Target is among the retailers that have already begun offering holiday discounts, with an early Black Friday sale on Nov. 8-9. The company is also offering free two-day shipping with no minimum purchase through Dec. 21, and has promised to match competitors' prices on items from Nov. 1 through Dec. 21.
In addition to its early holiday offerings, Target has been investing in new store formats and products as it seeks to differentiate itself from competitors. The company has been testing a smaller format called TargetExpress, which features a curated selection of merchandise and caters to urban customers. It has also been expanding its private label offerings, with new brands like Goodfellow & Co., a menswear line.
Mervyn's, which Dayton Hudson acquired in 1995, has had a more difficult time in recent years, with declining sales and store closures. But the company has been investing in the chain, renovating many of its stores and expanding its e-commerce capabilities. Dayton Hudson has also been investing in its credit card business, which it owns jointly with JPMorgan Chase.
Overall, Dayton Hudson's strong third-quarter results bode well for the retail industry, which has been struggling in recent years amid the rise of e-commerce and changing shopper habits. "Dayton Hudson's results are a good sign for the retail industry as a whole," said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, in a statement. "Although there is still much uncertainty in the sector, positive momentum is building and retailers which invest in the right things are beginning to see some rewards."
