H&R Block, the US tax preparation company, is having difficulties with spinning off CompuServe, its online service. The move is intended to boost the company's performance, which has been weighed down by decreasing demand for tax preparation services in recent years.
CompuServe, which was once a major internet service provider, has been struggling to compete with other online services like Google and Yahoo. H&R Block has been trying to sell the business for some time, but has been thwarted by the lack of interested buyers.
The company's latest effort to spin off CompuServe has been complicated by the online service's poor financial performance. According to sources familiar with the matter, CompuServe has been losing customers at a significant rate, and is projected to lose money for the foreseeable future.
H&R Block's management team is said to be considering various options, including a partial spin-off or a sale to a private equity firm. The company is expected to make a decision on the future of CompuServe in the coming months.
The struggles with CompuServe come at a time when H&R Block is facing increasing competition from new players in the tax preparation industry. Online tax services like TurboTax and TaxAct have been eating into the company's market share, forcing H&R Block to shift its focus to other areas like financial advisory and insurance services.
Despite these challenges, H&R Block remains one of the largest tax preparation firms in the US, with over 10,000 offices across the country. The company has been expanding its services in recent years to include wealth management, mortgage lending, and personal finance advice, with mixed success.
In its most recent financial results, H&R Block reported a $630 million loss for the fiscal year ending in April 2020, due in part to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the US economy. The company has since rebounded somewhat, with a profit of $216 million in the first quarter of 2021.
Analysts suggest that H&R Block needs to find a way to cultivate more long-term relationships with customers, rather than relying on one-time tax preparation fees. The company's CEO, Jeff Jones, has hinted at plans to shift towards more personalized, year-round financial services that could help build customer loyalty over time.
Despite the challenges facing H&R Block, the company remains committed to its mission of providing trusted financial advice to Americans. The fate of CompuServe may be uncertain, but the company's leadership is determined to find new and innovative ways to serve its customers in an ever-changing market.
