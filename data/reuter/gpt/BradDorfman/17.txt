AMSTERDAM – The Netherlands-based bank, ABN AMRO, has announced plans to acquire Standard Federal Bancorp in a deal valued at $1.9 billion, propelling the bank into becoming the eighth largest mortgage originator in the United States.
The acquisition, set to be finalized by the end of the year, is a strategic move by ABN AMRO to expand its mortgage business in the United States. The bank already has a strong presence in the region with over 30 branches across 13 states.
Standard Federal Bancorp, based in Michigan, has assets worth $13.6 billion and 96 branches across the Midwest region of the United States. With its acquisition, ABN AMRO will have access to a wider customer base, enabling it to offer a broader range of financial services.
“Acquiring Standard Federal Bancorp is a significant step forward for our mortgage business in the United States. It will give us access to a wider customer base and also strengthen our network of branches in the region,” said Kees van Dijkhuizen, CEO of ABN AMRO.
Van Dijkhuizen also added that the acquisition is in line with the bank’s strategy to expand its mortgage business internationally, particularly in mature markets like the United States.
“This acquisition represents a great opportunity for ABN AMRO to further expand its mortgage business in the United States,” he said. “Our strategy for growth is to focus on mature markets where we expect strong growth opportunities.”
ABN AMRO has been targeting growth in its mortgage business for several years. The bank has been investing heavily in technology, particularly in digitizing the loan origination process, to enhance customer experience and reduce processing time.
The bank has also been expanding its distribution channels, such as online platforms and third-party mortgage brokers, to reach more customers. In 2020, ABN AMRO’s mortgage business accounted for 17% of its total income, up from 14% in 2019.
The acquisition of Standard Federal Bancorp is expected to strengthen ABN AMRO’s position as a leading mortgage lender in the United States. According to data from Inside Mortgage Finance, ABN AMRO currently ranks 14th in the United States in terms of mortgage lending.
The acquisition also comes at a time when the US housing market is booming. Despite the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for housing has remained strong, with record-low mortgage rates fueling a surge in home purchases and refinancing.
The US housing market is expected to remain strong in the foreseeable future, driven by low-interest rates, high demand, and tight supply. ABN AMRO will be well-positioned to capitalize on this trend with its expanded mortgage business.
The acquisition of Standard Federal Bancorp is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. Once completed, ABN AMRO will have a solid foothold in the Midwest region of the United States, enabling it to compete with other major mortgage lenders in the region.
ABN AMRO has been expanding its mortgage business internationally in recent years, with a particular focus on mature markets like the United States. The acquisition of Standard Federal Bancorp is a big step forward for the bank’s mortgage business in the United States and is expected to drive its growth in the region for years to come.
