H&R Block Inc. reported a big loss in its latest quarter due to the struggles of its subsidiary, CompuServe. The tax preparation company posted a net loss of $152 million, or $0.72 per share, for the quarter ended January 31, 2021. This is a significant decrease from the $166 million in net income, or $0.80 per share, reported in the same quarter last year.
CompuServe, a pioneer in the online service industry, has been struggling to keep pace with newer, more modern platforms. The company provides internet services to businesses and consumers primarily in central Ohio, but has not been able to gain a foothold in the competitive market.
H&R Block acquired CompuServe in 1998, and the unit has been losing money for years. In December 2020, H&R Block announced it would sell its subsidiary, but has yet to find a buyer. The struggling unit has been a drag on H&R Block's overall performance, as evident in its latest financial results.
The tax preparation company said it had a total revenue of $3.1 billion for Q3 2021, a slight increase from $3 billion in the same quarter last year. H&R Block's tax services revenues were up by 8%, primarily due to the extended tax season, which started on February 12 this year, instead of January 27. The company's software revenues saw a 4% decrease for the quarter.
Despite the revenue increase, the company's net loss was driven by a $300 million non-cash impairment charge related to the CompuServe unit. H&R Block said it took the charge due to an ongoing assessment of the fair value of the subsidiary.
H&R Block's CEO, Jeff Jones, admitted that the performance of the CompuServe unit was "disappointing". He said the company remained committed to finding a buyer and ending the unit's drag on the company's overall performance.
"We continue to focus on driving growth in our core businesses while taking strategic steps to address areas that have been a drag on results," Jones said in a statement. "The decision to divest CompuServe was the right one for the long-term success of our company, and we remain committed to completing the process."
H&R Block's Q3 earnings report follows a challenging year for the company, which has been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic downturn. The tax preparation company, which relies on in-person services, faced a decline in customers due to the pandemic's social distancing measures.
In response, H&R Block expanded its digital services, including offering virtual tax preparation services. The company also partnered with Walmart to offer its services at the retailer's stores, increasing its reach and accessibility.
The extended tax season, which gives taxpayers until May 17 to file their taxes, provides additional time for H&R Block to recover from the pandemic's impact. The company said it was optimistic about the future, citing the increasing demand for its digital and virtual services.
"H&R Block is well-positioned to capitalize on the significant opportunity presented by the evolving tax industry," Jones said. "We believe our investments in technology and the expansion of our virtual capabilities will enable us to capture market share and continue to drive growth over the long-term."
The tax preparation company's shares fell by 2.6% to $22.90 in after-hours trading following the earnings report's release. Despite its struggles with CompuServe, H&R Block remains committed to its core business while continuing to adapt to meet the demands of the changing tax industry.
