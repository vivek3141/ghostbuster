As the sun began to rise on the Friday morning after Thanksgiving, crowds of eager shoppers were already gathered outside of retail stores across the country. From electronics to clothing to home goods, shoppers set their sights on snagging the best deals and kicking off the holiday shopping season.
This annual tradition, known as Black Friday, has become a staple of American consumer culture. Stores often offer significant discounts on highly sought-after items, drawing in throngs of shoppers who are willing to brave the long lines and early wake-up calls in order to save big.
In New York City, shoppers began lining up outside of the flagship Macy's store in Herald Square as early as 4 a.m. The store opened its doors at 5 a.m., and the crush of shoppers that poured inside was overwhelming. "It's crazy in there," said one shopper, who had been waiting in line for over an hour. "But the deals are worth it."
At Best Buy locations across the country, shoppers camped out overnight in order to be first in line when the doors opened at 6 a.m. "I've been here since yesterday afternoon, but it's totally worth it," said one shopper, who was hoping to score a discounted 65-inch television.
The scene was similar at malls and shopping centers around the country, with lines snaking out of stores and into parking lots. Some retailers, such as Walmart and Target, even opened their doors on Thanksgiving Day itself, giving shoppers a head start on their Black Friday shopping.
For many people, Black Friday shopping is as much of a tradition as turkey dinner on Thanksgiving. "It's just something we do every year," said one shopper outside of a Target store in St. Paul, Minnesota. "It's a fun way to kick off the holiday season."
But not everyone is a fan of the annual shopping frenzy. Critics argue that the consumerism of Black Friday has overshadowed the true meaning of the holiday season. Rather than focusing on family, friends, and giving back to those in need, they say, Americans have become obsessed with buying more and more stuff.
"The rampant consumerism of Black Friday is a disturbing trend," said one commentator. "It's a sad reflection of how materialistic our society has become."
Others have pointed out the negative impact that Black Friday can have on workers. Many retail employees are required to work long hours, often without overtime pay or other benefits. In recent years, some workers have organized protests against this trend, calling for better wages and working conditions for those in the retail industry.
Despite these concerns, however, Black Friday remains as popular as ever. According to a survey conducted by the National Retail Federation, an estimated 165 million Americans planned to shop over the course of the Thanksgiving weekend, with an average of $313 spent per person.
For retailers, this annual shopping extravaganza is an opportunity to boost their bottom line and kick off the holiday season with a bang. "Black Friday is our biggest day of the year," said one store manager. "We've been preparing for this for months."
In order to stay competitive, many retailers have extended their Black Friday deals throughout the entire weekend and even into Cyber Monday, the online shopping holiday that takes place on the Monday after Thanksgiving. This year, online sales are expected to grow even more rapidly than in years past, with an estimated $9.4 billion spent on Cyber Monday alone.
In the end, the success or failure of Black Friday often comes down to the deals on offer. For many shoppers, the allure of deep discounts on popular items is simply too much to resist. Come rain or shine, they'll be lining up outside of stores early next Black Friday morning, eagerly awaiting the chance to score a bargain.
