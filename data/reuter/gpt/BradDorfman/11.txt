Meredith Corp CEO, William T. Kerr, has announced plans to acquire more television stations in 1997 due to a decline in prices. While this move may surprise some, Kerr believes that it is an opportune time for his company to expand its reach.
In recent years, the cost of owning and operating television stations has been on the rise. However, Kerr's team has noted a decrease in prices over the past few months. With this in mind, Kerr plans to take advantage of the current market conditions to acquire new television stations that will help expand the company's profile.
Meredith Corp is a leading media and marketing company that specializes in publishing, broadcasting, and marketing services for various industries. The company currently owns and operates 17 television stations across the country, including CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox affiliates.
Kerr believes that the acquisition of more stations will give Meredith Corp a stronger presence in the broadcasting industry. He is confident that the company can successfully navigate the challenges that come with owning and operating television stations, and believes this move will be beneficial for both the company and its clients.
"Our goal is to find television stations that complement our existing portfolio and give us an even stronger platform for providing our advertising and marketing services to clients," Kerr said in a recent statement. "We are excited about the opportunity to expand our reach and build on our success to date."
While the exact number of stations Meredith Corp plans to acquire has not been disclosed, industry analysts predict that the company will likely pursue deals that are around $100 million or less. This is a significant decrease from typical acquisition prices in the past.
In addition to its television station acquisitions, Kerr is also exploring other ways to expand Meredith Corp's reach in the media industry. This includes partnerships with other media companies and increasing the company's digital presence.
Despite some uncertainty in the industry due to the rise of streaming services and changes in consumer viewing habits, Kerr remains optimistic about the future of television broadcasting and Meredith Corp's ability to weather any potential storms.
"We believe there is still a significant opportunity for growth in the television industry, and we are committed to staying at the forefront of these changes," he said. "With our long history of success and our talented team, we are confident that we can continue to lead the way in providing high-quality content and advertising opportunities for our clients."
As the year progresses, it will be interesting to see how Meredith Corp's acquisition plans unfold and how they will impact the company's overall strategy. For now, Kerr and his team are focused on positioning the company for long-term success in the ever-changing media landscape.
