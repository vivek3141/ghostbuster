Caterpillar Inc. has reported a record third-quarter profit, beating Wall Street expectations. The construction and mining equipment company announced on Tuesday that it earned $2.66 billion, or $4.61 a share, in the quarter ending September, up from $1.49 billion, or $2.66 a share, in the same period last year.
The better-than-expected results were driven by strong demand for its products and services in North America and China. Caterpillar's revenue rose 20% to $13.5 billion in the quarter, up from $11.2 billion in the same period last year.
"Our dedicated team of employees, dealers and suppliers are executing our strategy with discipline and urgency to improve the safety, quality, delivery and cost of our products and services," said Jim Umpleby, Caterpillar's chief executive officer. "As a result, we are delivering exceptional value to our customers and achieving record financial results."
Caterpillar's robust performance came despite ongoing supply chain disruptions and rising costs for raw materials and transportation. The company said it is taking steps to mitigate these challenges, including improving internal processes and working closely with suppliers.
"We are doing everything we can to minimize the impact of these external factors on our business and customers," Umpleby said on a conference call with analysts.
Caterpillar's stock price surged more than 3% in pre-market trading on Tuesday following the earnings announcement. The company's shares have risen about 55% this year, far outpacing the broader market.
Analysts attributed Caterpillar's strong performance to several factors, including a rebound in demand for construction and mining equipment, increased spending on infrastructure projects, and the company's efforts to streamline operations and cut costs.
"Overall, it was a great quarter for Caterpillar," said David Raso, an analyst with Evercore ISI. "The company is firing on all cylinders, with strong demand, solid margins, and a strong balance sheet."
Caterpillar's earnings were also buoyed by its services business, which provides maintenance, repair, and rental services for its equipment. The unit saw revenue increase by 14% in the quarter, driven by higher rental volume and increased demand for parts and services.
Looking ahead, Caterpillar said it expects strong demand for its products and services to continue, driven by ongoing investments in infrastructure and construction projects around the world. The company also raised its full-year earnings outlook, noting that it expects to generate higher revenue and profit margins than previously forecast.
"We are confident in our ability to deliver strong financial performance in the future," Umpleby said. "We are investing in key growth areas and continuing to improve our operations to deliver value to our stakeholders."
Caterpillar's success is a positive sign for the broader economy, which has been unevenly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. While some industries, such as construction and manufacturing, have seen a surge in demand, others, such as hospitality and retail, have struggled.
The company's earnings report is also likely to please investors, who have been increasingly focused on corporate sustainability and social responsibility. Caterpillar highlighted its efforts to reduce emissions and improve the sustainability of its operations in its earnings release, signaling a commitment to environmental and social goals.
As the world continues to navigate the ongoing pandemic and the challenges it presents, Caterpillar's success is a reminder of the importance of innovation, collaboration, and adaptability in driving economic growth and creating value for all stakeholders.
