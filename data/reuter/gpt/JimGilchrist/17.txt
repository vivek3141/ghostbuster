British Airways has announced plans to increase air cargo capacity on its shorter Hong Kong-London route via China. The move is expected to boost trade between China and the UK amid a surge in demand for air cargo services.
The new service will start in June, with the airline offering daily flights from Hong Kong to London via Shanghai. The route will be operated by a Boeing 777-300 aircraft with a capacity to carry up to 25 tonnes of cargo.
British Airways said in a statement that the additional cargo capacity would benefit businesses across both the UK and China, allowing them to transport goods quickly and efficiently between the two countries.
The route also has the potential to increase connectivity to other destinations in Europe and North America, offering businesses in Asia greater access to global markets.
The move comes as air cargo volumes have surged, with many airlines ramping up services to meet increased demand amid the pandemic-fuelled e-commerce boom.
British Airwaysâ€™ decision to increase capacity on the Hong Kong-London route will put it in direct competition with other airlines, including Cathay Pacific, which currently dominates the route.
However, the move is expected to be welcomed by businesses, particularly those in the fashion and electronics industries, which have been hit hard by supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic.
