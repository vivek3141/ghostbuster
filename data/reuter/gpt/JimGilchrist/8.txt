U-Freight Holdings, a leading international freight forwarding and logistics company, is planning to establish a new office in Guangzhou, China, to take advantage of China Southern Airlines' expanding network.
According to sources, the new office would be strategically located near the Baiyun International Airport, which is China Southern's hub in Guangzhou, to provide better access to the carrier's domestic and international routes.
With China Southern's strong presence in the Asia-Pacific region and its growing route network, U-Freight Holdings is looking to expand its business in the region.
"We see tremendous opportunities in the market, especially with China Southern's expanding network and our expertise in freight forwarding and logistics. Our new office in Guangzhou will enable us to serve our clients more efficiently and effectively," said Simon Wong, CEO of U-Freight Holdings.
Wong added that the company's expansion in China is in line with its long-term strategy to strengthen its presence in the Asia-Pacific region.
"We believe that China is a key market for us, and we are committed to investing in the country's logistics sector. With our new office in Guangzhou, we will be able to tap into the growing demand for international freight forwarding and logistics services," he said.
The move comes as China's logistics industry continues to grow rapidly, with strong demand for services from both domestic and international customers.
According to a report by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, the country's logistics industry revenue grew by 4.7% year-on-year in 2020, despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
In addition, China's Belt and Road Initiative has led to increased investment in infrastructure projects, which is expected to fuel demand for logistics services in the region.
U-Freight Holdings, which has been operating in China for over 20 years, currently has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Xiamen.
The company's new office in Guangzhou is expected to be operational by the second quarter of 2022.
