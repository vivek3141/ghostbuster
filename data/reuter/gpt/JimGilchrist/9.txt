Salomon Brothers, a leading global investment bank, has predicted "phenomenal" growth for Thai Airways International (THAI), the flag carrier airline of Thailand. The bank analysts have also recommended that THAI should focus on expanding its cargo business, which has been a key driver of the airline's revenue amid the pandemic.
According to the research note by Salomon Brothers, THAI has the potential to emerge as a leading airline in the region with its strong brand recognition, extensive route network, and efficient cost structure. The analysts expect the airline to benefit from the growing demand for air travel in the Asia Pacific region, driven by the expanding middle class, rising tourism, and improving business sentiment.
In addition to the passenger business, the bank analysts see significant opportunities for THAI to further develop its cargo business, which has been a bright spot in an otherwise challenging year for the airline industry. With the global logistics industry undergoing a transformational shift towards e-commerce and digitalization, there is a growing demand for fast, reliable, and efficient delivery of goods across borders.
Salomon Brothers expects that THAI's cargo business will continue to benefit from the strong demand for medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, and other essential goods during the pandemic. The bank analysts also highlight the potential for THAI to partner with logistics companies and e-commerce platforms to tap into the growing cross-border trade and online shopping.
"The cargo business has been a stronghold for THAI, and we believe that the airline can further leverage this business to enhance its competitiveness and profitability," said the lead analyst of Salomon Brothers' research note.
The bank analysts' prediction comes as THAI is undergoing a major restructuring process following its filing for bankruptcy protection in May 2020. The airline has been struggling with financial losses, high debts, and management issues in recent years, exacerbated by the COVID-19 crisis. Under the rehabilitation plan approved by the bankruptcy court, THAI aims to reduce its costs, improve its operational efficiency, and restructure its debt.
The Salomon Brothers' research note could provide THAI with a much-needed boost in confidence and investor interest. The airline's stock price has been under pressure in the past year, reflecting the challenging operating conditions and the uncertainty surrounding its future. However, if THAI can execute its turnaround plan successfully and capitalize on the growth opportunities in the passenger and cargo markets, it could emerge as a stronger and more resilient airline in the post-pandemic era.
