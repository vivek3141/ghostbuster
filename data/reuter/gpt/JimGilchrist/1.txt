Dragonair, the Hong Kong-based regional airline, announced its plans to purchase two new Airbus A321neo aircraft and lease another one to meet the increasing demand for its China routes. The company said that the new planes would replace the older ones in its existing fleet and help serve the growing passenger traffic in the region.
According to Dragonair’s CEO, the company has been experiencing strong demand for its China routes, especially from the southern and central regions of the country. The new planes are expected to increase capacity and improve the overall customer experience on these routes. Moreover, the A321neo is known for its fuel efficiency and advanced technology, which will help reduce the airline’s operating costs.
The two new planes will be delivered in 2022 and 2023, respectively and will be equipped with the latest inflight entertainment systems and comfortable seats. The leased aircraft will be delivered in 2022 and will also be an A321neo.
Dragonair currently operates a fleet of 48 aircraft, including 23 A320s and 10 A321s. However, with the addition of the new planes and the retirement of the older ones, the company will have a more modern and efficient fleet to serve its customers.
The airline’s decision to invest in new aircraft comes amid a slowdown in the global aviation industry due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to a significant decline in air travel demand. However, some airlines, such as Dragonair, are still seeing strong passenger traffic in some regional markets.
Dragonair, which is a subsidiary of Cathay Pacific Airways, has been operating for over 35 years and serves over 50 destinations in Asia. The company’s focus on customer satisfaction and operational efficiency has helped it establish a strong reputation in the industry. With the new A321neo planes, Dragonair is expected to keep up with its high standards of service and grow its customer base in the region.
