The Aircrew Officers' Association (AOA) of Hong Kong has revealed that the city's pilots are staying connected with e-mail addresses, ensuring that they remain up-to-date on industry news and developments.
Speaking to the media, spokesperson for the AOA said that e-mail has become an important means of staying connected, especially in today's digital age. It has allowed pilots to stay in touch with colleagues, other professionals in the aviation industry and regulatory bodies, thereby enhancing their knowledge and skills.
"Given the nature of our profession, pilots are often on the move and it's not always possible to catch up with their peers or attend seminars in person. But with e-mail, they can easily connect with the industry and stay updated on all the latest happenings," the spokesperson added.
The AOA also pointed out that e-mail addresses have become an important part of pilot training and certification procedures. Pilots are required to provide a valid e-mail address when applying for licences or renewals, something that wasn't the case until recently.
Furthermore, the association has urged all pilots to ensure that their e-mail addresses are always active and up-to-date so that they receive timely updates on industry regulations, changes in flight procedures and other important information.
With the aviation industry becoming more competitive and dynamic, keeping up-to-date with the latest developments and innovations has become crucial for pilots. And e-mail is proving to be a valuable tool in this regard.
