British Airways has announced its plans to increase passenger flights to Hong Kong, while still maintaining its freight services on a wet lease basis. The airline, which has been operating passenger and cargo flights to Hong Kong since 1936, will increase the frequency of its flights from London Heathrow to Hong Kong International Airport from four to five flights per week.
According to the airline, the decision to increase passenger flights to Hong Kong was made in response to the growing demand for air travel between the two destinations. The additional flight will provide passengers with more travel options and greater flexibility when planning their trips.
In addition, British Airways will continue to offer freight services to Hong Kong on a wet lease basis. This means that the airline will lease aircraft, crew, maintenance, and insurance services from other airlines to transport goods on behalf of its customers.
The wet lease agreement is a cost-effective way for British Airways to maintain its cargo services to Hong Kong, as it avoids the need to invest in additional aircraft and crew. The airline also benefits from the expertise and experience of its partner airlines, which can help to improve the efficiency and reliability of its cargo operations.
Commenting on the announcement, Jean-Marc Janaillac, the CEO of British Airways, said: “We are delighted to be increasing our passenger flights to Hong Kong, which is one of our most popular destinations in Asia. This additional flight will provide our customers with even more options when travelling to and from Hong Kong, and reflects our commitment to meeting the needs of our customers.”
Janaillac also noted the importance of maintaining the airline’s cargo services to Hong Kong, saying: “Cargo is a vital part of our business, and we are committed to providing our customers with the highest quality service and support. Our wet lease agreement allows us to maintain our cargo operations in Hong Kong while also ensuring that we are providing cost-effective solutions for our customers.”
The new passenger flight is due to start operating from 10th June and will be operated by a Boeing 777 aircraft, which seats up to 285 passengers. British Airways currently operates over 15 daily flights to Hong Kong as part of its global network of more than 200 destinations.
