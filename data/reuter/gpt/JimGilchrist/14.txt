Hong Kong has reported a significant surge in air cargo handled in the month of August, marking a 6.7 percent increase over the same period last year, according to official data released by the Airport Authority. The unexpected spike in air freight volume has come as a relief to the aviation industry, which has been grappling with the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting disruption in international trade.
The data shows that the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) handled a total of 439,000 tonnes of air cargo in August, compared to 411,000 tonnes in the same month last year, indicating a remarkable jump of 6.7 percent. While imports increased by 11 percent, exports fell marginally by 0.5 percent, as reported by the official sources.
The positive growth has been attributed to the increase in demand for electronic products, medical goods, PPE, and temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals, which formed the bulk of the air shipments. In addition, the increasing adoption of e-commerce and logistics services has also contributed to the higher volumes of goods being transported by air.
The Hong Kong Airport Authority has welcomed the increase in air cargo handled as evidence of the resilience of the airport and its ability to adapt to the changing market dynamics. The Authority also believes that the positive growth could be sustained in the coming months, provided the industry experiences a gradual recovery in global demand for air cargo services.
