Virgin Atlantic Cargo has announced a new shorter route for its Hong Kong to London service, cutting journey time by one hour and increasing freight capacity. The new direct service will operate from Hong Kong International Airport to London Heathrow Airport.
The airline’s new route will reduce journey times by one hour, making it a more attractive option for shippers transporting goods between Hong Kong and London. The new service will also offer customers increased freight capacity, ensuring that they can transport larger shipments with ease.
Virgin Atlantic Cargo is one of the world’s leading air cargo carriers. It operates a fleet of Boeing 747-400 aircraft, capable of transporting up to 110 tonnes of freight. The carrier has a network of routes covering destinations across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.
The new Hong Kong to London service will further strengthen Virgin Atlantic Cargo’s presence in the Asian market. Last year, the airline added new routes to and from Shanghai, China, and Delhi, India. The carrier also operates flights to Tokyo, Japan, and Hong Kong, among other destinations.
Dominic Kennedy, Managing Director of Virgin Atlantic Cargo, said: “We are constantly striving to improve our services and offer our customers the best possible options for their freight shipments. The new direct service from Hong Kong to London is a great example of that commitment, offering faster journey times and increased freight capacity. Our customers can enjoy greater flexibility and choice, as well as the reliability and quality for which Virgin Atlantic Cargo is known.”
The new direct service from Hong Kong to London is set to begin in the coming weeks, with the first flight scheduled for late March. With its shorter journey times and increased capacity, the service is expected to be popular with businesses looking to transport goods quickly and efficiently between Asia and Europe.
