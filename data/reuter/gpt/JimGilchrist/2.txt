The Hong Kong government has been working on new overflight arrangements with Beijing, ahead of the 1997 handover of the territory to China. A spokesperson for the Hong Kong government said that the negotiations were still ongoing, but that the parties were making progress.
The negotiations are aimed at ensuring that the airlines of all countries can continue to use Hong Kong as an air traffic hub, even after the territory becomes part of China. Currently, Hong Kong is subject to international aviation regulations, and many airlines use the city as a convenient transfer point for flights between different countries.
The new arrangements would guarantee that airlines can continue to use Hong Kong as a transit point, without having to comply with new, potentially restrictive, regulations after the handover. The Hong Kong government has been keen to reassure the aviation industry and the travelling public that there will be no disruption to air services after 1997.
Observers have noted that the negotiations are part of the wider process of preparing Hong Kong for its new status as a Special Administrative Region of China. The territory is currently ruled by the British, but this will change on 1 July 1997, when sovereignty over Hong Kong is transferred to Beijing under the terms of a treaty signed in 1984. The treaty also guarantees that Hong Kong will retain many of its existing freedoms and rights under a system known as "one country, two systems".
The aviation negotiations are seen as an important step in ensuring that Hong Kong can maintain its position as a major economic and transportation hub in East Asia. The city is strategically located at the crossroads of major air routes between Asia and Europe, and many airlines use it as a hub for flights to other parts of Asia, Australia, and beyond.
Hong Kong is also home to one of the world's busiest container ports, and has a thriving financial sector. The territory's economy has grown rapidly in recent years, and is seen as a model of efficient, market-oriented development in Asia.
The aviation negotiations are just one part of the complex process of preparing Hong Kong for its new status as a Special Administrative Region of China. Nevertheless, they are seen as an important symbol of the commitment of the Hong Kong government to maintaining the territory's position as a leading center for international trade, commerce, and finance in the region.
