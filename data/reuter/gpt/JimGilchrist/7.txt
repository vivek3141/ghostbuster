Hong Kong freight forwarders have warned that air cargo rates from the transpacific route could increase by up to 20%. The warning comes as airlines plan to increase their capacity from China's mainland to North America, resulting in a shortage of available cargo space.
There are many factors that could contribute to the increase of rates. The ongoing trade war between the United States and China has led to higher tariffs on goods such as electronics and textiles, which drives up demand for air freight. In addition, the pandemic has caused many airlines to suspend their operations, leading to a decrease in overall capacity and an increase in demand for air cargo.
The rise in prices could have a major impact on the supply chain industry and could cause an increase in costs for retailers and customers. It is important for businesses to monitor the situation closely and look for alternative methods of shipping to avoid possible disruptions in the supply chain.
