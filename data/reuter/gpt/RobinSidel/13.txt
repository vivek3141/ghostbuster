CGIP in Talks to Acquire 28% Stake in Valeo SA from Italian Businessman
Paris-based private equity firm, CGIP, is in talks to acquire a 28% stake in Valeo SA from Italian businessman Francesco Garofalo. As per the sources, the stake is currently valued at approximately €1.2 billion. Valeo SA, based out of France, is a leading supplier of automotive parts and systems globally.
CGIP is presently discussing financial terms with Garofalo’s holding company, Eventide Funds, which currently owns almost 30% of Valeo's voting rights. The potential sale is subject to the approval of Valeo's board, which is reportedly meeting soon to discuss the matter.
If negotiations are successful, CGIP will attain a substantial position in Valeo’s board and will become a major shareholder of the company. The deal comes at a time when the auto industry is undergoing significant changes as electric vehicles become increasingly popular and advancements in autonomous driving.
The acquisition of the stake in Valeo SA will further boost CGIP’s portfolio, which already has major holdings in trucking parts supplier Jost, and French telecommunications provider, SFR Group.
Sources suggest that the deal could be completed by the end of the year. However, no official confirmation has been provided from CGIP or Valeo SA about the discussions and it has not yet been confirmed whether the deal will be accepted by Valeo. 
This potential acquisition by CGIP is a bold move and displays confidence in Valeo’s future growth prospects. The company recently announced its medium-term 2025 vision of generating over €27 billion in annual revenue by 2025, riding high on new technologies and demand for hybrid and electric vehicles.
Valeo is also looking to expand its business with Chinese automakers and create new collaborations in emerging markets such as India, Vietnam, and Thailand, to tap into the fast-growing demand for its products.
Conversely, with the acquisition of Valeo’s stake, CGIP will gain a strong foothold in the automotive market. Valeo’s position in the global automotive industry is likely to benefit CGIP in terms of market diversification and increased investment opportunity.
In conclusion, the acquisition of the 28% stake of Valeo SA by CGIP will be a significant move which is likely to benefit both companies in the long run. It remains to be seen whether this potential acquisition will be accepted and result in a successful deal.
