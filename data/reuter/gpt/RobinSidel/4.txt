PacifiCorp and Protection One have joined forces to offer security systems to customers across the United States. This collaboration was announced at a press conference held by both companies in Salt Lake City on Monday.
The deal will see PacifiCorp, which provides electricity to over 1.8 million customers in six western states, team up with Protection One, a leading provider of commercial and home security systems. PacifiCorp customers will now be able to purchase Protection One's advanced security products and services, which include alarm systems, surveillance cameras, and home automation.
Commenting on the partnership, PacifiCorp's CEO, Stefan Bird, stated, "This is an exciting opportunity for us to expand our range of products and services to our customers. We believe that our collaboration with Protection One will bring enhanced security and peace of mind to our customers across the region."
Protection One's CEO, Timothy Whall, added, "We are delighted to be working with PacifiCorp to offer our comprehensive security systems to their customers. We have a strong track record of providing exceptional service and security solutions to customers across the country, and we are looking forward to working with PacifiCorp to protect their homes and businesses."
The partnership also comes with a number of incentives for customers who sign up for Protection One's services. For instance, PacifiCorp customers who install a qualifying alarm system will receive a $100 credit on their energy bill, while those who opt for home automation services will receive a $50 credit.
Both companies are also committed to providing customers with round-the-clock customer support. This means that customers who require assistance with their security systems can contact Protection One's customer service team at any time of day or night.
The PacifiCorp and Protection One partnership comes at a time when the demand for security systems is growing rapidly across the country. With crime rates on the rise in many areas, more and more Americans are looking to invest in advanced security solutions to protect their homes and businesses.
Indeed, a recent survey by the National Council for Home Safety and Security found that over 90% of all homebuyers consider security a top priority when purchasing a property. It is therefore likely that PacifiCorp customers will welcome the opportunity to take advantage of Protection One's services.
In conclusion, the PacifiCorp and Protection One partnership is set to bring enhanced security and peace of mind to customers across the region. With a range of advanced security products and services on offer, and incentives for customers who sign up, this collaboration is sure to be a success.
