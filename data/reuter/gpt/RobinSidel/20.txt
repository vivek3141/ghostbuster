Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn has renewed his campaign to break up RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. He believes that the food and tobacco conglomerate is undervalued and that splitting it into separate entities could unlock significant value for shareholders.
Icahn, who owns a stake in RJR Nabisco, has been pushing for a breakup of the company for several years. He first made his intentions known in 2014 when he acquired a stake in the company and began calling for a spinoff of the food business from the tobacco business. At the time, he argued that the two businesses were undervalued when combined and that they would be worth more if they were separated.
However, his efforts were rebuffed by the company, which argued that the two businesses were better off together. RJR Nabisco also pointed out that a breakup would be complicated and expensive, and that it would not necessarily result in higher shareholder value.
Despite the pushback, Icahn has not given up on his campaign to break up the company. In fact, he appears to be more determined than ever to see it through. In a recent letter to the CEO of RJR Nabisco, he reiterated his belief that a breakup is the best way to create value for shareholders.
"Regardless of the current challenges facing the tobacco industry, it is clear that the food business has significant growth potential that is not being fully realized within the current structure of RJR Nabisco," he wrote. "A spinoff of the food business would allow both businesses to focus on their respective strengths, unlock significant value for shareholders, and create new opportunities for growth."
Icahn also pointed to the recent success of other companies that have undergone spinoffs, such as Dow Inc. and DuPont de Nemours Inc. He argued that these companies have created significant value for shareholders by breaking up and focusing on their core strengths.
The renewed campaign by Icahn has sparked renewed interest in the potential breakup of RJR Nabisco. Some analysts believe that a spinoff could indeed create significant value for shareholders, particularly given the strong growth potential of the food business.
However, others caution that a breakup would not necessarily be a panacea for the company's woes. They point out that both the food and tobacco businesses are facing significant challenges, and that a separation could create new complications and costs. They also note that the combined company has been able to generate significant free cash flow, which has given it the flexibility to invest in new growth opportunities.
Nevertheless, the renewed attention on the potential breakup of RJR Nabisco is likely to put pressure on the company's management to consider the possibility more seriously. Icahn, who has a reputation as a tenacious activist investor, is unlikely to give up his campaign easily, and he may seek to rally other shareholders to his cause.
At the same time, the company's management will need to weigh the potential benefits and risks of a breakup, and determine whether it is in the best interests of shareholders. Given the complexity and cost of such a move, it is unlikely that they will rush into any decision, and they will likely take their time to carefully evaluate all the options.
In the end, the fate of RJR Nabisco will depend on the decisions and actions of its management, as well as the pressures brought to bear by investors like Carl Icahn. Whether the company remains intact or is broken up, it is clear that its future will be closely watched by investors and analysts alike.
