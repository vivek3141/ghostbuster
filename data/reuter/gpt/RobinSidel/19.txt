In recent years, the food industry has been focusing its attention on millennials, specifically those who do not enjoy cooking. Dubbed "non-cooking millennials," this demographic has become a key target for food companies as they look to increase their sales and profits.
Recent studies have shown that nearly half of millennials prefer to eat out or order takeout rather than cook at home. This trend has been attributed to a variety of factors, including busy schedules, a lack of cooking skills, and a desire for convenience.
Recognizing the potential for growth in this market, food companies have been developing new products and marketing strategies to appeal to non-cooking millennials. These efforts have included the creation of pre-packaged meal kits, the introduction of more convenient and easy-to-prepare options, and the use of social media influencers and other digital marketing tactics.
One of the companies leading the charge is Blue Apron, a meal kit service that delivers pre-portioned ingredients and recipes to customers' doors. Since its launch in 2012, Blue Apron has become a household name, with a reported 750,000 subscribers as of 2018. The company has also expanded its offerings to include wine pairings and even a market for customers to purchase individual ingredients.
Another company leveraging the trend is Grubhub, a food delivery service that has seen a surge in popularity among millennials. According to a report by Cowen and Company, Grubhub's sales increased by 36% year over year in 2018, driven in part by the company's focus on convenience and an easy-to-use app.
In addition to these companies, traditional food brands such as Campbell's and Kraft have also been taking steps to appeal to non-cooking millennials. Campbell's has launched a line of pre-made soup cups and even a line of "Well Yes!" soups marketed as a healthier option. Kraft, meanwhile, has introduced a line of "Easy Mac" products and a variety of pre-made pasta dishes.
To reach the non-cooking millennial demographic, many companies have been increasing their digital marketing efforts. This includes partnerships with social media influencers, targeted digital ads, and even the creation of branded social media accounts.
One example of this strategy in action is the launch of the Instagram account "Every Plate," a meal kit service targeted at budget-conscious millennials. The account features brightly colored food photos, easy-to-follow recipes, and a playful tone in its captions and stories.
While these efforts have proven successful for many food companies, some experts warn that the trend towards convenience and away from cooking could have negative consequences in the long run. "Cooking skills are an important part of a healthy lifestyle," says nutritionist Laura Thomas. "If we don't encourage people to cook more, we could see a rise in diet-related health problems in the future."
Despite these concerns, the trend towards non-cooking millennials shows no signs of slowing down. As food companies continue to develop new products and marketing strategies, it remains to be seen what impact this trend will have on the food industry as a whole.
