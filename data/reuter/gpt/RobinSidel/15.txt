Revco D.S. Inc. announced today its plans to acquire Big B Inc., a regional drugstore chain with over 150 stores in the Midwest, in a sweetened takeover deal worth $380 million. The acquisition is expected to further expand Revco's presence in the region and diversify its product offerings.
The deal includes both cash and Revco stock, with Big B shareholders receiving $25 per share in cash and the remainder in Revco stock. The new offer is significantly higher than Revco's initial bid of $300 million, which was rejected by Big B's board of directors as undervalued.
"Big B is a well-respected and established brand in the Midwest, and we are thrilled to be bringing them under our umbrella," said Ed Jankowski, CEO of Revco. "This acquisition will allow us to offer our customers an even wider range of products and services, while expanding our footprint in this important market."
The deal is expected to close in the next several months, pending regulatory approval. Revco has stated that it intends to retain most of Big B's employees and maintain the chain's current branding and operations.
News of the acquisition sent shares of Revco up over 5% in early trading, as investors reacted positively to the news. Analysts praised the move as a strategic one for the company, as it allows them to tap into a new customer base and increase market share.
"The Midwest is a key market for drugstores, and this deal gives Revco a strong foothold in the region," said John Wilson, an analyst at Morningstar. "It also helps them differentiate themselves from competitors by expanding their offerings beyond just pharmaceuticals."
Big B was founded in 1973 and has since grown into one of the largest privately owned drugstore chains in the Midwest. The company is known for its focus on customer service and friendly, local feel. The chain offers a wide range of products, including over-the-counter medications, health and beauty products, and household essentials.
"We are excited to be joining forces with Revco and believe that this deal will benefit both our customers and our employees," said Linda Schmidt, CEO of Big B. "Revco brings with it a wealth of experience and resources, and we look forward to working together to grow our business and serve our communities."
The acquisition comes amid a wave of consolidation in the retail pharmacy industry, driven in part by rising healthcare costs and increased competition from online retailers. In recent years, an increasing number of smaller regional chains have been acquired by larger national players, including CVS and Walgreens.
However, some analysts have raised concerns about the impact of these mergers on consumers, particularly in terms of pricing and access to healthcare. A recent report by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance found that the rise of national pharmacy chains had led to a decline in independent pharmacies, reducing competition and increasing prices for consumers.
"We need to be vigilant about the effects of consolidation in this industry, particularly in terms of its impact on consumer choice and access to healthcare," said Wilson. "While this deal may be positive for Revco in the short term, we need to ensure that it doesn't have negative long-term effects for consumers and the broader healthcare system."
Despite these concerns, Revco remains optimistic about the future of the retail pharmacy industry and its role in it. The company has said that it plans to continue expanding through strategic acquisitions and investment in new products and technology.
"This is an exciting time for us and for the industry as a whole," said Jankowski. "We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible service and keeping up with the latest trends and innovations in the field. With our acquisition of Big B, we are taking another important step in that direction."
