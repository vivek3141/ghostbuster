Loewen Group Inc. seeks state help as defense against Service Corp. International's hostile bid
The ongoing tussle between two major players in the funeral services industry has taken yet another turn. Loewen Group Inc. has sought state assistance in fending off a hostile takeover bid from Service Corp. International (SCI).
Loewen Group, based in Burnaby, British Columbia, operates funeral homes, cemeteries and crematoria across North America under the brand names of Loewen, MacKenzie, Alderwoods and others. SCI, headquartered in Houston, Texas, is the largest provider of funeral and cemetery services in North America.
The latest development in this longstanding rivalry began when SCI publicized its intention to buy Loewen Group at a premium of $6.50 per share, which amounted to $1.1 billion. Loewen Group rejected the offer, stating that it undervalued the company's assets. SCI then launched a hostile takeover bid by offering to purchase Loewen Group's outstanding shares from its shareholders directly.
Loewen Group is now seeking help from the Canadian government to prevent the hostile takeover. The company argues that SCI's bid is detrimental to Canadian interests as it would result in the loss of thousands of jobs in Canada and the reduction of competition in the funeral services market.
Loewen Group also claims that SCI's acquisition would not be in the public interest due to the negative impact it would have on the availability and quality of funeral services for Canadian families.
In response to Loewen Group's submission, the Canadian government has launched a national security review of SCI's takeover bid. The review process will take 45 days, during which the government will examine whether the move poses a threat to Canada's domestic interests.
The Canadian government has the power to intervene in foreign takeovers that are deemed detrimental to national security or public interest. It can block or impose conditions on the takeover bid to prevent the acquirer from harming Canadian businesses and jobs.
Loewen Group's move to seek government intervention has received support from several quarters. Canadian labor unions have spoken out in favor of the company, stating that SCI's takeover bid would result in the loss of jobs and hurt Canadian workers.
Consumer advocacy groups have also expressed concern over the possibility of reduced competition leading to higher prices for funeral services. In a statement, Consumers Council of Canada said, "We urge the relevant authorities to investigate the potential consequences of this takeover bid on consumers in Canada, who rely on affordable and accessible funeral services."
SCI has defended its bid, saying that it will benefit Loewen Group by providing access to its technology and management expertise. The company has also argued that the acquisition will result in cost savings, which will be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices.
However, Loewen Group has been critical of SCI's approach, stating that the company has a history of aggressive acquisitions, which have led to a reduction in the quality of funeral services and a negative impact on the communities it serves.
The ongoing battle between Loewen Group and SCI has been closely watched by industry analysts and investors. The funeral services market is valued at over $20 billion in North America and is expected to grow in the coming years due to an aging population and increasing demand for cremation services.
The outcome of the national security review and Loewen Group's efforts to fend off the hostile takeover bid will have significant implications for the future of the industry and the companies involved.
In conclusion, Loewen Group's decision to seek state help in fighting SCI's hostile takeover bid has raised concerns over the impact of such acquisitions on the Canadian job market and the availability and quality of funeral services. As the national security review gets underway, industry players and regulatory bodies will closely monitor the developments and their implications for the funeral services market.
