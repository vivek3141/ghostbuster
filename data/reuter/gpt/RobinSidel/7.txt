PepsiCo shares surged on Wednesday following reports that Philip Morris Cos Inc. is considering a takeover of the snack and beverage giant. The rumor sent the stock price soaring by more than 7% to close at $139.09.
While PepsiCo has not commented on the takeover rumors, analysts say that the company would be an attractive target for Philip Morris, which is looking for new growth avenues amid declining cigarette sales. With a market capitalization of nearly $190 billion, PepsiCo owns iconic brands such as Pepsi, Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Tropicana, and Quaker Oats.
According to sources, Philip Morris has been exploring potential acquisitions in the consumer goods sector as it looks to diversify its business beyond tobacco. The company has already made a foray into the food and beverage industry with its acquisition of Kraft Foods in 2007. However, since then, its food business has struggled to keep pace with rivals.
The potential acquisition of PepsiCo would give Philip Morris access to some of the world's most recognized consumer brands, as well as a foothold in the growing health and wellness market. PepsiCo has been investing heavily in healthier snacks and beverages, including its recent acquisition of energy drink maker Rockstar.
Moreover, PepsiCo has a strong presence in emerging markets where Philip Morris has struggled to gain a foothold. The company derives about 40% of its revenue from outside the U.S., with a significant portion coming from Asia and Latin America.
The takeover rumors come at a time when PepsiCo is also rumored to be considering a split of its snack and beverage businesses. Some analysts believe that a spin-off of Frito-Lay, the company's snack division, could unlock value and better position the company for growth.
However, a potential acquisition by Philip Morris may complicate the separation process, if it were to go ahead. The tobacco company may have different ideas about how to structure the company, and may look to retain some key assets.
It remains to be seen whether a deal will materialize between the two companies. Given the size and complexity of both businesses, any potential acquisition would likely be subject to close scrutiny by regulators. Moreover, with the coronavirus pandemic causing massive disruptions to the global economy, deal activity has slowed down significantly in recent months.
Nonetheless, the takeover rumors have sparked renewed interest in PepsiCo among investors, who have been looking for signs of growth amid a broader market downturn. With its strong portfolio of brands and diversified business model, PepsiCo remains well positioned to weather any economic headwinds.
