American Medical Response Inc, the leading provider of emergency medical services in the United States announced their acquisition of a smaller rival company yesterday. However, the announcement sent AMR stocks tumbling down by almost 5%.
The target company, which has not been named, has a national presence, but is much smaller than AMR. The acquisition is expected to boost AMR's market share by several percentage points in this highly competitive industry. Despite the strategic importance of this deal, investors reacted negatively to the news, with the stock price closing at $42.50 yesterday, down from the previous level of $44.70.
There are concerns over the market conditions and the sustainability of AMR’s growth. With the pandemic situation in the country, the demand for medical assistance has increased sharply, and several smaller operators in the industry have been struggling to keep up. This acquisition was expected to present an excellent opportunity for AMR to expand its business and capitalize on these market conditions. However, investors are speculating that the move might have been too aggressive, risking over-capacity in a market that might saturate soon.
“While in the short-term, this acquisition might increase the valuations of the companies, in the long-term, the industry’s growth potential might be a cause for concern” said Albert, an analyst from Duke Investment Research. “The outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent vaccination rollout have caused a surge in demand in the industry, leading to several companies wanting to join the bandwagon.”
The recent loss in the futures market poses more uncertain for the industry. Hospitals and medical centers have not been admitting regular patients regularly, due to the fear of COVID-19, and this temporary pause has hit the industry's growth potential. As we are gradually resuming normal operations, medical institutions might reduce their dependency on a private-hire service like AMR.
Despite these concerns, the AMR acquisition is still being viewed as a positive long-term development, taking the current scenario into consideration. However, investors and industry experts are keen on monitoring the acquisitions closely, to assess the developments in the industry.
