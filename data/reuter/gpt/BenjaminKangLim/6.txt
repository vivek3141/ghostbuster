The mother of prominent Chinese dissident Wang Dan has vowed to defend her son in court against serious charges that he was involved in a plot to overthrow the government.
Wang Dan was arrested in China earlier this year and charged with subversion, a serious crime in China that can lead to long prison terms or even the death penalty.
Wang's mother, Zhang Yuxiang, said in a letter to Chinese authorities that she would do everything in her power to defend her son in court.
"I believe that my son is innocent and that he has never done anything to harm the motherland or the people of China," Zhang wrote in the letter.
"I will not rest until justice is done and my son is freed from these false charges."
Wang, who is now in his 50s, was a leader of the pro-democracy movement that swept China in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He was arrested in 1989 after taking part in protests in Tiananmen Square and spent several years in prison.
After his release, he continued to speak out against the Chinese government and eventually fled to the United States, where he has been living in exile for the past few decades.
However, he has continued to be a thorn in the side of the Chinese government, which has accused him of being involved in a number of plots to overthrow the government.
Zhang said in her letter that the charges against her son were baseless and that he had never advocated or taken part in any violent actions against the government.
"He has always advocated peaceful protest and non-violent resistance," she wrote.
"He has never called for the overthrow of the government or promoted any ideology that would harm the stability and prosperity of our country."
Zhang also accused the Chinese government of violating her son's basic human rights, including the right to a fair trial and the right to freedom of speech.
"I call on the Chinese government to observe basic human rights and to ensure that my son is treated fairly and justly in court," she wrote.
"He should be allowed to defend himself and to have access to legal counsel. He should also be allowed to speak freely and to express his views without fear of repression."
The case against Wang has sparked international concern, with many human rights groups and governments calling on China to release him and to respect his human rights.
"We are deeply concerned about the treatment of Wang Dan and other dissidents in China," said a spokesperson for the US State Department.
"We call on the Chinese government to observe basic human rights and to respect the rights of all individuals to peaceful protest and freedom of expression."
It remains to be seen how the case against Wang will be resolved, but his mother's determination to fight for his freedom is a testament to the enduring spirit of resistance that still exists in China.
