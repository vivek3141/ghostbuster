BEIJING MAYOR RESIGNS IN EXPECTED RESHUFFLE AFTER MENTOR'S CORRUPTION SCANDAL
Beijing Mayor, Chen Jining, announced his resignation on Tuesday, sparking off an expected reshuffle in the top positions of the Chinese capital's government. The announcement is believed to be connected to the ongoing corruption scandal involving one of his predecessors and political mentor, Guo Jinlong.
Guo, who served as Beijing's mayor from 2008 to 2012, was recently suspected of taking bribes and other corruption charges. The Communist Party's anti-corruption watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, launched an investigation into Guo's activities. The scandal is part of President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign, which has targeted high-ranking officials and influential figures across the country.
Mayor Chen, who has been in the position since 2016, is seen as a protege of Guo. Chen was previously the president of Tsinghua University, where he worked closely with Guo, who was the university's Communist Party chief. Chen was appointed as mayor by the Beijing Municipal People's Congress after Guo's tenure ended.
Chen's resignation came as no surprise to many political analysts. It was widely expected that he would not be able to keep his position as part of the reshuffling of key officials following Guo's downfall. Chen's resignation was submitted to the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, which will hold a special session to review and approve it.
The committee will then nominate a new candidate for the position of mayor, who will be appointed by the National People's Congress, China's top legislative body. The reshuffle is expected to involve other key positions in the Beijing government.
Chen's resignation was met with mixed reactions from the public. Some praised his work during his tenure, which included improvements in the city's environment, transportation, and social welfare. Others criticized him for failing to tackle some of the city's most pressing issues, such as the high cost of living, traffic congestion, and pollution.
Chen, in his resignation letter, thanked the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, the municipal government, and the people of Beijing for their support during his time in office. He said he was grateful for the opportunity to serve the city and its residents.
"I have devoted all my efforts to this great city and have been privileged to work with so many dedicated and talented people," Chen said in his letter. "I believe that, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, Beijing will continue to prosper and flourish."
Although Chen's resignation has been seen as part of the ongoing anti-corruption campaign, some observers have noted that it may also be linked to the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics, which is scheduled to take place in 2022.
"The Beijing Winter Olympics is an important event for the city and the country," said Lu Qi, a Beijing-based political scientist. "The leadership wants to ensure that everything runs smoothly and without any hiccups. They want to make sure that the officials in charge are competent and trustworthy."
The Beijing government has been under pressure to ensure that the Winter Olympics is a success, as it is a major opportunity for Beijing to showcase its economic and political power to the world. Chen's resignation may be part of a broader effort to guarantee that the event is well-managed and scandal-free.
In the end, whether Chen's resignation is part of a reshuffle triggered by Guo's corruption scandal or a move to ensure the success of the Winter Olympics, it shows that the Chinese government takes swift action against officials accused of wrongdoing. It is a clear sign that President Xi's anti-corruption campaign will continue to be a major priority for the Chinese leadership.
