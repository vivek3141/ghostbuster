Beijing, China - China has criticized Taiwan for its failure to crackdown on a new independence party, accusing it of undermining peace and stability in the region.
The new party, named the Taiwan National Party, officially registered with Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior last month, marking the first time an openly pro-independence party has been recognized on the island.
The party's founder, Chiu Yi-Lin, has openly advocated for Taiwan's complete independence from China. Chiu has stated that the ultimate goal of the Taiwan National Party is to change the country's official name from Republic of China to Republic of Taiwan, and to seek recognition as a fully sovereign state.
While the party has gained support among some Taiwanese who favor independence, it has also drawn criticism from China, which sees Taiwan as a rogue province of its territory that should eventually reunify with the mainland.
China's ruling Communist Party has long maintained that Taiwan is a part of its territory, and it regards any moves towards independence as a grave threat to its national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Beijing has also warned that it will use force if necessary to prevent Taiwan from becoming an independent state.
The Taiwanese government has so far not taken any action against the Taiwan National Party, arguing that it is a legitimate political party that has the right to operate within the country's democratic system.
However, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, dismissed this stance, saying that Taiwan's failure to take action against the party was tantamount to condoning what she called "separatist activities." She also accused the Taiwanese government of "fanning the flames of Taiwan independence" by allowing the party to operate.
Hua further warned that China would continue to take a tough stance towards Taiwan's independence efforts, and called on the international community to respect China's "core interests" and support its efforts to uphold its territorial integrity.
The latest developments have further raised tensions between China and Taiwan, which have been at odds since the civil war in China ended in 1949 and the Nationalist Party fled to Taiwan.
Taiwan has since developed into a bustling democracy, but its political status remains in limbo. While it operates as a de facto independent state, it is only recognized by a handful of countries, and is still claimed as part of China by Beijing.
The issue remains a sensitive one in the region, with the United States providing military support to Taiwan, prompting repeated condemnations from Beijing.
As tensions continue to rise between the two sides, the prospect of a peaceful reunification appears increasingly unlikely, with the Taiwan National Party further stoking controversy by advocating a hardline approach towards Beijing.
With both sides unwilling to back down, it remains to be seen how the latest standoff over the Taiwan National Party will play out, and whether it will further escalate tensions in the already volatile region.
