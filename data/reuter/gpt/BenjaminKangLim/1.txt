Beijing has offered assurances to Taiwan regarding the island's security following the lift of a direct trade ban. The move, which has been a long-standing issue between the two sides, is expected to boost economic ties but has raised concerns over Taiwan's security.
China's State Council announced last week that it would end the ban on direct trade between China and Taiwan. The ban, which was introduced in 2000, had required Taiwan businesses to go through Hong Kong or other third-party countries to trade with China. The ban was seen as a way for Beijing to exert pressure on Taiwan, which it considers a breakaway province.
Taiwanese officials had expressed concerns that lifting the ban would make the island more vulnerable to China's influence and coercion. Taiwan has been a self-governing democracy since 1949, but China has been keen to reunify it with the mainland and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve that goal. Beijing has also stepped up its military activities around Taiwan, including sending fighter jets and aircraft carriers near the island.
However, Chinese officials have sought to allay these fears, saying that the trade agreement would not compromise Taiwan's security. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said that the agreement "will not harm the interests of Taiwanese businesses or workers" and that "it will not affect Taiwan's security."
Wang also reiterated Beijing's stance on the "one China" principle, which states that there is only one China, of which Taiwan is a part. He said that "the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair and concerns China's sovereignty and territorial integrity" and that "Taiwan independence is a dead end."
Despite the reassurances from Beijing, many Taiwanese remain skeptical. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said that it would "actively evaluate" the agreement and would "take all necessary measures to safeguard the nation's security and interests." Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has also said that the island would "remain steadfast in defending our democracy and freedom" and would not bow to pressure from Beijing.
In the United States, which has long been a supporter of Taiwan's democracy, there are also concerns over the agreement. A State Department spokesman said that the US has "long been clear that we support Taiwan's meaningful participation in the international community" and that any steps taken by China to suppress Taiwan's international presence would be met with "strong opposition."
The US has also been stepping up its military presence in the region in response to China's increasing assertiveness. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin have both visited Japan and South Korea, where they reaffirmed the US commitment to regional security and stressed the importance of the US alliances with those countries.
The lift of the direct trade ban between China and Taiwan is a significant development in the relationship between the two sides. While it is expected to boost economic ties, it has also heightened concerns over Taiwan's security and sovereignty. Beijing's assurances may have eased some of those concerns, but many Taiwanese remain wary of China's intentions. As the US and other regional powers continue to monitor the situation, the focus will remain on how the agreement will play out in practice and whether it will lead to greater cooperation or greater tensions between China and Taiwan.
