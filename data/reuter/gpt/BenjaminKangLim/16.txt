Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan has announced that he will step down as part of a reshuffle of the city's leadership following the downfall of his mentor and former party chief, Cai Qi.
Mr. Cai was removed from his post earlier this month following an investigation into allegations of corruption and misconduct. The move was seen as part of a broader crackdown on graft and abuses of power by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Mr. Li, who has served as mayor since 2017, is the latest in a series of high-profile officials to be caught up in the anti-corruption campaign. He had been widely expected to be replaced in the upcoming reshuffle.
The timing of Mr. Cai's downfall was seen as significant. He had been a close ally of former security chief and presidential adviser Zhou Yongkang, who was jailed for life in 2015 on corruption charges. Mr. Cai was himself viewed as a rising star in the Communist Party and was tipped to be a potential member of the Politburo, the party's highest decision-making body.
Mr. Li's departure is also notable for its timing. In just a few months, Beijing will host the Winter Olympics, and the city's leadership is under pressure to ensure the smooth running of the event.
There is speculation that Mr. Li may be replaced by someone with more experience in overseeing large-scale projects. However, no successor has been named yet, and it is unclear who will take over the reins.
The reshuffle in Beijing comes amid a wider shake-up of the country's political leadership. Last year, President Xi launched a new campaign to "rectify" the party, aimed at purging corrupt and disloyal officials.
Since then, thousands of officials have been investigated and punished, including senior figures such as former security chief Zhou Yongkang and exiled tycoon Guo Wengui. The campaign is seen as part of President Xi's broader efforts to consolidate his power and root out potential rivals.
The anti-corruption drive has won widespread public support in China, where corruption is viewed as one of the country's most pressing problems. However, critics say the campaign is being used to target political opponents and those who are seen as threats to President Xi's rule.
The reshuffle in Beijing is also seen as an important test of President Xi's leadership. As the country prepares for its once-in-a-decade leadership transition next year, many are watching to see how he will balance the need for stability and continuity with the desire for change and reform.
For now, Mr. Li's departure marks the end of his tenure as mayor of one of the world's most populous and influential cities. His successor will inherit a range of challenges, from climate change to economic inequality, but will also have the opportunity to shape the direction of China's capital as it continues to become a global superpower.
