China's political landscape experienced a jolt yesterday after news emerged that Deng Duan, the son-in-law of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, has resigned from his position on the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee. His resignation followed a failed promotion bid to the head of China's largest SOE. 
The sudden resignation of Deng Duan from China's top legislative body after just one year has caught many analysts off-guard, raising questions about the reasons behind his departure. While no official explanation has been given, sources close to the matter reveal that Deng's resignation came after he failed to get appointed to the top job at China State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC).
Deng, who is married to Deng Xiaoping's daughter, was seen as a leading contender for the job after the Alibaba Group executive Jiang Fang was ousted last year. Industry insiders believed that with his powerful family connections, Deng Duan had what it took to become the chairman of China's largest SOE. However, his ambitions were dashed when Liu He, a close aide to President Xi Jinping, was appointed to the post in the latest round of appointments.
Deng Duan's resignation has been interpreted by many as an act of defiance against President Xi Jinping's hard-line stance on corruption and nepotism. The 56-year-old businessman was previously chairman of Tsingtao Brewery, one of China's largest beer producers that is partly state-owned. His ties to Deng Xiaoping, the leader who is often credited with opening China to the world and laying the groundwork for its economic boom, have been seen as his ticket to a higher position in the Communist Party.
Some analysts suggest that Deng's resignation is also a reflection of the growing tension within China's ruling elite. As Xi Jinping consolidates power, many of the old-guard families, who have dominated the Communist Party since its inception, are becoming anxious about their future prospects. Deng's departure is seen as a signal of this anxiety, indicating that past networks are beginning to lose their grip on power.
The resignation of Deng Duan has raised eyebrows, not just inside China but also globally. Western observers have long been concerned about the lack of transparency in China's political system and the potential for corruption and nepotism. Deng's departure, which was triggered by a failed promotion bid, could be a sign for the worsening predicament of foreign investments in China.
Some worry that the ousting of an SOE head with close family ties to Deng Xiaoping could result in a transfer of power and wealth from the old-guard families to the current leadership. Others suggest that it could lead to more aggressive crackdowns on corruption and privilege within the Communist Party. Either way, the resignation of Deng Duan has brought into sharp relief the ongoing struggle for power within China's ruling elite.
The news of Deng Duan's resignation has come at a time when Beijing is preparing for its annual parliamentary session, where major policy decisions and appointments are made. With Xi Jinping's ambitious plans for China's continued economic development, the resignation of Deng Duan will undoubtedly create ripples in the political landscape.
This is not the first time that family connections have had a bearing on promotions within China's Communist Party. In 2012, Bo Xilai, the former party chief of Chongqing who was considered a rising star in China's political hierarchy, was ousted and subsequently jailed for corruption. His wife, who was implicated in the case, was also sentenced to death.
The ousting of Deng Duan, while not as dramatic as the Bo Xilai case, is a reminder of the complex and opaque nature of China's politics. It remains to be seen how it will impact China's economic prospects and its relations with Western countries, which are looking to invest in the country. Jinping's China, while trying to keep the economy growing, is also struggling to balance growth with stability, as such incidents continue to serve as a warning to anyone who tries to use their power for favorism.
