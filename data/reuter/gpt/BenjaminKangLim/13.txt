The tension between China and the United States has reached a new high after China demanded that the US cancel its plans to sell weapons to Taiwan. On Wednesday, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said that the country strongly opposes the move and has urged the US to immediately stop selling arms to Taiwan.
The US State Department had recently approved the sale of advanced military equipment worth $1.8 billion to Taiwan. The deal includes 135 air-to-ground missiles, as well as equipment to aid in the detection and tracking of enemy submarines. The sale, which must still be approved by Congress, marks the second major arms deal between the two countries in two years.
China, which considers Taiwan a part of its territory, has long opposed any arms sales to the island. The country has repeatedly warned the US that selling weapons to Taiwan would damage bilateral relations and could lead to a military conflict.
The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman accused the US of violating the “one-China” principle, a policy that recognises Taiwan as a part of China. He said that the US should immediately cancel the arms deal to avoid damaging bilateral relations.
He also warned the US not to underestimate China’s determination to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. He said that China would take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests.
The US, however, has defended its arms sales to Taiwan, saying that it is necessary to help the island defend itself from Chinese aggression. The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said that the sale is consistent with the US commitment to Taiwan’s self-defense.
He said that the US continues to support Taiwan’s democratic government and its efforts to build its own defense capabilities. Pompeo also accused China of using coercive tactics, including military threats, to intimidate Taiwan and other neighbouring countries.
The US has been increasingly critical of China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, where it has built military bases on disputed islands. The US has also accused China of human rights violations against the Uighur minority in Xinjiang province and of cracking down on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.
The arms deal is likely to further exacerbate tensions between the two countries, which have already been strained due to their ongoing trade war and disputes over the coronavirus pandemic.
China has retaliated against US sanctions by imposing its own tariffs on US goods and has also targeted US companies operating in China. The US, in turn, has imposed restrictions on Chinese tech companies, including Huawei, over allegations of national security threats.
The tension has also spilled over into the diplomatic arena. Last month, the US ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, accusing it of being involved in espionage and stealing intellectual property. China retaliated by ordering the closure of the US consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu.
The arms deal to Taiwan, if approved by Congress, is likely to further escalate the situation and may lead to retaliation by China. The country has previously warned that it would take countermeasures, including sanctions on US companies involved in the arms deals.
The US, however, has maintained that the sale of arms to Taiwan is consistent with its longstanding policy of supporting the island’s defense against potential aggression from China. The US has also accused China of using military coercion to intimidate Taiwan and of violating its commitments under international law.
The escalating tension between the two countries is likely to have repercussions not only for trade relations but also for global stability. As the two largest economic and military powers in the world, their disputes are likely to have ripple effects in other parts of the world and could lead to a wider geopolitical conflict.
