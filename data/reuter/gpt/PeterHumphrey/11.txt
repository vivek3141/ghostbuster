After months of anticipation and protests, Hong Kong recently held its unique form of “democratic election” for a new chief executive. Unlike most democratic elections, the 2021 Hong Kong chief executive election only involved a small group of hand-selected voters. This year’s election was dominated by the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) objectives, aimed at maintaining greater control over Hong Kong’s governance.
Hong Kong has a relatively complex political system with only 400 people in the election committee having a say, including 40 sectoral representatives, 60 special representatives, and 300 Hong Kong elites, who are selected by the CCP. In essence, the election is not democratic since the 400 members of the election committee do not represent the entire Hong Kong population, but rather a hand-selected group of elites who vote based on their allegiance rather than their belief in democracy.
Despite criticism, the CCP has maintained firm control over Hong Kong's political system for years, with the selection of the new chief executive being a critical indicator of who will be the future leader of the territory. Hong Kong has consistently maintained high governmental autonomy, but due to the protests in 2019, China took a more aggressive stance on curbing freedoms and liberties in Hong Kong and appointed a new head of the outgoing chief executive with an aim to restrict Hong Kong’s popular democratic leaders.
Hong Kong’s election system presents a severe challenge to democratic values as it lacks any integrity or fairness. The majority of the people who vote have either been designated to their position or have already pledged their allegiance to China’s CCP. Several prominent pro-democracy and pan-democrat candidates for the chief executive position were disqualified, including Joshua Wong and Leung Kwok-hung, who had passed stringent qualifications in previous elections since they were against China’s policies.
Up until recently, pan-democrats were concerned about protecting Hong Kong’s autonomy and were in favor of creating a more democratic system. However, the latest election results have thrown a spanner in the works with the announcement of the new head of chief executive that brings the autonomy of Hong Kong under more extensive limitations. Thousands of Hong Kong people immigrated to other countries as China assumed greater grip over Hong Kong after implementing stringent national security laws in 2020.
Besides, many fear that widespread political repression will lead to a loss of fundamental rights and liberties that are enshrined in Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, the Basic Law. In the past year, there have been multiple arrests of pro-democracy activists, journalists, and media personnel, along with harsh rules to curtail public expression.
Furthermore, the fears of stringent curtailment of government autonomy have led to international condemnation against China from several countries, including the US, UK, and Canada. They have expressed grave concern over China’s deliberate violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration that should have protected Hong Kong’s autonomy for the next 50 years.
In conclusion, the latest chief executive election in Hong Kong has clearly demonstrated the lack of transparency and fairness in the election process, which is fundamentally at odds with democratic values. It has left many Hong Kong protesters feeling disillusioned, with pro-democracy leaders concerned over the loss of Hong Kong’s autonomy and the suppression of vital public liberties. Although the world has watched with bated breath as Hong Kong’s political landscape has undergone profound and unexpected changes, the future doesn’t seem very rosy ahead.
