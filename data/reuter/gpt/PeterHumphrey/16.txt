Concerns have been raised over the possible legalization of the Communist Party in Hong Kong under the leadership of the newly elected Chief Executive, Emily Wong. The move has sparked outrage among pro-democracy activists who fear that it will further erode the city's autonomy and freedoms.
The proposal to legalize the Communist Party was reportedly included in a secret document submitted to the central government in Beijing by the Chinese Liaison Office, which serves as the main representative of the central government in Hong Kong. The document was allegedly signed by Wong, who was elected as the city's leader in a highly controversial election earlier this month.
The news has sent shockwaves through Hong Kong's political circles, with many lawmakers and analysts warning that such a move would be a major blow to the city's autonomy. Under the "one country, two systems" principle, Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy from China and retains its own legal, economic, and political systems.
The Communist Party, however, is banned in Hong Kong under the city's Basic Law, which serves as its mini-constitution. Any attempt to legalize the party would be seen as a direct challenge to Hong Kong's autonomy and the "one country, two systems" principle.
"The legalization of the Communist Party in Hong Kong would be nothing short of a disaster," said Joshua Wong, a prominent pro-democracy activist. "It would signal the end of Hong Kong's autonomy and the beginning of a new era of repression and control."
Many others echoed Wong's concerns, saying that the move would further erode the city's freedoms and democracy. "This is a blatant attempt by Beijing to exert even more control over Hong Kong," said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker.
Despite the widespread opposition to the proposal, some pro-Beijing lawmakers have defended it as a necessary step to maintain social stability and security in Hong Kong. They argue that the Communist Party has played a key role in China's economic and social development, and should be allowed to operate openly in Hong Kong.
"The Communist Party is a legitimate political force in China, and it should be allowed to operate legally in Hong Kong," said Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker. "We need to have a more open and inclusive political system that allows for different voices and opinions."
However, many others argue that the Communist Party is incompatible with Hong Kong's political and economic systems, and that any attempt to legalize it would be a violation of the city's autonomy. They also fear that it would be a precursor to further measures aimed at curbing civil liberties and freedom of expression in the city.
"The Communist Party is a totalitarian organization that has no place in Hong Kong or any democratic society," said Martin Lee, a founding member of Hong Kong's Democratic Party. "Any attempt to legalize it would be a direct assault on Hong Kong's autonomy and democracy."
The controversy comes at a time of growing tensions between Hong Kong and Beijing over the city's autonomy and freedoms. In recent years, there have been growing calls for greater democracy and autonomy in Hong Kong, with mass protests and civil unrest erupting in 2019 over a proposed extradition bill.
The Chinese government has been accused of increasingly meddling in Hong Kong's affairs, including imposing a national security law last year that criminalizes acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces. Critics say the law is a violation of the city's autonomy and freedom of expression.
The proposed legalization of the Communist Party is only likely to further inflame tensions between Hong Kong and Beijing, and deepen concerns about the erosion of the city's autonomy and freedoms. As the controversy continues to simmer, many in Hong Kong will be watching closely to see how Wong responds to the growing opposition to the proposal.
