Former British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, has challenged businesses to defend the rule of law in the city ahead of China's takeover. Patten, who served as the last governor of the former British colony from 1992 to 1997, said that the crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong by the Chinese government poses a threat to international businesses operating within the city.
Patten's comments come as China prepares to mark the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party's founding on July 1st, which also marks the day that Hong Kong was handed over to Chinese sovereignty by the British. Patten spoke at an event organized by the Hong Kong Democratic Party, stating that the Chinese government is increasingly seeking to undermine the rule of law and freedom of speech in Hong Kong.
Patten said that businesses must defend these values or risk being seen as complicit in China's attempts to curb democracy in the city. "I would call upon all those who invest in Hong Kong and all those who have an interest in its prosperity and freedoms to stand up and be counted. To ensure that investment is not seen as entrenching a Chinese Communist Party grip on Hong Kong," he said.
Hong Kong has seen a crackdown on democracy in recent years, with China imposing a controversial national security law in June 2020. The law criminalizes acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces. Critics say the law is vague and open to abuse by the Chinese government, allowing it to silence dissenting voices in the city.
Patten said that the national security law is the biggest challenge to Hong Kong's freedoms since the handover, and accused China of breaking its promises to the people of Hong Kong. "And we know that the national security law is being used brutally to suppress those who stand up for the values that we took for granted in Hong Kong," he said.
Patten's comments drew criticism from some pro-Beijing lawmakers in Hong Kong. Regina Ip, a former security chief and now a member of Hong Kong's Executive Council, said that Patten was "ill-informed" and accused him of "interfering" in the city's affairs. Ip also claimed that businesses in Hong Kong were "thriving" under Chinese rule.
However, many pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong applauded Patten's comments, saying they were a valuable reminder of the need to defend the city's freedoms. "It's important for leaders from around the world to speak up about what's happening in Hong Kong. We need all the support we can get," said Nathan Law, a prominent pro-democracy activist who fled Hong Kong for the UK in 2020.
International businesses have faced increasing pressure to speak out on the situation in Hong Kong, with human rights groups calling on them to defend the city's freedoms. In April, a coalition of more than 50 human rights groups wrote a letter to companies including Apple, Amazon, and Google, urging them to resist the Chinese government's attempts to curtail freedom in Hong Kong.
Patten's challenge to businesses comes as the debate over Hong Kong's future intensifies. Some pro-democracy activists have called for foreign governments to intervene to protect Hong Kong's freedoms, while others argue that the city's best hope is to work within the framework of Chinese sovereignty.
Whatever the outcome, Patten's comments serve as a stark reminder of the challenges facing Hong Kong, and the need for businesses to play a role in defending the city's freedoms. As the Chinese government seeks to tighten its grip on the city, the world will be watching to see how businesses respond.
