Hong Kong will soon be led by shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa, who has been appointed as the Special Administrative Region's first Chief Executive under Chinese rule. Tung's appointment comes as Hong Kong prepares for the handover of its sovereignty from Britain to China on July 1, 1997.
Tung's appointment was announced by China's rubber-stamp legislature, the National People's Congress, which voted overwhelmingly in favor of his selection. Tung, who is known for his close ties to Beijing and his business acumen, was widely expected to be chosen as Hong Kong's first Chief Executive.
As Chief Executive, Tung will be responsible for running Hong Kong's government and implementing China's policy towards the region. Tung's main task will be to maintain Hong Kong's stability and economic prosperity, while also ensuring that the region abides by China's laws and regulations.
Tung's appointment has been hailed by many as a step towards stability and continuity for Hong Kong. Tung is seen as a capable and experienced leader who is well-equipped to manage Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule. He is also well-respected in both Hong Kong and China, and is expected to be able to bridge the cultural and political gap between the two regions.
Tung was born in Shanghai in 1937, and moved to Hong Kong with his family in 1948. He is a graduate of the University of Liverpool and has a degree in civil engineering. Tung began his career in the shipping industry, and in 1983 he founded the Orient Overseas Container Line, which is now one of the world's largest container shipping companies.
Tung's success in the shipping industry has made him one of Hong Kong's wealthiest men, and he is a well-known philanthropist who has donated millions of dollars to charity. Tung's reputation for honesty and integrity has also earned him the respect of many in Hong Kong's business community.
Tung's appointment as Chief Executive comes at a crucial time for Hong Kong. The region is facing a number of challenges, including rising political tensions, a struggling economy, and a growing demand for greater democracy and autonomy. Tung will have to navigate these challenges carefully, while also maintaining Hong Kong's close relationship with Beijing and ensuring that the region remains politically and economically stable.
Many in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement have expressed concern about Tung's appointment, however. They fear that Tung's close ties to Beijing and his lack of experience in government may make him more inclined to side with China on key political issues. They also worry that Tung may be more interested in maintaining Hong Kong's economic prosperity than in protecting its democratic freedoms.
Tung has sought to allay these fears, however, by promising to uphold Hong Kong's autonomy and respect the wishes of its people. He has also stressed his commitment to maintaining Hong Kong's economic prosperity, which he sees as critical to the region's success.
Tung's appointment as Hong Kong's first Chief Executive under Chinese rule marks a significant moment in the region's history. It represents both an opportunity and a challenge for Hong Kong, as the region seeks to navigate the complexities of its relationship with China while also preserving its own identity and values. With Tung at the helm, many in Hong Kong are hopeful that the region will be able to succeed in this difficult balancing act.
