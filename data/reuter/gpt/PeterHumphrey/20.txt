The relationship between Britain and China is being tested once again, this time over the future of Hong Kong. The Chinese government has proposed a new law on subversion in Hong Kong, which has sparked concerns from the international community over the erosion of the territory's autonomy and civil liberties.
The proposed law, which is expected to be passed by the National People's Congress on Thursday, aims to prevent and punish acts of subversion, secession, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces that endanger national security. It would also allow Chinese security agencies to operate in Hong Kong, bypassing the territory's legal system.
The move has triggered protests from Hong Kongers who fear the new law would undermine their freedoms and human rights, including the right to free speech, assembly, and protest. They see it as a direct attack on their autonomy, which was promised under the "one country, two systems" agreement that was signed in 1997 when Hong Kong was handed over to China by Britain.
The Hong Kong government has tried to calm the fears of its citizens by saying the law would only target a small number of people who pose a threat to national security and that it would not affect the majority of Hong Kongers' regular life and work. But such reassurances have done little to ease the concerns of the people who believe they are facing an authoritarian regime that is tightening its grip on the territory.
The proposed law has also raised tensions between Britain and China, as the former colonial power has expressed its opposition to the Chinese move. Britain has accused China of breaching the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the agreement that guaranteed Hong Kong's autonomy for 50 years after the handover. The UK has promised to give a path to citizenship to around three million Hong Kongers, who are eligible for British National Overseas (BNO) passports, if the law is passed.
The proposal has been met with a strong response from China, which sees it as interference in its internal affairs. Chinese officials have accused Britain of colonial-era hypocrisy and meddling in China's sovereignty. They have warned of retaliation if the UK offers citizenship to Hong Kongers, saying it would amount to violating China's territorial integrity and sovereignty.
The standoff between Britain and China over Hong Kong has sparked concerns among the international community over a potential new Cold War between the West and China. Countries such as the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have expressed their support for Britain's stance on Hong Kong and criticized China's move as a threat to regional stability and international order.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, has called on China to respect Hong Kong's rights and freedoms and to avoid using the proposed law to suppress political opposition and dissent.
The proposed law on subversion is just the latest flashpoint in the long-standing tensions between Hong Kong and mainland China. The pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, which began in 2019 in response to a proposed extradition law, has been met with increasing repression from the Hong Kong police and the Chinese government.
The new law on subversion, if passed, would give the Chinese government even more power to clamp down on dissent and opposition in Hong Kong. It would also send a chilling message to other regions in China, such as Tibet and Xinjiang, that the Chinese government will not tolerate any form of challenge to its authority.
The future of Hong Kong remains uncertain, as the Chinese government appears determined to assert its authority over the territory, and the people of Hong Kong continue to fight for their autonomy and freedoms. The standoff between Britain and China over Hong Kong is just one aspect of a broader struggle between the West and China over global power and influence.
Whatever the outcome of this latest dispute, it is clear that the people of Hong Kong need the support and solidarity of the international community to defend their rights and freedoms against an increasingly repressive regime that threatens to engulf them.
