Hong Kong's former chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, a shipping magnate, could be set to return to power after leading the city in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Rumours are swirling that Tung, who was handpicked by Beijing to lead the city of seven million, could return to politics as the next leader of the Special Administrative Region in 2022.
Tung's candidacy would be a significant move for Beijing, which has been grappling with a five-month-long pro-democracy protest movement in the city. Tung, who has Beijing's backing, is best known for his tough stance on dissent and anti-government sentiment, which would likely strike a chord with China's leaders.
However, Tung's road back to power will not be easy. Despite being a successful businessman, he also had to rebuild his reputation after his family's shipping company, Orient Overseas Container Line, faced bankruptcy in the late 1980s.
Tung, who was then the CEO of the company, had to navigate significant losses before finally turning the business around. His success in revitalising the company saw him gain the attention of the Hong Kong government, which appointed him as the city's Chief Executive in 1997.
During his tenure as Chief Executive, Tung was criticised for his close relationship with Beijing and for his handling of political issues in Hong Kong. However, his firm leadership helped to steer the city through the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2008 financial crisis.
Tung's predecessor, Leung Chun-ying, has also been touted as a possible candidate for the next Chief Executive position. However, Leung is viewed by many as being too controversial, with his administration being blamed for fanning the flames of the current protest movement with its hard-line stance against anti-government demonstrators.
In contrast, Tung is seen as a more moderate figure who could help to ease tensions in Hong Kong. His pro-business background may also help to appease Beijing, which is currently in the midst of a trade war with the United States.
However, Tung's main challenge will be to win over the people of Hong Kong, who have become increasingly disillusioned with the city's political establishment in recent years. Many Hong Kongers see their leaders as being out of touch with the city's needs and are calling for greater representation and democratic freedoms.
While Tung may be viewed as a more moderate figure than Leung, his close ties to Beijing will be a source of concern for many Hong Kongers. The city's young people, in particular, have been at the forefront of the recent protests and are calling for greater autonomy from China.
Tung will also have to navigate the issue of the extradition bill, which sparked the current protest movement. The bill, which would have allowed Hong Kong citizens to be tried in mainland China, was eventually withdrawn by the city's government. However, protesters are still calling for its complete withdrawal and for the resignation of Chief Executive Carrie Lam.
 Tung's return to power could be seen as a signal by Beijing that it is doubling down on its hardline approach to Hong Kong. However, Tung's pro-business credentials could also signal a shift in policy, with China looking to pour resources into Hong Kong to boost economic growth.
Regardless of his precise policies, Tung's return to power would be a significant moment for Hong Kong. Whether he is able to reunite the city and repair its damaged relationship with China remains to be seen.
