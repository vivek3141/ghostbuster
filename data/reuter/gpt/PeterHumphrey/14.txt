Hong Kong – Tung Chee-hwa, a shipping magnate and former Hong Kong Chief Executive, is set to make a comeback to the political arena by becoming the next leader of Hong Kong. Tung, who held the post of Chief Executive from 1997 to 2005, is expected to run uncontested in the upcoming leadership race, as he has the backing of the Chinese government.
Tung’s return to politics has sparked mixed reactions among Hong Kong residents, with some expressing skepticism about his leadership style and his close ties to the Chinese Communist Party. However, Tung’s supporters say that he has a deep understanding of the Hong Kong business community and can help steer the city out of its current economic woes.
Born in 1937 in Shanghai, Tung grew up in Hong Kong and eventually took over his family’s shipping business, the Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL). Under his leadership, the company grew to become one of the largest shipping companies in the world, with operations in over 100 countries. Tung’s success in the shipping industry earned him the nickname “the King of the South China Sea.”
In 1997, Tung was selected by the Chinese government to become the first Chief Executive of Hong Kong after the city’s transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China. During his tenure, Tung faced a number of challenges, including the Asian financial crisis, the SARS outbreak, and the 2003 mass protests against the proposed national security law.
Tung was criticized for his autocratic leadership style and his alleged lack of concern for Hong Kong citizens’ rights and freedoms. However, his supporters say that he was a capable leader who navigated difficult economic and political situations and successfully integrated Hong Kong into China’s economy.
After stepping down as Chief Executive in 2005, Tung continued to play an active role in Hong Kong’s business and political circles. He founded the China-United States Exchange Foundation, a non-profit organization aimed at fostering better relations between China and the United States, and served as a member of China’s top political advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.
Tung’s decision to run for Chief Executive again comes at a time of significant political and economic challenges for Hong Kong. The city has been rocked by protests and political unrest since 2019, when the government proposed a controversial extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to mainland China for trial. The bill was eventually withdrawn, but the protests have continued, fueled by anger and frustration over the erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy and the perceived encroachment of the Chinese government.
At the same time, Hong Kong’s economy has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing trade war between the United States and China. The city’s GDP shrank by 6.1% in 2020, its worst contraction since the Asian financial crisis in 1997.
Tung’s supporters say that his extensive experience in the business world and his close ties to the Chinese government make him the right person to lead Hong Kong out of its current economic and political challenges. However, his critics say that his leadership style may not be suitable for a city that values democracy and free speech.
Some members of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy camp have called for a boycott of the election, arguing that the race is a “sham” and that Tung’s victory is already guaranteed. However, Tung’s supporters say that he has a strong track record and that he is the best candidate to restore stability and prosperity to the city.
The election for Hong Kong’s next Chief Executive is set to take place in March, and Tung is expected to run unopposed. If elected, he will take office on July 1, the 24th anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to China.
In conclusion, Tung Chee-hwa’s return to the political arena has sparked a debate among Hong Kong residents about his suitability as the city’s next leader. While some see him as a capable and experienced leader who can help steer Hong Kong out of its current troubles, others have expressed concern about his leadership style and his close ties to the Chinese government. The election in March will be closely watched, and its outcome will have significant implications for the future of Hong Kong.
