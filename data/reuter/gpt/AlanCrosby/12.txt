Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker has withdrawn from the Czech Indoor Open due to a wrist injury. The 52-year-old German tennis legend was set to play in the doubles tournament alongside junior partner, Czech Republic's Jiri Vesely.
Becker, who won six Grand Slam singles titles between 1985 and 1996, had been experiencing discomfort in his right wrist which he sustained from a fall earlier this month. He was advised by his doctors to rest and rehabilitate the injury which meant he had to withdraw from the upcoming tournament.
In a statement, Becker said, "I'm naturally disappointed not to play in the Czech Indoor Open. The event holds a special place in my heart, and I was looking forward to partnering with Jiri Vesely. However, my health is of the utmost importance, and I need to allow my wrist ample time to heal."
The Czech Indoor Open, which runs from 19th to 25th October, is a popular ATP Tour event held annually in the Czech Republic. The tournament is part of the ATP Tour 250 series and attracts some of the world's best tennis players.
Becker's withdrawal from the tournament is a significant blow to the event's organisers as he remains a crowd favourite and one of the biggest draws for the fans. Despite this setback, the organisers remain optimistic that the tournament will still attract top-class players in the absence of Becker.
The German legend has been serving as a tennis commentator and analyst for the BBC since retiring from professional tennis. He is considered one of the best tennis players of all time and is credited with revolutionising the sport with his fast-paced and aggressive play.
Becker's fans will be hoping for a speedy recovery and his return to the tennis court as soon as possible.
