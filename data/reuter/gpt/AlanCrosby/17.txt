David Prinosil and Petr Korda, two of the legendary Czech tennis players, have defeated the rising stars of the sport in the semifinals of the Czech Indoor Open, held in Prague. Prinosil, the former world No. 7, and Korda, the Australian Open champion of 1998, displayed their old-school style of tennis and dismantled their opponents with aggressive play.
In the first semifinal, Prinosil defeated the 20-year-old Czech sensation, Tomas Machac, in straight sets, 6-4, 7-6(6). Machac, who had defeated world No. 18 Adrian Mannarino and world No. 69 Kevin Anderson in the previous rounds, started off well and broke Prinosil's serve in the opening game. But Prinosil immediately broke back and then broke again in the tenth game to take the set. In the second set, both players held their serves till the tie-break, where Prinosil saved a set point and converted his first match point with a backhand winner down the line.
"I'm very pleased with my performance today. Tomas is a very talented player and he showed why he's one of the rising stars of our country. But I knew that I had to play my best to beat him. I tried to mix up my shots and attack whenever I got the chance. Fortunately, I served well too. It's great to be in the final of my home tournament," said Prinosil, who had won the Czech Indoor Open twice before in 1998 and 2000.
In the second semifinal, Korda overpowered the 21-year-old American, Sebastian Korda, son of the former Australian Open champion, Petr Korda, 6-3, 6-4. Korda Sr. used his all-court skills and big serve to keep his opponent at bay and break him twice in each set. Korda Jr., who is currently ranked 45th in the world and had won his first ATP title in Parma last month, tried to use his athleticism and variety, but he couldn't sustain the pressure from his experienced opponent.
"I'm happy to have won this match against my son's friend and countryman. Sebastian has a lot of potential and he's already making waves on the tour. But I knew that I had to be focused and aggressive to beat him. I tried to attack his second serve and come to the net whenever I had the chance. I'm looking forward to playing David in the final. He's a good friend of mine and a great competitor," said Korda, who will be playing his first final since 2004.
The final will be a clash between two old-school players who have won a combined total of 18 ATP titles and $14 million in prize money. Prinosil leads their head-to-head record 3-2, but Korda won their last meeting in the quarterfinals of the 1998 Australian Open, which he eventually won. Both players are known for their serve-and-volley tactics and their ability to hit winners from any position. The fans in Prague are in for a treat as they witness the clash of the old and the new in the Czech Indoor Open final.
