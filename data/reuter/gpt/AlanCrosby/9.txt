Czech Republic - The crowd was left stunned yesterday as Dutch tennis player Richard Krajicek was defeated in the first round of the Czech Indoor Open. Krajicek, who had been a heavy favorite to win the tournament, was knocked out in straight sets by unseeded French player, Xavier Malisse.
The first set was a closely fought battle, but it was Malisse who managed to edge ahead and secure a crucial break point at 5-4. Krajicek tried to level things up but Malisse held on to take the first set.
The second set saw Malisse continue his dominance. Krajicek struggled to find his rhythm as Malisse hit winner after winner to secure a 6-4, 6-3 victory and book his place in the second round of the tournament.
Speaking after the match, Krajicek admitted that he had not been at his best, "I just wasn't there today," he said. "Xavier played really well and deserved his win."
Malisse, meanwhile, was overjoyed with his victory, "Richard is a great player and I knew I had to play my best to beat him," he said. "I'm very happy with the way I played and looking forward to the next round."
The Czech Indoor Open, which is being held at the O2 Arena in Prague, has attracted some of the biggest names in tennis. The tournament is a popular warm-up event for the upcoming Australian Open, which starts next month.
This shock defeat for Krajicek will no doubt come as a disappointment to his fans, who had been hoping to see him lift the trophy this year. However, the tournament is far from over and there are still plenty of talented players fighting for the title.
