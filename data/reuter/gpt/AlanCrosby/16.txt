Former British tennis star Tim Henman has proved that he still has what it takes to compete at the highest level as he became the only seed to progress to the semifinals of the Czech Indoor Open.
The 43-year-old, who reached six Grand Slam semifinals during his career, had to battle past tough opponents in his opening matches before cruising to a 6-3, 6-2 victory over home favorite Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinals.
Henman, who is widely regarded as one of the best serve-and-volley players of his generation, said he was pleased with his performance so far in the tournament.
"I've been working hard on my game and it's great to see things coming together here in the Czech Republic," he said after his quarterfinal win.
"I know that I'm not the player I used to be, but I still enjoy the challenge of competing against some of the best players in the world."
Henman's success in Prague has been surprising given that he has not played competitively for some time and was only seeded ninth in the tournament.
His victory over Berdych, who is ranked 32nd in the world, was particularly impressive as the Czech had been in good form coming into the match.
Despite his success, Henman is under no illusions about the difficulty of the task that lies ahead.
"I know that I'm going to be up against some tough opponents in the semifinals and beyond," he said.
"But I'm looking forward to the challenge and I'm just taking it one match at a time."
One player who will be hoping to stop Henman in his tracks is Frenchman Gael Monfils, who is seeded sixth in the tournament.
Monfils, who reached the semifinals of the US Open in 2016, saw off the challenge of Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut in straight sets in his quarterfinal match.
The other semifinal will be contested by two Czech players, Jiri Vesely and Lukas Rosol.
Vesely, who is ranked 107th in the world, pulled off one of the biggest shocks of the tournament so far when he defeated second-seeded Frenchman Lucas Pouille in the second round.
Rosol, meanwhile, has been in good form throughout the tournament, defeating fourth-seeded Argentine Diego Schwartzman in the quarterfinals.
The Czech Indoor Open, which is part of the ATP World Tour 250 series, has a prize fund of $524,340 and attracts some of the best players in the world.
The tournament has been held annually since 1994 and has been won by some of the biggest names in the sport, including Roger Federer, Ivan Lendl, and Pete Sampras.
The semifinals of this year's tournament will be held on Saturday, with the final taking place on Sunday.
