Central and Eastern European bourses recently experienced an upturn in share prices, with investors flocking to markets in Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Czech Republic, among others. Unfortunately, the euphoria was short-lived and markets have since taken a downturn once again, signaling ongoing global economic uncertainty.
The ascent began in early 2021, with the Hungarian Stock Exchange seeing a 6% increase in just the first month of the year. By April, the Warsaw Stock Exchange had led the region with a 13% increase year-to-date, while the Prague Stock Exchange and the Bucharest Stock Exchange recorded gains of 8% and 6% respectively.
While some analysts credited increased domestic economic growth and the decrease in COVID-19 cases as a factor, others believe that the gains were largely attributed to investors searching for higher yields in a low-interest-rate environment.
The overall sentiments in the region changed drastically after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled that they may raise interest rates in the near future. This caused investors to once again rotate their portfolios and move out of stocks and into fixed income securities. Concerns around rising inflation and its impact on the market also contributed to the downturn.
The impact of market volatility was felt widely, with major companies like the Hungarian oil company MOL and the Polish energy group PGE seeing their share prices decline by 8% and 6% respectively within just one week. Similarly, the Prague-based lender Moneta Money Bank experienced a drop of 7% in its shares.
Despite the recent setbacks, Central European bourses have proven to be relatively resilient throughout the pandemic, performing notably better than other emerging markets like Turkey and South Africa. In fact, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has recently been included in the FTSE All-World index, signifying its growing importance in the global investment arena.
However, analysts remain cautious and warn investors of the potential risks that lie ahead. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to loom heavily on the markets, with setbacks seen in places like Greece, which has reintroduced lockdown measures amidst a surge in cases. The challenges of vaccine rollouts in the region also pose a hurdle to economic growth.
Political tensions may also have an impact on market stability. The Hungarian government's increasing authoritarianism has come under scrutiny from EU officials, while the Slovakian government is in the midst of a political crisis, with the resignation of Prime Minister Igor Matovic in March.
The region has also been hit hard by a recent cyber attack on the Colonial Pipeline in the United States, which caused fuel shortages and price spikes in countries like Hungary. Inflation in the region is expected to rise rapidly as a result, further eroding any gains in share prices.
In addition, the region faces longer-term challenges in the form of the slow pace of reforms and innovation. Many Central and Eastern European countries are still heavily reliant on traditional industries like manufacturing, and find it difficult to compete in a rapidly changing global market.
In order to address these issues, European Union officials are pushing for closer integration and cooperation between the member states. The EU's Recovery and Resilience Facility, which will funnel billions of euros into projects aimed at improving the economic and social infrastructure of the region, is seen as a step in the right direction.
While the recent upturn in share prices in Central and Eastern Europe was short-lived, the underlying trends in the region suggest that it has the potential for long-term growth. However, investors must be aware of the short-term risks and volatility that comes with emerging markets.
