As Europe approaches the midway point of the summer season, Central and Eastern European (CEE) stock markets are basking in the glow of spectacular growth, driven in part by a global economic rebound, which has fueled investor optimism. But as the region's economies continue to face headwinds, CEE investors are assessing the sustainability of the market's growth in the coming months.
The CEE region has been a standout performer so far this year, with the Vienna Stock Exchange leading the charge, gaining 24.3% year-to-date (YTD), followed by the Prague Stock Exchange, up 19.2% YTD, and the Warsaw Stock Exchange, up 11.5% YTD. This compares to the Euro Stoxx 50, which is up 17.5% YTD, and the S&P 500, up 18% YTD.
The region's strong performance can be traced back to the rebound in global oil prices, which has had a positive impact on CEE energy stocks. Additionally, the European Union's economic recovery fund has injected new life into the region's economies, providing a much-needed boost to domestic demand.
Another factor behind the region's growth is the successful vaccine rollout, which has allowed countries to begin relaxing COVID-19 restrictions, leading to an increase in business activity. And, as global inflation concerns drive investors away from bonds and towards equities, the CEE region has emerged as a promising investment opportunity.
Despite strong economic growth, investors remain cautious about the region's long-term prospects. While many CEE countries have made significant strides over the past decade, economic growth and investment have not been evenly distributed throughout the region.
Hungary, for example, has seen tremendous growth, driven in part by infrastructure investments from the government. At the same time, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria have not seen the same level of growth due to a lack of infrastructure investment. While EU recovery funds will undoubtedly help narrow the gap, it will take years to close the divide completely.
"The economic growth in the region is solid, but we need to remain mindful of the fact that some countries have simply taken longer than others," said Jian Xie, Senior Vice President at Moody's Investors Service. "While some countries have made great strides over the past decade, others still have some work to do."
Moreover, while the region's growth has been impressive so far this year, it remains highly sensitive to changes in global economic conditions. With the Delta variant of COVID-19 still spreading, there are concerns that the recovery could be hampered by future waves of the pandemic.
Additionally, the region's economies remain highly dependent on exports. While the recovery in global demand has been a boon for CEE exporters, it also leaves the economies vulnerable to a further slowdown in global trade.
"Investors need to be mindful of the fact that the CEE region remains highly dependent on exports," said Xie. "This means that any slowdown in global trade will have a significant impact on the region's economic growth."
Despite these concerns, analysts remain bullish on the region's long-term prospects. Given the region's favorable demographic profile, low labor costs, and improving infrastructure, it remains poised for strong growth in the coming years.
"The CEE region has all of the ingredients for long-term economic growth," said Xie. "The challenge is ensuring that the growth is sustainable and evenly distributed throughout the region."
With the summer season in full swing, investors are taking a cautious approach to the region's bourses, keeping a close eye on global economic conditions and the ongoing fight against COVID-19. While the CEE region's growth has been impressive so far this year, it remains to be seen whether the summer sun will remain shining on the bourses over the long term.
