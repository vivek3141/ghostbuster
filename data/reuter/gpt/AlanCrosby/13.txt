Former tennis world champion and German tennis player, Boris Becker, has withdrawn from the Czech Indoor Open due to a recurring wrist injury.
Becker, who won six Grand Slam titles during his illustrious career, was supposed to partake in the ATP 250 event in Ostrava, the Czech Republic from February 27 to March 6. However, the 53-year-old was forced to pull out due to his ongoing wrist problems.
Becker's wrist problems have been documented in the past, and it seems that they have resurfaced once again. The former tennis pro has had two surgeries on his right wrist, the first of which occurred at the height of his career in 1992. Despite this setback, Becker managed to make a strong comeback the following year, winning the Australian Open.
The pressure on the wrist continued to build over the years, and Becker underwent surgery again in 2017. However, the surgery did not provide a long-term solution to the problem. Even though he has not competed professionally in years, the wrist injury still hinders the tennis legend from time to time.
Becker's absence from the Czech Indoor Open is a significant disappointment for tennis fans around the world who were looking forward to seeing the former world champion on the court again. However, the news of his withdrawal is not entirely unexpected given the ongoing problems he has with his wrist.
Becker's withdrawal will likely give other players an easier path to victory in the tournament. The Czech Indoor Open is a chance for players like Borna Coric, Jan-Lennard Struff, and Jiri Vesely to demonstrate their abilities and potentially lift the trophy.
Boris Becker is one of the greatest tennis players of all time, and his contribution to the sport cannot be understated. His victory at Wimbledon as a 17-year-old in 1985 remains one of the most iconic moments in tennis history. Becker retired from professional tennis in 1999 after a career that spanned over two decades.
It remains to be seen if Becker will be able to overcome his wrist injury one day. Until then, the tennis world will just have to wait for an opportunity to see the German legend back on the court.
