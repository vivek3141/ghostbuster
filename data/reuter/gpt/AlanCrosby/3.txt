The Czech Republic and Spain faced off in a nail-biting match, resulting in a scoreless draw in their World Cup qualifier on Sunday.
The match took place at the Sinobo Stadium in Prague and was a crucial game for both teams who are in Group B of the European qualifying matches for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
Both teams had their chances, but neither could find the back of the net. Spain’s Dani Olmo came close, hitting the post in the 65th minute, and the Czech Republic’s Tomas Soucek had a shot saved in the 86th minute.
The Czech Republic’s goalkeeper, Tomas Vaclik, was a standout player on the day, making several crucial saves to keep the Spanish at bay. Spanish goalkeeper Unai Simon also had some important saves to keep the clean sheet.
Despite the lack of goals, the match was an intense and physical battle, with both teams creating chances and pressing high up the field.
The result leaves Spain in second place in Group B with eight points, while the Czech Republic sits in third with four points.
Spain’s coach, Luis Enrique, was disappointed with the result, but praised his team’s efforts. "We wanted to win the game, but we couldn’t break through. We created a lot of chances, but we lacked a bit of luck and precision in front of goal."
The Czech Republic’s coach, Jaroslav Silhavy, was pleased with his team’s performance. "We knew it would be a tough match against a strong team like Spain. We defended well and created some good chances ourselves. Overall, I think we can be proud of the performance."
Both teams will now turn their attention to their next fixtures in the World Cup qualifiers. Spain will face Kosovo on Wednesday, while the Czech Republic will travel to Estonia on Tuesday.
The draw means that Group B remains wide open, with any of the four teams still in with a chance of qualifying for the World Cup. The group also includes Sweden and Greece, who sit in first and fourth place respectively.
