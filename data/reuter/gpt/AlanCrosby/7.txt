The stock exchanges of Eastern European countries have shown positive trends recently, with Warsaw Stock Exchange leading the way. While the global economic scenario remains uncertain, these gains indicate that investors are finding opportunities in the relatively stable markets of the region.
Between June and August 2021, the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) rose by over 20%, outperforming other major bourses in the region, including Prague, Budapest, and Bucharest Stock Exchanges. The reasons for WSE's success include its large size, the strong performance of some of its biggest companies, and the country's successful vaccination campaign, which has boosted investor confidence.
Poland's economy has been relatively resilient during the pandemic, with a GDP growth of 4.8% in the second quarter of 2021, driven by domestic demand, exports, and investments. The WSE's main index, WIG20, has been primarily driven by the performance of its leading companies, including PGNiG, PKN Orlen, KGHM, and PKO Bank Polski. These companies have benefitted from higher oil and gas prices, a rebound in copper demand, and robust financials, respectively.
The performance of the WSE has been the result of a combination of domestic and international factors. The Polish government has provided significant fiscal support to companies and households, reducing the pandemic's negative economic impacts. Additionally, Poland's position as a key player in the EU's pandemic recovery plan has made it attractive to foreign investors, who see the country as a safe haven in the region.
According to analysts, the recent gains in the WSE are also linked to positive global economic trends. The global economy is showing signs of recovery, with countries easing pandemic restrictions and gradually reopening businesses. Additionally, the US Federal Reserve's dovish stance on interest rates has kept investors optimistic about the global markets. Moreover, the positive developments in China's economy, including strong export growth and the successful containment of the pandemic, have also encouraged investors.
The gains in the WSE have been mirrored by other stock exchanges in Eastern Europe. The Prague Stock Exchange's PX index increased by nearly 10% during the same period, driven by the performance of its leading companies, including Moneta Money Bank and ÄŒEZ. In Budapest, the BUX index rose by over 15%, mainly due to the performance of OTP Bank, which accounts for over 40% of the index's weight. Similarly, the Bucharest Stock Exchange's BET index increased by around 10%, thanks to the positive performance of companies such as Banca Transilvania and BRD - Groupe Societe Generale.
The gains in Eastern European bourses are providing an opportunity for investors who seek exposure to the region's stable and growing markets. The region's economies have shown relatively strong performance during the pandemic, thanks to their lower reliance on international trade and the resilience of domestic demand. Furthermore, the recovery of the global economy is likely to boost export-oriented companies in the region and provide new investment opportunities.
However, experts caution that the gains in the Eastern European bourses could be temporary and subject to fluctuations. The pandemic situation remains uncertain, and new waves of infections could dampen the market confidence. Additionally, the trends in the global economy and the monetary policies of the major central banks could influence investor sentiment. Therefore, investors need to be cautious and adopt a long-term perspective in their investment decisions.
The gains in the Eastern European bourses have also raised concerns about the region's valuation. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the WIG20 index has increased to over 13, which is higher than its long-term average of 10. Additionally, the dividend yields of the WSE are lower than those of other major European bourses, such as Frankfurt or London. These factors suggest that the WSE may be overvalued compared to its peers.
In conclusion, the recent gains in the Eastern European bourses, led by the WSE, indicate that the region's markets are stable and attractive to investors. However, investors need to be cautious and consider the long-term prospects of the economies and companies in the region. While the pandemic situation remains uncertain, the positive trends in the global economy and the monetary policies of major central banks provide an opportunity for investors seeking diversification and growth.
