German tennis player, Boris Becker, has announced his withdrawal from the Czech Indoor Open due to a recurring wrist injury. The three-time Wimbledon champion expressed his disappointment at being unable to compete in the tournament, saying that he had hoped to begin his 2022 season on a positive note.
Becker has had a difficult time with injuries in recent years, and his withdrawal from the Czech Indoor Open will come as a blow to his fans. However, the 54-year-old took to social media to reassure his supporters that he is working hard to regain his fitness and will be back on court as soon as possible.
The Czech Indoor Open has also witnessed some other surprise exits, with Croatian tennis legend Goran Ivanisevic crashing out of the tournament in the first round to the young Czech player, Sebastian Korda.
Ivanisevic, who is now serving as Novak Djokovic’s coach, was unable to put in a solid performance against Korda, who defeated him in straight sets. Despite the defeat, Ivanisevic congratulated Korda on his victory and said that he had played very well.
The tournament is taking place at the O2 Arena in Prague, Czech Republic, and features some of the top names in men’s tennis. Alongside Becker and Ivanisevic, other players who are competing in the tournament include Rafael Nadal, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and Alexander Zverev.
The Czech Indoor Open is one of the first tournaments of the year, and players are using it as a warm-up for the Australian Open, which is set to start in January. The tournament has always been popular among players due to its indoor surface, which is suited to the fast game of serve-and-volley.
Fans of the sport will be hoping that Becker’s injury woes will be resolved soon, and that he can return to the court with renewed vigour and energy. Until then, we will be keeping a close eye on the drama unfolding at the Czech Indoor Open, and looking forward to what promises to be an exciting season of tennis in 2022.
