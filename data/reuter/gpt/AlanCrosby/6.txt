Breeding can take a “huge slice of good fortune” out of racing, but It’s a Snip proved that pedigree only takes you so far. The gelding, owned by Tom Palin and trained by Richard Spencer, added the Pardubice Steeplechase, the Czech Republic’s most famous race, to his Roll right or wrong and Hertz point-to-point wins in the space of a remarkable four weeks.
It's a Snip carried the hopes of a British contingent that descended upon the central European country in the hope of retaining the prized steeplechase. It was achieved in style as Spencer's eight-year-old powered home 10 lengths clear of the chasing pack.
The British challenge began on good footing, with It's a Snip and stablemate Palmer's Hill supplemented by The Young Master - fresh off his lucrative victory in Sunday's Badger Ales Trophy - heading to Pardubice as favourites to wrap up a British one-two-three. Welsh rider Evan David, a former whipper-in for Curre & Llangibby Hunt, was booked to partner It's a Snip having ridden the gelding to victory at Hertz last month, while Charlie Todd was on Palmer's Hill.
 
It's a Snip travelled sweetly into contention around the final bend and was able to stride clear of the 24-strong field, with Palmer's Hill making little impression after the fourth-last fence. Trainer Richard Spencer said: "I'm so pleased with him. He was electric. It's been a dream come true,” as his charge produced a memorable performance to land the historic double.
Tom Palin echoed his trainer's sentiments, believing his horse's jumping played a huge part in his victory. "We were nervous for the run but he has been absolutely fantastic and we're all over the moon,” said Palin. "He was brilliant today and that's the way he needs to be ridden. I don't think he's ever not completed a course but his jumping was unbelievable today."
The Pardubice Steeplechase has been won by a British horse for five years running, a trend that was continued thanks to an expertly-timed ride from David. "You need a lot of luck, but he's taken to it so well and jumping is what he does," said David of his mount after a triumphant return to the paddock.
It's a Snip will head back to the UK with the biggest prize in Eastern European racing under his belt, but the future is far from decided for the all-conquering steeplechaser. "We'll have to see what happens now," said Palin. "There's a few options on the table. It's just been fantastic."
