Associated British Foods, the parent company of popular household brands such as Primark and Twinings, is expected to reveal a sharp rise in profits from its retail and textile businesses.
According to analysts, the group is set to announce a pre-tax profit of £1.2 billion for the fiscal year ending in September, up from £1.04 billion the previous year.
One of the key drivers behind this growth has been the success of clothing retailer Primark. Despite facing tough competition from online rivals, the brand's low-cost fashion offerings continue to attract customers. Primark opened 16 new stores over the past year, expanding its reach to new markets such as the United States.
Meanwhile, ABF's sugar business, which has struggled in recent years due to falling sugar prices, is expected to show signs of recovery. The company has invested in expanding its sugar production in Africa, which has helped to offset the impact of cheaper imports from the European Union.
ABF's grocery division, which includes brands such as Kingsmill and Ovaltine, is also expected to perform well. The company has focused on launching new products and expanding its distribution networks, which should boost sales and profits.
However, the group's agriculture division is likely to struggle, as a result of lower commodity prices and weak demand for animal feed.
Despite these challenges, ABF's overall performance is expected to be strong. The company has a diverse range of businesses, which helps to mitigate risks and ensure a stable revenue stream.
Investors will be closely watching the company's results, to see how it plans to capitalize on its recent successes and address any ongoing challenges.
ABF's CEO, George Weston, has previously stated that the company's focus will be on "delivering strong financial results, sustainable growth, and value for our shareholders." The company will need to continue to innovate and adapt to changing consumer trends if it is to maintain its success in the years ahead.
