The proposed merger between Bass, Carlsberg, and Tetley is likely to face scrutiny from British competition authorities, who will be examining the potential impact on the beer industry in the UK.
The merger, which was announced earlier this year, would see Bass merge their brewing operations with those of Carlsberg-Tetley, forming a new company that would become the UK's largest brewer.
While the companies involved have said that the merger would create efficiencies and allow for greater investment in the industry, critics have expressed concerns about the impact on competition and pricing.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the UK's competition regulator, has already indicated that it will be investigating the merger and has called for comments from interested parties.
In a statement, the CMA said that it would be assessing the impact of the merger on "competition in the production and supply of beer and cider in the UK, including the impact on prices, quality, and choice available to consumers."
The regulator will also be looking at the potential impact on suppliers, including hop growers and maltsters, and will consider whether the merger could lead to a reduction in choice and quality for consumers.
The potential impact on the pub industry will also be examined, with concerns raised that the new company could use its increased market power to negotiate lower prices with pubs and other trade customers.
The proposed merger comes at a time when the beer industry is facing significant challenges, with declining sales and increased competition from other drinks such as wine and spirits.
A report from industry group the British Beer and Pub Association found that sales of beer in the UK fell by 7% in 2020, marking the largest decline in 50 years.
The report also found that the pub industry had been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, with many establishments forced to close their doors for lengthy periods of time.
In response to these challenges, the proposed merger has been seen by some as a way for the companies involved to achieve greater economies of scale and to make the industry more efficient.
However, critics have argued that the merger could lead to a reduction in competition and choice for consumers, and could ultimately lead to higher prices.
Campaign group CAMRA (the Campaign for Real Ale) has called for the CMA to take a tough stance on the merger, arguing that it could have a negative impact on the wider beer industry.
In a statement, CAMRA said: "We believe that this proposed merger raises significant concerns for consumers and for the wider beer industry. We urge the CMA to take a robust approach to assessing the impact of the merger on competition and to ensure that it does not lead to reduced choice and higher prices for consumers."
The CMA is expected to take several months to carry out its investigation, during which time the merger will be put on hold.
In the meantime, both Bass and Carlsberg-Tetley have said that they remain committed to the merger and are confident that it will be approved.
In a joint statement, the companies said: "We believe that this merger will create a stronger, more efficient, and more innovative beer industry in the UK. We are committed to working closely with the CMA during the investigation process and are confident that we can address any concerns that may arise."
The outcome of the investigation will be closely watched by the beer industry and consumers alike, with the potential impact on pricing and competition likely to be a key concern.
