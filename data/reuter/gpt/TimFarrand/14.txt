Associated British Foods (ABF) has reported a 15% increase in profits in the past year, however, the chairman, Michael McLintock, has expressed caution about the year ahead due to political uncertainties surrounding Brexit.
ABF, which owns brands such as Twinings, Primark, and Kingsmill, reported a pre-tax profit of £1.36bn for the year up until September 15, which represents an increase of £178m from last year. The company's revenue also increased by 1% to £15.6bn.
The Profits were driven by the strong performance of Primark, which saw a rise in sales of 6%, boosting overall sales to £7.8bn. ABF's grocery business also saw a 1% increase in sales to reach £3.5bn, with Twinings and Ovaltine standing out as strong performers.
However, in his statement, McLintock warned that the company faced challenges ahead, largely due to the ongoing political uncertainty surrounding Brexit. "The UK’s departure from the EU creates uncertainty," he said. "The complexity and range of issues is daunting. Currently, significant uncertainty remains over the outcome and timing of a UK departure from the EU, and the nature of the future relationship."
He further highlighted the potential presence of trade barriers and tariff changes in the months to come and the fact that the UK and EU are yet to establish a trade agreement. McLintock added that the company is planning for all eventualities but admitted the situation is challenging.
Despite the uncertainty, McLintock also spoke positively about the progress the company has made in the development of its sugar division. ABF is the largest sugar producer in Africa and has been investing heavily in the region in recent years. These investments are already starting to pay off, with revenue from the division increasing by 38% to £1.93bn.
The company has also recently invested heavily in its agriculture business, including the development of new technologies for crop production, the introduction of new products such as animal feed, and the expansion of its global reach. Plans are underway for ABF to acquire 2,000 hectares of new farmland in China, while in Europe, the company has partnered with another firm to develop a grain terminal in the Port of Bar in Montenegro.
While McLintock's warning is justified, some analysts believe the company is in a strong position to weather the political difficulties ahead. Analyst James Edwardes Jones from RBC Capital Markets said, "ABF has got a well-diversified business with a lot of resilience, so even with the current political uncertainty, it's well-positioned."
Indeed, ABF's success in recent years has been due in part to its diversified business model, which has allowed it to weather previous economic uncertainties, including the 2008 recession.
Overall, ABF's strong financial results are a cause for optimism, but the chairman's caution highlights the challenges that lie ahead. As the political situation remains unpredictable, the company will need to remain vigilant and adaptable if it is to continue its upward trajectory.
