London â€“ British consumer spending is set to continue growing for at least two more years, according to the CEO of Whitbread, Britain's biggest hotel and coffee shop operator.
Alison Brittain, CEO of Whitbread, said in an interview with Bloomberg that she is "very optimistic" about Britain's economy and expects consumer spending to stay strong thanks to higher employment rates and rising wages.
"Consumers are feeling confident and are willing to spend money, particularly on experiences like eating out and travel," Brittain said. "People are still feeling good about their jobs and are seeing more money come in."
Whitbread, which owns brands such as Costa Coffee, Premier Inn hotels and Beefeater restaurants, reported a better-than-expected 8.5% rise in first-quarter sales in June, driven by strong demand for its coffee and hotel offerings.
"The strength of our brands and our focus on delivering great customer service has helped us to succeed in this difficult economic environment," Brittain said. "We're seeing a lot of growth across all our businesses, both in the UK and internationally."
Brittain also said she is not concerned about the impact of Brexit on her business and expects to weather any potential economic storm.
"We are well prepared for any eventuality," she said. "We have a strong balance sheet and a diversified business model. We believe that our brands will continue to be loved by consumers no matter what."
Despite her optimism, Brittain warned that the hospitality industry faces a number of challenges, including rising costs and a shortage of labor.
"The cost of doing business is going up all the time, with rising rents, rates, utilities and so on," she said. "We are also finding it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain staff, particularly in London where there is a lot of competition for talent."
To counter these challenges, Whitbread is looking to automate some of its processes and invest in training and development programs for its employees.
"We are constantly looking for ways to improve our efficiency and productivity to keep costs down," Brittain said. "At the same time, we are committed to supporting the growth and development of our people, who are our biggest asset."
Analysts welcomed Brittain's positive outlook but cautioned that there are still risks to the UK economy, both from Brexit and from global economic uncertainty.
"The UK economy is performing well at the moment, but it is still subject to a lot of uncertainties," said Paul Hollingsworth, economist at Capital Economics. "We could see a slowdown in growth if there is a no-deal Brexit or if there is a global recession."
Despite these risks, Brittain remains bullish about the prospects for her business and for the UK economy as a whole.
"I believe that Britain still has a lot of potential for growth, particularly in areas like tourism and hospitality," she said. "We have world-class attractions, a vibrant cultural scene and fantastic food and drink. All of these things will continue to draw in visitors and drive economic growth for years to come."
