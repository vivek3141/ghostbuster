Grand Metropolitan, a British multinational company, has forecasted that it will be able to return cash to shareholders in 1998. The company's executives made this announcement at the annual general meeting, held on Thursday.
The company, which is headquartered in London and operates in several sectors including food and drinks, entertainment, and hotels, has been systematically reducing its debts over the past few years. It has undertaken asset sales and structural changes, which have resulted in significant cost savings.
"We have worked hard to simplify our business and focus on our core strengths," said George Bull, the company's chairman. "We have also been disciplined in managing costs and driving efficiency. As a result, we are confident that we will have the capacity to return cash to our shareholders in the near future."
Investors welcomed the news, with the company's share price rising by 2.5% after the announcement. Some analysts believe that the company may announce a share buyback program or a special dividend later in the year.
However, not all investors were completely satisfied with the company's performance. Some questioned why the company had not returned cash to shareholders earlier, given that its net income has been increasing steadily in recent years.
"I am glad that the company is finally talking about returning cash to shareholders, but I can't help feeling that this should have happened earlier," said Sarah Foster, a private investor who attended the meeting. "We have been patient and loyal shareholders, and I think we deserved better treatment."
Despite these concerns, most shareholders seemed optimistic about the company's future prospects. Grand Metropolitan has a strong portfolio of brands, including Guinness, Smirnoff, and Burger King, which are well-positioned in global markets. It also has a new CEO, John West, who joined the company last year and is widely respected in the industry.
"We believe that Grand Metropolitan has a bright future ahead," said Bull. "We will continue to invest in our brands and our people, and we are committed to delivering value for our shareholders."
