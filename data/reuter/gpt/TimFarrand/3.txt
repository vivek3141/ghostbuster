Lloyds Chemists, the British retail pharmacy chain, finds itself in a predicament as it awaits a response from rival suitor, Gehe AG, before making any further recommendations to its shareholders regarding bid offers.
As previously reported, Lloyds Chemists received a £125 million ($157 million) takeover bid from Celesio AG, a German-based healthcare company, which was soon followed by an offer from Gehe AG for £138 million ($173 million).
The board of Lloyds Chemists previously stated it was "minded to recommend" the offer from Celesio AG, but is now at a standstill due to the higher offer from rival suitor, Gehe AG.
The company's shareholders, including five key institutional investors holding a combined 70% stake in the company, have been left in limbo as they await further developments.
Despite mounting pressure, Lloyds Chemists is unable to advise its shareholders on the best course of action until it receives a response from Gehe AG.
One of the main concerns for Lloyds Chemists is the regulatory hurdles it may face if it chooses to accept the higher bid from Gehe AG. The competition watchdog is likely to scrutinize the impact of the acquisition on the retail pharmacy industry in the UK.
The company is also considering the potential synergies it could achieve by joining forces with Celesio AG and the potential growth opportunities it could bring to the business.
A spokesperson for Lloyds Chemists said: "We are currently in the process of evaluating the Gehe offer and will make a recommendation to our shareholders once we have received a formal response from Gehe."
Both Celesio AG and Gehe AG have declined to comment on the situation.
The bidding war for Lloyds Chemists comes amid a wave of consolidation in the UK retail pharmacy sector. Earlier this year, rival chain Boots was acquired by US healthcare company Walgreens in a deal worth $15.3 billion, while Superdrug's parent company, AS Watson, acquired the UK's largest independent pharmacy chain, Savers, for an undisclosed sum.
Analysts predict more consolidation in the sector in the coming months as companies look to strengthen their position in a highly competitive market.
Lloyds Chemists currently operates over 1,300 stores across the UK, with a turnover of £18 billion ($23 billion) in the last financial year. The company employs around 17,000 staff and serves over 7 million customers every week.
The uncertainty surrounding the bidding war has caused some concern among shareholders, but many remain optimistic about the company's future.
One institutional investor, who wished to remain anonymous, commented: "We believe Lloyds Chemists is a great business with strong potential for growth, regardless of who ultimately acquires it. We trust the board to make the right decision for the company and its shareholders." 
In conclusion, Lloyds Chemists is in a tricky position as it awaits a response from rival suitor, Gehe AG, before making any further recommendations to its shareholders regarding bid offers. The ongoing bidding war highlights the consolidation trend in the UK retail pharmacy sector and investors should remain patient as the company evaluates its options.
