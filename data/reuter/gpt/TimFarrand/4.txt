The ice cream industry in Europe has taken a huge hit this year due to the unseasonably dull summer. Major players in the industry are struggling to keep their bottom lines in the black, with many of them exploring fresh marketing strategies for the winter season.
The summer season traditionally represents the peak of sales for ice cream companies, with footfall at ice cream parlors and retail stores increasing drastically. Unfortunately, 2020 is not like any other year, and the lack of tourists and locals out and about to enjoy ice cream for the most substantial part of the season is a severe setback for the industry.
Ice cream giants are now realizing the severity of the situation and resisting from looking at the summer as the only season to boost their sales. Consequently, there has been a shift in the focus of their product offerings towards winter flavors and, of course, seasonal sorbets.
The ice cream industry is fiercely competitive, and many big names in the business are proactive and always seeking out new ways to appeal to their customers. This year, they are getting innovative and looking at winter flavors as an opportunity to cater to sophisticated tastes.
Many of these ice cream companies have turned towards creating unique flavors tied to different holidays such as Christmas and New Year. They are using eye-catching packaging materials to entice people to buy their products, in an attempt to stand out from competition and increase their market share.
The shift in the marketing strategies of the industry has been reflected in the retail stores too. Many shops are now displaying more winter-themed ice creams prominent on the shelves, with Christmas and Hanukkah flavors taking center stage. Advertisements are not only exclusively aimed at children, as adults are increasingly becoming the target market as well.
In an interview with one of the major players in the industry, the Baskin-Robbins Senior Director of Global Marketing, Carolyn O’ Keefe, confirmed the company was hoping their ice cream flavors for the winter season would boost sales following the poor summer.
O’Keefe said, “In the past, we have tended to focus more on introducing ice-cream-based products during the summer. But the impact of the coronavirus means we need to be much more creative, and we have come up with some fantastic winter flavors that we hope are going to appeal to customers’ tastes.”
Some of the winter flavors O’Keefe mentioned include Gingerbread Cheesecake, Roasted Turkey Ice Cream, and Dijon Mustard Ice Cream, which she believes will interest more adventurous customers.
Furthermore, the company has plans to introduce much more fruity flavors as more people prefer a healthier option. Such flavors incorporate cinnamon, chestnut, and caramel to combine the comfort and nostalgia of winter. Of course, O’Keefe also acknowledged the role ice cream plays in people’s mental health. Its sweetness and refreshing taste help some to cope with the gloomy weather during the winter months.
A representative of Unilever, a conglomerate with a significant stake in the ice cream industry, confirmed that big players are taking the winter months much more seriously this year. “We have departments exclusively focused on creating new winter flavors and increasing our presence during the winter months,” the representative said.
The representative further explains that Unilever has plans to advertise their product ranges in movies, TV-series, commercials, and radio shows. Though not exclusively aimed at adults, the company hopes that this strategy will attract their target audience.
In general, the ice cream industry has had a hard time due to the pandemic. Still, with the shift towards winter flavors and season-themed sorbets, there is hope that sales will pick up during the winter months to help recover some of the losses experienced during the summer.
The winter period is crucial not only for the ice cream industry but also the retail industry in general. Whichever way this season turns out, it is safe to say that companies’ resilience and innovation can mean the difference between their survival or demise during these unprecedented times.
