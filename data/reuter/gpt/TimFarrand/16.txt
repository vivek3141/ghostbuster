London-based hospitality and leisure company Whitbread Plc has reported that its hotel arm, Premier Inn, has doubled its profits in the past year, with strong growth in the leisure market. The news comes as a refreshing change to the travel and tourism industry, which has been hit hard by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
According to Whitbread's annual financial results, Premier Inn generated an operating profit of £148m ($206m) in the year ended February 25, up from £76m ($106m) the previous year. The chain had seen a surge in bookings from leisure guests in the late summer months of 2020, as people searched for staycations and domestic travel options amid international travel restrictions.
"Our strong hotel performance in the second half of the year was driven by the leisure market, which we believe will continue to be resilient in 2021 as the UK population looks forward to a summer of domestic travel," said Alison Brittain, CEO of Whitbread Plc.
Brittain added that the company saw strong demand from business customers in Premier Inn's city center locations, particularly in London, as the UK government began easing restrictions. The chain saw occupancy rates of 60% during the six months leading up to February 25, compared to just 40% in the first half of the year.
Whitbread's other brands in the hospitality and leisure segment, including the Beefeater and Brewers Fayre pub chains, saw mixed results. Beefeater restaurants recorded a 44% drop in sales, while Brewers Fayre saw a marginal 2% increase in sales.
The company has been on a transformational journey in the recent past, focusing on the hotel segment and expanding its presence in the UK and Germany. It had pruned its restaurant business in 2018, and sold Costa Coffee to Coca-Cola the following year.
Whitbread's shift in focus has paid off, particularly as the hospitality industry weathered the pandemic. According to a survey by the Office for National Statistics, the accommodation and food services sector was the hardest-hit in the UK, with a 12.9% decrease in gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020.
However, as lockdown restrictions ease and the vaccine rollout continues, there are signs of recovery for the industry. Whitbread is not alone in benefiting from a surge in domestic travel, as budget hotel chains such as Travelodge and easyHotel have also seen increases in bookings.
But challenges remain, such as the uncertainty around international travel and the possibility of new variants of the virus. The UK government has announced that foreign holidays will be allowed from May 17 at the earliest but is yet to announce which countries will be on the so-called "green list" for safe travel.
Whitbread is taking a cautious approach, with plans to open 2,000 new Premier Inn rooms this year in the UK and 1,500 in Germany, but also to reduce its UK hotel base by about 1,500 rooms.
"We remain cautious given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Covid-19 and the impact on the travel market, particularly international," said Brittain. "However, we are confident in our business model and ability to grow market share."
Overall, Whitbread had a mixed financial year, with group revenue down 71% to £589m ($819m) and a statutory loss before tax of £1bn ($1.4bn), due to the impairments and exceptional costs associated with the pandemic. However, the company's hotel performance has given it reason to be optimistic about the future and the recovery of the wider industry.
Whitbread shares rose 2.5% on the news, trading at £32.33 ($44.85) on the London Stock Exchange.
