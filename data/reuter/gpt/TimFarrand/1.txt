Whitbread, the UK’s largest hotel and restaurant group, has reported strong growth in consumer spending on leisure activities despite a recent slump in National Lottery ticket sales.
Alison Brittain, CEO of Whitbread, has attributed the growth to increased disposable income and the rise in staycations within the UK. She also commented on the positive impact of the National Living Wage, which has boosted wages for low-paid workers and increased their disposable income.
“Consumer confidence remains robust and we are seeing increased leisure spend across our brands,” said Brittain. “Despite a dip in National Lottery ticket sales, we are seeing strong growth in consumer spending on leisure activities such as dining out, cinema, and short breaks.”
Whitbread’s brands include Premier Inn, Costa Coffee, Beefeater, and Brewers Fayre. The company is one of the largest employers in the UK, with over 50,000 employees.
Brittain added that the majority of Whitbread’s customers are UK residents, with over 90% of Premier Inn’s guests being from within the UK. This has enabled the company to benefit from the trend for staycations, with Brittain noting that Premier Inn has seen “record levels of occupancy” in popular tourist destinations such as Cornwall and Devon.
The rise in staycations has been attributed to a number of factors, including the weak pound, which has made foreign travel more expensive, and the uncertain political climate in Europe. Meanwhile, the National Living Wage has had a positive impact on low-paid workers, many of whom are employed in the leisure and hospitality sectors.
However, the recent decline in National Lottery sales has been a concern for some businesses, as they fear that it could be a sign of weakening consumer confidence. The National Lottery reported a 9% drop in ticket sales in the 2016/17 financial year, with sales falling by £670m compared to the previous year.
Some observers have attributed the decline to changes made to the Lotto game, which saw the number of balls increase from 49 to 59, making it harder to win the jackpot. Others suggest that the rise of online gambling and other leisure activities could be diverting consumer spend away from the National Lottery.
Despite this, Brittain remains optimistic about the outlook for the leisure and hospitality sector, citing the positive impact of the National Living Wage and the continued growth of consumer spending on leisure activities. She added that Whitbread plans to continue investing in its brands to ensure they remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market.
“We are committed to delivering exceptional value and experiences for our customers, and we will continue to invest in our brands to ensure they remain relevant and attractive in an increasingly competitive market,” she said.
In conclusion, Whitbread’s CEO, Alison Brittain, has expressed confidence in the outlook for the leisure and hospitality sector, despite concerns over the decline in National Lottery sales. The rise of staycations, increased disposable income, and the positive impact of the National Living Wage have all contributed to strong growth in consumer spending on leisure activities. However, businesses must remain vigilant and continue to innovate in order to compete in a rapidly changing market.
