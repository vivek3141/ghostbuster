Whitbread Plc, the UK-based multinational hospitality company, has reported a 10 percent rise in its first half earnings, driven by strong consumer spending on the high street. The company's performance was boosted by robust demand for its Premier Inn hotels and Costa Coffee shops.
According to Whitbread's latest financial statement, the company's pre-tax profits for the six months to 31 August 2019 hit £236 million ($291 million), up from £215 million the previous year. This exceeded analysts' expectations, who had predicted profits of around £228 million.
The company's overall revenue also climbed by 3.9 percent to £1.08 billion, while like-for-like sales grew by 1.3 percent. The results come despite a challenging consumer environment, which has seen many high street chains struggle with diminishing footfall and rising costs.
Whitbread CEO Alison Brittain said the company's solid performance was due to continued investment in its brands, as well as a focus on efficiency and cost control. "We are pleased with these interim results, which show that our strong brands continue to win share, even in challenging economic and political times," she said.
The results were particularly driven by Whitbread's Premier Inn hotel chain, which saw an 8.6 percent rise in revenue to £971 million. The brand opened 2,279 new rooms in the first half, taking its total network to 82,164 rooms across the UK and Ireland.
Meanwhile, Costa Coffee saw a 0.6 percent rise in sales to £710 million, with a particularly strong performance from the drive-thru and express store formats. The company recently announced it would be rolling out a new self-serve coffee machine across its UK stores, in response to changing consumer expectations.
The news will come as a relief to Whitbread shareholders, who have seen the company's shares struggle in recent years. The shares are currently trading at around £42.40, up from a year low of £34.05, but still well below their 2015 peak of £64.90.
Analysts said the results demonstrated Whitbread's ability to weather the current economic uncertainty, but warned there were still challenges ahead. "The half-year results are a testament to Whitbread's well-known and much respected brands, in what remains a hugely uncertain retail and consumer environment," said Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor.
"Nevertheless, there remains an ongoing competitive backdrop, particularly in the coffee sector, while the underperformance of the high street as a whole continues to cast a shadow."
Whitbread is currently in the process of disposing of its Costa Coffee business, following the £3.9 billion sale to Coca-Cola in August 2018. The company has said it will use the proceeds to pay down debt and focus on growing its Premier Inn hotel chain.
In conclusion, Whitbread Plc has reported a rise in its first half earnings, driven by strong consumer spending on the high street. Despite an uncertain economic climate, the company's solid results were achieved through a focus on investment in its brands, efficiency and cost control. With the disposal of its Costa Coffee business, and a continued focus on growth, the future looks bright for Whitbread and its shareholders.
