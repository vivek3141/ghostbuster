Highland Distilleries, the parent company of Famous Grouse, has announced a 14% dip in profit for the first half of 2021, largely due to lower sales of the Scotch whisky brand in the UK. The news sent shockwaves through the whisky industry as Famous Grouse has long been the top-selling blended whisky in Scotland.
The company said that overall revenue fell 9% to £32.6m in the six months to 31 March, compared with £35.9m in the same period last year. The decline in sales of Famous Grouse was partly due to ongoing challenges related to Brexit and Covid-19 restrictions but also due to increased competition from rival brands.
Despite this setback, the company is confident that it can bounce back in the second half of the year, with a range of new products planned for release in the coming months. These include a new premium single malt called The Glenrothes, which will be launched in August 2021.
In a statement, Highland Distilleries CEO, Gordon Buist, said: "We are disappointed to report a dip in profits for the first half of the year, but we remain optimistic about the future. Our brands have a strong reputation in markets around the world and we continue to invest in new product development to meet changing consumer demands."
Famous Grouse is not the only whisky brand to have struggled in the UK market recently. Other popular brands such as Johnnie Walker and Bell's have also seen declining sales, amid changing consumer preferences and increased competition.
Despite these challenges, the whisky industry remains an important contributor to the Scottish economy, generating around £6bn in annual revenue and employing more than 10,000 people. Highland Distilleries is one of the largest employers in Scotland, with a workforce of around 1,500 people.
The company is hoping that the launch of The Glenrothes will help to boost sales in the second half of the year. The new single malt is named after the distillery in Speyside where it is produced and is aimed at a more premium market segment.
Highland Distilleries is also investing heavily in marketing, with a new advertising campaign for Famous Grouse set to launch in the coming months. The campaign will focus on the brand's Scottish heritage and will feature a range of new products, including a limited-edition bottling of Famous Grouse made in collaboration with Edinburgh-based artist Peter Doig.
Despite the challenges posed by Brexit and Covid-19, the whisky industry remains a key part of Scotland's economy and is set to play an important role in the country's economic recovery in the aftermath of the pandemic. As Highland Distilleries and other brands continue to invest in new products and marketing, the future looks bright for the industry as a whole.
