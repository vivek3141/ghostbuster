Toronto's stock market closed higher on Monday, with bank stocks and strong bond and currency markets lifting the market by almost 1%.
The benchmark Toronto Stock Exchange Composite Index (TSX) gained 148.92 points, or about 0.83%, to close at 18,106.73. This was the highest closing level since January 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the global financial markets.
The financial sector was the biggest contributor to the TSX's gains, led by Canada's five largest banks. Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) rose 2.9%, while Bank of Montreal (BMO), Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS), and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) all gained between 1.8% and 2.7%.
The energy sector also posted gains as oil prices increased on hopes of a global economic recovery. Suncor Energy (SU) rose 1.9%, while Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ) and Enbridge (ENB) added 2.3% and 2.4%, respectively.
Meanwhile, the bond and currency markets also surged, as investors shifted their focus on economic recovery from the pandemic-induced recession. The Canadian dollar rose to 0.79 US dollars, its highest level in more than three years. The yield on 10-year Canadian bonds rose to 1.51%, a nine-month high.
"Market participants are increasingly optimistic that the vaccination campaign will succeed and that governments and central banks will continue to provide fiscal and monetary support to ensure a smooth economic recovery," said a market analyst.
Analysts also said that the announcement of a new US$1.9 trillion stimulus package by the incoming Biden administration could further boost the markets in the coming weeks.
However, they also cautioned that markets could face some volatility due to the ongoing pandemic and geopolitical risks.
"Although the market sentiment is currently optimistic, there are still some uncertainties, such as the path of the pandemic, the slow rollout of vaccines, and the potential for geopolitical tensions," said another analyst.
As of Monday, Canada has reported more than 707,000 COVID-19 cases and over 18,000 deaths. The country has already started vaccinating its citizens, but the process is slower than other developed countries.
