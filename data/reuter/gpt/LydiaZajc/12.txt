The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) continued its winning streak, scaling another record high on Friday. The exchange's benchmark index, S&P/TSX Composite Index, closed at 21,441.44, up 0.47% on the day. The latest kick was led by interest-sensitive issues and conglomerates that helped lift the market despite a mixed bag of economic data.
The Bank of Canada's (BoC) hawkish tone on interest rates was the key driver behind the rally in interest-sensitive stocks. BoC Governor Tiff Macklem confirmed on Thursday that the bank could begin to hike interest rates as early as the second half of 2022 if the economy continues its recovery and inflationary pressures persist. The news sparked a lot of interest among investors, prompting a rush towards companies that are likely to benefit from higher rates.
Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Bank of Montreal (BMO), and TD Bank (TD) finished higher on the TSX, driving the financial sector to be the best-performing group, up 1.07%. The utilities sector also contributed to the broader gains on the index, with Canadian Utilities (CU) and Fortis (FTS) jumping 2.71% and 2.06%, respectively.
Meanwhile, the performance of large-cap conglomerates added to the bullish sentiment. Shares of Brookfield Asset Management (BAM-A) and Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEPC) rose more than 1.50%, while Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Suncor Energy (SU) gained nearly 1.0%.
The TSX has returned over 15% so far this year, outpacing its U.S. counterparts, as Canada's economic recovery takes shape amid the pandemic. Friday's gains signal that the market could offer ample opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the country's growth prospects.
