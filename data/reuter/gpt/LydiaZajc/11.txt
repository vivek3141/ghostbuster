Despite gains in the gold and real estate sectors, Toronto stocks ended softer on Monday. The S&P/TSX Composite was down 0.18% or 31.15 points at 17,256.87.
The gold sector, which is considered a safe-haven investment, was up by 1.9%, led by Eldorado Gold Corp. (TSX: ELD) and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. (TSX: AEM). The gains came on the back of worries about the ongoing trade tensions between China and the United States.
Meanwhile, the real estate sector was up by 0.8%, with all the major companies performing well. Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (TSX: BAM-A) was up by 1.2%, while Brookfield Property Partners LP (TSX: BPY-UN) rose by 1.3%.
However, these gains were not enough to offset the losses in other sectors, with most of the major companies ending in the red. The energy sector was down by 0.8%, as oil prices fell due to concerns about the global economic slowdown. Suncor Energy Inc. (TSX: SU) was down by 1.2%, while Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (TSX: CNQ) fell by 1.1%.
The materials sector was also down by 0.8%, with Teck Resources Ltd. (TSX: TECK-B) leading the losses, falling by 3.4%. The healthcare and financials sector were also down by 0.6% and 0.2% respectively.
The bearish sentiment was reflected in the American markets as well. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down by 0.36%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were down by 0.53% and 0.73% respectively.
The ongoing trade tensions between China and the United States continue to weigh on the markets, with both countries imposing tariffs on each other's goods. Concerns about the global economic slowdown and the future of Brexit are also contributing to the negative sentiment.
The Bank of Canada is set to announce its interest rate decision on Wednesday, with many analysts predicting that the central bank will hold interest rates steady at 1.75%. However, the ongoing trade disputes and the global economic slowdown could influence the bank's decision.
Overall, the Toronto stocks ended softer on Monday, with gains in the gold and real estate sectors not enough to offset the losses in other sectors. The ongoing trade tensions and global economic slowdown continue to weigh on the markets, with investors remaining cautious about the future.
