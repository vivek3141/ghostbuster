Canadian consumers should prepare to be scrooge-like once again during this holiday season, according to a recent survey conducted by the Retail Council of Canada. The survey revealed that consumers plan on cutting back on holiday spending as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
The survey found that 62 percent of shoppers plan to spend less on holiday gifts and celebrations in 2020 than they did in 2019. The majority cited financial concerns and the impact of the pandemic on their budgets as the main reasons for their reduced spending plans.
Many Canadians are experiencing financial hardship due to the economic fallout of the pandemic, and are therefore prioritizing essential expenses such as rent and groceries over discretionary spending. The survey found that 52 percent of respondents felt that their ability to spend on holiday gifts had been compromised by the pandemic, with 24 percent of those surveyed saying that their finances had been significantly impacted by the crisis.
The Retail Council of Canada predicts that holiday spending will decrease by approximately 20 percent this year, representing a loss of billions of dollars for the retail sector. Many retailers are facing significant challenges, as they rely heavily on sales during the holiday season to generate revenue and profit.
Despite the challenging economic environment, retailers are adapting quickly to meet the needs of consumers in the new normal. Many are pivoting to online sales and adopting new safety measures to ensure that customers feel comfortable shopping in-person.
The holiday season is typically a time to bring cheer and joy to loved ones, but the pandemic has made this year exceptionally difficult for many Canadians. However, with the right balance of patience, creativity, and kindness, we can still find ways to connect with one another and make the most of this festive season.
