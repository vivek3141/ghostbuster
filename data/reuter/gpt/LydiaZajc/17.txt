The holiday shopping season is in full swing, and Canadians are turning to the internet to get their gifts. A recent survey conducted by e-commerce website Etsy Canada found that nearly 80% of Canadian shoppers are purchasing their holiday gifts online this year. This marks a significant shift in consumer behavior as more and more people choose to shop online instead of going to physical stores.
The survey, which was conducted in November 2021, surveyed over 1,000 Canadian shoppers about their holiday shopping habits. The results showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the way people shop. With restrictions in place and concerns about health and safety, many Canadians are opting for the convenience and safety of online shopping.
According to the survey, the most popular items being purchased online this holiday season are clothing and accessories, followed by home decor, jewelry, and toys. Shoppers are also taking advantage of online sales and promotions to get the best deals on their purchases.
Etsy Canada's managing director, Erin Green, said that online shopping has become more popular than ever before. "Canadians are turning to online shopping in record numbers this holiday season," she said. "With the pandemic still impacting our daily lives, many are looking for convenient and safe ways to get their holiday shopping done. Online shopping provides that convenience, and customers can easily browse and purchase items from the comfort of their own homes."
The shift to online shopping has also led to a surge in demand for delivery services. The survey found that 70% of Canadian shoppers plan to use delivery or pick-up options this year, and 60% plan to use curbside pickup. This highlights the importance of reliable and efficient delivery services, especially during the busy holiday season.
Despite the popularity of online shopping, some consumers still prefer to shop in physical stores. The survey found that 20% of shoppers plan to purchase their gifts through in-store shopping this year, while the remaining 1% plan to shop through print catalogs.
In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way Canadians shop for their holiday gifts. With restrictions in place and concerns about health and safety, more shoppers are choosing to purchase items online. This trend is expected to continue as online shopping becomes more convenient and accessible to consumers. As a result, retailers and delivery companies will need to adapt to meet the changing needs of their customers and provide a top-notch shopping experience.
