Toronto, Canada - The Toronto stock market closed at a record high for the 51st time in 1996 on Tuesday, amid a rally in interest-sensitive issues and expectations of an interest rate cut by the Bank of Canada.
The benchmark S&P/TSX composite index finished the day at 14,363.11, up 67.69 points from the previous day. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose by 2.4 percent, driven by the strong performance of Intel, Microsoft, and Cisco.
The jump in global equity markets was triggered by a rally in interest-sensitive stocks as investors bet on a cut in interest rates by the Bank of Canada, which is expected to support economic growth. The rally was also fueled by strong earnings reports from some of the biggest banks in Canada.
Bank of Montreal reported a third-quarter profit of $1.6 billion, beating market expectations, while Bank of Nova Scotia reported a third-quarter profit of $2.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion in the previous year.
"The strength of the banks' earnings is an indication that the Canadian economy is performing well and it is likely that the Bank of Canada will follow the US Federal Reserve and cut interest rates," said David Redford, an analyst at RBC Dominion Securities.
The rally in interest-sensitive issues was led by the gold and energy sectors, with shares of Barrick Gold Corp, Goldcorp Inc, and Suncor Energy Inc rising by 2.1 percent, 2.4 percent, and 1.8 percent respectively.
The performance of the Toronto stock market was also driven by a string of positive economic reports, including better-than-expected employment data and strong retail sales figures. Canada's unemployment rate fell to 7 percent in July from 7.1 percent in the previous month, while retail sales rose by 0.7 percent in June, beating expectations.
"The Canadian economy is showing signs of strength, with improvements in employment and retail sales, and this is reflected in the performance of the stock market," said Redford.
The positive sentiment also spilled over into the Canadian dollar, which climbed to a one-month high against the US dollar on Tuesday. The loonie rose by 0.5 cents to close at 77.90 cents US.
