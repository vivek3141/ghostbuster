Despite more declining issues than climbing ones on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), bank stocks have pushed the exchange into stronger territory, with the S&P/TSX Composite Index gaining 32.47 points to 15,832.09 at the end of Tuesday's trading session.
Among the big banks, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), and Bank of Montreal (BMO) all saw gains of over 1%, with RBC leading the way with a 1.64% increase. The Bank of Nova Scotia and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) saw more modest gains of 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively.
However, declining issues still marginally outnumbered advancing ones on the exchange, with 905 decliners compared to 882 advancers. The energy sector also continued to struggle, with Canadian Natural Resources and Suncor Energy both experiencing losses of 0.9%.
Despite this, analysts have pointed to the strong performance of the banking sector as a reason for optimism on the TSX. The banks have been buoyed by bond yields increasing across North America, with investors optimistic about a potential rise in interest rates from central banks.
"The banks benefit from higher yields on lending in this environment, which could produce better loan growth, better net interest margins, and more revenues," said John M. Beck, CEO of Aecon Group.
The performance of bank stocks on the TSX also comes in the wake of a strong earnings season for the sector. RBC and TD both beat earnings expectations, with RBC announcing a 34% increase in profit compared to the same quarter last year.
However, concerns remain about the potential impact of rising interest rates on the broader economy, particularly for homeowners with variable-rate mortgages.
"We are now at a stage where interest rates are slowly creeping higher," said Scott Terrio, manager of debtor advocacy at Hoyes, Michalos & Associates. "For those with variable rates on their mortgages, it means that they will be paying more money just to service their debt. This could end up putting a lot of households under additional financial strain."
Despite these concerns, many investors remain bullish on bank stocks, with some analysts predicting further gains for the sector in the coming months.
"It's a good time to be investing in financials," said Jennifer Radman, an investment advisor with The Wealth Co. "The banks are well-capitalized, they are looking at growth opportunities, and they are returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. These are all good signs for investors."
