Toronto stocks took a significant tumble on Thursday, September 9, due to a combination of profit-taking and gold sell-off. The slide was also attributed to the market’s reaction to the lack of progress in U.S. stimulus talks. 
The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index had fallen by 1.4%, or 253.22 points, to 20,792.05 at the end of the trading day. This was the lowest the benchmark has been in over two weeks, since August 24. 
Analysts say that the sudden dip was caused by investors’ persistent concerns over the global economic recovery. Additionally, the price of gold, a key component of Canada’s primary equity index, fell sharply after a bounce in the US dollar’s value. 
Gold was down by almost 2% on the day, which saw the benchmark index fall below its support level of 21,000 points. Reports indicated that some big names in the Canadian mining industry dragged the market down, with players like Barrick Gold Corp and Kirkland Lake Gold both losing over 4% during the day. 
Meanwhile, Toronto-listed tech stocks also fell, including Blackberry Inc, which was down by almost 5%, and Shopify Inc, which lost nearly 4.3% by the end of Thursday's trading.
Despite Thursday’s sell-off, most major global stock markets remain near record-high levels. Analysts insist that investors need to focus on long-term trends and not be swayed by short-term volatility.
The recent outcome will doubtless prove frustrating for Canadian investors who had backed strong gains throughout the summer. Whether the market will bounce back soon or not remains to be seen, but experts are warning that investors should beware of further market turbulence as the pandemic’s effects continue to play out. 
In all, Thursday’s plunge serves as a stark reminder that the stock market is inherently volatile, and investors need to remain vigilant and well-informed to navigate its twists and turns.
