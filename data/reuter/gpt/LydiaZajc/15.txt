The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) gained 60 points on Tuesday, led by a frenzy of investors looking to get in on the action. The surge in the market comes amid growing optimism about the economic recovery, boosted by the rollout of coronavirus vaccines and the gradual reopening of businesses across the country.
The TSX reached an intraday high of 19,634.17 points, up 0.31 percent, before closing at 19,610.11 points. The rally was driven by strong gains in the energy and financial sectors, which rose 1.68 percent and 1.04 percent, respectively.
Investors were buoyed by positive economic data, including a report showing Canada's manufacturing sector expanded in February at the fastest pace in two and a half years. The report, released on Monday by IHS Markit, showed the purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the sector rose to 58.5, up from 55.6 in January.
The PMI is a measure of manufacturing activity and is based on a survey of purchasing managers in the sector. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a reading below 50 indicates contraction. The PMI for the services sector also rose in February, to 56.1 from 54.4 in January.
Another factor driving the market was the Bank of Canada's decision to maintain its benchmark interest rate at 0.25 percent, where it has been since March 2020. The central bank also reiterated its commitment to keeping the rate low until economic slack is absorbed and inflation returns to its 2 percent target.
"We remain committed to leaving the overnight rate at the effective lower bound until slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved," said Governor Tiff Macklem in a statement.
Despite the market's gains, some investors remain cautious about the potential for a market correction. The TSX has risen more than 60 percent since hitting a pandemic-induced low in March 2020, and some analysts are warning that the market may be due for a pullback.
"We are starting to see some signs of excess valuations in spots, and investors need to be selective," said Patrick Blais, a portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management.
Nevertheless, many investors remain bullish about the TSX's prospects, citing the country's strong fiscal and monetary policies, as well as its well-diversified economy.
"The Canadian market is definitely looking up, with a lot of potential growth in sectors like energy, manufacturing, and technology," said Mayra Juarez, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. "Investors are feeling optimistic about the future and are putting their money where their mouth is."
