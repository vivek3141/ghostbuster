Canada’s foremost stock exchange, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), has hit a record high as trading closed on Friday with the help of strong financial and conglomerate stocks. The Toronto Stock Exchange Composite Index (SPTSX) advanced by 1.2%, or 210.35 points a new all-time high of 18,014.25. The previous all-time high of 17,977.5 was recorded in February 2020, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.
The positive performance was the result of a bullish rally in financial stocks. Major Canadian banks reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings, with Royal Bank of Canada, TD Bank, and Bank of Montreal posting profits that exceeded analysts’ forecasts. Boosted by these earnings, financial stocks surged by 1.7%.
The conglomerate stocks followed suit, with nearly all  the members of the TSX conglomerate sub-index registering gains. Brookfield Asset Management, the largest public listed alternative asset management firm in the world, was one of the gainers, posting a stock price rise of 3.1%. Other significant gains included the Canadian Tire Corporation Limited (up 2.5%) and Loblaw Company Limited (up 1.4%).
Market analysts attributed the buoyancy of the financial and conglomerate sectors of the TSX to improved economic indicators. The Bank of Canada’s recent projection of a strong post-pandemic rebound is also a likely factor in the stock’s positive performance.
A report from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives deemed the market's impressive run in recent months as “decoupled from reality”. However, the report's view is not universally accepted, with some analysts pointing out that the global economy is booming. US retail sales surged in May, aiding economic recovery, and the US Federal Reserve has signaled that it won't raise interest rates anytime soon.
The Toronto Stock Exchange’s record high is an encouraging sign for the overall Canadian economy as it signals a robust post-pandemic economic recovery. Analysts are hopeful that this performance will continue, creating wealth and greater economic opportunities for the country at large.
