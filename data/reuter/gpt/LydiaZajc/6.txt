Toronto Stocks experienced a mixed day in trading as some sectors fell while others showed some recovery. The energy sector was one of the hardest hit areas, as pipeline delays and disruptions continue. On the other hand, the gold industry also experienced a dip in prices.
The S&P/TSX Composite Index closed the day down by 0.1%, with the energy sector being the main contributor to the losses. The drop in oil prices combined with news of a pipeline delay caused a 0.7% decline in the energy sector. The pipeline delay was caused by legal challenges to the Trans Mountain Pipeline's expansion project, which has been on hold since April 2019.
The debacle caused a 3.6% price reduction in shares of Calgary energy company, Enbridge (ENB.TO). Enbridge is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America, and the pipeline delay is expected to have a significant impact on its financials. Meanwhile, shares of Pembina Pipeline (PPL.TO) also experienced a drop of 4.7%. The company has been in the spotlight as its proposed acquisition of Inter Pipeline (IPL.TO) undergoes scrutiny from the Canadian Competition Bureau.
Additionally, the gold industry also experienced a dip, with gold prices dropping by 0.3%. This caused a 1.1% fall for Eldorado Gold (ELD.TO), and a 1.5% decrease for Yamana Gold (YRI.TO). The precious metal's decrease in value was attributed to investors' optimism in the global economy's growth, which lessened the demand for safe-haven assets such as gold.
However, not all sectors experienced negative outcomes. The information technology sector gained 2.4%, while the materials sector rose by 0.3%. Shopify (SHOP.TO), one of the top-performing stocks in Canada, rose by 4.9%. The e-commerce giant recently announced the acquisition of a logistics company to improve its delivery and fulfillment services.
Overall, it was a mixed day for Toronto stocks. While some sectors experienced significant declines, other industries seemed to have bounced back. Experts suggest that a global economic recovery could boost demand for oil and other basic materials, aiding in a significant rebound for Toronto Stock Exchange.
