Recently, media mogul Rupert Murdoch confidently predicted a 20% rise in News Corp's net profit for the current fiscal year. Despite first quarter results not meeting analysts' expectations, Murdoch's prediction is still expected to hold true.
News Corp's first quarter revenue fell short of analysts' expectations, with a decrease of 3% to $2.12 billion. Its net income also fell from the previous year's $128 million to $96 million, despite an increase in operating income from $116 million to $140 million. The disappointment was largely due to a weak performance from its News and Information Services segment, which includes publications such as The Wall Street Journal and The Australian.
However, despite the disappointment, industry experts still believe News Corp's net profit will reach the 20% predicted by Murdoch. This belief is based on a combination of factors, including News Corp's cost-cutting measures, its investments in digital media and real estate, and the positive performance of its other business segments.
News Corp's Digital Real Estate Services segment, which includes online real estate brokerages, has been a key driver of growth for the company. In the first quarter, this segment saw revenue increase by 22% to $305 million, contributing significantly to News Corp's overall revenue growth.
News Corp has also made strategic investments in digital media, including its acquisition of video ad platform Unruly and the launch of a news aggregation app called Knewz. These investments are expected to contribute to the company's growth in the coming years, as more consumers shift to digital media consumption.
Moreover, News Corp's cost-cutting measures have been effective in reducing expenses. The company has reduced its headcount by 2,000 over the past year, resulting in annualized savings of approximately $150 million. These cost savings, together with revenue growth from its real estate and digital media segments, are expected to boost News Corp's net profit in the current fiscal year.
Despite the disappointing first quarter results, News Corp's leadership remains optimistic. Commenting on the results, CEO Robert Thomson stated, "Whilst our results for the first quarter were affected by ongoing headwinds, we have a potent portfolio and a sharp focus on digital development, which will be augmented by opportunities in real estate."
Chairman Murdoch echoed this sentiment, stating earlier this month that he was "confident in our ability to continue to compete in this rapidly evolving media marketplace and to deliver on our strategic priorities."
Overall, while the first quarter results may have disappointed analysts, News Corp's net profit is still expected to meet Murdoch's predicted 20% rise due to the company's cost-cutting measures, strategic investments in digital media and real estate, and the positive performance of its other business segments. Investors and industry experts will continue to monitor these factors as News Corp moves forward into the rest of the fiscal year.
