The partners in Australia's largest gas project have announced plans to double production. The A$34 billion Ichthys LNG project, located in the Northern Territory, is a joint venture between Japan's Inpex Corporation and France's Total. The announcement comes as the project marks its first anniversary of production.
In a statement released on Monday, Inpex and Total announced a A$6 billion investment to build an additional LNG train and expand other facilities at the project's onshore processing plant. The new investment will take the total output capacity to 11.1 million tonnes per year of LNG, 0.4 million tonnes per year of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and 58,000 barrels per day of condensate.
The project's first-phase development, which had a production capacity of 8.9 million tonnes of LNG per year, began in April 2018, and the first-ever LNG cargo from the project sailed to Japan in October 2018. Since then, the project has achieved stable production, which has enabled the partners to embark on the expansion plans.
"The additional investment demonstrates our confidence in the long-term potential of the Ichthys LNG project and our continuing commitment to the Australian energy industry," said Takayuki Ueda, President of Inpex Corporation. "We will continue to work with our partners and the Australian Government to create value for all stakeholders."
Philippe Sauquet, President of Gas, Renewables & Power for Total, added: "The expansion project announced todayâ€¦will enable us to capture additional value, enhance the competitiveness of the asset and drive its performance."
The expansion will require a significant amount of engineering work, along with new equipment and infrastructure, such as a new floating production, storage and offloading vessel to handle the additional production.
"The Ichthys LNG project is one of the world's largest and most complex projects, and its successful start-up was the result of years of hard work and collaboration," said Jannah Ruthven, Ichthys LNG Project Director. "The expansion project will require similar dedication, and I am confident our team will deliver."
The Ichthys LNG project is operated by Inpex, with a 62.245% stake, while Total holds a 30% stake. The remaining 7.755% is held by CPC Corporation, Taiwan.
The project consists of an offshore gas field with an estimated life of 40 years, along with a 890 km subsea pipeline that carries gas and condensate to an onshore processing plant near Darwin. The gas is exported to customers in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.
The Ichthys LNG project has created more than 8,000 jobs during construction and is expected to generate billions in revenue for the government over the project's life. It is also helping to secure Australia's energy supply, with its annual production capacity equating to around 5% of the world's total LNG output.
The expansion plans have been welcomed by the Australian Government, with Federal Resources Minister, Matt Canavan, calling it "great news" for the country's energy industry.
"The Ichthys LNG project is one of the most significant investments ever made in Australia, and this expansion brings even more jobs and economic benefits to the Northern Territory and the nation," Canavan said. "It demonstrates that Australia continues to be an attractive destination for major energy projects and is testament to the strong and enduring relationships developed between our respective governments and businesses."
