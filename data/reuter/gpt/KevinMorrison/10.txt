AGL Energy Limited is reportedly interested in acquiring Tenneco's Australian assets if they're put up for sale, according to the company's managing director, Brett Redman. The potential acquisition would align with AGL's plans to expand its gas business in Australia.
Tenneco is a global manufacturing company that produces automotive parts and aftermarket products. It operates a plant in Australia that predominantly produces exhaust systems for factory-fitted vehicles. However, the company has announced that it plans to exit its Australian manufacturing business amid ongoing challenges in the automotive industry.
In an interview with The Australian Financial Review, Redman said that AGL is "always looking at opportunities to expand" and that Tenneco's Australian assets "would fit nicely" with its existing gas business in the region. He added that the company is "keeping a watchful eye" on the situation and may make a move if the assets become available.
Redman's comments come as AGL faces increasing pressure from investors to diversify its portfolio amid uncertainties facing the energy sector. In recent years, the company has come under fire for its heavy reliance on coal-fired power generation, which has faced opposition due to its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.
In response, AGL has shifted its focus towards renewable energy sources, including wind and solar power, while maintaining its gas business. Last year, the company acquired a wind farm in Queensland and announced plans to build a battery storage facility in South Australia. However, gas remains a key part of its business, with the company operating a number of gas-fired power stations around Australia.
The potential acquisition of Tenneco's Australian assets would allow AGL to further expand its position in the gas market. According to Redman, gas is "expected to play a critical role in Australia's transition to a low-carbon economy," and he sees "huge potential" for AGL to lead the way in the sector.
However, any potential acquisition would face a number of challenges. Firstly, Tenneco is yet to formally announce that it plans to sell its Australian assets, and it's unclear when or if it will do so. Additionally, AGL would likely face competition from other interested parties, as Tenneco's Australian assets are potentially attractive to a wide range of buyers due to their location, infrastructure, and skilled workforce.
Furthermore, it's unclear whether regulators would approve a potential acquisition by AGL. The company's heavy reliance on coal-fired power has previously been criticized by environmental groups, and any move to expand its gas business may face similar opposition. However, Redman has emphasized that AGL is "committed to responsible and sustainable business practices" and that any potential acquisition would be "carefully considered."
Despite these challenges, Redman remains optimistic about the potential acquisition. He stated, "We think there's a really good opportunity for us to be involved in that business and continue to contribute to the Australian economy."
Overall, AGL's interest in acquiring Tenneco's Australian assets reflects the company's commitment to expanding its gas business in Australia. While any potential acquisition would face challenges, it has the potential to be a significant move for AGL as it seeks to diversify its portfolio and maintain its position in the energy sector.
