News Corp, the global media giant led by Rupert Murdoch, has reported a drop in its fiscal first-quarter earnings, missing the analysts’ forecasts. The company’s Q1 net profit fell by 8.1% to $128 million, or 17 cents per share, from $140 million, or 19 cents per share, a year earlier.
The revenue of News Corp in the three months through September 2020 was $2.12 billion, down 7.8% from the same quarter of last year. However, this beat the average analysts’ estimate of $2.04 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) were $355 million, down 2%, but beating the analysts’ estimates of $339.8 million.
Despite the pandemic’s impact on the global economy, News Corp’s digital real estate services business, which includes REA Group and MOVE, reported a 6% rise in revenue to $291 million. The company’s subscription video services, which include Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, saw a 7% drop in revenue to $408 million, citing the impact of the lockdowns in Australia.
The advertising revenue of News Corp, which accounts for a significant portion of the company’s business, fell by 17% to $522 million in the quarter, compared to the same period of 2019. The decline was mainly due to weak performance in the US, UK, and Australia markets. However, the company said the recent rebound in ad spending, especially in the US, is a positive sign for the coming quarters.
“The broader economic recovery from the pandemic continues to impact our advertising businesses this quarter, particularly in Australia and the UK,” said Robert Thomson, News Corp’s chief executive. “There are signs of nascent improvement in some ad markets, certainly compared to the chaotic depths of April and early May, but the path ahead is uncertain.”
The company’s News Media division, which includes The Wall Street Journal, The Times, and The Australian, saw a 7% drop in revenue to $1.19 billion, as advertising and circulation revenues declined. However, digital subscriptions to its news outlets continued to rise, with a 23% increase in the paid digital subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal, which currently stands at 3.8 million.
“Despite the challenges presented by the pandemic, we remain focused on our strategy to develop high-quality content, broaden our digital subscription base, and grow our digital real estate services business,” Thomson added.
News Corp has been facing intense competition from digital rivals such as Google and Facebook, as well as emerging players like Netflix and Amazon, which have changed the media landscape significantly. The company has been investing heavily in digital content, aiming to boost its digital subscription revenue and reduce its reliance on advertising.
The company’s shares dropped 4.9% to $13.23 in New York trading, reflecting the market’s disappointment with the lower-than-expected earnings. However, the stock has rallied more than 80% since hitting a low of $7.11 in March, as investors have been betting on the company’s digital initiatives and cost-cutting measures.
News Corp’s results come amid a challenging time for the media industry, as the pandemic has accelerated the shift to digital consumption and reduced advertising spending. According to a report by eMarketer, US digital ad spending is expected to grow by only 1.7% this year, compared to the 17% growth in 2019.
“The pandemic has disrupted global advertising and impacted every industry,” Thomson said. “But the essential nature of our journalism has been vividly demonstrated by the crisis, which is why we have been recruiting rather than retrenching. We are confident that our strategy will enable us to emerge stronger as the pandemic recedes.”
