As the global oil and gas industry navigates its way through major market shifts, foreign companies have been quick to snap up undervalued Australian oil and gas stocks.
Since the 2015 oil price crash, the Australian oil and gas sector has struggled, with many small-to-medium sized companies going under. This resulted in many of their assets becoming available for foreign companies to buy, with favorable exchange rates making them particularly enticing.
Recent data shows that foreign ownership of Australia’s oil and gas resources has surged to more than 50% in the past decade. According to the Australian Energy Regulator, gas market deregulation has been a factor in attracting foreign investment, as increased competition creates more opportunities for smaller players to enter the market.
But despite the increased foreign investment, analysts say that the Australian oil and gas sector has a promising future with higher oil prices and a deregulated gas market.
Oil prices have been bouncing back since 2016, and many analysts believe that prices will continue to increase. This will lead to more investment in exploration and production, as well as increase the profitability of the sector. Additionally, the deregulation of the gas sector is expected to create new opportunities and increase competition, leading to more investment in exploration and production.
While the increase in foreign investment has raised concerns about Australia’s long-term energy security, analysts note that foreign investment can lead to knowledge transfer and technology sharing that ultimately benefits Australia.
Moreover, Australia’s recently launched Gas-fired Recovery Plan seeks to address energy security concerns, and encourage further investment in the sector. The plan has identified 13 priority projects, with the aim of securing reliable and affordable energy supply across the country.
Despite this, challenges remain. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the energy sector hard, and the closure of international borders has impacted foreign investment. Additionally, the push towards renewable energy has left some questioning whether investment in the oil and gas sector will be sustainable in the long run.
However, analysts argue that the world will continue to rely on oil and gas, especially as the demand for energy is expected to grow with population growth and urbanization. While the world shifts towards renewable energy, oil and gas will remain an important source of energy to meet demand, at least in the short to medium term.
Ultimately, while foreign companies have taken advantage of the current market conditions and targeted undervalued Australian oil and gas assets, there is reason to be optimistic about the future of the sector. With higher oil prices and gas market deregulation, the sector is poised for growth and investment. The challenge will be navigating the global market shifts and staying ahead of the curve in a rapidly changing energy industry.
