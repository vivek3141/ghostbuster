Foreign companies are taking advantage of undervalued Australian oil and gas stocks, but industry analysts say the sector has a bright future ahead with higher prices and a soon-to-be-deregulated gas market.
According to recent reports, foreign companies such as Tokyo Gas, Mitsui & Co, and Shell are buying up Australian oil and gas stocks that have been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and low oil prices. These companies are betting on a gradual recovery in the industry and see the stocks as undervalued investments.
However, industry analysts believe that there is much more to the Australian oil and gas sector than just undervalued stocks. They argue that the long-term outlook for the industry is positive, with the expected deregulation of the gas market in 2021 and the prospects of higher oil prices in the future.
Australia's gas market is currently dominated by three major players – Santos, Origin, and BHP – who together control around 70% of the market. However, under new legislation expected to pass later this year, the Australian gas market will be opened up to more competition, leading to lower prices for consumers.
"The deregulation of the gas market is a positive development for the industry and should attract more players to the market," says Daniel Hynes, senior commodity strategist at ANZ Bank. "This should lead to more investment in exploration and production, which is good news for the sector."
In addition, the expected rebound in oil prices in the coming years is another positive signal for the Australian oil and gas sector. Oil prices have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but with the rollout of vaccines and the gradual reopening of economies, there is hope that prices will recover in the medium to long-term.
"It's important to remember that oil prices have been low due to the pandemic and not because of any fundamental issues in the industry," says Hynes. "As the world recovers from the pandemic and demand for oil picks up, we could see prices return to pre-pandemic levels, which would be a big boost for the industry."
Another positive factor for the Australian oil and gas sector is the global trend towards cleaner energy sources. While this might seem like bad news for the industry, analysts argue that it actually presents an opportunity for Australian companies to invest in new technologies and diversify their businesses.
"Renewable energy is the future, and companies that don't adapt will be left behind," says Stefanos Melissopoulos, head of equity research at Lonsec. "However, the good news is that there are opportunities for traditional oil and gas companies to invest in areas such as carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and other alternative fuels. Those that do will be well-positioned for the future."
Overall, while foreign companies may be snapping up undervalued Australian oil and gas stocks at present, industry analysts believe that the sector has a bright future ahead. With the expected deregulation of the gas market, the prospects of higher oil prices, and the opportunity to invest in new technologies, Australian companies are well-positioned to take advantage of the changing energy landscape.
It remains to be seen just how much foreign companies will invest in the Australian oil and gas sector in the coming years, but the outlook for the industry is certainly positive. As the world recovers from the pandemic and demand for energy picks up, Australia's oil and gas sector is well-positioned to play a major role in meeting that demand.
