In a major development in the Australian banking industry, St George Bank and Advance Bank Australia have joined forces to create the country's fifth-largest bank. The merger will bring together the strengths of both entities, enabling the new bank to offer a wider range of products and services to its customers.
The merger was announced after months of negotiations between the two banks. The deal is expected to be completed in the next few months, subject to regulatory approval. The new entity will be called St George Advance and will be headquartered in Sydney.
The merger has been welcomed by industry experts, who believe that it will create a stronger player in the highly competitive Australian banking sector. St George Advance will have a combined network of more than 600 branches, making it one of the largest banks in the country.
The new bank will be led by current St George Bank CEO, Ross Miller. In a statement, he said, "This is an exciting development for both banks and our customers. The merger will enable us to offer a wider range of products and services, and to build on the strengths of both our brands."
The merger will bring together two banks with a long history in Australia. St George Bank was founded in 1937 and has grown to become one of the country's largest banks. Advance Bank was established in the 1860s and has been a leading provider of banking services to Australian consumers and businesses.
The merger is expected to deliver significant cost savings for both banks. It will also enable the new entity to invest in new technology and innovation, and to improve its customer service capabilities.

The merger comes at a time of significant change in the Australian banking sector. In recent years, competition has intensified, with new players entering the market and traditional banks facing pressure from fintech startups.
Industry experts believe that the merger between St George Bank and Advance Bank will help to position the new entity as a strong player in the competitive banking landscape.
