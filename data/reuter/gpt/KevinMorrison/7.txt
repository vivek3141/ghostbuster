Rupert Murdoch, the founder of News Corp, has announced his plans to use sports broadcasting as a “battering ram” to dominate the pay television markets globally. The billionaire media mogul intends to use his extensive sports portfolio to drive subscription sales and become the dominant force in the industry.
Murdoch built his fortune by building a global media empire which included newspapers, television networks, and film studios. In recent years, he has taken an active interest in sports broadcasting, recognizing it as a lucrative tool to drive subscriptions. News Corp now owns a range of assets in the sports broadcasting space, including subscription-based channels such as Sky Sports and ESPN+.
Murdoch's latest strategy is to bundle sports content with other pay television offerings, such as movies and TV shows, in order to gain an edge over competitors. This approach is not new, as companies like Amazon and Disney have successfully used bundling models to drive up subscription numbers and revenue.
The 90-year-old tycoon has always been a fierce competitor in the media industry, and he seems determined to keep it that way. By consolidating his sports broadcasting assets and leveraging their popularity, he aims to outstrip the competition and expand his influence in the fiercely competitive television market.
Murdoch's statement comes amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has disrupted the sports broadcasting landscape significantly. With restrictions on live attendance and new protocols in place for media coverage, some broadcasters have struggled to keep up with the challenges.
However, Murdoch sees this as an opportunity to acquire new assets at lower prices. As companies struggle to cope with the pandemic's effects, Murdoch could swoop in and snap up some valuable assets at a discount.
Despite criticism from analysts and the media about the cost of acquiring sports broadcasting assets, Murdoch seems undeterred. The media mogul remains bullish on the potential for sports to drive engagement and revenue in the pay television market. He has invested heavily in the sector with the hope that his long-term bet will pay off.
The strategy seems to be working as News Corp’s sports portfolio has seen a significant increase in popularity. Sky Sports, for instance, has continued to grow in subscribers, and ESPN+ has seen significant growth since its launch in 2018.
However, News Corp isn't alone in its quest to dominate the sports broadcasting space. Disney has also been making significant strides, with its acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2018. Amazon has been building up its sports broadcasting capabilities, too, with its recent acquisition of the rights to broadcast the UEFA Champions League.
Despite the stiff competition, Murdoch remains confident in his ability to become the dominant player in the industry. He has been known to use his vast resources to enter new markets, and his competitive streak is well established in the media landscape.
Murdoch's announcement has raised eyebrows and sparked much debate among analysts and other industry players. Some have hailed the move as a bold strategy to expand his media empire, while others have criticized the company for focusing too much on sports. However, Murdoch seems undeterred by such criticism and appears determined to use sports broadcasting as his opportunity to dominate the pay television market worldwide.
