News Corp's Q1 net profit falls 8.1%, missing market expectations, but 20% profit lift still possible
Global media giant News Corporation has reported a fall in its Q1 net profit, which has missed market expectations. However, the company has expressed confidence in its outlook, despite the poor start to the year.
For the quarter ended September 30, News Corp recorded a net profit of USD 128m, down from USD 139m in the same period last year. The result missed analysts' average forecasts of USD 140m. Revenues for the quarter also fell from USD 2.52bn to USD 2.27bn.
The drop was attributed to lower advertising revenues at News Corp's Australian and UK newspapers, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. However, News Corp CEO Robert Thomson said the company had made "encouraging headway" in its efforts to transform its business, citing growth at the company's digital assets, such as realtor.com, HarperCollins and Dow Jones.
"We remain confident in our ability to achieve our full-year targets and continue to position the company for long-term growth," Thomson said in a statement.
The company has also announced a three-year partnership with Google to sell advertising on its news websites, including The Wall Street Journal, Barron's and MarketWatch. The deal, which comes as News Corp prepares to launch a US news network later this year, is expected to generate significant revenue for the company. However, Thomson said the partnership would not affect the company's commitment to its own advertising technology initiatives.
"We believe that the combination of our creative expertise and Google's advertising technology will result in a formidable force in the global advertising world," Thomson said.
Despite the Q1 results, analysts remain bullish on News Corp's prospects. Paul Zwillenberg, CEO of media consultancy ESI, said the company's digital assets had "great potential" and warned against overreacting to what he saw as a "transitional quarter".
"There's no doubt that News Corp is in the midst of a significant transformation, but they have the resources and the talent to make it work," he said. "They've got a lot of exciting things in the pipeline, and I'm confident they can turn this situation around."
News Corp has also announced plans to expand its presence in India, following the successful launch of subscription-based streaming service Hotstar earlier this year. The company is reportedly in talks with local media firms, including Network18, to increase its stake in the country's media landscape. The move comes as India's media market is expected to grow rapidly over the next few years, with increasing penetration of smartphones and the internet.
"We see great potential in the Indian market, and we're committed to expanding our footprint there," Thomson said.
Despite the Q1 results, News Corp's share price has remained relatively stable, falling by just 1%. The company's stock has gained almost 40% in the past year, outpacing the broader S&P 500 index. Investors are said to be betting on the company's aggressive expansion plans, as well as its ability to adapt to the challenges facing the media industry.
"Our focus remains on driving long-term growth and creating value for our shareholders," Thomson said. "We're confident that we're on the right path, and we look forward to delivering on our promises over the coming year."
