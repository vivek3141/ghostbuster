Australian aluminium giant, Comalco Ltd, reported a 72% drop in net profit for the first half of 1996. The company, which had previously projected a healthy profit growth, cited weaker metal prices and a stronger Australian dollar as the key reasons for the significant decline.
Comalco's net profit for the six-month period ending June 30, 1996, was AUD 12.6 million, compared to AUD 45.4 million for the same period in 1995. The company reported revenue of AUD 764.3 million, down from AUD 884.1 million in the previous year.
The aluminium industry has been hit hard by a global oversupply of the metal, which has led to depressed prices. Comalco's Chief Executive, Mr. Ian Cockerill, acknowledged that the weaker metal prices had impacted the company's financial performance.
"We have seen a further decline in the US dollar aluminium price during the first half, resulting in a challenging market for our primary metal operations," Cockerill said.
The stronger Australian dollar also played a role in the drop in profits. Comalco, whose output is priced in US dollars, suffered from the appreciation of the Australian dollar against the greenback.
"The strength of the Australian dollar has had a significant impact on our earnings, as the majority of our sales are priced in US dollars. This effect has been exacerbated by the weakness in aluminium prices," Cockerill said.
Comalco's downstream businesses, which include bauxite mining, alumina refining, and rolled products operations, performed better than its primary metal segment. The company's bauxite division saw increased sales volumes, while its alumina and rolled products segments both returned to profitability after a loss in the previous year.
Despite the challenging market conditions, Comalco remains optimistic about the future. The company has undergone significant restructure and cost-cutting measures in recent years, which it believes will make it more resilient in the face of market fluctuations.
"We remain committed to our strategy of repositioning the company for long-term growth. We are taking action to reduce costs and improve efficiency across our operations," Cockerill said.
Comalco has also invested in several growth projects, including an expansion of its alumina refinery in Queensland and the development of a new bauxite mine in Far North Queensland.
"We have a strong pipeline of growth projects that will provide increased value over the long-term. We remain focused on delivering value to our shareholders and improving our competitive position," Cockerill added.
Despite Comalco's disappointing financial results, the company's shares remained relatively stable, indicating that investors still have confidence in the company's long-term prospects.
Comalco is one of Australia's leading producers of aluminium, with operations spanning mining, refining, and smelting. The company, which is majority-owned by global mining giant Rio Tinto, employs approximately 5,400 people and has a significant presence in Australia and New Zealand.
