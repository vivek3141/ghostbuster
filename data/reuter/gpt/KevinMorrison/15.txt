Optus Communications, one of Australia’s leading telecommunications companies, has reported its first annual profit and is now preparing for a sharemarket float.
The company, which has been operating since 1981, has been making significant strides lately, including achieving a net profit after tax (NPAT) of AU$146m for the 2020 financial year. The achievement marks a significant milestone for Optus, which had previously reported an annual loss of AU$41m in 2019.
With this win under its belt, the company is now taking steps to expand its investor base and has announced plans for an initial public offering (IPO) on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). According to sources, Optus’ parent company Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel) is looking to list up to 25% of the Australian business, with the IPO rumoured to be worth around AU$2bn.
The decision to go public is a significant move for the company, which has traditionally been a private entity. However, it is a strategic move for Optus, which aims to increase its capitalisation and leverage new investment opportunities.
Despite the ongoing pandemic and the economic impact it has had on many businesses, Optus’ strong performance has allowed it to weather the storm and continue expanding its services. With Australia’s increasing demand for faster and more reliable internet services, Optus is well-positioned to take advantage of the market’s growth potential.
“We are excited about the opportunity to expand our business and bring new innovations to the market. With the support of our investors, we can continue to grow and provide our customers with the best possible services,” said Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, CEO of Optus.
Optus has also been actively investing in its infrastructure to maintain its competitive edge. In June 2020, the company announced it would be investing AU$500m over two years to improve its networks and services, including 5G capabilities.
As part of its expansion plans, Optus is also looking to expand into new areas beyond traditional telecommunications. In 2020, it launched Optus Sport, a streaming service offering live and on-demand sports content. The service has been well-received, with more than 700,000 people signing up for Optus Sport subscriptions.
“We are exploring new opportunities to bring our customers more value and enhance their overall experience with our brand. Optus Sport is just one example of this, and we hope to launch more innovative services in the future,” said Bayer Rosmarin.
It remains to be seen what impact the IPO will have on Optus and its customers. There are concerns that a public listing may cause the company to focus more on short-term profits than long-term investments, which could negatively affect the quality of its services.
For now, however, Optus remains focused on its expansion plans and growing its customer base. With the launch of its multi-billion IPO, the company has signalled its intention to be a major player in the Australian telecommunications industry for years to come.
