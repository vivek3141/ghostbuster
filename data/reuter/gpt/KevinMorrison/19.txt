Boral Ltd, the Australian building materials manufacturer, has reported a poor start to the 1996/97 year due to the weak Australian housing market. Boral, which is one of Australia's largest companies, reported a net loss of $29.5 million for the first quarter of the year, compared with a net profit of $2.3 million for the same period last year.
The poor performance was largely due to the weak Australian housing market, which has been hit hard by rising interest rates and a slowdown in the economy. Boral's earnings from its building materials division, which includes its bricks and roofing products, were down by 21% compared with the same period last year.
Boral's Chief Executive, Rod Pearse, said that the poor performance was disappointing but not unexpected given the difficult economic conditions. "We have been expecting a tough start to the year, and the results reflect the challenges that we are facing in the Australian market," he said.
Pearse said that Boral had taken steps to cut costs and improve efficiency in response to the challenging market conditions. "We have already implemented a number of cost-cutting measures, including reducing our headcount and streamlining our operations, to ensure that we are well positioned to weather the current economic climate," he said.
Despite the poor start to the year, Pearse said that he remained optimistic about Boral's long-term prospects. "We are confident that we have the right strategy in place to deliver sustainable growth over the long-term, and we remain committed to investing in our business to ensure that we continue to deliver value to our shareholders," he said.
Analysts said that the weak housing market was likely to continue to weigh on Boral's earnings in the short-term. "The Australian housing market is one of the main drivers of Boral's earnings, so any weakness in that market is going to have a significant impact on the company's bottom line," said Johnathan Mott, an analyst at UBS.
Mott said that Boral's strategy of cutting costs and improving efficiency was a sensible one given the current economic climate. "Boral needs to focus on improving its productivity and reducing its costs in order to remain competitive in what is a very challenging market," he said.
However, Mott said that Boral would also need to focus on diversifying its operations if it wanted to reduce its dependence on the housing market. "Boral has a strong position in the building materials market, but it needs to start looking at other industries if it wants to reduce its exposure to the housing market," he said.
Boral has already taken steps to diversify its operations, with the company recently acquiring US-based Headwaters Inc, a supplier of building materials to the construction industry. The acquisition, which was completed in January this year, is expected to help boost Boral's earnings by providing it with a foothold in the North American building materials market.
Pearse said that the acquisition of Headwaters was part of Boral's strategy to diversify its operations and reduce its dependence on the Australian housing market. "The acquisition of Headwaters is a significant step in our strategy of diversifying our operations and expanding our footprint in key global markets," he said.
Boral's shares have fallen by around 20% this year, and the company has warned that its earnings for the full year are likely to be lower than previously expected due to the weak Australian housing market.
Despite the challenges that the company is facing, Pearse said that he remained confident about the future of Boral. "We have a strong business with a great track record, and we are well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities in our industry," he said. "We are confident that we will be able to deliver sustainable growth over the long-term and continue to provide value to our shareholders."
