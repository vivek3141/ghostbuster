Washington D.C. - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced on Tuesday that it is erasing a Depression-era rule that governed the rates that long-distance phone companies could charge each other. The decision is part of the agency’s efforts to modernize regulations and provide a more conducive environment for competition.
The rule, which was put in place in 1934, required long-distance phone companies to charge each other the same rate for using each other’s networks. Advocates for the rule argued that it prevented larger companies from using their market dominance to cut off competition by charging higher rates to independent carriers or simply refusing to connect their networks to those of potential competitors. But critics of the rule, including many in the telecom industry, argued that it created distortions in the market and discouraged innovation.
The FCC’s decision to eliminate the rule is likely to provoke both criticism and praise from different quarters. Supporters of the measure say that it will clear the way for more innovation in the telecom industry and allow newer, smaller companies to gain a foothold. They also argue that the move will help bring down prices for consumers and businesses.
One telecom industry insider praised the decision, arguing that “the telecom industry has changed dramatically since the 1930s, and it’s beyond time for regulations to catch up with that reality.” But others have criticized the FCC for effectively deregulating the long-distance phone market. Critics argue that without the rule, larger companies will be able to charge smaller ones higher rates, which could carve some smaller players out of the market altogether.
The FCC’s decision is part of a broader effort to reduce regulation and red tape in the telecommunications industry. Last year, the agency repealed net neutrality rules that would have required internet service providers to treat all online traffic equally. Supporters of that decision argued that it allowed ISPs to be more innovative and responsive to consumer needs, while critics argued that it would lead to bigger companies dominating the market and stifling competition.
The FCC has also been working to streamline the approval process for telecom companies, making it easier for them to build new infrastructure and deploy new services. Last year, the agency created a “one-touch make-ready” policy, which allows new telecom companies to more easily attach their equipment to existing poles and other infrastructure.
The telecom industry has been changing rapidly over the past decade, with new technologies and services emerging at a rapid pace. As a result, policymakers and regulators have been struggling to keep up with developments in the field. The FCC’s decision to eliminate the long-distance phone rate rule is just one example of how the agency is attempting to modernize regulations and adapt to the new realities of the market.
