After a 48-year-old ban, whiskey and gin are set to be advertised on broadcast media, joining beer and wine in the world of televised promotions. This decision was made by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS), which represents companies that produce and import distilled spirits, including gin, rum, tequila, and whiskey.
The ban was yesterday revoked by the DISCUS, signalling a huge shift in the company's attitudes towards advertising their products. Throughout this ban, producers of hard liquor were only allowed to advertise their alcoholic beverages in print media. While beer and wine were allowed to advertise on broadcast media, whiskey and gin were prohibited from advertising on television and radio stations.
This decision was made with the acknowledgment of the benefits the advertising will provide to American consumers, including job creation, increased economic activity, and the promotion of responsible consumption. DISCUS CEO, Chris Swonger said, "We are proud of our longstanding commitment to responsibility and this action aligns our advertising approach with other beverage alcohol categories and our members' evolving marketing and advertising practices."
The Council revealed that the advertising will not just depend on the prodigious production of liquor but also on the message that is conveyed. The advertising will set a limit, given the strict rules and regulations of responsible marketing and advertising of alcohol. This will ensure the prevention of overuse or irresponsibility and avoid any harmful effects on society.
After a considerable meeting, it was realized that the advertising will make it easier for beverage alcohol marketers to monitor the content and reach of their advertisements while at the same time making sure it remains responsible. Subsequently, this led to the conclusion that the new legislation would create jobs, increase economic activity and eliminate the unnecessary prohibition whose origins date to the 1970s when liquor advertising was said to be a major cause of drunk driving, rather than the drivers themselves.
In conclusion, liquor advertising is projected to evolve beyond reach and credibility. This will be boosted by ads for high-quality spirits. Cheers to the repeal of the 48-year-old broadcast liquor ad ban. This has been widely welcomed by connoisseurs of drinks, the alcohol industry and consumers alike.
