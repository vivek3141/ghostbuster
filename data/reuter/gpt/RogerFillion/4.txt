The Department of Justice (DOJ) has sought intervention from the Supreme Court to lift the suspension on federal rules for local telephone competition. The move is aimed at promoting increased competition and innovation in the telecommunications industry.
The suspension of the federal rules, known as the “Unlocking the Gridlock” rules, was put in place by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2017. The rules were designed to promote competition between local telephone service providers and increase access to broadband services in underserved areas.
The DOJ argues that the suspension of the rules has stymied competition in the telecommunications industry, resulting in higher prices and reduced innovation. The department also argues that the suspension has prevented smaller service providers from entering the market, thus limiting consumer choice.
“Competition is vital to maintaining an innovative and robust telecommunications industry that serves all Americans,” said Attorney General William P. Barr. “The suspension of the Unlocking the Gridlock rules has had a negative impact on competition in the industry, and we are seeking the Supreme Court’s intervention to lift the suspension and promote increased competition.”
The DOJ notes that the telecommunications industry has undergone significant changes in recent years, with new technologies and services emerging that were not contemplated when the original rules were put in place. The department believes that the rules should be updated to take into account these changes and promote competition and innovation in the industry.
The “Unlocking the Gridlock” rules were put in place in 1996 as part of the Telecommunications Act. The rules were designed to promote competition in the local telephone service industry, which at the time was dominated by a handful of large companies.
The rules required incumbent local exchange carriers to share their telephone networks with competitors, allowing new companies to enter the market and compete on an equal footing. The rules also required incumbent carriers to offer access to their networks at wholesale rates, enabling smaller companies to offer competitive pricing to customers.
The FCC suspended the rules in 2017, citing concerns that they were no longer necessary in a market that had become more competitive. The move was met with criticism from consumer advocacy groups and smaller service providers, who argued that the suspension would lead to higher prices and reduced competition.
The DOJ’s request for Supreme Court intervention is seen as a significant step in the ongoing debate over the future of the telecommunications industry. The court is expected to hear the case later this year, with a ruling likely to have far-reaching implications for the industry and consumers alike.
