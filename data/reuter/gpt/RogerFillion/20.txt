A recent survey has revealed that parents want the television industry to spell out the sexual and violence content of shows before they air. The survey, conducted by a prominent research institute, found that 86% of parents believe that TV shows should have this information clearly marked on them.
The survey was conducted across the country and collected data from parents with children aged between 5 and 18. The results of the survey found that parents are becoming increasingly concerned over the amount of sexual and violent content being aired on television. The findings indicate that these issues are a major concern for parents, who believe that the industry should take responsibility for ensuring that parents are fully informed about the content of the shows.
The survey also found that 72% of the parents believe that there should be stronger regulations around the content of television shows, and that broadcasters should be held accountable for the material they broadcast. A further 65% of parents surveyed believe that there should be more educational programs made available for children to watch.
The results of the survey have been welcomed by parenting groups and child advocacy groups, who are calling for the television industry to take notice of the concerns of parents. The groups are urging TV networks to take responsibility for the types of programs and content shown on their channels.
In response to the survey, a spokesperson for one of the major television networks stated that the network was committed to airing programs that were suitable for all audiences, and that they would continue to work with parents and advocacy groups to address concerns around the content of shows.
There is no doubt that the debate surrounding television content will continue, with parents demanding greater accountability and regulations around content. This survey highlights the need for greater transparency and clarity for parents around the programs their children are watching.  It remains to be seen whether the television industry will respond to these concerns, but the survey indicates that parents are becoming increasingly vocal in their demand for changes.
