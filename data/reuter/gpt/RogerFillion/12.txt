Regulators have put forward a proposal to provide $2.3bn in funding to connect schools and libraries across the United States to the internet at heavily discounted rates. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has outlined the ConnectED program, which aims to connect 20 million students to high-speed internet by 2020.
The FCC has acknowledged that internet connectivity is essential for students to succeed in the 21st century. It is not only a tool for education but also for job prospects and economic growth. In a statement, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said: “The new proposal is a smart, forward-thinking and responsible step that delivers on the promise to make sure every student, no matter where they live or what their circumstances, has access to the tools they need to succeed.”
The proposal is set to provide a ray of hope for several schools and libraries that are still operating below internet speeds required by the FCC. The recent proposal, which was approved in March 2016, amends the existing E-Rate program, established in 1996 to subsidize phone service in schools and libraries. The new proposal supports broadband services and Wi-Fi connections to the same institutions.
The ConnectED program aims to provide a foundational infrastructure that would allow schools and libraries to use digital resources to enhance their learning and teaching. The funding would also support the development and deployment of new educational technology aimed at improving teaching and learning in the classroom.
The ConnectED proposal is set to have far-reaching effects on American students. The program aims to equip students with the skills and knowledge required to succeed in the modern digital age, where internet connectivity is essential. The FCC has suggested that low-income and rural students stand to benefit the most from the program as they face the most significant challenges in getting access to quality internet and broadband services.
Many schools and libraries in rural communities, which are often remote and have limited resources, will benefit from the ConnectED program. The initiative will provide funding to upgrade internet infrastructure, which will ensure that they can receive the necessary connectivity required for their teaching programs and resources.
To ensure equitable distribution of the funds, the FCC is working with states, schools, and libraries to identify areas that are underserved or face challenges in providing internet and broadband services to students. The program aims to provide internet connectivity to every classroom in America by 2018.
The ConnectED program also aims to promote digital literacy and responsible use of the internet to students. The proposal intends to provide online safety education, including topics such as cyberbullying and online privacy. Digital literacy and safety remain essential skills for students in the digital age.
The ConnectED program has attracted support from various stakeholders, including educational organizations and private sector companies. The program is seen as critical to advancing educational technology and digital learning in America.
In conclusion, the ConnectED program is a significant initiative aimed at providing essential internet connectivity to American schools and libraries. It is a much-needed program that will help bridge the digital divide and enable students to succeed in the modern age. The program aims to make it possible for students to access digital resources, support their learning and promote responsible use of the internet. With the FCC's latest proposal, the program is set to achieve its goals and improve student access to quality education.
