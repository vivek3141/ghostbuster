Scottish Amicable, a UK-based life insurance company, has reportedly turned down a $2.3 billion takeover offer from Abbey National, a British multinational banking and financial services firm.
The proposed deal would have seen Abbey National acquire Scottish Amicable, which has been operating as a standalone subsidiary of Royal London Group since 2014.
Scottish Amicable was founded in 1826 and is headquartered in Edinburgh. The company offers a range of life insurance, pensions, and investment products to customers in the UK and internationally.
According to sources, Abbey National approached Scottish Amicable with an unsolicited bid in October 2021. The offer valued the insurance company at approximately $2.3 billion, representing a significant premium to its current market value.
However, Scottish Amicable’s board of directors reportedly rejected the offer on the grounds that it did not accurately reflect the company’s true worth.
In a statement on the matter, Scottish Amicable CEO Barry O’Dwyer said: “We have a clear vision for our business and are confident in our ability to deliver long-term value to our customers and shareholders. The offer from Abbey National did not meet our expectations in terms of value, and we therefore declined it.”
O’Dwyer added that Scottish Amicable’s board had carefully considered the offer and consulted with its financial advisers before making its decision.
The news of the rejected bid has caused speculation about the future direction of both Scottish Amicable and Abbey National.
Some analysts have suggested that Abbey National’s interest in Scottish Amicable may have been driven by a desire to diversify its revenue streams and expand its product offering.
However, others have suggested that the proposed deal may have been primarily motivated by a desire to gain access to Scottish Amicable’s large customer base and distribution channels.
Abbey National has not yet commented on the matter, although it is understood that the company is considering its options for how best to proceed.
The news comes at a challenging time for the insurance industry, which has been grappling with a range of issues including increasing costs, regulatory changes, and shifts in consumer behaviour.
Despite these challenges, Scottish Amicable has remained focused on delivering strong financial results and expanding its customer base.
In its most recent financial report, the company reported a 14% increase in new business sales over the previous quarter, driven by strong demand for its life insurance and pension products.
The report also noted that Scottish Amicable had taken steps to streamline its operations and reduce costs, which had contributed to a significant improvement in its operating margin.
The news of the rejected bid has been met with mixed reactions from Scottish Amicable shareholders.
Some have expressed disappointment that the company is not willing to consider a takeover offer that would have delivered a substantial return on their investment.
Others, however, have praised Scottish Amicable’s decision to reject the offer, arguing that the company is in a strong position and does not need to sell itself to a larger firm in order to continue growing and delivering value to shareholders.
The situation is likely to remain unclear for some time, as both Scottish Amicable and Abbey National consider their next move.
For now, Scottish Amicable shareholders can take comfort in the fact that their company is committed to delivering long-term value and remains focused on delivering strong financial performance in a challenging business environment.
