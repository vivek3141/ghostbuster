London, 26th March 2021: The traditional members of the Lloyd's of London insurance market are expected to keep declining, according to the CEO of major investor Blackstone Group Inc.
Steve Schwarzman, the CEO of Blackstone, said in a recent interview with Bloomberg TV that the traditional members of Lloyd’s, known as "names," who put up their personal wealth as collateral to back insurance policies, are rapidly dwindling. This follows a long-running trend of falling numbers, which he expects to continue.
“It’s been going on for some time. They [names] have either been dying or retiring or deciding it’s too risky,” Schwarzman said.
Lloyd’s, the world’s oldest insurance market, has seen its traditional membership fall from around 34,000 in the 1980s to fewer than 3,000 today. The reason behind this decline is twofold: the increasing adoption of corporate-style capital through external investors and the difficulty for individuals to meet new regulatory requirements designed to protect policyholders.
Schwarzman called for more external capital and institutional investors in Lloyd’s, saying that Blackstone is “really bullish” on the market. After a difficult year for the insurance sector thanks to the pandemic and a string of natural disasters, Schwarzman sees Lloyd’s as well positioned for the times ahead, with the capacity to assimilate significant amounts of capital.
The shift towards third-party capital has funded entry by insurance-linked securities (ILS) funds and institutional investors, which have grown by around £7.5 billion ($10.3 billion) in recent years. Schwarzman has said institutional investors, such as Blackstone, are turning to insurance-linked markets to generate returns and hedge risks.
Despite fears surrounding upcoming regulatory reforms and a recent tumultuous trading year, Lloyd’s is still seen by many in the industry as a valuable destination for investors seeking to gain a foothold in the insurance market.
The influx of external capital has not gone unnoticed by traditional members, who feel their interests are being sidelined. However, with traditional members expected to keep declining, the Lloyd's market may continue its shift towards institutional investors and external capital.
