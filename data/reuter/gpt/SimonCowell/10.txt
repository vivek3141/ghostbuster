London, U.K. - Ladbroke Group and Hilton Hotels Corp announced today their reunion in a global alliance over 32 years since they last combined forces. The move is expected to strengthen the hospitality industry, providing hotel patrons with greater access to a wider range of services and experiences.
The Ladbroke Group, which owns Ladbrokes Coral Group, is one of the largest sports betting and gaming corporations in the world. With a presence in Australia, Europe, North America, and Asia, they have become a leader in the industry. Hilton Hotels Corp, on the other hand, is one of the most recognizable names in the hotel industry with properties in more than 100 countries.
The newly formed alliance will allow for the creation of numerous marketing and joint venture partnerships that will offer customers unique experiences and services. Ladbrokes Coral’s extensive customer database will be combined with the Hilton Honors loyalty program. This will enable customers to have access to added benefits, services, and experiences when they book Hilton hotels worldwide.
Jane Torrance, Chief Product and Marketing Officer at Ladbrokes Coral Group, has stated that "We are excited to announce our reunion with Hilton Hotels Corp. This global alliance will help us diversify our business portfolio, and elevate the level of services we offer customers. We believe the brand and loyalty strengths of both companies will pave the way for further opportunities in the future."
This move is just the latest in a string of recent acquisitions and mergers in the hotel industry, as corporations aim to attract more customers to their properties. Some of the most significant mergers in recent memory include the Marriott-Starwood merger and Accor’s purchase of Fairmont, Raffles, and Swissotel. The goal of these mergers is to create a more consolidated industry that can offer more extensive customer bases and greater economies of scale.
Christopher J. Nassetta, CEO of Hilton Hotels Corp, said “We are delighted to reunite with Ladbrokes Coral Group after all these years. This alliance will allow us to provide a superior level of service that will benefit our customers, employees, and the industry as a whole.”
With Ladbrokes Coral’s extensive customer database and Hilton Hotels Group's global reach, the potential for this partnership is limitless. The alliance will likely enable both companies to reach new markets and offer innovative services, while creating new revenue streams and benefits for their customers. The reunion between these two industry giants provides a clear visualization of how the hospitality industry is undergoing a revolution, and how alliances are becoming more important than ever.
