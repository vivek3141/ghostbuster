Scottish Amicable, the 170-year-old mutual life insurer, is set to abandon its mutual status and embark on flotation to enhance its financial stability and growth prospects. The company announced that it is preparing to offer policyholders a special bonus and future benefits as part of the process.
The historic insurer, which had been operating under the mutual model since its establishment in 1826, said that the move would enable it to raise more capital, compete better, and offer a wider range of products and services. The company's board had unanimously approved the demutualization plans, subject to regulatory and policyholder approvals.
The insurer aims to raise up to £500m from the initial public offering (IPO) expected to take place later this year. The proceeds would be used to boost the firm's financial strength, support its growth ambitions, and enhance policyholders' value. The company added that it would also seek to establish a new charity reflected in its branding.
Under the demutualization plan, eligible policyholders would receive a special bonus, calculated as a proportion of their policy value. The payout would range from £500 to £5,000, depending on policy size, type, and longevity. Additionally, Scottish Amicable said that policyholders would become shareholders in the new public company, allowing them to participate in its future success and growth. The company also pledged to offer future benefits, including a policyholder loyalty scheme and a range of discounted products and services.
The insurer emphasized that the move would not affect the security or coverage of its existing policies, which would continue to be provided under the same terms and conditions. The policies would also be protected by a new policyholder committee, which would represent the interests of policyholders and ensure that they have a say in the company's governance.
Commenting on the announcement, Scottish Amicable CEO, John Williamson, said: "This is an exciting and transformational move for our company, which will enable us to continue to meet our policyholders' needs, compete more effectively, and provide enhanced value and benefits. We are committed to ensuring that our policyholders are at the heart of the process and that they receive fair treatment, adequate compensation, and a say in our future direction."
The move by Scottish Amicable follows a trend among UK mutual insurers that have converted to the PLC (public limited company) structure in recent years, including Standard Life, NFU Mutual, and Royal London. The shift has been driven by increased regulatory scrutiny, tougher capital requirements, and pressure to remain competitive in a changing market environment.
In conclusion, Scottish Amicable's decision to demutualize and seek flotation represents a significant milestone in its history and a major strategic shift for the company. The move is expected to offer policyholders a unique opportunity to benefit from the firm's future growth and value, while enabling Scottish Amicable to enhance its financial strength and competitive position. The company aims to complete the demutualization process by the end of the year, subject to approval and market conditions.
