Nicola Horlick, the former chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, has reportedly admitted to holding discussions with ABN AMRO before her suspension from Morgan Grenfell in 1997.
Horlick, who was known at the time as one of the most prominent women in finance, left Morgan Grenfell following allegations that she had encouraged colleagues to invest in a film scheme that was later found to be a tax avoidance scheme. She vehemently denied the allegations and sued her former employer for wrongful dismissal.
Now, over two decades later, Horlick has reportedly stated that she had indeed held talks with ABN AMRO while still employed at Morgan Grenfell. However, in an interview with Sky News, Horlick denies any wrongdoing and states that the discussions were entirely above board.
According to Horlick, the discussions with ABN AMRO were centered around establishing a new business line within Morgan Grenfell that would focus on high-net-worth individuals. Horlick states that she had informed Morgan Grenfell of the discussions and that they were fully aware of her intentions.
Despite this, Horlick was suspended from her role at Morgan Grenfell and subsequently left the company. The suspension was in relation to the film scheme allegations, rather than any discussions with ABN AMRO.
Horlick has stated that she believes her suspension was unrelated to the discussions with ABN AMRO and that she was simply a victim of a wider scandal within the investment bank. She has called for an independent inquiry into the events of 1997, stating that the true facts have never been fully disclosed.
The revelations come as the financial industry is facing increased scrutiny over its treatment of women and the lack of diversity within its ranks. Horlick, who has been a vocal advocate for women in finance, has stated that the industry still has a long way to go in terms of addressing these issues.
In a separate interview with the Financial Times, Horlick has called for more women to be appointed to senior positions within the finance industry. She has argued that greater diversity will lead to better decision-making and ultimately better outcomes.
The revelations about Horlick's discussions with ABN AMRO will likely cast a new light on her departure from Morgan Grenfell and the wider scandal that engulfed the investment bank. However, Horlick remains adamant that she did nothing wrong and that her intentions were entirely honorable.
The financial industry will no doubt be watching developments closely, particularly in light of the renewed focus on diversity and gender equality. Whatever the outcome, the story serves as a reminder of the challenges still faced by women in finance and the importance of transparency and accountability in the sector.
