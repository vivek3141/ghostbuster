Abbey National, one of the largest banks in the UK, has urged Scottish Amicable (ScotAm) to halt its demutualisation plans. The call comes after the Edinburgh-based firm announced that it was considering a conversion to a public limited company (PLC) from a mutual insurer.
In a letter to ScotAm CEO, David Pollard, Abbey National's CEO, Ian Harley, warned that the move could damage policyholders and result in a "poor deal" for them. In the letter, Harley stated that Abbey National was concerned about the impact of demutualisation on the Scottish life assurance market and that it would like ScotAm to reconsider its decision.
"We are mindful of the significant benefits that the mutual model provides to policyholders, including long-term investment in the business, and we are concerned that ScotAm's demutualisation plans may not be in the best interests of policyholders," said Harley in the letter.
Demutualisation refers to the process of converting a mutual insurance company, owned by its policyholders, into a publicly traded company owned by shareholders. The aim is to raise capital and increase the company's value, but the move often results in a windfall payment for policyholders who lose their ownership rights.
However, Harley warned that the windfall payments may not be sufficient to offset the losses incurred by policyholders. He also raised concerns about the future of the company and the potential for changes in management, which could negatively impact policyholders over the long term.
"We fear that the windfall payments may not compensate policyholders for the loss of ownership, and the potential for negative impacts on policyholders in the future is also a concern," he added.
Abbey National, which has a strong presence in the UK life assurance market, also expressed concerns about the impact of the demutualisation on competition in the sector. The bank urged ScotAm to engage with existing mutuals in the market and explore opportunities for collaboration rather than conversion.
"Mutuals have a long history of serving the best interests of policyholders, and we believe that ScotAm should explore all alternatives to demutualisation before pursuing this course of action," said Harley.
The call from Abbey National comes after several other insurance companies, including Standard Life, Liverpool Victoria, and Royal London, have undergone demutualisation in recent years. However, demutualisation remains a contentious issue, with many arguing that it puts the interests of shareholders ahead of customers.
ScotAm, a subsidiary of Royal London, is one of the oldest life assurance companies in Scotland, with a history dating back to 1826. The firm currently has over 500,000 policyholders, with assets under management worth around Â£6.5bn.
In response to the letter from Abbey National, ScotAm issued a statement saying that it was committed to delivering value and benefits to its policyholders and that it would carefully consider all options. The company also stressed that any changes would be subject to rigorous regulatory approval and consultation with policyholders.
"We have always been committed to delivering value and benefits to our policyholders, and we will continue to do so as we consider our options. Any changes we make will be subject to rigorous regulatory approval and consultation with our policyholders," said ScotAm CEO, David Pollard.
The demutualisation debate is expected to continue in the coming months, with many in the industry calling for a balanced approach that prioritises the interests of customers and policyholders over those of shareholders.
