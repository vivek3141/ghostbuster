In a bold move to challenge the dominance of computer industry giants Microsoft and Intel, Sun Microsystems has introduced JavaStation, a network computer designed to simplify computer use and reduce costs for businesses and consumers.
The JavaStation, which runs on the Java operating system, is a compact device that connects to a server over a network and offers users a range of applications and services. It does not have a hard drive or diskettes, but instead uses a smart card or USB drive for storage. The JavaStation is designed to be easy to set up and use, making it an attractive option for small businesses and home users.
Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy said the JavaStation was part of a broader effort to make computing more affordable and accessible to all. "The JavaStation is an example of our commitment to simplify computing and reduce costs," McNealy said at a press conference announcing the product. "We believe that by leveraging network computing, we can provide not only more affordable solutions for businesses and consumers, but also more convenient and flexible solutions."
The JavaStation is just one part of Sun's broader strategy to challenge Microsoft and Intel's dominance in the computer industry. Sun has long been a leader in network computing, which involves using powerful servers to provide computing services to users over a network. Sun's Java programming language, introduced in 1995, has become a popular choice for building web-based applications and services that run on a variety of devices.
By focusing on network computing and open standards like Java, Sun has positioned itself as an alternative to Microsoft and Intel's closed, proprietary approach. Sun's strategy has not always been successful, however. In the early 2000s, Sun struggled financially as the dot-com bubble burst and the company's hardware business faced fierce competition from Dell and other low-cost PC makers.
But Sun has rebounded in recent years, thanks in part to strong demand for its servers and storage products. In 2009, Sun was acquired by Oracle Corporation, which has continued to invest in the company's technology and products.
The JavaStation is one of Sun's most ambitious efforts to challenge Microsoft and Intel's dominance in the computer industry. The device is designed to offer a low-cost, simple alternative to traditional desktop computers, which can be expensive and complicated to manage.
According to Sun, the JavaStation is ideal for businesses that need to deploy a large number of computers quickly and easily, such as call centers or retail stores. The device can be customized with specific applications and services to meet the needs of different businesses.
In addition to the JavaStation, Sun has introduced a range of other products and services aimed at challenging Microsoft and Intel's dominance in the computer industry. These include the Solaris operating system, which competes with Microsoft's Windows and Linux; the MySQL database, which competes with Microsoft's SQL Server and Oracle's own database products; and the OpenOffice productivity suite, which competes with Microsoft Office.
While Sun's strategy of focusing on open standards and network computing has won it many fans in the industry, it has also faced criticism from some who say the company has been slow to adapt to changing market conditions. Some analysts have questioned whether Sun is capable of competing with Microsoft and Intel, given their massive resources and entrenched market positions.
But Sun remains confident that its approach will pay off in the long run. "We believe that the JavaStation and our other products and services offer a compelling alternative to the costly and complex desktop computers that dominate the market today," McNealy said. "By leveraging the power of the network, we can provide more affordable, flexible, and innovative solutions that meet the needs of businesses and consumers alike." 
Only time will tell if Sun Microsystems can truly challenge the dominance of Microsoft and Intel, but one thing is certain: the company's commitment to open standards and network computing is changing the way we think about computing and the computer industry as a whole.
