Netscape Communications Corp. revealed a low-cost version of its software for corporate networks on Monday to help the company compete in a crowded market with rival Microsoft Corp.
The new software, called Netscape SuiteSpot 3.0, bundles several applications designed to help businesses manage email, Internet access and corporate intranets. Netscape SuiteSpot 3.0 is priced at $1,295 per server, the lowest price point for the company's software for corporate networks.
Netscape's move comes as it faces increasing pressure from market leader Microsoft. According to the latest figures from International Data Corp., Microsoft held a commanding lead in the corporate server software market with 40 percent market share in 1997, while Netscape had only 8 percent.
Netscape also announced a strategic alliance with Microsoft in a bid to expand its market. Under the alliance, Microsoft agreed to bundle Netscape's Netcaster software with its Internet Explorer browser, while Netscape will provide support for Microsoft's ActiveX technology in future products.
Analysts believe Netscape's move into the low-cost, entry-level server software market could help the company compete with Microsoft while also widening its customer base.
"Netscape is aiming to capture the entry point of the market with this low-cost product," said Neil Macehiter, an analyst at Ovum, a London-based research firm. "It's an important offering for the company to have, as it leverages the strength of Netscape's core technology at a more affordable price point."
Netscape CEO and chairman Jim Barksdale said in a statement that the new software is designed to help small and medium-sized businesses take advantage of the benefits of corporate networks without the high cost.
"With SuiteSpot 3.0, we are giving customers greater control over their networks, while letting them reap the benefits of Internet and intranet-based computing at a price that's affordable for even the smallest businesses," he said.
Netscape SuiteSpot 3.0 is designed to work with a variety of operating systems, including Windows NT, Sun Solaris and IBM AIX. It includes a range of tools to manage corporate email, Internet access and intranet-based collaboration. The software also includes support for SSL encryption and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) tunneling to help safeguard corporate data.
Netscape's strategic alliance with Microsoft comes as the two companies continue to compete in the browser market. Microsoft's Internet Explorer holds a commanding lead in the market, with Netscape Navigator losing market share since 1997. The two companies have also clashed over the use of Java technology, with Microsoft's own version of Java being incompatible with Netscape's.
Despite their rivalry, Netscape executives believe the strategic alliance will help the company increase sales of its products while also expanding Microsoft's browser offerings.
"We view this as an opportunity to broaden our product line and increase the reach of our technology," said Netscape president and chief operating officer Mike Homer in a statement. "Our customers have been asking for a choice of browser, and we're pleased to be working with Microsoft to provide them with that choice."
Microsoft executives also welcomed the alliance, with group vice president Bob Muglia calling it a "good step for customers" in a statement.
"This agreement will give customers a convenient way to obtain a choice of Web browsers from industry leaders," he said. "We believe that offering customers a choice of browsers is important, and we're excited to be working with Netscape on this effort."
Netscape's move into the low-cost server market and its alliance with Microsoft are seen as key steps toward helping the company compete with its larger rival while also expanding its customer base. For small businesses looking to take advantage of corporate networks and intranet-based applications, SuiteSpot 3.0 could be an affordable option, while Microsoft's decision to bundle Netscape's Netcaster software with Internet Explorer could help expand its presence in the browser market.
As competition in the market continues to heat up, both companies are likely to continue to innovate and collaborate in their efforts to meet the needs of their customers and outmaneuver each other in the battle for market dominance.
