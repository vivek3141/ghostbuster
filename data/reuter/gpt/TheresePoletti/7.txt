IBM Corporation is one of the leading technology companies in the world. The company has been in the business for more than a century and has grown to become a global giant in the technology and services industry. In recent years, IBM has focused on expanding its cloud and cognitive computing business to diversify its earnings stream.
With the release of IBM's third-quarter earnings report approaching, analysts have been predicting how the company's earnings will fare for the quarter. According to consensus estimates, analysts expect IBM's earnings to grow by 5% compared to the same period last year.
IBM has been investing heavily in its cloud business, which has been experiencing strong growth in recent years. The company's cloud revenue increased by 30% in the second quarter, and its cloud services backlog grew to $23.5 billion. This trend is expected to continue in the third quarter, with analysts predicting that IBM's cloud revenue will grow by double digits.
IBM's cognitive computing business, which includes its Watson artificial intelligence platform, is also expected to contribute to the company's earnings growth in the third quarter. Watson has been gaining traction in various industries, including healthcare, finance, and retail. The platform has been helping businesses to solve complex problems and gain insights from large amounts of data.
Another area that is expected to drive IBM's earnings growth is the company's hybrid cloud business. IBM has been partnering with other companies to offer hybrid cloud solutions that allow businesses to integrate their on-premises data centers with public cloud services. This approach has been gaining popularity among companies that want to take advantage of the scalability and flexibility offered by the cloud while maintaining control over their data.
Despite the positive outlook for IBM's earnings, there are also a few areas of concern that analysts are keeping an eye on. One of these is the company's legacy hardware business, which has been in decline for several years. IBM has been divesting its low-margin hardware businesses to focus on higher-margin services and software, but the division is still a significant part of the company's overall revenue.
Another area of concern is IBM's services business, which has also been struggling in recent years. The division has been affected by increased competition from other companies, as well as a shift towards smaller, more specialized services providers. IBM has been trying to address these challenges by focusing on higher-margin services, such as cloud and cognitive services, but it remains to be seen if this strategy will be successful.
Overall, analysts remain cautiously optimistic about IBM's third-quarter earnings. The company's investments in cloud and cognitive computing are expected to drive growth, while its legacy hardware and services businesses continue to be a drag on revenue. Nevertheless, if IBM can continue to execute its strategy and capitalize on the growing demand for cloud, cognitive, and hybrid cloud solutions, it has the potential to deliver solid earnings in the quarters ahead.
