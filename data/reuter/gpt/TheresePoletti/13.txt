Compaq Computer Corp, one of the world's largest manufacturers of personal computers, has lost a key executive to an internet startup. Mark Wills, a top executive at Compaq, has left his position to become president and CEO of pcOrder.com, an e-commerce company based in Austin, Texas. The move is a significant blow to Compaq, which has been struggling to maintain its dominance in the PC industry amid fierce competition from competitors such as Dell, HP, and Lenovo.
Wills, who had been with Compaq for 15 years, was widely seen as a rising star in the company. He had most recently served as senior vice president of global enterprise sales and services, overseeing Compaq's largest customers, including corporations, governments, and educational institutions.
In his new role at pcOrder.com, Wills will be responsible for leading the company's efforts to expand its e-commerce platform, which enables businesses to order technology products and services online. The company serves a range of industries, including healthcare, education, and government.
"pcOrder.com is at the forefront of innovation in the e-commerce space, and I'm excited to be joining such a talented and dedicated team," Wills said in a statement. "Our goal is to empower businesses with the tools and technology they need to succeed in a rapidly changing digital landscape."
The news of Wills' departure has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, with many analysts speculating about the impact it could have on Compaq's business. While the company has been making strides to diversify its product portfolio, including recent investments in cloud computing and cybersecurity, the loss of a top executive could hamper those efforts.
"Compaq has been struggling to adapt to the changing dynamics of the PC industry, and losing someone of Mark Wills' caliber is a significant setback," said Timothy Lajer, an industry analyst with Gartner Inc. "It remains to be seen how the company will respond, but it's clear that they will need to find a way to keep pace with the competition."
Compaq, which was founded in 1982, rose to prominence in the 1990s as one of the leading PC manufacturers in the world. The company was known for its innovative products and aggressive marketing strategies, which helped it capture a large share of the market.
However, in recent years, Compaq has struggled to maintain its market share amid fierce competition from companies such as Dell, HP, and Lenovo. Sales of PCs have also been declining, as consumers increasingly turn to smartphones and tablets for their computing needs.
To stay competitive, Compaq has been making strategic investments, including recent acquisitions of companies in the cloud computing and cybersecurity markets. The company has also been focusing on its services business, which includes consulting, support, and financing for its customers.
Despite these efforts, Compaq has continued to struggle with declining sales and profits. In the most recent quarter, the company reported a 4% decline in revenue compared to the same period last year, with net income falling by 19%.
The departure of Mark Wills is likely to further complicate Compaq's efforts to turn its business around. The company will now need to find a way to replace one of its top executives while also making progress on its strategic goals.
For pcOrder.com, Wills' appointment is a major coup. The company has been growing rapidly in recent years, with revenues increasing by 65% in 2020. With Wills at the helm, the company is well-positioned to continue its expansion into new markets and industries.
"Mark Wills is a proven leader with a track record of success in the tech industry," said John McMillan, chairman of pcOrder.com. "We're excited to have him on board and look forward to working with him to take our business to the next level."
The news of Wills' departure is a reminder that the tech industry is constantly in flux, with new companies emerging and established players struggling to adapt. For Compaq, the loss of a top executive is a setback, but the company's long history of innovation and resilience suggests that it will find a way to navigate the challenges ahead. As for pcOrder.com, the appointment of Mark Wills is a sign that the company is well-positioned to seize opportunities in the fast-changing world of e-commerce.
