Former Executive Vice President of Compaq Computer Corporation, Sam Wyly, has left his $7 billion North American computer business to join the internet startup pcOrder.com as their new Chairman and CEO. Wyly will receive a salary of only $1 a year, and his move to the startup marks a significant shift in his career. 
Wyly is widely known as a pioneer in the computer industry. He was the founder and CEO of University Computing Company before selling it to Honeywell in 1968. He then founded Sterling Software in 1981, which he sold to Computer Associates in 2000. Wyly joined Compaq in 1996, as a result of the acquisition of Digital Equipment Corporation. 
He was responsible for managing Compaq's North American computer business, which generated annual revenues of $7 billion at the time. During his tenure, Wyly led many initiatives to grow the business and improve customer satisfaction. He was a strong advocate for Compaq's direct sales and online sales channels, which helped the company to become a leader in the personal computer market.
Wyly's move to pcOrder.com is a bold one, as the startup is relatively unknown in the industry. However, Wyly has a knack for spotting opportunities and taking risks that pay off in the long run. In an interview with Forbes, he explained that he believes pcOrder.com has the potential to "revolutionize the way businesses purchase technology."
pcOrder.com is an e-commerce platform that allows businesses to easily purchase technology products and services. The startup was founded in 1997 by six former Dell executives and has since raised over $70 million in funding. Wyly's role as Chairman and CEO is expected to take the company to new heights.
The decision to accept a salary of only $1 a year is a statement of Wyly's commitment to the startup. He explained, "I'm not doing this for the money. I see a great opportunity here to help a company that has a lot of potential. I want to be a part of that."
Wyly's move to pcOrder.com has been met with mixed reactions. Some industry experts are skeptical of his decision to leave a stable, well-paying job at Compaq for a high-risk startup. However, others see this move as a testament to Wyly's entrepreneurial spirit and willingness to take risks.
Many are also intrigued by the potential impact that Wyly could have on pcOrder.com. His extensive experience in the computer industry and his history of successful business ventures make him a valuable asset for the startup. Wyly has a proven track record of building strong relationships with customers and partners, which will be crucial for pcOrder.com as it grows its business.
The news of Wyly's move to pcOrder.com has also raised questions about the future of Compaq's North American computer business. Some analysts suggest that Wyly's departure could be a sign of trouble for the business unit. However, others believe that Compaq will continue to thrive without him.
