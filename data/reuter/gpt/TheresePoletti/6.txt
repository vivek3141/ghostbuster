Compaq Computer Corp. announced today that it had achieved a sharp rise in profit, with a 43% jump in the third quarter of the year, with sales boosting and streamlined operations. The result is seen as yet another milestone for the company in its remarkable turnaround since CEO Michael Capellas took over in early 2000.
According to the report, the company's net income stood at $357 million, or 21 cents per share, compared with $249 million, or 15 cents per share, in the same quarter in 1999. This earnings performance also surprised Wall Street analysts, who had estimated earnings of only 15 cents per share.
"We feel great about our performance in the third quarter," Capellas said in a statement. "We exceeded our financial objectives due to strong growth in key product areas and solid execution of our operational efficiency initiatives."
Sales for the quarter also grew by 22% to $10.14 billion compared with $8.32 billion in the same period last year. This jump was driven by strong revenue growth in the company's business computing, storage, and consumer products divisions. Compaq has worked hard to reduce its PC business as it looks to bolster other areas.
In recent years, Compaq had struggled to compete in the PC market, with stiff competition from Dell and Hewlett-Packard. But the company has now refocused on high-margin businesses, including servers, storage, and software, with considerable success.
The company's operational improvements have also helped boost its bottom line. Compaq has implemented a series of cost-cutting measures over the past year, such as plant closures, job cuts, and reductions in capital spending. These moves have allowed the company to achieve greater efficiency and stronger profitability.
Compaq's PC sales, however, were stagnant, with sales even dropping slightly to $2.68 billion from $2.69 billion. The company has pointed to a slow PC market and significant competition in this space.
Despite the challenges, Compaq's CEO remains optimistic about the company's prospects. "We believe that our focus on high-growth, high-margin businesses, along with our operational improvements, will result in continued profitability and shareholder value," Capellas said.
The earnings announcement is likely to give a boost to the company's stock. Compaq shares were down more than 50% earlier this year but have since rebounded, thanks in part to strong earnings reports.
Compaq's success also comes amid a broader revival in the technology industry, which has long taken a beating due to concerns about overhyped valuations and a downturn in the American economy. But now, with the economy gradually rebounding, technology companies like Compaq are well positioned to profit.
The Compaq earnings report caps off a strong quarter for the technology industry. IBM, Sun Microsystems, and Hewlett-Packard have all recently reported strong earnings. Industry analysts suggest that this bodes well for the technology industry going forward and could signify the end of the technology industry's troubles.
With stronger revenue growth, operational efficiency, and a refocused business focus, Compaq Computer Corp. appears set for continued success in the months ahead. Investors and industry analysts alike will no doubt keep an eye on the company's progress as it continues its impressive turnaround story.
