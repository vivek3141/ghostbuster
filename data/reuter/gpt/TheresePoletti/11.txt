Unisys Corp. and Stratus Computer Inc. have recently reported improved results for Q3 2021. The two major technology companies have recorded significant growth in revenue and earnings, despite the ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Unisys Corp., a leading provider of digital transformation and IT solutions, reported a revenue of $667 million in Q3, up by 4% compared to the same period last year. The company attributed its positive results to the strong demand for its cloud and security services, which have become essential in the current remote work environment.
Unisys' CEO, Peter Altabef, said in a statement: "We are very pleased with our Q3 results, which demonstrate the resilience and agility of our business in the face of the pandemic. Our focus on providing innovative cloud and digital solutions has helped us to meet the evolving needs of our customers and drive growth."
Meanwhile, Stratus Computer Inc., a provider of fault-tolerant computer systems, reported a revenue of $92 million in Q3, up by 6% compared to the same period last year. The company's growth was driven by the increased demand for its advanced edge computing solutions, which have been widely adopted in industries such as manufacturing, transportation, and healthcare.
Dave Laurello, Stratus' CEO, said in a statement: "Our strong Q3 results are a testament to the value that our solutions bring to our customers, especially in these challenging times. We are proud to be at the forefront of the edge computing revolution, and we remain committed to delivering innovative and reliable systems that can withstand the toughest environments."
Both companies also recorded improvements in their earnings for Q3. Unisys reported an adjusted EBITDA of $97 million, up by 19% compared to the same period last year, while Stratus reported an adjusted EBITDA of $14 million, up by 13% compared to the same period last year.
The positive results have been welcomed by investors, with both companies' stock prices rising following the release of their Q3 earnings reports. Unisys' stock price rose by over 7% in after-hours trading, while Stratus' stock price increased by over 3%.
The two companies' improved results come at a time when many businesses are struggling to navigate the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic. The technology sector has been particularly affected, with many companies facing disruptions in the supply chain, decreased demand for their products and services, and tighter budgets.
However, Unisys and Stratus' success highlights the importance of investing in innovative and resilient solutions that can help businesses cope with the challenges of the current environment. Cloud services, edge computing, and fault-tolerant systems have become crucial tools for enabling remote work, ensuring business continuity, and enhancing operational efficiency.
Looking ahead, Unisys and Stratus remain optimistic about their future prospects, despite the ongoing uncertainties of the pandemic. Unisys has reiterated its commitment to its "One Unisys" strategy, which aims to drive growth through innovation, customer focus, and operational excellence. Stratus, meanwhile, is continuing to invest in its edge computing solutions and expand its customer base across different industries and regions.
As businesses continue to adapt to the new normal, the demand for technology solutions that can support remote work, digital transformation, and business resilience is expected to remain strong. Unisys and Stratus, with their innovative offerings and strong market positions, are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities and deliver ongoing growth and value to their customers and shareholders.
