The war between Shanghai Film Studio and movie distributor Yongle has escalated, with the former now taking steps to fight back against the latter's aggressive expansion in China's cinema chain industry.
The feud between the two companies began when Yongle, which is backed by Internet giant Tencent, started to aggressively acquire cinemas across China in 2016. The move was seen by many as an attempt to take control of the country's lucrative cinema industry and put pressure on rivals, including Shanghai Film Studio.
In response, Shanghai Film Studio has been taking steps to defend its turf by opening more cinemas and partnering with other companies to boost its market position.
One of the most significant moves from Shanghai Film Studio has been its strategic alliance with leading Chinese cinema chain operator Wanda Cinemas in 2018. The partnership saw Shanghai Film Studio take a 30% stake in Wanda Cinemas, with the aim of improving its market competitiveness and expanding its global reach.
However, Yongle has continued to expand aggressively, and its market share has grown substantially over the past few years. This has put increased pressure on Shanghai Film Studio and its partners, including Wanda Cinemas.
Now, Shanghai Film Studio is fighting back with a new strategy that aims to boost its presence in China's cinema chain industry and counter Yongle's dominance.
One of the key elements of this strategy is Shanghai Film Studio's plan to acquire more cinemas across China. The company has already acquired several cinemas in Shanghai and other major Chinese cities, and it has announced plans to open more in the coming months.
In addition, Shanghai Film Studio has been building close relationships with other companies in the industry, including tech firms and cinema chain operators. These partnerships are designed to help the company access new markets and expand its reach into areas where Yongle has a strong presence.
One of the companies that Shanghai Film Studio has partnered with is Alibaba Pictures, the film arm of the Chinese e-commerce giant. The two companies have formed a strategic partnership that aims to boost their presence in China's cinema market and explore new opportunities in the sector.
Another company that Shanghai Film Studio has been working closely with is IMAX China. The two firms have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that aims to promote the development of the Chinese cinema chain industry and improve the viewing experience for audiences in China.
The MOU includes plans to expand the number of IMAX screens across China and to introduce new technologies and services that will enhance the cinema experience for viewers. This will help to improve Shanghai Film Studio's competitiveness in the market and make it more appealing to moviegoers across the country.
Shanghai Film Studio's CEO, Shi Dongming, has said that the company is committed to expanding its presence in the Chinese cinema industry and taking on Yongle's dominance.
"We are determined to defend our position in the Chinese cinema market and to provide our audiences with the best cinema experience possible," he said. "We believe that our partnerships and strategic alliances will help us to achieve this goal and to grow our business in the coming years."
The battle for control of China's lucrative cinema industry is likely to continue in the coming months, with both Shanghai Film Studio and Yongle vying for dominance. However, with its new strategy and partnerships, Shanghai Film Studio is well placed to take on its rivals and secure its position as a leading player in the market.
