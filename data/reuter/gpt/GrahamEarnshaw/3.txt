As China aims to further liberalize its financial industries by expanding its stock and bond markets, the country is encouraging more efficient investment opportunities. This marks another major milestone in the country's move towards opening up its economy to the world.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) recently announced that it will begin implementing a series of measures that seek to ease access to China's stock and bond markets for overseas investors. The measures will also promote more efficient investment as they are expected to deepen the markets and increase transparency. 
Among the measures set to be implemented are the scrapping of quotas for foreign institutional investors in the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) and Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) schemes. These schemes have been instrumental in facilitating foreign investment into China's markets but have previously operated under strict quotas, which many investors said was limiting their ability to fully capitalize on the opportunity.
The recent reform in China's financial sector is aimed at encouraging more stable and sustainable economic development as the country shifts from an investment- and export-led economic model to one driven by consumption. China’s securities regulator, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, has also stated that the opening-up of the stock and bond markets will boost liquidity, enable better pricing transparency and enhance risk management.
The move is set to provide a significant boost to China's financial sector, which is already one of the world's largest. The country has become a focal point of the global financial world with the rise of domestic equities and the issuance of debt in its bond market. Chinese stocks have recovered over the past year and the country’s bond market has grown to be one of the largest in the world.
This reform will undoubtedly impact both existing and new investors within the mainland Chinese market. However, there are also implications for investors within the western markets. With China's markets providing more opportunities for investment capitalization, the West is likely to see a decline in investors willing to further invest in emerging markets, such as the US or UK. 
The change will also have implications for investors within western countries in terms of portfolio diversification. Many investment advisers suggest that investors should have a diversified portfolio when looking at their investment strategy, which includes emerging markets such as China. The liberalisation of China's markets will allow investors from the West to more readily access and invest in China's securities on a more fair basis, thus helping to balance and diversify their own investment portfolios. 
According to the PBOC, the new measures aimed at expanding access to China's stock and bond markets are planned to go into effect in June of 2021. The announcement is just one of many that China has made as it strives to further integrate itself into the world economy. 
Overall, the reforms in China's financial sector will present significant opportunities for investors around the world. By encouraging more efficient investment opportunities and deepening the stock and bond markets, both Chinese and foreign investors can benefit from the platform for sustainable economic development. This development signals China's ongoing commitment to open its economy, and its willingness to deepen its integration into the global financial system.
