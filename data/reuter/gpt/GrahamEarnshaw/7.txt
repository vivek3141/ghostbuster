Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere Products Co Ltd has reported strong interim results, thanks to the drop in raw material prices. Despite the ongoing economic challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the cashmere products manufacturer has managed to grow its business by taking advantage of lower cost inputs.
According to the company's financial statement for the first half of 2021, its revenue rose 28.5% to 4.53 billion yuan ($699 million) compared to the same period last year, while net profit surged 175.6% to 517.5 million yuan ($79.8 million). The company said that the increase was mainly due to the decline in the cost of raw materials such as cashmere, wool, and camel hair.
Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere Products Co Ltd is a leading Chinese maker of cashmere fabrics, garments, and accessories, supplying major brands such as Burberry, Armani, and Max Mara. The company sources its raw materials from Inner Mongolia, where the world's best cashmere is produced. However, the cost of cashmere has been declining for several years due to oversupply and weak consumer demand.
The pandemic has worsened the situation, with the global fashion industry suffering a severe downturn as people have reduced their spending on non-essential items. This has forced cashmere farmers to sell their products at lower prices, which has benefited manufacturers like Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere Products Co Ltd.
The company has also focused on reducing production costs and increasing efficiency, which has helped it to maintain profitability even in difficult market conditions. It has invested in new technologies and processes to streamline operations and improve the quality of its products.
In addition, Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere Products Co Ltd has expanded its product lines and marketing channels to reach more customers. It has launched new collections of cashmere clothes and accessories, targeting younger and fashion-conscious consumers. It has also increased its online sales and social media presence, which has helped it to reach a wider audience.
The company expects to continue its growth trajectory in the second half of 2021, as demand for cashmere products is expected to recover as the global economy recovers from the pandemic. However, it cautioned that the volatility of raw material prices could affect its financial performance in the future.
Overall, Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere Products Co Ltd's strong interim results demonstrate its resilience and adaptability in a challenging business environment. Its ability to take advantage of market opportunities and innovate its business model could serve as a model for other companies struggling in the current economic climate.
