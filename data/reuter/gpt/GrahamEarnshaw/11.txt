China's metals futures trading should be limited to just one or two exchanges due to low trading volumes, according to industry experts. A recent report by the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association revealed that trading volumes for metals futures on the country's exchanges have been declining over the past few years, leading many to call for a consolidation of the market.
Currently, there are six exchanges in China that trade metals futures, including the Shanghai Futures Exchange, the Dalian Commodity Exchange, and the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange. However, trading volumes on these exchanges have been relatively low, with many only seeing a few hundred contracts traded each day.
This low trading volume has been attributed to a number of factors, including the overall decline in China's economic growth, as well as the country's efforts to crack down on speculative trading. In addition, many traders have shifted their focus to other investment opportunities, such as stocks and real estate, which have been performing well in recent years.
Industry experts have suggested that consolidating the market to just one or two exchanges could help boost trading volumes and improve liquidity. This would also make it easier for traders to access the market, as they would only need to monitor one or two exchanges instead of several.
"Consolidating the market would help to reduce the number of participants and simplify the trading process," said Zhao Xiaoyong, a metals analyst with Jinrui Futures. "This would make it easier for traders to access the market and could help to boost trading volumes."
However, there are concerns that limiting metals futures trading to just one or two exchanges could lead to a monopolization of the market, with larger players dominating the trade. This could also make it more difficult for smaller traders to compete, leading to a lack of diversity in the market.
"Limiting the market to just one or two exchanges could lead to a concentration of power, with larger players dominating the trade," said Li Hong, an independent commodities analyst. "This could also make it more difficult for smaller traders and investors to enter the market, leading to a lack of diversity."
Despite these concerns, many in the industry agree that something needs to be done to boost trading volumes in China's metals futures market. Whether that involves consolidating the market or finding other ways to increase liquidity, it is clear that changes will need to be made in order to make the market more appealing to traders.
"With the decline in trading volumes and the overall slowdown in China's economy, it is clear that something needs to be done to boost the market," said Chris Wang, a metals analyst with CFETS. "While there are concerns about limiting the number of exchanges, there are also benefits to consolidating the market. It will be up to regulators and industry experts to find the best solution for China's metals futures market."
