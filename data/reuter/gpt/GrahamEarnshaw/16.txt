Shanghai, China â€“ China has recently launched its first major shipping exchange in Shanghai, aiming to further develop its maritime industry and boost its goal of becoming a global shipping power.
The China National Shipping Exchange (CNSE) has commenced operations on June 28, after receiving approval from China's Ministry of Transport and the Shanghai municipal government. The exchange serves as a platform for shipping companies to trade shipping-related assets such as freight contracts, ship rentals, and sale and purchase agreements.
With over 4,000 domestic and foreign registered members, CNSE is expected to facilitate a fair and transparent market for shipping transactions, enable more efficient allocation of resources and reduce transaction costs for participants.
"As the world's largest shipping country, building a major shipping exchange represents a significant measure of promoting the development of shipping and logistics industries, as well as expanding the opening-up and collaboration of the financial market," said Liu Xiaosong, the CEO of CNSE.
The launch of CNSE is part of China's broader efforts to enhance its shipping industry and support its Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to connect Asia, Europe, and Africa through a network of trade routes.
According to data from the China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry, Chinese shipping companies have a 40% share of the global shipping market. The country also has the world's largest ports in Shanghai and Ningbo-Zhoushan, and the number of ships owned by Chinese companies has surpassed those owned by Japanese and South Korean firms.
However, the industry has also faced challenges such as overcapacity, high debt levels, and fluctuating freight rates. The COVID-19 pandemic has also severely impacted global trade, leading to a decline in demand and increased competition within the industry.
To address these issues, Chinese shipping companies have been exploring new business models and technologies, such as blockchain and digitalization, to improve efficiency and reduce costs.
CNSE will also incorporate these technologies into its operations, providing advanced services such as digital bills of lading, online auctions, and risk management tools.
"The launch of CNSE marks a milestone in the transformation and innovation of the traditional shipping industry. The association will continue to provide better services and products for the industry and promote the high-quality development of China's shipping industry," said Zhu Hongjie, the Chairman of CNSE.
The launch of CNSE is expected to boost China's shipping industry and strengthen its position as a major player in global trade. It also provides more opportunities for international collaboration and promotes the development of a more inclusive and sustainable shipping industry.
