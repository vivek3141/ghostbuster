Bre-X Minerals, a Canadian mining company, has been embroiled in controversy following its partnership with Hutomo "Tommy" Mandala Putra, the son of former Indonesian ruler Suharto. The partnership has raised ethical questions due to allegations of corruption and collusion between the company and the Suharto regime.
Bre-X Minerals first gained prominence in the mid-1990s when it claimed to have found one of the world's largest gold deposits in Indonesia. The discovery caused a flurry of excitement among investors, and the company's stock price skyrocketed from Canadian$0.30 to a peak of Canadian$286 per share, making millionaires out of its executives and early investors.
However, the excitement soon turned to suspicion as the company's claims about the size and quality of the deposit were called into question. In 1997, an independent analysis revealed that the deposit was a hoax and that samples had been "salted" with gold to make it appear valuable. The revelation led to the collapse of Bre-X Minerals and the imprisonment of its CEO, David Walsh.
Fast forward to 2021, and Bre-X Minerals is back in the news thanks to its controversial partnership with Tommy Suharto. The partnership was announced in 2019, and it involves the acquisition and exploration of a gold mine in Indonesia. Under the terms of the agreement, Bre-X Minerals will own 60% of the mine, while Tommy's company, TM Investindo Resources, will own the remaining 40%.
The partnership has been criticized for several reasons, including the fact that Tommy is the son of Suharto, who was known for his corrupt regime during his time as Indonesia's leader. Suharto was accused of enriching himself and his family through the exploitation of the country's natural resources, and his family's wealth is estimated to be in the billions of dollars.
In addition, there are concerns that the partnership may have been facilitated through bribes and other forms of corruption. Tommy has a history of legal troubles and was convicted of corruption in 2002, although he was later released after serving only four years of his 15-year sentence. His involvement in the partnership with Bre-X Minerals has raised suspicions about his business dealings and whether he has used his family's political connections to his advantage.
Despite these concerns, Bre-X Minerals has remained silent on the issue and has not responded to requests for comment from the media. The company's website contains no information about the partnership with Tommy, and there have been no public statements from its executives or board members.
This silence has only fueled speculation about the company's motives and its true relationship with Tommy and his company. Some analysts have suggested that Bre-X Minerals may be trying to distance itself from the controversy surrounding the Suharto family and avoid any negative publicity that could harm its reputation and share price.
Others are more critical, arguing that the company has a responsibility to explain its actions and the ethical implications of its partnership with Tommy. They point out that Bre-X Minerals has a history of controversial business practices, including its role in the Bre-X Minerals scandal of the 1990s, and that it should be transparent about its dealings to avoid further controversy and scrutiny.
The controversy surrounding the partnership between Bre-X Minerals and Tommy Suharto highlights the ongoing challenges of doing business in developing countries, particularly in the extractive industries. While these industries hold the promise of significant profits and economic development, they are also susceptible to corruption, environmental destruction, and social unrest.
Companies operating in these industries must navigate complex social, political, and legal landscapes, and they must balance the needs of their shareholders with their responsibilities to the communities in which they operate. Bre-X Minerals, it seems, has not done enough to live up to these responsibilities, and its silence on the issue only adds to the suspicion that surrounds its business practices.
As the debate over the partnership continues, it is clear that companies must do more to address the ethical concerns raised by their business dealings. Whether it is through greater transparency, community engagement, or stronger corporate governance, these companies must take steps to rebuild trust with their stakeholders and demonstrate their commitment to responsible business practices.
