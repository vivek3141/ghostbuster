Barrick Gold Corp has reported lower Q3 earnings due to an after-tax charge and higher costs. The Canadian mining company's net earnings for the quarter were $882 million, down from $1.3 billion in the same period last year.
The lower earnings were due to an after-tax impairment charge of $222 million, which was related to the write-down of some exploration assets. The company also experienced higher operating costs, which rose by 10% to $1.4 billion for the quarter.
Despite the lower earnings, Barrick Gold Corp's revenue increased slightly to $3.5 billion, up from $3.4 billion in the same period a year ago. The company attributed the increase in revenue to higher gold prices and increased production.
Barrick Gold Corp produced 1.25 million ounces of gold in the third quarter, up from 1.13 million ounces in the same period last year. The company also produced 99 million pounds of copper, up from 97 million pounds in the same period a year ago.
In a statement, Barrick Gold Corp CEO Mark Bristow said: "Our strong operational performance and sound financial management have enabled us to generate solid free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet despite the impact of Covid-19 on our operations."
He added: "Looking ahead, we remain focused on driving value through the disciplined execution of our strategy and delivering long-term sustainable returns to our shareholders."
Barrick Gold Corp's share price has fallen by around 8% this year, reflecting uncertainty in the gold market. The company is the world's second-largest gold producer, behind Newmont Corp.
The lower Q3 earnings announcement comes as Barrick Gold Corp continues to face challenges in Tanzania, where the company has faced a long-running dispute with the government over taxes and investment. The government has accused the company of underreporting the value of its exports, and the two sides remain in negotiations over a potential settlement.
Despite the ongoing dispute, Barrick Gold Corp said it remains committed to its mining operations in Tanzania and is continuing to invest in the country's mining industry.
Overall, the Q3 earnings announcement suggests that Barrick Gold Corp is weathering the challenges of the current economic environment and remains well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities in the gold market going forward.
