Toronto, ON - Barrick Gold Corp, one of the world's largest gold mining companies, has reported lower earnings for the third quarter (Q3) due to an after-tax charge and higher operating costs.
In a statement released on Thursday, the company revealed that it had earned $882 million in net income, or $0.50 per share, for the three months ended September 30. This is down from the $1.3 billion, or $0.77 per share, it earned in the same period last year.
The lower earnings were attributed to a $264 million after-tax charge related to the closure of its Lumwana copper mine in Zambia, which was announced in September. The mine was shut down due to a new royalty regime that made it uneconomic to continue operations.
Higher operating costs were also a factor. The company said that its all-in sustaining costs (AISC) were $984 per ounce of gold produced, up from $887 per ounce in the same period last year. This was mainly due to higher royalties, taxes, and other expenses.
Despite the lower earnings, Barrick said that it remained on track to meet its production targets for the year. The company produced 1.25 million ounces of gold in Q3, up from 1.15 million ounces in the same period last year. This was due to higher production at its Nevada Gold Mines joint venture and its Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic.
Barrick's CEO, Mark Bristow, said that the company was focused on reducing costs and improving efficiency across its operations.
"Our Q3 results reflect our ongoing efforts to manage our costs and increase productivity while maintaining our focus on safety and sustainability," Bristow said. "We remain committed to delivering value for our shareholders and stakeholders by investing in our people, our assets, and our communities."
Barrick's shares were down 2.4% to $19.85 in early trading on Thursday. The stock has risen 24% this year, outperforming the S&P/TSX Global Gold Index, which is up 8.2%.
Analysts said that while the lower earnings were disappointing, the company's underlying fundamentals remained strong.
"Overall, we view this as a mixed quarter for Barrick, with slightly softer earnings, but strong production and financial position," said Josh Wolfson, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. "Looking ahead, we expect continued positive momentum from the company, driven by higher gold prices, strong production, and ongoing cost optimization efforts."
