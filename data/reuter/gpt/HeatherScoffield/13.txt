The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has lost its bid to freeze shares in a mining financier's company over an environmental case. The case involves allegations that the company, Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd, misled investors in its plans to develop a mine in Alaska that would disturb salmon habitat.
In a ruling on Friday, US District Judge Colleen McMahon denied the EPA's request to freeze shares in Northern Dynasty Minerals held by its parent company, Pebble Limited Partnership. The EPA argued that the shares were owned by the same people who controlled Northern Dynasty Minerals and could be used to pay for any liabilities the company may face.
However, Judge McMahon wrote that the EPA had failed to prove that the parent company was the alter ego of Northern Dynasty Minerals, which would enable the government agency to go after the parent company's assets. She also noted that "the equities weigh against granting the injunction" because it would harm Pebble Limited Partnership's ability to raise funds.
The EPA's case against Northern Dynasty Minerals stems from allegations that the company made false and misleading statements in its public filings about the likelihood of obtaining the necessary permits to develop the Pebble Mine in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. The bay is home to one of the largest salmon runs in the world and is a vital resource for local communities, including Alaska Native tribes.
In 2014, the EPA proposed restrictions on mining in the area, citing the potential risks to the salmon population and other resources. Northern Dynasty Minerals, which had been working on the Pebble Mine project for years, saw its share prices plummet as a result. The company sued the EPA, claiming that the restrictions were based on faulty science and exceeded the agency's authority.
In 2017, the Trump administration settled the lawsuit and withdrew the proposed restrictions, paving the way for Northern Dynasty Minerals to pursue permits for the Pebble Mine. The company's share prices soared in response.
However, the EPA's lawsuit against Northern Dynasty Minerals continued. The agency argued that the company had made misleading statements to investors about the project's viability, based on internal emails and other documents obtained during discovery.
Northern Dynasty Minerals has denied the allegations and said that it will vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit. The company has also accused the EPA of bias and conflicts of interest, citing emails between agency officials and environmental groups that opposed the Pebble Mine project.
The EPA's case against Northern Dynasty Minerals is one of several high-profile environmental cases that have been filed in recent years. The agency has been criticized for rolling back regulations on industries such as coal mining and oil and gas drilling, and for failing to protect communities from environmental pollution. The Biden administration has promised to reverse many of these policies and to take stronger action on climate change and environmental justice issues.
