Toronto, Canada - The third quarter of 2021 has been a challenging period for Canadian base metal miners, who saw their earnings decline due to poor metal prices during the period.
According to a report from the Mining Association of Canada (MAC), the country's total mineral production value fell 7.8% year-on-year in the third quarter, primarily due to lower prices for base metals such as copper, nickel, and zinc.
The report revealed that copper prices dropped 12% in Q3, while nickel and zinc prices fell 7% and 6%, respectively. The decline in metal prices translated into lower revenues for Canadian mining companies, which struggled to maintain profitability during the quarter.
"Deteriorating metal prices have negatively impacted the bottom line for base metal miners in Canada," said Pierre Gratton, MAC's President and CEO. "The sector has been grappling with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, trade uncertainties, and supply chain disruptions, which have all contributed to the challenging operating environment."
The poor earnings results have prompted some Canadian mining companies to revise their production forecasts for the remainder of the year. Some have also implemented cost-cutting measures, such as reducing exploration budgets and delaying capital expenditures.
The MAC report also highlights the continued decline in exploration activity in the country. It states that exploration expenditure by Canadian mining companies fell by 13% in 2020, and the trend is expected to continue in 2021.
Gratton emphasized the importance of encouraging exploration activity in Canada, given the country's abundant mineral resources. He noted that mining provides critical minerals for the transition to a low-carbon economy and that Canada has a unique opportunity to be a leading supplier of these minerals.
Despite the challenges facing the sector, Gratton remains optimistic about the future prospects for Canadian mining. "The long-term outlook for the industry is positive, and we are working collaboratively with governments and other stakeholders to address the issues facing our sector," he said.
The MAC report also revealed that gold prices remained high in Q3, providing welcome relief to gold miners in the country. However, the report notes that gold is not an entirely insulated commodity, and its price can also be affected by global economic conditions and investor sentiment.
