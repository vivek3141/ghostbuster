The Voisey's Bay nickel production project in Newfoundland, Canada is facing a significant setback due to environmental and Aboriginal pressures. The Innu Nation of Labrador and the Nunatsiavut Government have expressed concern over the company's proposed underground mining method, which involves the disposal of waste in a nearby lake. Additionally, the Newfoundland and Labrador Government has yet to approve the project's environmental impact assessment. The mining company, Vale, has acknowledged the concerns and is working to address them in consultation with Indigenous communities and government officials. The delay of the project's start date is inevitable due to the ongoing pressures.
