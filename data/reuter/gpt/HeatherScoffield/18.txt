Bre-X Minerals Ltd. is facing growing concern over its Indonesian partnership with Suharto's son, Tommy Suharto, but the company has remained silent on the issue.
The Canadian gold mining company was once a darling of the stock market, with its shares skyrocketing on the back of claims that it had discovered the world's largest gold deposit in Indonesia's Busang region. But in March 1997, the company's shares plunged when it was revealed that the Busang deposit was a fraud, consisting of virtually no gold at all.
Now, almost 25 years after the scandal, Bre-X is once again drawing attention for its operations in Indonesia. The company, which was resurrected as a shell company in 2017, announced in 2019 that it had formed a joint venture with Indonesia's PT Gunung Fajar, which is owned by Tommy Suharto.
The news sparked concern among some investors and observers, given Tommy Suharto's controversial reputation. The son of Indonesia's late authoritarian leader, Suharto, Tommy was convicted in 2002 of ordering the murder of a Supreme Court judge and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was released in 2006 after serving less than half of his sentence and has since been involved in various business ventures.
Critics of the Bre-X-PT Gunung Fajar partnership have pointed out that the deal raises questions about the due diligence conducted by Bre-X and the legality of the partnership, given Tommy Suharto's criminal record.
Bre-X, however, has remained tight-lipped on the matter. In response to inquiries from journalists, the company has issued only sparse statements, including one in August 2019 in which it said it was "fully committed to working within all the applicable laws and regulations in Indonesia."
The lack of transparency from Bre-X has only fueled speculation about the nature of the partnership and the potential risks involved for investors.
Some observers have noted that Bre-X's dealings in Indonesia are not the only cause for concern. The company's current CEO, David Walsh, was one of the central figures in the 1997 fraud scandal and was criticized at the time for failing to properly oversee the company's exploration efforts in Busang. And the company's recent resurrection as a shell company has also raised eyebrows, with some accusing it of attempting to wipe the slate clean and distance itself from its checkered past.
Despite these concerns, Bre-X has continued to pursue its operations in Indonesia. In November 2019, the company announced that it had signed a deal with a third-party company to begin exploration work at its Busang project, which is located in the same region where the 1997 fraud occurred.
The company has also announced that it is raising funds to pursue its operations, including through the sale of shares. According to recent filings with Canadian regulators, the company has raised more than $9 million through the sale of shares since 2017.
Bre-X's silence on the issues surrounding its Indonesian partnership and its past track record has worried some observers, who are calling for greater transparency from the company.
Speaking to the Financial Post, John Godec, a mining investment advisor and former head of mining research at BMO Nesbitt Burns, said: "Investors would like to see greater transparency from the company regarding its plans and its partnerships. The track record of both Bre-X and Tommy Suharto raises some red flags, and investors want to be sure that any risks associated with the company's operations are being properly disclosed and managed."
As Bre-X continues to pursue its operations in Indonesia, the company will likely face mounting pressure to address these concerns and provide greater transparency to investors. With the ghosts of its past still haunting it, the company will need to show that it can navigate the tricky terrain of the mining industry with greater care and responsibility in order to win back the trust of investors.
