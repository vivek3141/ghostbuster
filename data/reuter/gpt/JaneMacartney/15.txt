China's government has issued a new directive that targets what it calls "hostile foreign forces" attempting to undermine the country's economy, society, and political stability. The move represents a hardline approach by China's ruling Communist Party to counter the perceived threat posed by Western ideas and values.
The directive - issued by the Communist Party's Central Committee and the State Council - lists a range of areas where foreign actors are viewed as potentially harmful, including media and culture, education, religion, and human rights. The document calls for a series of measures to counter foreign interference and promote "core socialist values."
The move follows similar measures implemented in recent years to tighten government control over the internet, restrict foreign funding of NGOs, and crack down on perceived threats such as Taiwan independence activists and the Falun Gong spiritual movement.
Critics say that the latest directive is part of a broader trend of increasing authoritarianism under President Xi Jinping, whose leadership in recent years has included a crackdown on dissent, increased censorship, and a clampdown on civil society.
"China under Xi is becoming much more ideologically rigid, and this is part of a concerted effort to suppress any kind of criticism or dissent," said Sophie Richardson, China director for Human Rights Watch.
The directive has also drawn criticism from the US government, which has called on China to respect freedom of expression and other basic rights.
"China's effort to dictate the terms of cross-border dialogue and suppress unapproved exchanges of ideas and information is harmful to the Chinese people and poses a serious threat to the free and open international order," said State Department spokesman Ned Price.
The move is also seen as a sign of the government's insecurity about the challenges it faces, including a slowing economy, rising social tensions, and a growing wealth gap. Many of these problems are viewed as being exacerbated by the government's own policies, such as excessive regulation and state-owned enterprises.
"This is a sign of the government's fear and desperation," said Wu Qiang, a political analyst based in Beijing. "They are trying to blame foreign forces for their own failures, but in reality it is their own poverty of ideas that is to blame."
Others argue that the focus on "foreign forces" is simply a way for the government to deflect blame for its own shortcomings and maintain control over society.
"It's a classic authoritarian strategy - create an external enemy to justify internal repression and maintain political power," said Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California.
The controversy over the directive comes at a time of growing tensions between China and the US over issues such as trade, human rights, and Taiwan. The Biden administration has signaled a tougher approach to China than its predecessor, calling for a coordinated approach with allies to push back against Chinese aggression.
"China's efforts to stifle free and open debate undermine international norms and values, and are a threat to the United States and our partners and allies," said White House press secretary Jen Psaki.
Despite the criticism, the Chinese government is unlikely to back down from its hardline stance on perceived foreign interference. The government already exercises a high degree of control over the media, education, and other aspects of society, and has shown little tolerance for dissent in recent years.
"The Communist Party sees itself as the only legitimate source of power and authority in China, and any challenge to that is seen as a threat to its existence," said Richardson. "Until that changes, we can expect to see more of the same."
