Beijing – The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has issued a stern warning to its members to adhere to Communist ideology or face disciplinary action, according to a notice released on Tuesday. The party leadership has expressed dissatisfaction with the "lack of ideological rigor" among some of its members and has warned that the party will not tolerate deviation from its orthodoxy.
The CCP is currently embarking on a campaign aimed at strengthening party discipline. The campaign is seeking to root out corruption, ensure party loyalty, and bolster ideological conformity. The party has emphasized the need to uphold the "Four Consciousnesses" – political consciousness, big picture consciousness, core consciousness, and paragon consciousness – which serve as guidelines for party members' behavior.
The notice warned that party members "must fully understand the importance and urgency of enhancing ideological and political work, and strengthen their sense of political responsibility and historical mission." It also emphasized the need for party members to "firmly establish Marxist views and values, adhere to the fundamental principles of the Party, and defend the Party's authority and centralized leadership."
The CCP has been increasingly concerned about the rise of individualism and liberalism in Chinese society, which it believes could undermine the party's authority. Earlier this year, the party leadership launched a new campaign aimed at promoting "red culture," which seeks to promote the values of Communism and traditional Chinese culture.
The notice also warned that party members who fail to adhere to party discipline may face disciplinary action, including expulsion from the party. The CCP has been ramping up its disciplinary measures in recent years, with high-profile corruption cases resulting in the downfall of several senior officials.
Some experts have expressed concern that the renewed emphasis on political conformity could stifle intellectual and artistic expression. "There is the danger that this campaign will lead to a new round of censorship and a narrowing of intellectual and artistic freedom," said one prominent Chinese intellectual who asked to remain anonymous.
The CCP's renewed emphasis on ideological orthodoxy comes at a time of increasing tension between China and the West. Recently, the CCP has clashed with Western nations over issues such as human rights, trade, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Some experts believe that the CCP's renewed emphasis on party discipline is partly aimed at shoring up its support at home amid increasing international pressure.
Despite concerns about potential repression, some party members have expressed support for the campaign. "The CCP has always emphasized the importance of party discipline and ideological conformity. This new campaign is just a reminder of that," said one party member who declined to be named.
The CCP's renewed emphasis on political conformity is likely to have far-reaching implications for Chinese society. It could lead to a tightening of censorship, a reduction in artistic and intellectual freedom, and a focus on traditional Chinese culture and values. However, it may also serve to bolster party loyalty and ensure the party's continued dominance in Chinese politics.
