As China's pro-democracy movement grows stronger, the government is cracking down on activists who are pushing for greater freedoms. In recent months, many activists have vanished without a trace, and their families and supporters fear the worst.
The latest wave of activism started in 2019, with the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The protests, which were sparked by a proposed extradition law that would have allowed China to extradite people from Hong Kong to mainland China, quickly escalated into demands for greater democracy and autonomy for Hong Kong.
The protests were met with brutal police violence, and many activists were arrested. Though the protests eventually died down, the pro-democracy movement continued to gain momentum. Activists continued to push for greater democracy and human rights, despite the risks.
But since the passing of China's National Security Law in 2020, things have gotten much worse for pro-democracy activists. The law, which was imposed on Hong Kong without the approval of its legislature, criminalizes any act of "secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces."
Since the law was passed, the Chinese government has been using it to crack down on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong and mainland China. Many activists have been arrested and charged with crimes related to the National Security Law.
But some activists have vanished without a trace. According to Human Rights Watch, at least twelve activists have disappeared since the National Security Law was passed. Their families and friends have no idea where they are or if they are even alive.
One of those activists is a journalist named Zhang Zhan. Zhang was arrested in May 2020, after she reported on the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. She was charged with "picking quarrels and provoking trouble," a common charge used against activists in China.
In December 2020, Zhang was sentenced to four years in prison. But since then, her family has received no information about her whereabouts or condition. They fear that she may have been tortured or mistreated in detention.
Another activist who has disappeared is a lawyer named Gao Zhisheng. Gao is a well-known human rights lawyer who has been imprisoned and tortured by the Chinese government in the past. He vanished in August 2017, and his family has not heard from him since.
These disappearances have raised fears that China's government is using enforced disappearance as a tool to silence pro-democracy activists. Enforced disappearance is a crime under international law and is defined as "the arrest, detention, abduction, or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the state or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support, or acquiescence of the state, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person."
If China's government is using enforced disappearance, it would be a serious violation of human rights and would be condemned by the international community.
But China's government has denied any involvement in the disappearances. When asked about Zhang Zhan's disappearance, Chinese government spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that he did not have any specific information but that "China is a country ruled by law, and the legal rights of all individuals are protected by law."
But activists and human rights organizations are not convinced. They say that the disappearance of activists is just the latest example of China's crackdown on basic human rights, including freedom of speech and assembly.
Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, said that the disappearances are "just one more way that the Chinese government is undermining human rights and the rule of law. It's clearly a tactic to silence activists and terrify others into not speaking out."
Richardson called on the international community to speak out against China's human rights abuses and to pressure the Chinese government to release the activists who have disappeared.
But so far, the international response has been limited. China is a powerful country with a lot of influence on the world stage, and many countries are hesitant to criticize it too harshly. But as the disappearances continue, it may become harder for the international community to turn a blind eye to China's human rights abuses.
For now, the families and supporters of the disappeared activists are left to wonder about their loved ones' fates. For them, the crackdown on pro-democracy activists is not just a political issue â€“ it's a deeply personal one.
