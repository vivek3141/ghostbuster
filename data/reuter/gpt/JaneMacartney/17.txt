The former U.S ambassador to China, Winston Lord, just completed a three-day visit to Beijing, China, where he held private and cordial talks with senior officials on the issues of human rights and North Korea's nuclear program.
Lord arrived in Beijing on Monday and held several closed-door meetings with Chinese officials. In an interview with the press, he described the talks as "candid, constructive and cordial."
During his stay in Beijing, Lord discussed with senior officials about the importance of human rights protection in China. He urged the Chinese government to release all political prisoners and stop the ongoing surveillance of activists.
"I have raised concerns about the current human rights situation in China, particularly the treatment of human rights activists, lawyers, and dissidents," Lord said.
Lord's visit came amid tensions between the U.S. and China over human rights issues and trade. The relationship between the two nations has been strained for some time, with the U.S. government accusing China of engaging in unfair trade practices.
However, Lord's approach was a departure from the Trump administration's public criticism of China's human rights record. Rather than criticizing the country publicly, Lord decided to engage in private dialogue with Chinese officials.
"I think it's important to engage with the Chinese authorities in a constructive manner to try and effect positive change in this area," he said.
Lord also discussed the situation in North Korea, urging China to continue to leverage its influence on the reclusive regime to halt its nuclear program. North Korea has continued to defy international sanctions, and its leader, Kim Jong-un, has refused to abandon his country's nuclear program.
"China has a critical role to play in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. I have urged the Chinese authorities to continue their efforts to encourage the North Korean regime to denuclearize and engage in peaceful negotiations," Lord said.
Despite the ongoing discussions, Lord's visit to China received little attention from the press. It is not clear if he met with President Xi Jinping, who recently concluded a meeting with President Trump in Florida.
Lord's visit comes ahead of other high-profile visits to China by U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and President Trump himself. Tillerson is scheduled to visit Beijing later this month to hold talks with Chinese officials on North Korea and trade.
The U.S. has been increasing pressure on China to take more decisive action to address North Korea's nuclear program. The Trump administration has said that all options are on the table when it comes to dealing with North Korea, including military action.
Meanwhile, tensions between the two nations over trade continue to simmer. President Trump has accused China of engaging in unfair trade practices, including currency manipulation, intellectual property theft and dumping.
Lord's visit is seen as a significant step towards improving the relationship between the two countries. The veteran diplomat has been a vocal critic of China's human rights record, but he has also emphasized the importance of engagement and dialogue.
"As a former ambassador to China, I know how important it is to maintain constructive dialogue with the Chinese government, even when we have disagreements," Lord said.
Overall, Lord's visit to Beijing was seen as a positive development in relations between the U.S. and China. With more high-profile visits scheduled in the coming weeks, it remains to be seen whether the two nations can work together to resolve their differences and improve their relationship.
