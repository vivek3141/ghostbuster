In a significant move in the hotel industry, Stakis PLC has announced a $530 million deal to acquire the five Metropole Hotels owned by Lonrho PLC. The deal will be primarily funded by a rights issue of Stakis shares.
The Metropole Hotels are located in London, Brighton, Birmingham, Leeds, and Manchester. The properties will give Stakis a strong presence in some of the UK's key cities. Stakis is already a well-established hotel and gaming operator with 42 hotels and casinos throughout the UK.
"The acquisition of the prestigious Metropole Hotels brand will be a significant step forward in our strategy to build a major leisure business," said David Michels, the chief executive of Stakis. "With an excellent geographic spread, these hotels will complement our existing portfolio perfectly."
Lonrho, a UK-based multinational conglomerate, had put the hotels up for sale as part of a restructuring plan. The five Metropole Hotels had been on the market for a few months, with several interested parties expressing an interest in the properties.
Stakis emerged as the most serious bidder, beating out rivals such as Hilton Hotels and Forte. The rights issue will be worth around $560 million, with the aim of funding the purchase and contributing towards future expansion.
"We firmly believe that this acquisition is in the best interests of our shareholders and marks the start of an exciting new phase in our company's development," said Michels.
The acquisition will take Stakis's hotel portfolio to 47, making it one of the largest hotel operators in the UK. The deal is expected to be completed within the next few months, subject to regulatory approval.
Stakis is optimistic about the synergies that the Metropole brand will bring to its existing portfolio. The company is confident that it can enhance the performance of the Metropole hotels through its expertise in the hospitality sector.
"The Metropole brand is a strong and established name in the hotel industry, and we are proud to welcome it into the Stakis family," said Michels.
The acquisition is also expected to bring benefits to the local economies of the cities where the Metropole hotels are located. Stakis's expansion plans include investing in the local communities and providing employment opportunities.
"Our commitment to the communities in which we operate is an essential part of our business philosophy," said Michels. "We are looking forward to supporting and working closely with the local communities in each of the five cities where the Metropole Hotels are located."
While Stakis's purchase of the Metropole Hotels is welcome news for the company, it remains to be seen how the market will respond. The shares in Stakis fell 5% in early trading following the announcement, reflecting some investors' concerns about the high price tag attached to the deal.
However, others are more optimistic about the impact that the acquisition will have on Stakis's future growth prospects.
"It's a bold move by Stakis, but strategically, it makes sense," said one analyst. "The Metropole brand has strong recognition and a loyal customer base. Bringing it under the Stakis umbrella will give the company greater scale and reach."
Stakis's rights issue is due to be launched in the next few weeks, subject to regulatory approval. The company is confident that its existing shareholders will support the move, which is seen as a key step in its long-term growth strategy.
"We have a clear vision for Stakis, and this acquisition is an important part of that vision," said Michels. "We are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to delivering on them in the months and years to come."
