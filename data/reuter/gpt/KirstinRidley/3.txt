Stakis Plc, a leading UK-based hospitality company, has launched a cash call to raise funds for a major acquisition. The company aims to purchase five Metropole hotels owned by Lonrho for a total of £327 million. The move is part of Stakis Plc's growth and expansion strategy, as it seeks to expand its reach in key markets.
The acquisition deal, which was announced last week, has generated significant interest in the hospitality industry. The Metropole hotels are located in some of the most sought-after destinations in the world, including London, Glasgow, and Monte Carlo. They are renowned for their luxurious amenities, excellent service, and prime locations.
Stakis Plc's decision to acquire the hotels is seen as a bold move that will significantly enhance the company's portfolio. With this acquisition, Stakis Plc will be able to increase its market share and tap into new customer segments. It will also help the company to diversify its revenue streams, reducing reliance on its existing properties.
To fund the acquisition, Stakis Plc has launched a cash call, which will allow the company to raise new capital from investors. According to the company's CEO, the cash call is an essential part of the acquisition strategy. "We believe that the acquisition of the Metropole hotels is a significant opportunity for us, and we want to ensure that we have enough capital to execute the deal successfully," he said.
The cash call, which will be open to institutional and retail investors, aims to raise £150 million. The funds raised will be used to finance the acquisition, as well as to cover transaction costs and provide working capital. The offer price for the new shares will be set at 1.35p per share, representing a discount of 10% to the stock's closing price before the announcement of the cash call.
According to industry analysts, the cash call is likely to be well received by investors, given Stakis Plc's strong track record and growth potential. "Stakis Plc is a well-established hospitality company with a solid reputation in the market. Its decision to acquire the Metropole hotels is a sign of its ambition and confidence in the future. We expect the cash call to be a success," said one analyst.
The acquisition of the Metropole hotels is expected to be completed by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approvals. Once completed, the hotels will be rebranded as Stakis Metropole and will be integrated into the company's existing operations. Stakis Plc plans to invest in refurbishing and upgrading the hotels to meet its standards of excellence.
The acquisition deal is expected to generate significant revenue for Stakis Plc, with projections suggesting that it could add up to £80 million to the company's annual revenues. The deal will also create new jobs and opportunities for local communities, as Stakis Plc seeks to expand its operations and presence in key markets.
In conclusion, Stakis Plc's decision to launch a cash call to fund the acquisition of Lonrho's five Metropole hotels is a significant development in the hospitality industry. The move highlights the company's ambition and growth potential, and it is likely to be well received by investors. Once completed, the acquisition will enhance Stakis Plc's portfolio and market share, creating new opportunities for growth and expansion.
