BT has strengthened its position as one of the world's top telecommunications providers with a $20 billion merger with MCI, the US-based technology company.
The deal, which was announced on Monday, is set to give BT access to the world's biggest telecoms market and increase its competitiveness against rivals, including Verizon and AT&T.
Analysts predict that the merger will result in increased revenue and cost savings of up to $1 billion per year for BT.
The acquisition of MCI's network infrastructure and customer base is expected to put pressure on BT's rivals as the British firm becomes a major player in the US telecoms market, which is worth an estimated $1.4 trillion.
"This is a transformational deal for BT. It firmly cements our position as a leading player in the global telecoms market," said BT CEO, Philip Jansen.
"With access to MCI's network and customer base, we can now deliver even better services, with faster speeds and improved reliability, to customers around the world."
MCI has a large customer base, which is expected to give BT valuable access to new markets and enable it to offer more competitive pricing to its existing customers.
BT is already one of the world's largest telecoms providers, with operations in over 180 countries. The merger with MCI will allow it to expand its reach even further, while also strengthening its position in the UK and Europe.
The deal is subject to approval from regulators in the US and Europe, but BT is confident that it will receive clearance in the coming months.
"We are committed to working closely with regulators to ensure that the merger is approved quickly and that our customers continue to receive the highest quality services," said Jansen.
The acquisition of MCI is part of BT's ongoing strategy to expand its operations and increase its global reach. Last year, the company acquired EE, the UK's largest mobile network operator, and it has also invested heavily in its fibre-optic network in recent years.
The merger with MCI is expected to enable BT to offer a more comprehensive range of services to its customers, including high-speed internet, voice services, and cloud-based solutions.
BT is also expected to benefit from MCI's experience in cybersecurity, which will be increasingly important as the world becomes more connected and digital threats become more sophisticated.
The deal is seen as a bold move by BT, which has faced challenges in recent years due to increased competition and changing market conditions.
However, the acquisition of MCI is expected to give the British firm a significant boost in the global telecoms market, as well as strengthening its position in the UK and Europe.
The merger is also expected to result in cost savings, which will be passed on to customers in the form of lower prices and improved services.
"BT's acquisition of MCI is a bold move that should pay off in the long term. It will give them a foothold in the world's biggest telecoms market and put pressure on rivals such as Verizon and AT&T," said Richard Waters, technology editor at the Financial Times.
"BT has been investing heavily in its network infrastructure and this acquisition will help to consolidate its position as one of the world's leading telecoms providers."
The merger between BT and MCI is expected to be completed in the second half of this year, subject to regulatory approval.
