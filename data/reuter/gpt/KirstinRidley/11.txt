Analysts Say Attempt to Block British Telecom and MCI $20bn Merger Will Fail
Experts in the telecommunications industry are predicting that the attempt to block the $20bn merger deal between British Telecom (BT) and MCI will ultimately fail.
BT and MCI had announced the merger in November 2020, and since then, there have been concerns about the potential impact on the competitive landscape in the telecommunications market. However, the deal was given initial approval by the US Department of Justice in December 2020.
The current concern appears to be around the possible impact on competition in the market for high-capacity fiber optic cables, which are critical for providing communication services to businesses and governments. Some critics have suggested that the merger could lead to BT and MCI controlling too much of the market, leading to higher prices and reduced choice for customers.
However, analysts are suggesting that the fears may be overstated and that the merger will ultimately be approved. They point out that the two companies are actually quite complementary, with BT having a strong presence in Europe and the UK, while MCI has a significant market share in the US. This means that they are not direct competitors, and the merger may actually enhance competition by creating a stronger global player to challenge other providers in the market.
Furthermore, they argue that the market is already incredibly competitive, with numerous companies vying for a share of the market. While the merged entity may have a significant market share, it will still face significant competition from other providers. Therefore, any suggestion that the merger will lead to monopolistic practices is unfounded.
In addition, they point out that governments in both the US and the UK are actively looking to promote investment in high-capacity fiber optic networks as part of their broader infrastructure plans. This should help to create a more level playing field for all providers, regardless of their market share.
Finally, the analysts suggest that the regulatory framework for the telecommunications industry is already robust and will ensure that the merged entity does not engage in any anti-competitive behavior. The approval process for the merger has already included extensive scrutiny by regulatory bodies, and it is unlikely that they would have given the green light if they believed that the merger would be detrimental to the market.
Overall, while there are legitimate concerns about the impact of the BT and MCI merger on the telecommunications market, the weight of expert opinion suggests that those concerns are overstated. The two companies are not direct competitors, and the market is already incredibly competitive. Furthermore, the regulatory framework is already in place to prevent anti-competitive practices. Therefore, it seems likely that the attempt to block the merger will ultimately fail, and BT and MCI will be able to proceed with their plans to create a stronger global player in the telecommunications industry.
