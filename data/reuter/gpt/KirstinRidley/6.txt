BT has secured its place as a leader in the global telecommunications market following the completion of its $20 billion merger with MCI, the largest in the industry to date. The acquisition sees BT expand its presence in the US, MCI's biggest market, and strengthens its position in the global data services industry. MCI's extensive network infrastructure and customer base are expected to complement BT's existing offerings, creating a formidable force in the telecoms sector. This deal marks a significant step in BT's growth strategy, with the company's CEO hailing the merger as a "game-changer" for the industry.
