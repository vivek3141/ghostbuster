London, UK – Analysts are saying that an attempt to block the merger of British Telecom (BT) and MCI on the grounds of restricted trade is highly unlikely to succeed.
The possible merger, which was announced earlier this year, would see BT acquire MCI, the biggest supplier of voice and data communication solutions globally. With the proposed acquisition mostly focusing on MCI's international business markets, some critics have expressed concern that the merged entity would hold too much market power and therefore breach trade regulations.
However, analysts have pointed out that there have been several mergers in the telecoms sector in recent years, including the merger of Vodafone and Mannesmann, BT’s acquisition of EE, and Deutsche Telekom's acquisition of US mobile network operator Sprint. These mergers have not had any significant impact on the competitive landscape and did not pose any threat to trade regulations.
Additionally, the proposed merger between BT and MCI does not involve a significant overlap in their businesses. MCI focuses primarily on business-to-business solutions, while BT’s focus is on consumer and business-to-business offerings. The deal would help BT to expand its global presence, in turn enhancing its competitiveness and potentially leading to lower prices for consumers.
Furthermore, the global telecoms market is becoming increasingly competitive, with new players entering the market and existing players constantly innovating to stay ahead. This competition makes it challenging for any one company to monopolize the market.
Some critics have raised concerns that a merged BT-MCI could withhold its network infrastructure from competitors, denying them access to key infrastructure. However, such concerns can be mitigated by regulating access to critical infrastructure through government involvement.
Speaking on this issue, Michael Powell, a former chairman of the US Federal Communications Commission, said, “The hype about how they will control all the network infrastructure or data centers and limit the access of others is vastly overstated. The global telecoms market is too intense and diverse for one company to create a stranglehold, no matter how much market power they have in some areas.”
It is expected that the merger will face scrutiny by antitrust regulators in the US and Europe, but analysts believe that regulators are unlikely to block the merger on trade restriction grounds, citing a lack of evidence to support such a claim.
The proposed merger is still subject to approval, and its impact on competition and regulation will need to be assessed. If approved, the merger between BT and MCI is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022.
