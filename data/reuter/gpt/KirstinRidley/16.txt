Dominion Resources, one of the largest electricity and natural gas producers in the United States, has held preliminary discussions with East Midlands Electricity (EME) over a potential takeover bid. While both companies declined to comment on the talks, sources familiar with the matter suggest that Dominion is interested in acquiring EME to expand its operations in the United Kingdom.
EME, which operates in the East Midlands and parts of Yorkshire, supplies electricity to over two million customers and has a market value of around Â£2 billion. The company is owned by the Hong Kong-based conglomerate Cheung Kong Group, which acquired it in 2011. Cheung Kong has not announced any plans to sell EME but is said to be considering various strategic options.
Dominion Resources, based in Richmond, Virginia, has a market capitalization of over $60 billion and operates in 18 states. The company generates and distributes electricity and natural gas, as well as operates gas pipelines and storage facilities. Dominion has been seeking to expand its overseas operations and has already acquired a stake in a liquefied natural gas plant in Maryland and is building a gas-fired power plant in South Korea.
If Dominion proceeds with a takeover bid for EME, it would mark the company's first major acquisition in Europe. The move would also give Dominion access to the UK's electricity market and increase its presence in the renewable energy sector. EME has invested heavily in wind and solar power in recent years, and renewable sources now account for over one-third of its electricity production. Meanwhile, Dominion has set a goal to produce 7,700 megawatts of renewable energy by 2025, up from 2,300 megawatts currently.
However, any potential acquisition by Dominion would require approval from UK regulators, including the Competition and Markets Authority. The regulator has recently been scrutinizing the electricity market, with a particular focus on the dominance of the "Big Six" energy suppliers, which include EME. The regulator has also been considering ways to encourage new entrants into the market and promote competition.
EME has faced criticism from some customers and politicians for charging high prices and failing to offer competitive tariffs. Last year, the company announced plans to reduce its standard variable tariff by 5% after a review by the regulator found that it had overcharged customers. EME has also faced pressure to invest in upgrading its infrastructure and improving its customer service.
Despite these challenges, EME remains a significant player in the UK electricity market and has a strong customer base in the East Midlands region. If Dominion acquires EME, it would face competition from other major energy suppliers such as British Gas, EDF Energy, and NPower.
The talks between Dominion and EME are still in their early stages, and it is unclear if a deal will be reached. However, the discussions indicate that Dominion is serious about expanding its operations overseas and sees the UK market as a strategic opportunity. If a deal is completed, it would be the latest in a string of mergers and acquisitions in the energy sector, as companies seek to consolidate their positions and adapt to the changing demands of the industry.
