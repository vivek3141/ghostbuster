BT Beats Analyst Forecasts with Strong Profits and Growth Despite Competition
BT Group, the UK's largest telecoms operator, has reported better-than-expected profits and growth, despite facing stiff competition in the industry. The company, which is in the midst of a major transformation programme, revealed a 7% increase in revenue in its latest financial results.
The telecoms giant recorded a pre-tax profit of £2.6bn ($3.4bn) for the financial year ending March 31, beating analysts' forecasts. This represented a 12% increase in profits compared to the previous year, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose by 2%.
BT's strong performance was driven by growth in its consumer division, which includes BT TV and EE mobile, as well as its Openreach infrastructure unit. The company saw significant growth in fibre broadband, with over half a million customers signing up over the past year.
BT's CEO, Philip Jansen, said the company had demonstrated "resilience" in the face of tough market conditions. "It was an extraordinary year, with Covid-19 impacting every aspect of our business," he said. "Despite these challenges, our colleagues have worked tirelessly to keep the nation connected."
Jansen said that the company's investment in new technologies, such as 5G and full fibre, would help to secure its long-term future. "We have accelerated our plans to roll out full fibre across the UK, and we are investing in 5G to bring the latest mobile technology to our customers," he said.
However, BT's strong performance was overshadowed by concerns about its ability to continue growing, as it faces increased competition from rivals such as Virgin Media and Sky. The company's share price has dropped by more than a third over the past year, as investors fret over declining revenues and margins.
Analysts have also raised concerns about BT's pension deficit, which stood at £7.9bn at the end of March. The company has pledged to make £3bn in cash contributions to the pension fund over the next three years, but some experts have questioned whether this will be enough to meet its obligations.
Nevertheless, some analysts were upbeat about BT's prospects. Jefferies analyst, Jerry Dellis, said the company had shown "early signs of being able to deliver on its transformation plan".
"BT's consumer business had a good year, with a solid performance from EE mobile and better-than-expected growth in BT TV," he said. "Meanwhile, Openreach is benefiting from the roll-out of fibre, which is helping to drive revenue growth."
BT's strong performance comes amid a rapidly changing landscape in the telecoms industry. The UK government is urging telecoms operators to invest in full fibre, with the aim of achieving universal coverage by 2033. Meanwhile, there are increasing calls for greater competition in the sector, with some experts calling for the break-up of BT's Openreach division.
In response to these challenges, Jansen said the company was committed to investing in new technologies and making its operations more efficient. "We are transforming the way we work, using data and technology to improve our services and reduce costs," he said.
BT's results were also buoyed by strong growth in its international business, particularly in Asia and Africa. The company's global services division recorded a 5% increase in revenue, driven by demand for cyber security and cloud services.
Despite the challenges facing the telecoms industry, BT's performance shows that there are still opportunities for growth and profitability. Whether the company can continue to compete effectively in an increasingly crowded market remains to be seen, but for now, it appears to be on a solid footing.
