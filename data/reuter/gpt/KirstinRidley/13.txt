The recent merger between UK-based Cable and Wireless Communications and US-based Liberty Global-owned company Concert PLC is estimated to bring in long term benefits, but also challenges for the newly formed company.
The $20 billion merger was finalized on Monday, after almost a year of negotiations between the two companies. The new company is being named as ‘Concert Wireless’ and is expected to cater to more than 50 million customers worldwide while operating in over 20 countries worldwide.
While talking to The Guardian, Mr. Cable, who is expected to lead the newly formed company, said that the merger would “create a major player in the telecommunications industry.”
He added that the merger had potential synergies of $5 billion, which would give Concert Wireless the required capital to invest in expanding its digital and mobile network.
The merger is expected to bring plenty of advantages to the newly named entity, but analysts believe that it will still face significant challenges in the coming months.
The first major obstacle that Concert Wireless is expected to face is the integration of its two pre-existent work cultures.
Cable and Wireless communications have traditionally been more focused on landline and wireless services, while Concert PLC has a significant presence in the cable industry.
Thus, experts believe that the integration of the two work cultures could lead to initial hiccups in terms of smooth operations.
Moreover, the combined company will have to deal with significant disparities in the countries where it operates. While Cable and Wireless’s primary market is in the Caribbean, Latin America, and the Seychelles, Concert PLC has operations in Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean as well as the United States.
Experts predict that the combined company will have to deal with regulatory differences, network infrastructure disparities, and varying market conditions in each of these countries.
Moreover, Concert Wireless will face significant competition in some of its primary markets, which include the United Kingdom, Italy, and Ireland.
In all three countries, the newly merged entity is expected to face stiff competition from established players.
In the United Kingdom, the company will have to go up against market leaders such as Vodafone, Telecom Plus and TalkTalk, while in Italy and Ireland, the company will face competition from established players such as Telecom Italia and Eircom, respectively.
The combined company will also have to deal with the challenge of keeping pace with rapid industry changes.
The telecommunications industry is constantly evolving, with new technologies being introduced all the time. Concert Wireless will have to keep up with these changes, especially as it tries to expand its digital and mobile network.
In order to remain competitive, the new company will have to invest in new technologies, keep up with industry trends and innovate at a faster pace than its rivals.
While these challenges pose significant risks to Concert Wireless, analysts believe that the company will still emerge as a major player in the telecommunications industry.
The company’s large customer base, combined with the potential synergies of nearly $5 billion, will undoubtedly give the firm the required capital to invest in expanding its digital and mobile network.
Moreover, analysts point out that Concert Wireless has already proven its ability to overcome significant challenges in the past.
For instance, in 2013, Cable and Wireless Communications’ revenues had fallen sharply, and the company was struggling financially. However, with smart strategic investments and cost-cutting, the company was able to turn things around, and by 2015, had generated a significant profit.
With the right approach and the required investment, analysts expect Concert Wireless to overcome the challenges it currently faces and emerge as a major player in the telecommunications industry.
