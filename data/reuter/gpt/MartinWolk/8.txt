Microsoft Reports Record Sales and Better-Than-Expected Profits for Latest Quarter
Microsoft Corp. reported record sales and better-than-expected profits for the latest quarter on Tuesday, driven by strong demand for its cloud computing services amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The technology giant said revenue in the three months ended March 31 rose $41.7 billion, up 19% from the same period a year earlier. Net income jumped to $15.5 billion, or $2.03 a share, compared with $10.8 billion, or $1.40 a share, in the same quarter last year.
"The third quarter was a very strong quarter for Microsoft, driven by continued cloud strength and usage and demand growth," said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft.
One of Microsoft's biggest strength lies in its Azure cloud service, which competes with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. Azure revenue surged 50% in the latest quarter, compared with a 47% rise in the previous quarter. The company said that Azure managed to reach a $50 billion annualized revenue run rate during the quarter.
Microsoft's commercial cloud revenue, which includes the Azure cloud security platforms along with its Dynamics 365 business application suite and Office 365 productivity suite, climbed 33% year-over-year to $17.7 billion.
Office 365 also enjoyed solid growth: The service now has more than 258 million users, an increase of 15% compared to the same time last year, Microsoft said.
More than a year into the pandemic, companies worldwide have overwhelmingly turned to cloud computing services to enable remote work for their employees. Microsoft has been at the forefront of this trend, and the company continues to benefit from the shift towards cloud-based work.
The company has also seen solid demand for its Xbox gaming console, thanks to increased sales amid the pandemic. Xbox content and services revenue grew by 34% in the latest quarter.
Microsoft's impressive results come at a time when many other companies are still grappling with the aftermath of the pandemic. For Microsoft, the pandemic has been a tailwind rather than a headwind. Sales at many of its businesses accelerated due to the pandemic's impact on digital transformation and remote work, while demand for its gaming products surged as more people shifted to gaming as a form of entertainment during lockdowns.
Microsoft's strong Q3 results were widely anticipated by Wall Street analysts. Shares of Microsoft rose more than 2% in after-market trading on Tuesday.
"Overall, we continue to see Azure and Office 365 as the key growth drivers for Microsoft in the next 2-3 years," said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
Looking ahead, Microsoft said it expects strong demand to continue for its cloud services, and the company also projected that its Xbox gaming business would continue to grow.
"The increasing focus on working and learning from home will continue to drive demand for Microsoft's products and services," Nadella said.
Microsoft has become one of the most valuable companies in the world thanks to its business in cloud computing and office productivity software. As more businesses shift towards cloud-based computing and remote work, Microsoft appears to be on track to continue its solid growth path in the coming years.
