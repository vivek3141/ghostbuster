Seattle, Washington - The Boeing Co. announced on Wednesday that it had recorded a 13% increase in its profits for the third quarter of 2021. The rise in profits came on the back of strong sales of its commercial jets and a rise in interest income.
The company, which is headquartered in Chicago, reported a net profit of $1.87 billion, compared to the $1.66 billion it recorded in the same period last year. The revenues went up by 7% to $18.3 billion from $17 billion in the previous year. The latest financial results have exceeded the expectations of industry analysts.
"The third-quarter results reflect our commitment to innovation, quality, and customer satisfaction, all of which are essential to the success of our business," said Boeing's CEO David Calhoun while commenting on the results. "We are making progress in our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our competitiveness."
The company's Commercial Airplanes division saw favorable sales during the quarter, driven by the continued demand for its 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. Despite the supply chain disruptions, Boeing has managed to deliver 156 commercial aircraft during the period, up from 139 aircraft in the same quarter last year. The company has a backlog of 4,100 aircraft, providing it with a solid base of future earnings.
Boeing's Defense, Space, and Security division also reported growth in revenue, driven by the U.S military's demand for its Chinook and Apache helicopters, F-15 and F-18 fighter jets, and satellite systems. Its Global Services division, however, suffered a decline in revenue due to the continued impact of the pandemic on its commercial customers.
Boeing's bottom line was further boosted by its rising interest income, which grew to $532 million from $160 million in the previous year. The increase in interest income came as the company repaid some of its long-term debt by issuing new bonds at lower rates.
However, the news is not all rosy for Boeing. The company is still dealing with the after-effects of the 737 MAX crisis, with production levels yet to meet pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, supply chain issues and a shortage of skilled labor are creating headwinds for the company.
Despite these challenges, Boeing remains optimistic about its long-term prospects. The company is forecasting higher deliveries of commercial aircraft next year, and it expects to receive certification for its 777X wide-body jet by mid-2023.
Investors seem to be bullish on Boeing's future growth prospects, with the company's stock price rising by 3.5% to close at $220.67 on Wednesday following the announcement of its financial results.
Boeing's positive results are a welcome boost to the aviation industry, which has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic. The company's continued success will mark another milestone in the recovery of the tourism and business sectors.
