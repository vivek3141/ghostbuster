REDMOND, WA - Microsoft has officially launched its new MSN Online Service, placing a significant emphasis on the entertainment programming alongside its comprehensive news coverage. This move reflects the technology giant's ambitions to become a major player in the entertainment industry, positioning itself for what it anticipates to be "the next mass medium."
The new service builds on the success of the original MSN platform, which launched over two decades ago. MSN Online Service's sleek design and easy-to-navigate interface make it simple for users to consume the content they enjoy most, whether it be the latest news stories or a hit TV show.
"Entertainment has become an essential part of the online world, and MSN's new service is tailor-made for that," said Sarah Bond, Corporate Vice President at Microsoft. "We want to create an immersive experience for our users, allowing them to access entertainment in all forms and giving them the freedom to curate it however they wish."
The service will integrate Microsoft's various entertainment and media offerings, including its gaming platform, Mixer, streaming service, Spotify, and partnerships for premium content with the likes of Netflix. As part of their broader strategy, Microsoft has created a team of entertainment professionals that includes former executives of Disney and CBS to develop and distribute exclusive programming.
Microsoft's vision is to create a versatile platform that can offer something for everyone. "We recognize that each person has different preferences for the types of content they consume," said Bond. "With our new service, users can choose from an incredible range of offerings that reflect their interests."
The new platform will also utilize artificial intelligence to ensure that recommended content is tailored to users' interests based on their consumption patterns. Microsoft hopes that this feature will drive user engagement and retention rates in an era where personalization is increasingly critical.
There are several advantages of a unified entertainment service platform, including increased efficiency, greater cost savings, and the ability to capitalize on cross-promotional opportunities from platforms such as gaming and streaming. As Microsoft expands its entertainment offerings, it may further strengthen its position as the go-to destination for online entertainment.
The release of MSN Online Service comes at a time when the entertainment industry is undergoing a period of tectonic change. Streaming services have fundamentally altered traditional TV consumption patterns, with players like Netflix and Disney+ winning millions of subscribers. The outbreak of COVID-19 has also accelerated this shift, leading to a surge in online content consumption.
Amid this rapidly evolving landscape, tech giants have come to recognize the value of entertainment as a means of attracting and retaining users. Amazon has conducted a notable push into the industry and secured a significant foothold through investments in original programming, while Google and Apple are also positioning their brands for a similar move.
Given these recent developments, Microsoft's entry into the entertainment sphere comes as little surprise. MSN Online Service's user-friendly interface, breadth of offerings, and personalized recommendations may give them a significant leg-up in this space. By offering a centralized, one-stop-shop for diverse entertainment, Microsoft hopes to position itself for the future of media and become a significant player in the industry.
