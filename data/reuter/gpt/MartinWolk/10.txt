Microsoft Corp's Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Amy Hood has recently shared a positive outlook for the company's revenue growth over the next two quarters. Speaking at a company conference, Hood revealed that the company is expecting revenue growth of 19% for the first quarter of 2022 and 16% for the second quarter.
Hood attributed the growth to the ongoing demand for the company's cloud and gaming products, among others. Microsoft's cloud offerings, including Azure and Office 365, have seen significant growth due to the ongoing trend of remote work and learning. The company's gaming division has also seen a boost in revenue thanks to the launch of its latest Xbox console.
"We continue to see strong demand for our cloud offerings and gaming products, which is reflected in our expected revenue growth for the next two quarters," said Hood.
Hood also highlighted the company's recent acquisition of Nuance Communications, a leading provider of conversational AI and speech recognition software and solutions, as a contributing factor to the optimistic outlook. The acquisition is expected to bolster the company's offerings in healthcare and other industries.
Microsoft's stock has been on the rise in recent months, reaching an all-time high in early September. The positive outlook for revenue growth is likely to further accelerate the company's stock value.
"Microsoft's strong financial performance is a testament to the company's ability to adapt to changing market conditions and consistently innovate to meet customer needs," said Hood.
Overall, Microsoft's positive outlook for revenue growth over the next two quarters is a significant boost for the company and its shareholders. With the ongoing demand for its cloud and gaming products and the recent acquisition of Nuance Communications, the company is well-positioned for continued success in the future.
