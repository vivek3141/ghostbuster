The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has confirmed 29 cases of bacterial poisoning linked to Odwalla apple juice, prompting the agency to test store shelves for contamination.
The Odwalla apple juice has been linked to an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7, a bacteria that causes severe illness including abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting. The illness can lead to complications such as kidney failure and even death.
The 29 cases were reported across four US states - Colorado, California, Washington and Oregon. The affected people range in age from 15 to 75 and have all reported drinking Odwalla apple juice prior to becoming ill. At least 11 of the affected people have been hospitalized, while three have developed kidney failure.
The FDA has urged consumers to avoid drinking unopened Odwalla apple juice until further notice and to throw away any opened bottles that have a "best before" date of October 2, 2021, and earlier.
"FDA is working with Odwalla to investigate the cause of the outbreak and identify the source of the bacteria," said Frank Yiannas, FDA Deputy Commissioner for Food Policy and Response.
The FDA has also begun testing store shelves for contamination, including at several retail chains across the country. The agency is specifically looking for E. coli O157:H7 in the apple juice.
"Our top priority is to protect consumers and prevent further illness," Yiannas said.
Odwalla, a subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company, has issued a voluntary recall of all Odwalla apple juice products with a "best before" date of October 2, 2021, and earlier. The company has also temporarily stopped production and distribution of the apple juice products.
"We take our responsibility for the safety of our products very seriously, and we are taking every step necessary to ensure that our apple juice is safe for consumption," said Odwalla in a statement.
The company is working with the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to investigate the outbreak and identify the source of the contamination.
The CDC has warned that the number of reported cases may increase as more people become ill. The agency has advised healthcare providers to be on the lookout for symptoms of E. coli O157:H7 in patients who have consumed Odwalla apple juice.
This outbreak is not the first time Odwalla has faced a bacterial contamination issue. In 1996, the company's unpasteurized apple juice was linked to an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 that led to the deaths of a toddler and an elderly person, and sickened more than 60 others.
Following that incident, Odwalla changed its production methods to include pasteurization, a process that kills harmful bacteria. However, the recent outbreak has raised questions about whether more measures are needed to ensure the safety of the company's products.
The FDA and Odwalla are urging consumers to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of bacterial poisoning, especially if they have recently consumed Odwalla apple juice.
As the investigation continues, consumers are advised to stay alert and take necessary precautions to protect their health.
