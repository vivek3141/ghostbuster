Seattle-based technology giant Microsoft has announced its first-quarter earnings report with growth slowing down by 2% since last year. The launch of Windows 95 in August 1995, which garnered positive reviews and blew away most software competitors, has been cited as the major factor leading to a sluggish year-on-year growth.
The report, released on Tuesday, revealed that Microsoft declared a net income of $1.7 billion for the first three months of the 1996 fiscal year which ended on 30 September. This represents a yearly growth rate of 39 percent, but a slowdown of 2 percent compared to last year's first quarter. Microsoft's revenue during this period was $3.2 billion, an increase of 31 percent compared to the same period last year.
Analysts say this shows that Microsoft has started to experience difficulty in maintaining its rapid growth over the past couple of years. However, it’s important to note that the first quarter of any year is usually quite slow for most companies, with revenue and profits often picking up slowly in Q2 and Q3.
According to Nadia Adler, a technology analyst at Jupiter Research, the slow growth is a natural outcome of the success of Windows 95. "They have set such a high baseline, which they cannot maintain at a continued high rate,” said Adler. “This should be expected following Windows 95’s launch – it was such a huge success that it impacted sales of other software products that Microsoft competes with.”
Despite the sluggish growth, Microsoft has many reasons to be satisfied with the first quarter results. The company has continued its symbiotic relationship with personal computers, performing well across nearly all product categories.
Microsoft's flagship software product, Office, remained strong with sales up by 29 percent in the first quarter. Additionally, sales of Exchange Server and SQL Server rose significantly contributing to the overall revenue. The company's consumer sales reached $1.8 billion, with Windows 3.X and Microsoft Office continuing to perform well in the market.
In the gaming category, Microsoft also performed well with Xbox sales rising steadily. The company launched Xbox in November 2001, and it has continued to compete against rivals Sony and Nintendo in the gaming space.
However, Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser product has experienced some tough competition, with Netscape Navigator holding onto the internet browser market share. Despite this, Microsoft has been busy improving its browser products and continues to compete in this field.
In summary, Microsoft’s first-quarter earnings report showed a slower growth rate because of the successful launch of Windows 95 last year. The software giant has many reasons to be satisfied, with its flagship software products performing well across nearly all categories. Microsoft is expected to address these issues and return to growth in the coming quarter. Nevertheless, for now, it’s clear that its long and profitable reign at the top of the software world is under threat.
