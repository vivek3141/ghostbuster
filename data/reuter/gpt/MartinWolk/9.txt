Seattle-based software giant Microsoft Corp. on Thursday reported better-than-expected profits for the first quarter of its fiscal year, led by strong demand for its latest operating systems, Windows 95 and Windows NT. The results marked a solid start to the year for Microsoft, which has been grappling with intense competition from rivals in recent quarters.
The company said its net income for the three months ended September 30 rose to $1.97 billion, or 78 cents per share, from $1.14 billion, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by First Call had expected the company to earn 65 cents per share.
Revenue for the quarter was $5.94 billion, up from $4.18 billion in the year-earlier period. Microsoft said its results were driven by strong sales of its core businesses, including its Windows operating systems, Office software suite, and server applications.
"We've got strong momentum in our business, and we're executing well across the board," said John Connors, Microsoft's chief financial officer. "Demand for Windows 95 and Windows NT is exceeding our expectations, and we're seeing broad-based growth in our businesses."
Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system, which was released in August 1995, has been a major driver of growth for the company over the past year. The operating system has been extremely popular among consumers and businesses, and has helped Microsoft maintain its dominant position in the PC software market.
Windows NT, which is aimed at the corporate market, has also been a strong performer for Microsoft. The operating system is designed for use in high-end servers and workstations, and is used by businesses for a wide range of applications, including database management, e-mail and messaging, and Web hosting.
In addition to its strong results from core businesses, Microsoft also reported growth in its online and multimedia businesses. The company said its MSN online service saw record growth in the quarter, with a 45 percent increase in registered users.
"Our online and multimedia businesses are really starting to take off," Connors said. "We're seeing strong demand for our Internet Explorer browser, our Web development tools, and our multimedia software."
Looking ahead, Microsoft said it sees continued growth in its core businesses, and expects to see strong demand for Windows 95 and Windows NT in the coming quarters. The company also said it plans to continue investing in its online and multimedia businesses, and will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships.
"We're confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results for our shareholders," Connors said. "We're focused on executing our strategy, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead of us."
