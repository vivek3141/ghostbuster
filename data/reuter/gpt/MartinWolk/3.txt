Microsoft Corporation announced yesterday that it had launched a new version of its MSN online service, which it said would offer more emphasis on entertainment programming. The company said it intended to double its subscriber base to 1.5 million by mid-1997. 
The new MSN service, which replaces the original launched in August 1995, offers a broader range of programming, including new partnerships with ESPN, CBS Sportsline and CNET, the network for current technology that will serve as a guide to online entertainment and information. 
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, speaking at the company's annual meeting in Seattle yesterday, said the company was undertaking "an aggressive marketing campaign" to attract new subscribers to the MSN service, which offers a wide range of information on entertainment, news, finance, sports and weather, as well as online access and e-mail. 
"We're excited about MSN and about our vision for who we want to be in the online world," Gates said. "Within the coming months, we will have many new features and services to announce." 
The new MSN service includes several new features, including the "Money Side," which offers access to a wide range of financial services, and "Interactive House," in which the user simulates buying and decorating a house. The new service also includes a feature called "Momentum," which is intended to help users get from one area of the Web to another more quickly. 
In addition, the new MSN service includes an "Entertainment Guide," which provides information on movies, television, theater, music, sports and other entertainment. Microsoft has signed partnerships with ESPN, CBS Sportsline, WebTV Networks and others to offer programming within the guide. The guide also includes links to other Web sites. 
Microsoft said it was promoting the new MSN service through a "multimillion-dollar" advertising campaign that includes print and television ads. The company also has set up a "street team" that will be visiting colleges and universities to promote MSN. 
The company is offering introductory rates for new subscribers, which range from $14.95 a month to $29.95 a month depending on the level of service. The lower-priced service includes access to the Internet and e-mail, while the higher levels offer additional services, such as online tax preparation and personal financial planning. 
Microsoft's decision to expand the MSN service comes as competition in the online marketplace heats up and as the company faces growing challenges from companies such as America Online, AT&T, and Yahoo!, as well as a host of smaller services. 
In a report issued last month by Jupiter Communications, an Internet market research firm, Microsoft ranked third behind America Online and AT&T in terms of online subscriber growth in the first half of 1996. The report said that while Microsoft had grown its subscriber base by 57 percent during that period, America Online and AT&T had grown theirs by 63 percent and 70 percent, respectively. 
Microsoft, which has invested millions of dollars in its online efforts, has been working to improve its software and services to attract a wider audience. The company also is exploring new markets, such as interactive television and other multimedia applications. 
Analysts said Microsoft faces a significant challenge in achieving its goal of doubling its subscriber base by mid-1997. While the company is offering some attractive features, such as the Entertainment Guide, it faces strong competition from well-established online services such as America Online, which boasts more than 8 million subscribers. 
"Microsoft is coming late to the party, and it is going to be tough to catch up," said Mike Maynard, an industry analyst with Jupiter Communications. "Microsoft will have to differentiate itself from the competition and offer something new and valuable to attract subscribers." 
Microsoft officials said they were confident they could achieve their goals for the MSN service. "We believe that MSN is an essential element of our strategy to drive growth and profitability," said Steve Ballmer, executive vice president of sales and marketing. "We are going to work hard to make it a success." 
Overall, the new MSN online service appears to be a significant step forward for Microsoft in the highly competitive and rapidly changing online marketplace. Whether the company can achieve its ambitious goals, however, remains to be seen. For now, the online service is a key part of Microsoft's efforts to establish a strong presence in the online world and to offer a wide range of products and services to its customers.
