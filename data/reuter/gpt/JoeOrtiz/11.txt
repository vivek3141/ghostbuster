The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has raised concerns among key players in the Eurotunnel share investigation as it has yet to reach out to securities houses regarding the matter.
In May 2019, the SFO launched an investigation into suspected fraud, bribery, and corruption in connection with the sale of Eurotunnel shares between 2012 and 2015. It is alleged that senior employees of Eurotunnel may have provided false or misleading information to the market and failed to disclose material information to potential investors.
The investigation has been ongoing for over two years, but the SFO has not yet contacted securities houses involved in the sale of Eurotunnel shares. This has raised concerns among industry professionals who fear that vital evidence may be missed if the matter is not handled with urgency.
The Eurotunnel investigation is one of several high-profile cases being handled by the SFO, but delays in reaching out to securities houses have led to criticism of the agency’s efficiency and effectiveness.
Experts in the financial industry have voiced their opinions on the matter, with many urging the SFO to take swift action in contacting securities houses implicated in the investigation.
Speaking to Reuters, Rachel Spearing, a partner at legal firm Peters & Peters, stated that it was “surprising” that the SFO had not yet contacted securities houses, adding that “time is of the essence” in such investigations.
Similarly, Nick Barnard, an expert in financial crime and partner at law firm Corker Binning, highlighted the importance of gathering evidence from securities houses in order to build a strong case against those accused of wrongdoing.
“Without guidance or direction from the SFO, it’s unclear what the securities houses involved should be doing to preserve and collect evidence,” said Barnard. “This could have significant implications for the strength of the case if and when it comes to court.”
In response to the criticism, the SFO has stressed that it is committed to the investigation and is working closely with relevant parties to gather evidence.
“We are conducting a thorough and complex investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption relating to the sale of Eurotunnel securities,” a spokesperson for the SFO told Reuters. “We are committed to ensuring the investigation is conducted efficiently and effectively, and we are working with all relevant parties to gather evidence.”
The investigation into Eurotunnel shares has also raised concerns among investors who may have been affected by the alleged wrongdoing. Some have called for greater transparency and accountability in the financial sector to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
As the investigation continues, the SFO will need to act fast in contacting securities houses in order to gather important evidence and build a strong case against those accused of fraud, bribery, and corruption. The financial industry and the wider public will be watching closely to see how the matter is handled.
