Mercury Asset Management, a UK-based investment company, has reported a significant rise in its first-half profits. The company said its pre-tax profit for the first six months of this year was £322m ($429m), representing a 29% increase from the same period last year. The jump in profit was mainly driven by the strong performance of its equity and bond funds, as well as a rise in assets under management.
The company's assets under management (AUM) grew to £52.3bn ($69.8bn) from £41.4bn ($55.3bn) last year. A significant portion of this came from net inflows, which amounted to £3.4bn ($4.5bn). The company has attributed this to increased demand for its ESG (environmental, social, and governance) funds, which have been gaining popularity among investors.
Mercury Asset Management's CEO, Mark Smith, commented on the results, saying, "We are pleased with the strong performance in the first half of the year, particularly in light of the challenging market conditions. We believe our commitment to active management and our focus on ESG investing has resonated with clients, which is reflected in the continued growth in assets under management."
Mercury Asset Management may use its cash pile to expand its presence in the US market. The company is said to be considering acquisitions as part of its growth plans. Smith said, "We see significant opportunities in the US market, and we are exploring various options to expand our presence there. While we cannot comment on any specific plans, we believe our strong balance sheet and cash position gives us the flexibility to pursue growth opportunities."
The company's cash and cash equivalents stood at £551m ($735m) at the end of June. This represents a significant increase from its cash position of £146m ($195m) last year. The company said it had no debt and has remained resilient despite the ongoing market volatility.
Mercury Asset Management has also announced plans to increase its dividend by 5% to 54p per share. This marks the sixth consecutive year of dividend increases. The company said it is committed to returning value to its shareholders and is confident about its future growth prospects.
The company's strong performance comes at a time when many investment firms are struggling to navigate the difficult market conditions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, Mercury Asset Management's active management approach has helped it weather the storm and deliver robust returns to its clients.
The ESG investing trend has been gaining traction among investors in recent years, with many seeking to align their investments with their values. Mercury Asset Management has been at the forefront of this trend, with a range of ESG funds that invest in companies with strong environmental and social governance practices.
The company's success in this area has been recognized with several awards, including the 2021 Morningstar Awards for Best ESG Equity Fund and the 2021 Citywire Awards for Best ESG (Global) Equity Fund.
In conclusion, Mercury Asset Management's strong first-half results and healthy cash position have put it in a strong position to pursue growth opportunities, particularly in the US market. The company's focus on ESG investing has resonated with clients, and its commitment to active management has helped it deliver strong returns despite the challenging market conditions.
