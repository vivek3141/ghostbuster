Barclays, the UK-based multinational investment bank, has confirmed that it is in discussions with Morgan Stanley regarding the sale of its global custody business. The deal is said to be part of Barclays' ongoing restructuring plans, as it aims to focus on its core businesses and increase profitability.
Global custody is a niche area of banking that involves the safekeeping of assets such as stocks, bonds and other securities on behalf of institutional investors like pension funds, insurance companies and asset managers. It is a highly competitive business with a small number of large players such as State Street, Bank of New York Mellon and JP Morgan.
According to industry sources, the global custody business is not a core area of focus for Barclays and contributes a relatively small amount to its overall revenue. The bank is said to be looking to raise funds from the sale of non-core businesses to support its investment banking operations and improve its profitability, which has been under pressure in recent years due to a challenging economic environment and increased regulation.
The talks with Morgan Stanley come after Barclays' planned sale of its stake in its African subsidiary, Absa Group, was put on hold earlier this year due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The bank had originally planned to exit its African operations altogether but now intends to retain a 14.9% stake in Absa.
The potential sale of its global custody business is expected to generate interest from a number of other large banks and financial institutions, including some of its existing competitors in the space. The deal is likely to be worth several hundred million dollars, although exact details of the terms of the transaction have not yet been disclosed.
Barclays is also said to be exploring other ways to streamline its business and reduce costs, including cutting jobs and closing branches. The bank recently announced plans to cut around 1,000 jobs in its investment banking division globally, as it seeks to reduce costs and improve efficiency.
The potential sale of its global custody business is just one example of how Barclays is seeking to reshape its business to better serve its clients and improve its financial performance. The bank has been working on a number of initiatives in recent years aimed at enhancing its digital capabilities and improving its risk management, in order to better compete with its peers and meet the evolving needs of its clients.
Overall, the talks with Morgan Stanley are a significant development for Barclays and demonstrate the bank's continued commitment to reshaping its operations and unlocking shareholder value. While details of the potential sale are still being worked out, it is clear that the deal would represent a major step towards achieving these goals.
