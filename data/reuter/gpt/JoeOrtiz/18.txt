The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) announced today that its pre-tax profits for the first quarter of 2021 rose significantly compared to last year, but fell short of analysts' predictions.
The UK-based bank reported £946m pre-tax profit for the first three months of the year, up from £288m during the same period in 2020. However, this figure was still lower than the expected pre-tax profit of £968m, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The bank credited its higher profits to a number of factors, including a boost in mortgage lending as the housing market in the UK continues to perform strongly. In addition, RBS said fewer customers were defaulting on loan repayments, which helped to increase its net interest margin.
However, the bank also highlighted the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, with uncertainty still prevailing in the global economy.
"Our results this quarter demonstrate the resilience of our business in the face of ongoing challenges," said RBS CEO Alison Rose in a statement. "While we are encouraged by the progress we have made, we remain mindful of the continued uncertainty caused by the pandemic."
RBS also reported a significant increase in its capital position, with its Common Equity Tier 1 ratio rising to 18.2%, up from 16.2% in the previous quarter. This ratio is a key measure of a bank's financial strength and ability to absorb losses.
Despite the higher profits and improved capital position, RBS's share price fell in early trading on Friday, indicating that investors were disappointed with the bank's results. The share price was down around 4% when markets opened.
Analysts had expected RBS to outperform its rivals in the first quarter, given its strong presence in the UK market and the recent recovery of the stock market. However, the results were seen as a mixed bag, with some positives and some disappointments.
"The bottom line is that RBS's results are not as good as they could have been, but they are still quite good in the current environment," said Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor.
Hunter said that RBS's performance was likely to be closely monitored by investors in the coming months as the bank undergoes a major restructuring plan, which involves reducing its staff and closing hundreds of branches across the UK.
"RBS is still in the middle of a turnaround plan, which is going to take time to fully play out," he said. "Investors will want to see more progress in the next few quarters before they make any major decisions about the bank's future."
