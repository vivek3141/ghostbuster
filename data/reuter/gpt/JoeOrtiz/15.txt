NatWest Markets has named Peter Hall as its new Chief Operating Officer amidst ongoing concerns over the bank’s strategy. Hall, formerly Chief Risk Officer at the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), will take up his new position on April 1.
NatWest Markets is the investment banking arm of NatWest Group, formerly known as RBS. The bank has been struggling to match the performance of its competitors in recent years, prompting questions over its future direction. Its new CEO, Alison Rose, has pledged to undertake a strategic review of the business.
Hall’s appointment is seen as a step towards addressing some of these concerns. He is highly regarded within the industry, having worked in various senior roles at RBS and NatWest Group over the past 15 years. His experience in risk management and operations is seen as particularly relevant to the challenges currently facing NatWest Markets.
In a statement announcing the appointment, Rose said: “I am delighted that Peter is joining the NatWest Markets team. He brings a wealth of experience and deep knowledge of our organisation, and I am confident that he will play a key role in driving our transformation forward.”
Hall’s appointment comes at a time of transition for NatWest Markets. The bank recently announced plans to wind down its legacy derivatives business and focus on areas where it can be more competitive, such as debt capital markets and foreign exchange trading.
However, there are concerns that this strategy may not be enough to turn around the bank’s fortunes. Some analysts have called for a more radical overhaul, such as a merger with another bank or a move away from investment banking altogether.
NatWest Markets’ performance has also been affected by the ongoing economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic. The bank reported a loss of £72m in the third quarter of 2020, compared to a profit of £85m in the same period of the previous year.
Hall’s appointment is expected to bring some much-needed stability to the bank’s senior leadership team. The previous COO, David King, left the bank in July 2020 after less than a year in the role. His departure was seen as a blow to the bank’s efforts to rebuild its operations after years of cost-cutting.
NatWest Markets will be hoping that Hall’s experience and expertise can help it navigate the challenges ahead and put the bank back on a path to growth and profitability. His appointment is a positive step, but there is still much work to be done to convince investors and analysts that the bank has a viable future in the highly competitive investment banking industry.
