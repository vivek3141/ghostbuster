London-based investment bank, Mercury Asset Management (MAM), has predicted a rise in its pre-tax profits for the current financial year due to the buoyant nature of global exchanges. However, despite the positive outlook, MAM has warned that the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated economic fallout could still have a negative effect on the financial market.
MAM is forecasting a pre-tax profit of £52 million this year, up from £39.5 million in 2020, driven by robust trading volumes and increased share prices. A spokesperson for the bank credited this boom in the financial market to a series of factors, including a swift global economic recovery, favourable interest rates, and the continued popularity of investment funds.
The spokesperson also attributed the positive outlook to the booming technology sector, which has seen a sharp rise in value thanks to increased digitalisation and remote working during the pandemic.
In addition to the predicted rise in pre-tax profit, MAM's assets under management (AUM) have also soared in recent months. The bank reported AUM of £7.3 billion in December 2020, up from £6.1 billion in June of the same year.
Despite the optimistic outlook, MAM warned that the pandemic and its impact on the global economy could still result in market volatility, which could ultimately affect the bank's profits. MAM's Chief Investment Officer, David Bartram, stated that there remains "a range of unknown factors" that could dampen the bank's long-term outlook.
"Questions around vaccine distribution, the wider economic impact of the pandemic, and ongoing geopolitical tensions could all introduce volatility into the markets," Bartram warned.
MAM's latest forecast comes amid a wider shift in the financial market towards investment in sustainable and socially responsible companies. MAM has been at the forefront of this shift, committing to a raft of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives in recent years.
The bank's leadership has pledged to invest in companies that demonstrate a commitment to combating climate change, promoting social justice, and upholding strong ethical standards. This approach has resonated with investors, with many individuals and institutions increasingly looking to invest in companies that align with their own values.
Overall, MAM's positive forecast bodes well for the health of the financial market, which has been buoyed by increased activity throughout the pandemic. However, the bank's warning about the potential downside risk of the pandemic and its fallout remains a cautionary note for investors.
