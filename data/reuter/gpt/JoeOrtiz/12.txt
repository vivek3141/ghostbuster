In a move that has sent shockwaves across the financial world, Sir Chippendale Keswick has taken over as the chairman and CEO of Hambros, ending the historic family dominance of the renowned banking institution.
The handover of power marks an end to the Keswick family's 170-year-long grip on the company, which was founded in 1839 by Sir Charles Hambro. The family has been synonymous with the bank since 1865, when Sir Charles' son-in-law, William Keswick, joined the board of directors.
But now, after much speculation and anticipation, Sir Chippendale Keswick has taken the reins of the company, inheriting the mantle of leadership that has passed down through his family for generations.
Sir Chippendale, who served as deputy chairman of Hambros prior to his appointment, brings with him a wealth of experience and expertise in the banking sector. He has been with the bank for over 20 years, and has previously worked at other prestigious institutions such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.
His appointment has been met with widespread praise from industry insiders, who believe he has the skillset and temperament needed to lead the company into a new era of growth and prosperity.
Speaking to reporters about his new role, Sir Chippendale said: "I am deeply honored to have been chosen to lead Hambros, and I am committed to upholding the legacy of the Keswick and Hambro families. I believe that with the right strategy and approach, we can navigate the current economic climate and emerge stronger than ever."
The appointment of Sir Chippendale marks a significant shift for the company, which has faced significant challenges in recent years. In 2008, the bank was acquired by Société Générale, a move that was met with some resistance from members of the Keswick family.
But despite this, Hambros has continued to thrive, and has remained a key player in the global banking sector. And now, with Sir Chippendale at the helm, the company is poised to continue this legacy of success and growth.
The breaking of the family dominance at Hambros has been a topic of much debate and discussion, with many arguing that it was time for fresh leadership and new ideas to take the company forward.
But despite this, the Keswick family will remain a key part of the bank's history, and their contributions to the institution will continue to be celebrated for generations to come.
