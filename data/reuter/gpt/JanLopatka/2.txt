Czech consumer prices rose less than economists had expected in September, giving a modest boost to households struggling to cope with the coronavirus pandemic, but also raising concerns that the government's full-year target may be difficult to achieve.
Data from the Czech statistics office showed that consumer prices rose 2.0% year-on-year in September, below the 2.3% increase economists had forecast in a Reuters poll, but still above the central bank's target of 2.0%. The monthly price increase was 0.2%, slightly higher than expected.
The largest price increases were in clothing and footwear (7.3%), transport (5.7%), and food and non-alcoholic beverages (4.6%). The largest downward pressure on prices came from the housing, water, electricity, and gas category (-3.5%), due to lower electricity prices.
The lower-than-expected inflation figure provides some relief for Czech consumers, who have been hit hard by the economic fallout from the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown measures. The country's economy is expected to contract by around 8% this year, according to the government's latest forecast.
However, the government's target of keeping average annual inflation below 3% this year may be difficult to achieve, given the uncertain economic outlook and the ongoing impact of the pandemic. The central bank has projected that inflation will reach 2.5% this year before easing to 2.1% next year.
"The inflation rate will continue to be affected by the pandemic, which is causing strong fluctuations in the prices of individual goods," said Jan Vejmelek, chief economist at Komerční Banka. "However, we expect that the annual average inflation rate will be between 2.5% and 2.7%, which is still below the government's target."
The government has taken steps to support households and businesses affected by the pandemic, including providing wage subsidies and tax breaks, and has pledged to maintain fiscal support for as long as necessary. The central bank has also implemented a range of measures to support the economy, including lowering interest rates and providing liquidity to the banking system.
However, concerns remain about the level of public debt, which is set to rise sharply this year and may limit the government's ability to provide further support. The Czech Republic had the third-highest debt to GDP ratio in the EU last year at 33.3%, and this is expected to rise to around 43% this year.
"The government will need to carefully balance the need to support the economy with the need to maintain fiscal sustainability," said Vejmelek. "It will be a challenging task, but the government has shown that it is willing to take bold action to support the economy."
Inflation is expected to remain a key concern for the central bank in the coming months, as it continues to assess the impact of the pandemic on the economy and adjust its policy accordingly. The bank has signaled that it may cut interest rates further if necessary, but has also stressed that it will maintain its commitment to price stability.
"The central bank will need to strike a fine balance between supporting the economy and maintaining its monetary policy goals," said Vejmelek. "It will be a challenging task, but the bank has the tools and the expertise to navigate the uncertain economic landscape."
