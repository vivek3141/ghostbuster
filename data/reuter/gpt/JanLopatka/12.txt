Prague, Czech Republic- Czech Prime Minister and Economics Professor Vaclav Klaus has predicted a small but perpetual trade gap in the country's economic future. Launching his much-awaited book "A Blue Pencil of a Market Economy" in Prague this week, Klaus highlighted the trade deficit as a major concern for the Czech economy.
According to Klaus, the country's focus on imports and lack of emphasis on exports could lead to long-term economic repercussions. He stated that though the trade gap may be small, it is expected to persist for the foreseeable future due to the country's export limitations.
The Czech Republic experienced a trade deficit of Kc 42.8 billion in the first quarter of 2021, representing a 67% increase from the same period in 2020. Additionally, the country has seen a consistent trade deficit since 1998. With exports accounting for only 75% of the country's GDP, Klaus states that this is insufficient for an economy of its size and potential.
Moreover, Klaus argues that the country's dependence on a few major industries hinders its ability to establish a competitive export market. He identifies automobile production and other manufacturing industries as the driving force behind the country's export market, but states that to increase export revenue, the country needs to diversify.
Klaus suggests that cultivating an entrepreneurial spirit, improving education, increasing research and development, and investing in technology will stimulate the production of innovative apps, devices, and platforms. He notes that prioritizing startups and SMEs and fostering innovation will greatly contribute to the development of a resilient and sustainable economy.
In the book, Klaus also takes aim at the European Union's Green Deal. The Prime Minister claims that the EU's ambitious climate goals will inevitably harm the economy, as they will drive up costs for businesses. Klaus instead believes that European countries should invest in new technologies and green energy without relying solely on regulatory measures from the EU.
The Czech Republic is one of the largest coal producers in the European Union and currently generates 40% of its electricity from coal. The government has committed to phase out coal-based electricity production by 2038 and has set a target of having 22% of its electricity generated from renewable sources by 2030.
Klaus's book has gained significant attention due to his extensive experience in economics and his two stints as Prime Minister of the country. The book comprises a collection of articles on economic theory, globalization, post-communist transformation, and the relationship between government and the market economy.
Public response to Klaus's predictions has been mixed, with some praising his insights while others criticize his controversial views on climate change and the EU's Green Deal.
Regardless of the debate, Klaus's warnings on the country's economic future should not be taken lightly. The Czech Republic must reevaluate its economic strategy and work towards exporting a more diverse range of products to the global market. For this to happen, the country must address its growth limitations, focus on innovation and technology, support startups, and invest in education to prepare its workforce for the rapidly evolving global economy.
