The Governor of the Czech National Bank, Jiri Rusnok, has advised a cautious approach to privatising shares in Komercni Banka. Speaking in a press conference on Friday, Rusnok argued that rushing into the privatisation could have negative consequences for Czech economic stability.
"We need to be careful here," Rusnok said. "Komercni Banka is a key player in the Czech banking sector, and any hasty decisions could have serious repercussions for the wider economy."
Komercni Banka is currently 60% owned by the Czech state, with the remaining 40% owned by Societe Generale. The Czech government has been considering the sale of its stake in the bank for some time, as part of a wider effort to reduce state ownership in the country's economy.
However, Rusnok argued that the government should proceed slowly, to ensure that any eventual privatisation was carried out in a way that benefited both the bank and the wider economy.
"It's important that we take the time to get this right," Rusnok said. "We need to make sure that any new owners of Komercni Banka have a long-term commitment to the country, and that they're willing to invest in the bank's infrastructure and operations."
Rusnok also stressed that the Czech National Bank would play a key role in any privatisation process, ensuring that the bank remained stable and financially sound throughout the transition.
"We'll be monitoring the situation very closely," he said. "We need to make sure that the bank is not only sold to the right buyers, but that the sale is carried out in a way that ensures the bank's continued success and stability."
The Governor's comments have been well-received by financial analysts, who have long warned that any hasty privatisation of Komercni Banka could have negative consequences for the wider Czech economy.
"Rusnok is absolutely right," said Petr Sklenar, a financial analyst with the Prague-based investment firm Investicni Skupina. "It's important that we take a slow and careful approach to this process, to ensure that we get the best possible outcome for everyone involved."
The Czech government has not yet announced a timeline for the privatisation of Komercni Banka shares. However, Rusnok's comments suggest that any eventual sale is likely to be carefully planned and executed, in order to minimise potential risks to the country's economy.
