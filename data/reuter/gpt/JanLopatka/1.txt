Prague, Czech Republic - The Czech Republic’s consumer prices edged up less than expected in September, relieving concerns for the Central European nation’s economy which is struggling with sluggish growth amid a global slowdown.
According to data released by the Czech Statistical Office (CSO) on Wednesday, the country’s annual inflation rate rose by 2.7 percent in September, compared to the previous year. The figure was less than the 2.8 percent forecasted by analysts in a poll by Reuters.
The data showed that the slower-than-expected increase in consumer prices was driven by lower growth in food and housing costs, which were offset by a rise in healthcare and transportation costs. Food prices increased by 3.1 percent in September, down from a 3.5 percent rise in August, while housing prices rose by 3.1 percent, compared to a 3.4 percent rise the previous month.
The low levels of inflation suggest that the Czech National Bank (CNB) may hold off on tightening its monetary policy in the coming months, as it looks to support the country’s economic growth. The bank has already cut interest rates twice this year, amid concerns over the global economic slowdown, which has hit the Czech Republic’s export-dependent economy hard.
“The lower-than-expected inflation in September is a sign that the Czech economy is still not facing significant inflationary pressures,” said Marek Mora, an economist at ING Bank in Prague. “This should give the central bank room to hold off on further interest rate cuts, or even start to consider raising rates if economic growth picks up in the coming months.”
Despite the lower-than-expected increase in consumer prices, the Czech Republic’s economy is facing significant headwinds. The country’s GDP growth slowed to just 2.7 percent in the second quarter of 2019, compared to 2.9 percent in the previous three months.
The country’s manufacturing sector, which accounts for a significant portion of its economy, has also struggled in recent months, amid a global slowdown in demand for automobiles and other manufactured goods. Data released on Wednesday showed that Czech industrial production fell by 3.9 percent year-on-year in August, significantly worse than expected and the steepest decline in four years.
“The data confirms that the Czech economy is in the midst of a serious slowdown, with the manufacturing sector in particular facing significant challenges,” said Jan Vejmelek, an economist at Komerční Banka in Prague. “Given these headwinds, it will be important for the government to take steps to support business investment and promote economic growth over the coming months.”
Despite the challenges facing the Czech Republic’s economy, some analysts remain optimistic about the country’s prospects for the coming months. They point to the government’s efforts to support business investment and the strong domestic demand, which has helped to buoy the economy during a difficult period.
“While the Czech economy is facing significant headwinds, it is important to remember that it is still growing at a healthy pace,” said Milan Nedeljkovic, an economist at Raiffeisenbank in Prague. “If the government and the central bank are able to support the economy in the coming months, we could see a rebound in GDP growth, which would be positive news not just for the Czech Republic, but for the wider Central European region.”
