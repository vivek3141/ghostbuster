The Czech National Bank Governor, Jiří Rusnok, has vowed to maintain the strength of the Czech Crown currency, despite calls to devalue to aid the nation's exports. 
Rusnok addressed the issue during a recent press conference, noting that the Czech Republic's strong economic performance and position in the European Union makes it unnecessary to take such measures. 
"We have no intention of artificially manipulating the value of our currency. We believe in a free and fair market, and we have the ability to withstand any negative effects of a strong currency on our exports," Rusnok stated.
Rusnok's comments come amidst mounting pressure on the central bank to weaken the Crown in order to make Czech exports more competitive in foreign markets. The country's manufacturing sector, which accounts for a significant portion of the nation's economy, has been struggling with a stronger currency making their goods more expensive in foreign markets.
However, Rusnok believes that the overall economic health of the country should take precedence over the short-term benefits of a weaker currency. He noted that the Czech Republic's economy is currently growing faster than the majority of other European Union countries, with a GDP growth rate of 2.5% in 2018.
Furthermore, Rusnok drew attention to the fact that the Czech Republic has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the EU, at just 2.2% according to Eurostat. "We have a strong economy, low unemployment, and a stable financial system. This is the foundation upon which we are building our future," he remarked.
Rusnok's comments have been welcomed by many in the business community, who believe that a strong currency is a reflection of a strong economy. Pavel Novotný, CEO of the Czech Republic's Confederation of Industry, said in an interview that "devaluing the Crown would be a temporary solution to a problem that can be better addressed by improving productivity and innovation within our manufacturing sector."
Despite Rusnok's commitment to a strong currency, the Czech National Bank has not ruled out the possibility of intervening in the foreign exchange market in the future. Such intervention would likely only occur in the case of extreme market fluctuations, and would be aimed at reducing volatility rather than intentionally weakening the Crown.
In conclusion, Jiří Rusnok, the Governor of the Czech National Bank, has reiterated his commitment to maintaining a strong Czech Crown currency, despite calls to devalue in order to aid exports. Rusnok believes that the Czech Republic's strong economic performance and position in the European Union provides a solid foundation for continued growth and stability, and remains confident that the country can make progress in tackling the challenges facing its manufacturing sector without resorting to artificial manipulation of its currency.
