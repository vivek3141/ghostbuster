The Czech Republic's prime minister, Andrej Babis, has accused his main political opponent, Jan Hamáček, of lying and failing to withstand the heat of the country's election campaign. Mr. Hamáček, leader of the Social Democratic Party, is running against Mr. Babis in the upcoming parliamentary elections, scheduled for October 8-9.
Speaking at an election rally in Prague on Friday, Mr. Babis lashed out at Mr. Hamáček, accusing him of spreading false claims about the government's recent policies and criticizing him for his perceived lack of resilience in the face of political attacks.
"He's lying about everything. He doesn't know what to say anymore, he's losing his nerve," Mr. Babis said. "He's not capable of running the country. He's weak, he's unstable, he's pathetic."
The prime minister's attack comes as the election campaign heats up, with both sides ramping up their efforts to win over voters. Mr. Babis and his ANO party are currently leading in the polls, with around 30% support, while the Social Democrats are trailing with around 15%.
Mr. Babis has been courting voters with promises of economic growth and stability, while Mr. Hamáček has been calling for greater social justice and a more equitable distribution of wealth. The two men have clashed on a number of issues, including environmental protection, tax policy, and relations with the European Union.
The prime minister's latest attack on Mr. Hamáček drew a swift response from the opposition leader, who accused Mr. Babis of resorting to personal insults instead of addressing the issues that matter to voters.
"He's trying to distract people from the real problems that they're facing," Mr. Hamáček said. "He's trying to create a false image of me to make himself look better. But people aren't stupid. They know who's really on their side."
The election campaign has been marked by a series of scandals and controversies, with both sides accusing the other of corruption and other forms of misconduct. The ANO party has been hit by allegations of conflicts of interest and misuse of EU funds, while the Social Democrats have been criticized for their handling of a recent Covid-19 outbreak in a nursing home.
Despite the mudslinging, both Mr. Babis and Mr. Hamáček have pledged to respect the outcome of the election and work together to form a stable government. However, analysts say that the bitterness of the campaign could make it difficult for the two sides to find common ground.
"With the level of personal animosity that's been expressed, it's going to be hard to put together a coalition that can work effectively," said Pavel Novotný, a political scientist at Charles University in Prague. "There's a lot of bad blood."
As the campaign enters its final weeks, both Mr. Babis and Mr. Hamáček will no doubt be stepping up their efforts to win over voters and secure the support they need to form the next government. The outcome of the election is likely to have far-reaching consequences for the Czech Republic, with implications for its relations with the EU and its domestic economic and social policies.
