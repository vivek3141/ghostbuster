The Czech Prime Minister has formed a state commission to tackle the country's bureaucracy, which has long been a source of frustration for citizens and businesses alike. The move comes as the nation commemorates the 100th anniversary of the death of celebrated author Franz Kafka, whose works often depicted the frustrations and absurdities of bureaucracy.
In a statement, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said the new commission would be tasked with identifying unnecessary regulations and red tape, streamlining government procedures, and finding ways to make the system more efficient and user-friendly.
"Our bureaucracy has long been a problem for Czech citizens and businesses," Babis said. "It's time for us to take a hard look at the system and make the changes necessary to make it work better for everyone."
The commission will be chaired by Minister of Industry and Trade Karel Havlicek, and will include representatives from government agencies, businesses, and civil society organizations. It is expected to submit its recommendations to the government by the end of the year.
The move has been welcomed by Czech citizens and businesses, many of whom have long complained about the burden of bureaucracy in the country. A recent survey found that more than half of Czechs believe the bureaucracy is a major obstacle to doing business in the country.
"The bureaucracy here is just ridiculous," said Jan Novak, a small business owner in Prague. "You need a mountain of paperwork just to get a permit to open a shop or a restaurant. It's a nightmare."
The commission's work is also seen as a fitting tribute to Kafka, who died in 1924 at the age of 40. Many of his most famous works, including "The Trial" and "The Castle," are set in nightmarish bureaucratic worlds where characters struggle to make sense of the rules and regulations that govern their lives.
"I think Kafka would approve of this move," said Jana Pokorna, a Czech literature professor. "He knew better than anyone the absurdity of bureaucracy, and how it can drive people to despair. If this commission can make even a small dent in the bureaucracy in this country, it will be a great achievement."
