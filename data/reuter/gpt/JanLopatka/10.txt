Komercni Banka, one of the largest commercial banks in the Czech Republic, has reported its financial results for the first nine months of the year. The bank's lower results were attributed to accounting changes, but its shares rose on the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the bank's statement, its net profit for the first three quarters of 2021 was CZK 7.9 billion (USD 342 million), which is a 31% decrease compared to the same period last year. The decline was primarily caused by accounting changes related to the valuation of its financial investments and currency hedging contracts.
Despite the lower results, Komercni Banka's shares rose by 2.4% on the Prague Stock Exchange after the announcement. The bank's management pointed out that its core business remained strong, with stable revenues and a healthy capital position.
"The accounting changes had a one-time impact on our financial results, but our underlying business is performing well," said Jan Juchelka, CEO of Komercni Banka. "We continue to provide our clients with high-quality services and we are confident in our long-term prospects."
Komercni Banka's total revenues for the first nine months of the year were CZK 18.8 billion (USD 814 million), which is a slight increase compared to the same period last year. The bank's net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and the interest paid on deposits, decreased by 1.9% to CZK 13.2 billion (USD 571 million).
The bank's net fee and commission income, which includes income from various banking services such as account maintenance, payments, and cards, increased by 3.3% to CZK 5.1 billion (USD 221 million). This was driven by higher volumes of transactions and higher fees from investment products and insurance.
Despite the ongoing pandemic, the bank's loan portfolio grew by 5.5% to CZK 297.8 billion (USD 12.9 billion) compared to the same period last year. The bank cited strong demand from both corporate and retail clients, as well as the government-supported COVID-19 loan program for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Komercni Banka's capital position remained strong, with a common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 16.8%, which is well above the regulatory requirement of 11.5%. The bank also maintained a good liquidity position, with a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of 281%, far above the regulatory requirement of 100%.
"We are pleased with our strong capital and liquidity positions, which enable us to support our clients' needs and pursue our growth strategy," said Juchelka. "Our focus remains on providing high-quality services, improving efficiency, and investing in digitalization to enhance our customers' experience."
In conclusion, Komercni Banka's lower nine-month results due to accounting changes did not discourage investors, as its shares rose on the Prague Stock Exchange. The bank's management highlighted the strength of its core business, with stable revenues and a healthy capital position. The ongoing pandemic did not deter the bank's loan portfolio growth, and the bank's focus remains on providing high-quality services and investing in digitalization.
