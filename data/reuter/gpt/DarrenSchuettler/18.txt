The Canadian Securities Regulator (CSR) has launched an investigation into Fidelity Investments' star manager, John Smith, over possible violations of securities laws.
Smith, who manages the Fidelity Global Equity Income Fund, has been accused of failing to disclose conflicts of interest and engaging in personal transactions that could harm his clients' interests.
The investigation comes as a blow to Fidelity, which is known for its strict compliance and ethical standards, and to Smith, who built his reputation as one of the best-performing fund managers in the industry.
Smith has been with Fidelity for over two decades and has managed the Global Equity Income Fund since 2006. The fund has returned an impressive average of 8.2% per year over the past five years and has attracted around $10 billion in assets.
However, the CSR alleges that Smith failed to disclose conflicts of interest related to his ownership of certain stocks that were also held in the Global Equity Income Fund.
According to the CSR's allegations, Smith also engaged in personal transactions that could have negatively affected his clients' interests. These alleged transactions involved buying and selling stocks that were also held by the Global Equity Income Fund, without proper disclosure or approval.
The CSR also alleges that Smith failed to comply with the fund's code of ethics and standards of conduct and failed to adequately supervise his team.
Fidelity has responded to the allegations, saying it takes them very seriously and is fully cooperating with the CSR's investigation.
"Fidelity has a culture of rigorous compliance and ethics, and we hold ourselves to the highest standards," the company said in a statement. "We will take appropriate action based on the findings of the investigation."
Smith has not commented on the investigation, but his lawyers have released a statement saying they are confident that he has acted in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
"We are confident that Mr. Smith has at all times acted in the best interests of his clients and in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations," the statement said. "We will vigorously defend him against these allegations."
This is not the first time that Fidelity has faced allegations of wrongdoing. In 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined Fidelity $8 million for allegedly allowing some of its traders to accept improper gifts and entertainment from brokers.
Fidelity has also been embroiled in disputes over fees and charges in recent years. In 2018, the company faced class-action lawsuits over its policy of charging high fees for mutual funds, and last year it was sued by a group of investors who alleged that it had charged them excessive fees for its 401(k) plans.
Despite these challenges, Fidelity remains one of the largest investment management firms in the world, with over $3.3 trillion in assets under management.
The outcome of the CSR's investigation into Smith is uncertain, and it is not yet clear what impact it could have on Fidelity and its clients. However, it is a reminder of the importance of transparency and compliance in the financial industry and underscores the need for investors to closely monitor their investments and the individuals who manage them.
