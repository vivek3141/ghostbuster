Bob Dylan fans around the world are up in arms over Bank of Montreal's recent use of the iconic song "The Times They Are a-Changin" in a new television commercial. The ad, which features a montage of images from different time periods, has been criticized for co-opting the song's powerful message of social change to sell banking services.
Many fans of the legendary singer-songwriter took to social media to express their outrage over the use of the song, which was written and performed by Dylan in 1964 as a rallying cry for the civil rights movement. "I can't believe they would use Bob Dylan's song to sell something so trivial," tweeted one fan. "It's an insult to his legacy and everything he stood for."
The controversy has also sparked a discussion about the ethics of using music in advertising. While it's common for companies to license popular songs for use in commercials, many argue that certain songs are too sacred to be used in this way. Dylan, who has been notoriously protective of his music, has rarely allowed his songs to be used in advertisements.
In response to the backlash, Bank of Montreal issued a statement defending their use of the song. "We believe that 'The Times They Are a-Changin' is a timeless and inspiring message that resonates with people of all ages and backgrounds," the statement read. "We wanted to use this song as a way to connect with our customers and show them that we are committed to helping them navigate the changes that come with life."
However, fans of Dylan remain unconvinced. "Using a song like that for a bank commercial is a misuse of the power of music," wrote one fan on Twitter. "It's like stealing something that doesn't belong to you."
This isn't the first time that a company has faced criticism over its use of Dylan's music. In 2007, Victoria's Secret was forced to pull a commercial that featured a lingerie-clad model dancing to Dylan's "Love Sick" after the singer objected to the use of his music in a "sexualized context."
As for Dylan himself, he has yet to comment on the controversy. The notoriously reclusive musician rarely speaks to the media, and has generally avoided commenting on his music's use in advertising. With his fans clearly divided on the issue, it remains to be seen whether he will weigh in on the Bank of Montreal's use of "The Times They Are a-Changin."
