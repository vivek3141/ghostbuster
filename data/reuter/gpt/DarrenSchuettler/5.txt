The son of NFL Hall of Fame quarterback and former U.S. Congressman Jack Kemp has found success and anonymity playing football in Canada.
Jeff Kemp, now 59, is the eldest son of Jack Kemp, who passed away in 2009. Like his father, Jeff was a quarterback and played in the NFL during the 1980s and 1990s, primarily as a backup for the Seattle Seahawks, San Francisco 49ers, and Philadelphia Eagles.
After retiring from football, Jeff pursued a career as a motivational speaker and author, specializing in subjects such as leadership, teamwork, and overcoming adversity. He also became a devout Christian and has been active in ministry work for many years.
But in recent years, Jeff has found a new passion: coaching football. Specifically, he has been working as a quarterbacks coach for the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League (CFL).
For those unfamiliar with the CFL, it is a professional league in Canada that operates from June to November, with nine teams based in cities across the country. The game is similar to American football, with a few key differences – for example, there are only three downs instead of four, and the field is wider and longer.
Jeff began his coaching career in 2004, working as an assistant coach for his alma mater, Dartmouth College. He then spent several years coaching at the high school level in California, before getting the opportunity to coach quarterbacks in the CFL.
In an interview with the Edmonton Journal, Jeff said that coaching in Canada has allowed him to reconnect with his love of football, without the pressure and scrutiny that comes with coaching at the college or professional level in the United States.
"I'm grateful for the opportunity to be back around the game," he said. "I've enjoyed being around great coaches and great athletes, and I've enjoyed the camaraderie of the team. It's just been a great blessing."
Jeff also said that he appreciates the cultural differences between Canada and the United States, and that he has enjoyed learning about Canadian society and history.
"The people of Canada are so friendly and hospitable," he said. "I've been privileged to learn a lot about their history and culture, and I've been impressed by how open-minded and tolerant they are."
As for his players, Jeff said that he loves working with them and helping them to develop their skills and knowledge of the game.
"I try to help them become better quarterbacks and better leaders," he said. "I also try to help them be good people off the field – to have integrity, humility, and a servant's heart. That's what my dad taught me, and that's what I try to instill in them."
Despite his success in Canada, Jeff remains largely unknown in the United States. But he said that he is content with his life and career, and that he feels blessed to have had the opportunities that he has had.
"I'm not seeking fame or fortune," he said. "I just want to make a difference in people's lives, and football is one way I can do that. If I can help someone become a better player or a better person, then that's all that matters."
