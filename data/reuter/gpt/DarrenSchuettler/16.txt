Rumors of a potential sale of the Montreal Canadiens franchise have been circulating in the media and among fans, causing speculation and concern. Reports have suggested that the team’s current owners, Molson Cos. Ltd., are considering selling the hockey team to an unknown buyer.
However, the company has firmly denied any such intentions and stated that they are committed to continuing their long-standing ownership of the Canadiens franchise.
In a statement released on Monday, Molson Coors Canada, the parent company of Molson Cos. Ltd., reiterated their commitment to the Montreal Canadiens, saying: “We have no intention of selling the Canadiens. We are proud of our affiliation with the team and look forward to continuing to support their success on and off the ice.”
The current ownership group, led by Geoff Molson, acquired the franchise in 2009 after a long history of family ownership. Since then, they have invested heavily in the team and the Bell Centre arena, creating a modern, state-of-the-art facility for fans to enjoy.
While some fans may be worried about the possibility of a sale, others are hopeful that new ownership could bring fresh ideas and investment to the team. However, the uncertainty around who the potential buyer may be and what their intentions might be has left many feeling uneasy.
In recent years, the Canadiens have struggled to make a deep playoff run, with their most recent Stanley Cup championship coming in 1993. However, the team has a loyal fan base and remains one of the most popular and recognizable franchises in the NHL.
In addition to their on-ice struggles, the Canadiens have also faced challenges off the ice, including declining attendance and revenue. The COVID-19 pandemic has only added to these difficulties, with the team playing in empty arenas last season and uncertain revenue streams going forward.
Despite these challenges, the Molson family appears committed to the team and their ownership of the Canadiens. In an interview with La Presse last year, Geoff Molson expressed his passion for the team and his desire to see them succeed: “We are passionate about the Canadiens, and we’re not going anywhere.”
While rumors of a potential sale may continue to circulate, for now, it seems that the Montreal Canadiens will remain under the ownership of Molson Cos. Ltd. and the Molson family. Fans can look forward to the upcoming NHL season and the continued success of one of hockey’s most iconic franchises.
