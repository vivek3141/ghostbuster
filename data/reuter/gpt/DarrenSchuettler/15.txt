Toronto stocks took a significant dive on Wednesday, ending weaker amid profit-taking after the index hit record highs earlier in the week. The moderate selloff was consistent with a pullback in global equities, including Wall Street, as investors remained cautious amid rising coronavirus cases and uncertainty over monetary stimulus from central banks.
The S&P/TSX Composite Index fell 0.5%, shedding 87 points to close below the 16,900 mark, with 8 out of its 11 major sectors finishing in the red. Energy, information technology, and materials were the biggest decliners, while consumer discretionary, utilities, and healthcare added some support to the index.
Energy stocks suffered the most as oil prices slumped after a surprise build-up in U.S. crude inventory and a much lower demand outlook from OPEC. Suncor Energy, Canadian Natural Resources, and Enbridge tumbled between 1.5% and 3.7%, overshadowing the gains of smaller firms such as Birchcliff Energy, Seven Generations Energy, and Nuvista Energy, which posted gains of up to 9%.
Information Technology stocks followed suit, dragged down by Shopify's 2.1% decline, as investors took profits after the stock soared 12% on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Constellation Software lost 1.4%, and Kinaxis gave up 1.8%, while Real Matters and CGI Group bucked the trend, surging 2.9% and 1.6%, respectively.
Elsewhere, materials edged lower, despite gold prices inching higher, as investors took a break from the recent rally in the sector. Barrick Gold and Kinross Gold retreated, down 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively, while First Majestic Silver and Yamana Gold advanced 2.6% and 1.4%.
Investors' appetite for riskier assets took flight as global equities slumped on the concern that the continued surge in COVID-19 cases worldwide could hamper the economic recovery, and the lack of progress in policies that could spark growth. Analysts predicted that the caution was likely to remain, with the risk of further downside momentum weighing on the markets.
The Toronto exchange market might still require some time to stabilize, as traders wait for cues to invest safely, the uncertainty around the pandemic, and tensions escalating in the U.S-China trade talks.
