Canada's six largest banks, often referred to as the "big six," have long held a stranglehold on the country's banking industry. However, with the rise of virtual banks, that dominance is now being challenged.
Virtual banks are entirely digital banking platforms that offer the same services as traditional banks, but with lower fees and more convenience. They are becoming increasingly popular around the world, and Canada is no exception.
The first virtual bank to launch in Canada was EQ Bank in 2016. Since then, several others have followed suit, including Tangerine, Simplii Financial, and Motive Financial. These virtual banks have attracted a large customer base by offering higher interest rates on savings accounts, lower fees, and easy accessibility through mobile apps and online platforms.
One of the biggest advantages of virtual banks is their lower fees. Many traditional banks charge maintenance fees, transaction fees, and other fees that can quickly add up. Virtual banks, on the other hand, often don't charge these fees, making them an attractive option for customers looking to save money.
In addition to lower fees, virtual banks also offer higher interest rates on savings accounts. Traditional banks typically offer interest rates well below 1%, while virtual banks often offer rates above 2%. This may not seem like a significant difference, but over time, it can add up to significant savings for customers.
Virtual banks are also more convenient than traditional banks. Customers can access their accounts anytime, anywhere through the internet or a mobile app. This makes it easy to check account balances, transfer money, and pay bills without having to visit a physical bank location.
The rise of virtual banks has not gone unnoticed by the big six banks. In response, they have started to offer their own digital banking platforms. For example, TD Bank's mobile app was ranked as the best banking app in Canada in 2020 by J.D. Power. RBC, CIBC, and BMO have also launched their own online banking platforms.
However, the big six banks have been slow to offer the same high-interest rates and lower fees that virtual banks provide. This has given virtual banks an advantage in attracting younger customers who are more tech-savvy and price-conscious.
This has led to a changing landscape in the Canadian banking industry. Virtual banks have been gaining market share, especially among millennials, who are the most significant demographic looking for alternatives to traditional banks.
According to a study by McKinsey & Company, virtual banks could capture up to 15% of the Canadian banking market by 2025, which would represent a significant shift from the current market share held by the big six banks.
The study also found that virtual banks are particularly attractive to customers who are dissatisfied with their current banking provider. This dissatisfaction may be due to high fees, low-interest rates, or poor customer service.
This is not to say that virtual banks are perfect. One of the biggest drawbacks of virtual banks is the lack of physical presence. Many customers still prefer to speak to someone in person when they have a question or problem, something that virtual banks can't offer.
Virtual banks also do not offer the same range of services as traditional banks. For example, they may not offer mortgages or credit cards. This may limit their appeal to some customers who prefer to have all their financial services in one place.
However, despite these drawbacks, the popularity of virtual banks is likely to continue to grow. With their emphasis on low fees, high-interest rates, and convenience, virtual banks are well-positioned to capture market share from the big six banks.
This shift in the Canadian banking industry is part of a broader trend seen around the world. Virtual banks have been growing in popularity in other countries, such as the United States and Australia, where they have already captured a significant market share.
In the United States, virtual banks such as Chime and Ally Bank have grown rapidly in recent years. Chime, which was founded in 2013, now has over six million customers and is valued at over $14 billion.
In Australia, virtual banks such as Up Bank and 86 400 have attracted significant attention for their innovative products and services. Up Bank, for example, offers a range of unique features, such as the ability to track spending in real-time and set savings goals.
As virtual banks continue to grow in Canada, it will be interesting to see how the big six banks respond. Will they start offering higher interest rates and lower fees to compete? Or will they continue to rely on their established brand names and physical branches?
Whatever happens, one thing is clear: the rise of virtual banks is challenging the dominance of the big six banks and changing the face of the Canadian banking industry. As customers become more aware of the benefits of virtual banks, it's likely that the trend will only continue to grow in the coming years.
