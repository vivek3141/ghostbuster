Reports of a consortium bid for the Montreal Canadiens have been making headlines in recent days, sparking rumours that the team's owner, Geoff Molson, is looking to sell the franchise. However, Molson has come out to deny these rumours, stating that he has no intentions of selling the Canadiens.
In a statement released on Thursday, Molson confirmed that he had received an offer from a consortium of investors, but he stressed that he was not interested in selling the team. "There have been rumours circulating in the media about a possible sale of the Montreal Canadiens," Molson said. "I want to be clear that these rumours are false. I have no intention of selling the team at this time, or in the foreseeable future."
Molson's statement comes after reports surfaced earlier this week that a group of investors was preparing to make a bid for the Canadiens. The group, which includes former players and business executives, is said to be interested in acquiring the team, which is currently valued at around $1.3 billion.
Despite Molson's denial, the rumours of a possible sale have continued to circulate, with some speculating that he may be considering the offer from the consortium. However, Molson's statement appears to put an end to these rumours, at least for now.
The Montreal Canadiens are one of the most storied and successful franchises in all of professional sports, with a history stretching back over a century. The team has won 24 Stanley Cup championships, more than any other team in NHL history.
The current season has been a challenging one for the Canadiens, who have struggled to find consistency on the ice. However, the team remains a valuable asset, with a loyal fan base and a reputation as one of the most iconic franchises in all of sports.
For now, it appears that Molson is committed to keeping the Canadiens under his ownership, and fans can rest assured that the team will continue to call Montreal home for the foreseeable future. As Molson stated in his statement, "I am fully committed to the Montreal Canadiens and to continuing to build this great franchise into the future."
