Ford Motor Co. has announced that two of its top executives Todd Eckert and Joy Falotico will be promoted to contend for the top spot at the company. The announcement comes after current CEO Alex Trotman announced his retirement plans earlier this year.
Eckert, who is currently the Ford's marketing chief, will be promoted to be in charge of U.S. sales, service and Parts. Falotico, currently the companyâ€™s chief marketing officer, will take over as group vice president and chief marketing officer. The two executives will join other members of Ford's Office of the Chairman, including Trotman, to help oversee the company.
"Both of these experienced executives have proven track records of helping Ford navigate through challenging times, and they are the right people to take Ford forward," said Trotman in a statement.
Eckert is a nine-year Ford veteran who has led the company's marketing efforts as it's attempted to revamp sales strategy and embrace new technologies including electric vehicles and self-driving cars. Eckert joined the company in 2012 as Ford's director of truck and SUV marketing and has led the launch of the new Ford Explorer.
Falotico is an eight-year Ford veteran who has led the company's global marketing efforts as well as its luxury Lincoln brand. In that role, Falotico has overseen the launch of several new Lincoln models and has been credited with helping to bring the brand back from the brink of extinction.
The promotions come at a time when Ford is struggling to regain its footing in a rapidly changing automotive industry. The company has been hit hard by the global pandemic, which forced it to shut down plants and close dealerships. Additionally, Ford has struggled to keep up with the fast-paced developments in electric vehicles and self-driving technology, which many experts believe will be the future of the automobile industry.
Ford has also come under fire in recent years for its slow progress on issues of diversity and inclusion. Several high-profile incidents have highlighted the challenges faced by the company in an industry that has traditionally been dominated by white men.
In response to these challenges, Ford has launched a number of initiatives aimed at boosting its competitiveness and addressing social and environmental concerns. The company has launched a new line of electric vehicles and pledged to invest heavily in renewable energy. Ford has also made a commitment to diversity and inclusion, including a new program aimed at increasing the number of women and people of color in leadership roles.
The promotions of Eckert and Falotico are seen as a positive step for the company, as both executives have demonstrated a strong commitment to innovation, sustainability, and diversity. The promotions also signal a strategic shift for the company as it seeks to adapt to the changing automotive landscape.
"The auto industry is evolving rapidly, and we need to be able to adapt quickly," said Eckert. "I'm excited to take on this new role and help lead Ford into the future."
Falotico echoed those sentiments, saying, "This is a critical time for Ford, and I'm honored to have the opportunity to help lead the company forward. I believe that by staying true to our values and continuing to embrace innovation, we can succeed in this rapidly changing industry."
As Eckert and Falotico prepare to take on their new roles, all eyes will be on them as they work to steer Ford through uncertain times and position the company for long-term success. With many challenges ahead, the two executives will need to draw upon all their skills and experience to navigate the changing terrain of the automotive industry and ensure that Ford remains competitive in the years to come.
