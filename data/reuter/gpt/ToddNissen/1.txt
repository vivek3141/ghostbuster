Ford Motor Co. has announced the promotion of two of its top executives as part of the race to find a successor for the current CEO, Jim Hackett. Kumar Galhotra and Jim Farley have been promoted to new positions within the company's leadership team, bringing them one step closer to fulfilling their aspirations of becoming the next CEO.
Galhotra, who currently serves as president of Ford North America, has been elevated to the position of president of global markets. Farley, who is currently the executive vice president and president of global markets, has been promoted to chief operating officer.
In a statement, Hackett praised Galhotra as "a proven leader who has played a key role in our global product and business transformation." He also described Farley as "an incredible leader with a deep understanding of our business and tremendous foresight about where we are headed."
The promotions come as Ford faces a period of transformation under Hackett's leadership. The company has been working to streamline its operations, cut costs, and invest in new technologies as part of a broader effort to remain competitive in a rapidly changing automotive landscape.
At the same time, there has been speculation about who will take over as CEO when Hackett steps down. Galhotra and Farley have both been mentioned as potential candidates, along with a number of other executives within the company.
However, Ford has not yet announced a timeline for Hackett's departure or provided any details about the CEO succession process. In a recent interview with Automotive News, Hackett emphasized that he is focused on steering Ford through its current challenges and preparing the company for the future.
"I'm not in any hurry to do anything other than make sure that this transition happens smoothly and that we have the right person in place," he said.
Galhotra and Farley, for their part, both expressed excitement about their new roles within the company.
"I'm honored to lead our global markets team and build on the progress we've made around the world," Galhotra said.
Farley added: "Ford is a great company with incredible people and products, and I'm excited to help lead us into the future."
Industry analysts say that the promotions of Galhotra and Farley indicate that Ford is taking its succession planning seriously and is preparing for a smooth transition when the time comes.
"Ford is making a statement that they have a deep bench of talent and are committed to grooming their future leaders," said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with Cox Automotive.
As Ford continues to navigate a challenging automotive landscape, the promotion of Galhotra and Farley is seen as a vote of confidence in their abilities and a sign of the company's commitment to its long-term success.
