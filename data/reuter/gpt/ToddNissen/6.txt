Ford Motor Company announced its third-quarter results on Thursday, October 28, 2021, revealing a profit that almost doubled from last year. The American multinational automaker reported a net profit of $1.93 billion, up from $986 million in the same period last year, boosted by strong demand for its trucks and SUVs in North America and China.
Despite this positive development, Ford's European operations posted a loss of $426 million, a cause for concern among analysts. The region has long been a weak spot for the company, which said it is taking steps to address the issue.
"We delivered a strong quarter, led by continued strong demand for our industry-leading trucks and SUVs," said Ford Chief Financial Officer John Lawler in a statement. "Despite semiconductor supply constraints, we've been able to continue to operate our plants efficiently and deliver vehicles to customers."
In North America, Ford's largest market, the company saw a 20% increase in revenue, primarily driven by strong sales of its F-150 pickup truck. Similarly, in China, its second-largest market, Ford's revenue surged by 40%, driven by its success in the SUV segment.
However, the automotive industry continues to face supply chain challenges caused by a global semiconductor shortage, resulting in production cuts and delays. Ford lowered its production forecast for the fourth quarter due to the chip supply constraint, signaling that the industry is unlikely to get out of the woods in the short term.
The supply chain crunch has also led to rising prices of new cars and used cars, creating inflationary pressures. Ford's average transaction price per vehicle increased by nearly $4,000 to a record $49,400 in the third quarter, a development that partly offset the ongoing production challenges.
Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company expects to face continued volatility and uncertainty in the short term but is confident in its long-term strategy.
"The pandemic is far from over, and the supply chain challenges are far from over," Farley said during a conference call. "But we believe that we're building a better Ford, a Ford that's fit, a Ford that's ready to grow and compete."
Ford is in the midst of a major restructuring under Farley, who took over the company's helm last year. The CEO has focused on streamlining Ford's operations, improving its profitability, and investing in electric and autonomous vehicles to compete with the likes of Tesla Inc. and General Motors Co.
The automaker has pledged to spend $30 billion on electric vehicles through 2025, with plans to have 40% of its vehicle volume electric by 2030. Ford recently launched its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck, which has received an overwhelming response from consumers and is expected to hit showrooms next year.
Ford is also investing in autonomous driving technology and partnerships with tech companies to expand its revenue streams beyond traditional car sales. The company has struck a deal with Alphabet Inc.'s self-driving subsidiary Waymo to develop self-driving commercial vehicles.
Despite Ford's positive developments, such as its electric-vehicle push and the growth of its truck and SUV segments in North America and China, analysts remain wary of the company's European losses, which they say are a persistent issue.
"It's always been a weak spot, and it's been difficult for Ford to make a turnaround in Europe," said Matt DeLorenzo, senior managing editor at Kelley Blue Book. "The company is taking steps to address it, but it remains a headwind."
Ford said it is continuing to focus on its European turnaround plan, which includes cost cuts, better capital allocation, and launching new EVs, such as the Mustang Mach-E and the all-electric Transit van.
The company's shares closed down nearly 3% on the day of the earnings release, reflecting some investor unease over the European losses. However, despite these challenges, Ford's leadership remains bullish about the future and its ability to compete in the rapidly evolving automotive industry.
"We're focused on what we have control over, and that's our transformation and our business plan," Farley said. "We have a great plan, and we're executing it, and I think people are starting to see that."
