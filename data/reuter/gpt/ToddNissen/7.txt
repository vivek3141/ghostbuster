Detroit, MI - Ford Motor Company announced on Tuesday that it had experienced a significant rise in profits in the second quarter of 2021, thanks to high sales of pickup trucks and SUVs in the United States.
The automaker revealed that its revenue in the quarter had increased 38% from a year earlier, to $26.8 billion. Meanwhile, net income went up to $561 million, from $148 million in the same period last year.
According to executives from Ford, the success was due to robust demand for its F-Series trucks and Bronco sport-utility vehicle.
"Customers continue to embrace our all-new products, whether it's the F-150, Bronco Sport or Mustang Mach-E," said Jim Farley, the company's CEO. "It's clear Ford is gaining momentum and delivering great value."
The surge in demand for trucks and SUVs reflected the broader trend in the US auto market. These large vehicles have become increasingly popular as low gas prices and an improving economy continue to drive sales of larger, more expensive cars.
However, the good news was overshadowed by significant losses in Ford's European operations. The company reported that its European division had lost $569 million in the quarter, nearly double the amount it lost a year earlier.
Ford's European business has been struggling for years, as it has been hampered by high costs and declining sales. This has led some analysts to question whether Ford can continue to compete effectively in a market where it has struggled to gain traction.
"The results in Europe were disappointing and raise concerns about the company's long-term viability in the region," said Morningstar analyst David Whiston. "Ford needs to find a way to reduce costs and increase efficiency if it wants to stay competitive."
Ford's executives acknowledged the challenges, but remain optimistic about the future. They said that while the losses in Europe were significant, they were offset by strong performances in other regions, including North America and Asia.
"The European market remains challenging, but we're making progress, and we're committed to delivering sustainable profitability there," said Farley.
One area where Ford sees potential for growth is in electric vehicles. The company is currently investing heavily in EV technology and plans to launch several new electric models in the coming years.
Earlier this year, Ford unveiled its new Mustang Mach-E electric crossover, which has received positive reviews from both customers and critics. The company hopes the Mach-E will help to shift public perceptions of EVs as being slow and boring to drive, and instead make them more appealing to a wider audience.
"We see electric as a huge opportunity for us, and we're investing to win," Farley said. "We've got a lot of great new products coming, and we're confident that they will help us continue to grow and succeed in the years ahead."
Overall, analysts say that despite the losses in Europe, Ford's strong performance in other markets, coupled with its commitment to EVs, bodes well for its future.
"They're facing some headwinds, but Ford has a lot of strengths that should help them weather the storm," said Whiston. "They've got a great brand, a loyal customer base, and a lot of new technology in the pipeline. With the right strategy and execution, I think they can continue to thrive."
