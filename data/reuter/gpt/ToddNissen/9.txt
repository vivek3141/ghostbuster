General Motors will idle its Lordstown plant for two weeks due to the Canadian autoworker strike that has affected the supply of crucial components for the Chevrolet Cruze. The Lordstown plant in Ohio produces the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, which has been affected by the ongoing strike at the Ontario-based parts supplier, Lear Corporation.
The strike has been going on for three weeks, with workers demanding better wages, job security, and a more secure pension plan. Lear Corporation, which supplies seats for GM vehicles, has also been affected, leading to disruptions in production at several GM plants in North America.
GM spokesman Dan Flores has confirmed that the company will halt production at the Lordstown plant for two weeks from October 7, which will affect about 1,400 workers at the facility. While the workers will be paid during the downtime, the halt in production has raised concerns about the impact on the local economy and industry.
The Lordstown plant has been one of GM’s most productive facilities, with over 32,000 Cruzes manufactured at the facility in the first half of the year. According to data from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, the plant accounted for nearly 15% of all manufacturing employment in the Youngstown Metropolitan Area in 2018.
The impact of the Canadian autoworker strike on the American auto industry has been significant, with several manufacturing facilities in the US also being affected. Andy Harless, an economist at the consulting firm, Andrew Harless Economic Consulting, has raised concerns about the effects of the strike on the US economy.
“GM’s decision to idle its Lordstown plant for two weeks is a sign of the growing impact of the Canadian autoworker strike on the American auto industry. It is important to remember that the auto industry is a significant contributor to the US economy, and any disruptions to its supply chain can have ripple effects throughout the economy,” Harless said.
The strike is now in its third week, with no signs of immediate resolution. However, both Lear Corporation and the Canadian union represent the workers have expressed their willingness to return to the negotiating table to resolve the issue. The impact of the strike on the auto industry, however, is expected to continue in the coming weeks.
