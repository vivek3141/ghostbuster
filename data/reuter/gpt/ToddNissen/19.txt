Detroit, Michigan - Ford Motor Company announced on Wednesday the launch of a groundbreaking new Computer-Aided Design (CAD) project aimed at cutting prototype costs by half. The project will allow Ford engineers to create and test digital prototypes in a virtual environment, reducing the need for physical prototypes.
This new CAD project is a remarkable achievement in the automotive industry, as it will significantly decrease development time and costs for Ford. The company expects to save billions in development costs by using virtual prototypes and eliminating the need to create physical models.
The new software employs machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies, which helps designers to quickly create and modify designs based on data analytics. This enhances the efficiency of the design process and allows for more complex designs to be created, tested, and optimized before a physical model is ever created.
The company has been employing computer-aided design (CAD) technology for decades, but this new project represents a significant advancement in the use of artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies. With this new system, designers can work collaboratively in a virtual environment, allowing for faster and more efficient innovations.
“The launch of this new CAD project is a game-changer for Ford,” said Jim Farley, Ford Motor Company CEO. “By utilizing the most advanced technologies available today, we’re able to create and test virtual prototypes of our designs much quicker than ever before. This new process will enable us to bring new products to market faster and at lower costs, providing significant benefits for our customers.”
The project has been in development for nearly four years, and the company has invested heavily in developing the digital tools and the technology required for the project. Ford has collaborated with leading software development companies to create the most advanced CAD system in the industry.
The new CAD project will be implemented across all of Ford’s global operations, including in North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. The company says that this project will transform the way it develops products, making it faster, more efficient and will allow it to produce better products.
“This is a significant milestone for Ford and an exciting development for the industry as a whole,” said Sheryl Connelly, Ford’s Chief Futurist. “The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies is transforming the way we think about design, and this project creates new opportunities for us to innovate and deliver more value to our customers.”
As the automotive industry continues to evolve, Ford is setting the standard for innovation. Through this new CAD project, the company is leading the way in the development of new technologies that will enable it to continue delivering high-quality products to customers worldwide.
