The CEO of ITT Automotive Inc, Richard Calore, made a contentious announcement at the company's annual shareholder meeting. He stated that the company is planning to pay its workers less than $10 an hour by 2000. This move is part of the company's cost-cutting measures, as it struggles to remain profitable in an increasingly competitive market.
The announcement was met with shock and anger from the company's employees and union representatives. Many of them expressed concern that such a low wage could jeopardize the livelihoods of ITT Automotive's workers. They argue that a lower wage could lead to a reduced quality of life for their families, and that it sets a dangerous precedent for other companies to follow.
One union representative was quoted as saying, "This is unacceptable. The workers at ITT Automotive deserve fair compensation for their hard work. We will fight tooth and nail to make sure that they receive a living wage."
Calore defended the decision, stating that the company could not maintain its current wage structure and remain competitive in the market. He added that the company was committed to providing competitive benefits packages to its employees, including healthcare and retirement plans.
The announcement comes as ITT Automotive faces stiff competition from other automotive suppliers, both domestic and foreign. The company has seen its profits decline in recent years as a result of these challenges. In response, ITT Automotive has been implementing a series of cost-cutting measures aimed at improving its bottom line.
Some experts have expressed concern that a wage reduction could have a negative impact on the company's overall operations. They argue that a lower wage could lead to reduced morale and productivity among workers, resulting in decreased quality and consistency in the company's products.
Others, however, have praised ITT Automotive's decision, arguing that it is a necessary step in order to remain competitive in a global market. "This is just the reality of the situation," said one industry analyst. "If you want to succeed in this business, you have to make tough decisions and cut costs where you can."
As of now, it is unclear how ITT Automotive's workers and union representatives will respond to the company's announcement. However, the announcement has certainly generated significant controversy, and it remains to be seen how it will impact the company's operations going forward.
