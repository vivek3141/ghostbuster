Ford Motor Co. announced on Monday that it has promoted two of its executives in the race to succeed CEO Alex Trotman upon his retirement next year. The two executives, Louis Ross and Anne Stevens, have been appointed as group vice presidents and will have expanded responsibilities within the company.
Louis Ross, currently the president of Ford Credit, will take on the role of group vice president of North America Marketing, Sales and Service. In his new role, Ross will oversee Ford's efforts to improve sales and market share in North America, including the launch of new products and innovations in customer service.
Anne Stevens, currently the executive vice president of Ford's automotive operations in Europe, will become group vice president of North America Vehicle Operations. In this role, Stevens will be responsible for all aspects of North American vehicle manufacturing, from engineering to production.
The promotions come as Ford looks to position itself for success in an increasingly competitive global market. Under Trotman's leadership, the company has made significant strides in improving its financial performance and expanding into new markets. However, the company faces a number of challenges, including mounting competition from foreign automakers, changing consumer preferences, and regulatory pressures related to environmental concerns.
In a statement announcing the promotions, Trotman praised both Ross and Stevens for their dedication and proven track records of success within the company. "I have worked closely with both Louis and Anne for many years, and I am confident that they have the skills and experience necessary to help lead Ford to continued success in the years ahead," Trotman said.
The promotions also highlight the ongoing race to succeed Trotman, who is scheduled to retire next year. While Ford has not yet announced an official successor to Trotman, insiders say that both Ross and Stevens are considered top candidates for the position.
Ross, who has been with Ford for over 30 years, has held a variety of leadership positions within the company, including serving as the president of Ford Mexico and leading the company's global marketing efforts. Stevens, who joined Ford in 1992, has held senior leadership roles in both Europe and North America, including leading the successful turnaround of Ford's European operations in the early 2000s.
Whoever succeeds Trotman will inherit a company that is still largely dependent on the North American market, despite recent efforts to expand into new regions. While Ford has made significant investments in electric and autonomous vehicle technology, it remains to be seen whether these efforts will be enough to stay competitive over the long term.
In recent years, Ford has faced criticism from some investors who believe that the company has been slow to adapt to changing market conditions. However, the company remains optimistic about its future prospects and has vowed to continue investing in new technologies and expanding into new markets.
"With Louis and Anne on board, we are well positioned to tackle the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead," Trotman said. "I am confident that our team has what it takes to build a stronger, more innovative Ford for the future."
