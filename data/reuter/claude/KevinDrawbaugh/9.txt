United Airlines Orders 51 New Airliners Valued at $4.4 Billion From Boeing and Airbus - European Consortium Scores Big Victory Over Rival Boeing 

United Airlines announced today its largest aircraft order since 2006. The airline will purchase 51 new airliners valued at $4.4 billion from Boeing and Airbus, with most of the order going to the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.

The order includes 25 Airbus A321XLR aircraft, a new longer-range version of the A321 that is set to debut in 2023. United also ordered 26 Boeing 737 MAX jets, with an option to purchase up to 100 more. However, the larger portion of the order in both dollar value and number of aircraft went to Airbus, dealing a blow to U.S.-based Boeing. 

The new aircraft will allow United to expand its domestic and international route network starting in 2023, including opening new routes to Europe from East Coast cities. The A321XLR in particular will allow nonstop flights to smaller European cities that currently require connections. United did not specify which routes the new aircraft would serve, pending government approval.

For Airbus, the deal represents its largest ever aircraft sale to United and one of the largest for its popular A320 single-aisle jet. The European plane maker has been aggressively marketing the new A321XLR to U.S. carriers and beating out Boeing for key orders over the last year, taking advantage of Boeing's 737 MAX crisis. Boeing's flagship single-aisle jet was grounded in March 2019 following two fatal crashes, causing airlines to look to Airbus as an alternative.

United Chief Executive Oscar Munoz said the new jets "will allow us to continue improving our operational reliability, the customer experience, and our environmental footprint." The airline has been upgrading its fleet with more efficient aircraft in an effort to boost profitability and meet sustainability goals.

The Boeing 737 MAX aircraft ordered are part of United's previous deal with Boeing and will not contribute any new money to the company. However, the new order for 25 A321XLR jets is worth approximately $3 billion at list price, though large customers like United typically negotiate significant discounts. Airbus could potentially turn more of these options into firm orders from United over the coming years, posing further competition for Boeing.

In total, United now has more than 250 aircraft on order from Boeing and Airbus, including 50 Airbus A350s and 40 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. The airline plans to take delivery of about 60 new aircraft from the manufacturers every year through 2022 to renew its fleet.
