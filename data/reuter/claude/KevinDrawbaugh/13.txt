Eli Lilly & Co's Third-Quarter Profits Expected to Rise, but Concerns Over Profit Margins Remain  

Eli Lilly & Co is expected to report higher third-quarter profits and revenue when the company announces earnings on Tuesday, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. However, concerns remain over narrowing profit margins for the pharmaceutical giant.

Lilly is forecast to post a 12% increase in earnings per share to $1.55 and a 7.3% rise in revenue to $5.43 billion, compared with the same quarter last year. Overall, Lilly has exceeded analysts’ earnings expectations for nine consecutive quarters. The company’s share price is up 18% so far this year, outperforming the S&P 500.

The expected earnings growth is fueled primarily by higher sales of new products, including the diabetes drugs Jardiance and Trulicity as well as the cancer treatment Verzenio. Trulicity has been Lilly's fastest-growing product and sales rose over 50% last quarter compared to a year earlier. However, revenue from some of Lilly’s older blockbuster drugs like Cialis and Forteo declined due to loss of patent exclusivity and competition from generic alternatives.

While Lilly’s top-line results have been solid, profit margins have been under pressure due to higher costs. The company has invested heavily in research and development to restock its product pipeline as well as in marketing and promotions to drive sales of new drugs. Lilly’s operating margin declined to 21% last quarter from 24% a year ago.

Looking ahead, Lilly aims to launch 20 new products between 2018 and 2023 to drive future growth. "We remain confident in our long-term outlook,” said Chief Executive David Ricks in Lilly’s second-quarter earnings call. However, the cost to develop new drugs and gain regulatory approval remains extremely high and uncertain.

Lilly faces numerous near-term challenges, including patent expirations, pricing pressures in the U.S. market, and competitive threats from rival drugmakers. While Lilly’s innovation-driven growth strategy has started to pay off, investors will be closely monitoring the company’s margins and pipeline progress to ensure sustainable momentum in the coming quarters.
