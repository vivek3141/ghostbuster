Interest in Subprime Auto Lender Olympic Financial Sparks Acquisition Speculation 

Shares of Olympic Financial Group, a specialty finance company focused on subprime auto loans, rose nearly 15% Tuesday amid speculation of a potential acquisition. The company has caught the eye of several private equity firms and financial institutions looking to gain a foothold in the fast-growing subprime auto lending market, according to people familiar with the matter.

Founded in 2003, Olympic Financial provides auto financing to borrowers with poor credit scores and limited credit histories who struggle to qualify for traditional auto loans. The Dallas-based company has more than $2 billion in assets and is on track to originate over $1.5 billion in new subprime auto loans this year, up nearly 25% from 2020. 

Subprime auto lending has boomed over the last decade, driven by record long auto loan terms, strong used car sales, and demand from lenders eager to generate high-interest income. While the space was hit hard by the financial crisis of 2008, lenders have returned in force, with less stringent underwriting standards. Some economists worry the market is overheating again and delinquency rates are on the rise.

However, Olympic Financial has outperformed its peers, keeping delinquency and default rates well below the industry average by utilizing state-of-the-art risk analytics systems and focusing on higher-quality subprime borrowers. The company's balance sheet and impressive growth has positioned it as an attractive takeover target for private equity firms and large banks, according to analysts.

“Olympic Financial is a prime example of a prudently run subprime auto lender,” said Mark Levinson, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service. “Its management team, underwriting, and servicing capabilities would be highly valuable to potential acquirers looking to enter the space.”

Representatives for Olympic Financial declined to comment on speculation regarding a potential sale or merger. Industry sources said the company may seek an acquisition price of up to $3 billion given its recent growth and financial performance. An offer of that size would make Olympic Financial one of the largest subprime auto lending acquisitions in recent years.

The sharp rise in Olympic Financial's shares Tuesday signaled investors are betting an acquisition is imminent, though interest from buyers is preliminary and there is no guarantee of a deal, sources said. Any transaction would be closely scrutinized by regulators given the Biden administration's focus on reining in predatory lending practices.
