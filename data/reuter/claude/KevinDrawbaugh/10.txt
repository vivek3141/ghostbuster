United Airlines Orders $4.4 Billion Worth of Planes from Boeing and Airbus for Fleet Update Program 

United Airlines announced today that it has placed firm orders for 25 new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus as part of a multi-year fleet update program. The orders are valued at $4.4 billion at list prices.

United will purchase 15 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, the latest iteration of Boeing's popular narrow-body jet. The 737 MAX will feature upgraded engines and aerodynamics to improve fuel efficiency by 14% compared to older 737 models. United also ordered 10 Airbus A321neo aircraft, the largest model in Airbus’s A320neo family. Like the 737 MAX, the A321neo will provide improved fuel economy and range thanks to new engine options and aerodynamic enhancements.  

The new Boeing and Airbus aircraft will replace older, less fuel-efficient planes in United's fleet, including Boeing 757-200s and Boeing 767-300s. The airline expects to take delivery of the new aircraft between 2024 and 2026. The fleet update program aims to improve operational efficiency, lower costs, and meet sustainability goals.

"These new aircraft will provide United's customers more premium seats in a smaller cabin, upgraded lighting, larger overhead bins and a stylish interior with the latest bellwether technology," said Andrew Nocella, United's chief commercial officer. "Additionally, the 737 MAX and A321neo aircraft provide innovative efficiency, allowing us to balance our environmental sustainability goals with expanding connectivity for our customers."

United plans to continue overhauling its fleet in the coming years, expecting to take delivery of more than 100 new narrow-body jets by the end of 2022. The airline currently operates a mix of 4,291 airplanes from Boeing and Airbus, with an average fleet age of 14.9 years. Updating its fleet with more modern aircraft is a key plank in United's strategy to gain a competitive advantage through improved customer experience and lower costs.
