Greenway Partners Buys 8.5% Stake in Outboard Marine Corp for Nearly $30 Million

Greenway Partners, a private equity firm focused on investments in the transportation and logistics sectors, announced today that it has acquired an 8.5% stake in Outboard Marine Corporation for $29.8 million. Outboard Marine Corp, based in Waukegan, Illinois, is the world's largest manufacturer of outboard motors for recreational powerboats. 

The investment by Greenway Partners values Outboard Marine at over $350 million. Outboard Marine's share price rose over 7% on news of the announcement. In a statement, Mark Thompson, Managing Partner of Greenway Partners, said "We believe Outboard Marine is poised for strong growth in the years ahead, driven by product innovation, international expansion, and strategic acquisitions. Our investment reflects our long-term confidence in the company and its management team."

Outboard Marine generates over $2 billion in annual revenue and employs nearly 5,000 people worldwide. While the U.S. remains its largest market, the company has been expanding aggressively in Asia, Latin America, and Europe. Its flagship brands include Evinrude, loved by recreational boaters worldwide for its power and performance, and Marine Power, a more value-oriented brand aimed at cost-conscious consumers in emerging markets. 

The U.S. recreational boating industry has recovered strongly from the financial crisis of 2008, buoyed by rising consumer confidence and discretionary spending. Unit sales of powerboats are up over 30% from 2015 levels. Outboard motors, in particular, have benefited from innovations like quieter and more fuel-efficient four-stroke engines, as well as from the trend toward larger, more powerful boats.

Outboard Marine intends to use the proceeds from the investment by Greenway Partners to pay down debt and fund new product development. According to CEO Brian Hartline, "This investment is a vote of confidence in our strategy and future direction. With the support of partners like Greenway, we will continue to strengthen our leadership position in the outboard motor market and deliver greater value to our customers and shareholders."

The transaction is expected to close within 60 days pending regulatory approvals. Greenway Partners was advised on the deal by Morgan Stanley and law firm Wilson & Parker. Outboard Marine was advised by Goldman Sachs and law firm Landau & Glidden.
