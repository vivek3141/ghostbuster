St. Jude Medical Inc's Third-Quarter Profits Held Back by Missed Heart Valve Sale to Iran and Other Factors

Medical device maker St. Jude Medical Inc reported lower third-quarter profits on Wednesday due to a combination of factors, including the loss of an expected sale of heart valves to Iran. The company said profits fell by 12% to $329 million, or $1.06 per share, down from $373 million, or $1.21 per share, in the same period last year. 

Revenue also declined by 3% to $1.33 billion from $1.37 billion a year ago. St. Jude Medical attributed the weaker results to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, a one-time charge related to job cuts, and lower sales of heart valves. The company had expected to sell $25 million worth of heart valves to Iran during the quarter but had to cancel the sale due to ongoing geopolitical tensions and reimposed U.S. sanctions.

Excluding one-time items, St. Jude Medical's profits fell short of analysts' expectations of $1.09 per share. The revenue also missed forecasts of $1.37 billion. St. Jude Medical lowered its full-year revenue and earnings guidance, citing the delayed sale to Iran as well as broader industry pressures.

"We had a challenging quarter with several unforeseen headwinds, including missing a sizable heart valve tender in Iran, lower market growth in some areas like Asia, and unfavorable currency fluctuations,” said CEO Mark Tollstrup. “Looking ahead, we remain focused on our key growth drivers while managing our expenses judiciously."

The weaker results and disappointing outlook sent St. Jude Medical's shares down over 6% in after-hours trading. The stock had already declined more than 13% in 2019 amid increasing competitive pressures and slowing sales growth. St. Jude Medical is battling rivals like Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences in the market for devices to treat heart disease and other medical conditions.

The company is looking to revive sales through new product launches, including a stemless shoulder replacement system and an advanced pacemaker. However, turnarounds often take time, and there are concerns over how quickly St. Jude can offset the loss of high-margin sales like the cancelled Iran valve deal. The company faces an uncertain outlook for the rest of 2019 and beyond.
