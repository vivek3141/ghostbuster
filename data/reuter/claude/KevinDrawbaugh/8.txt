Guidant Corp's Lower Than Expected Sales Growth Rate Impacts NYSE Shares 

Guidant Corp, a maker of implantable heart devices, announced third quarter sales figures today that disappointed investors and analysts. The company reported sales of $1.12 billion, a 4% increase from the same quarter last year. However, analysts had expected the company to report sales growth of 7-8% based on strong sales of Guidant's implantable defibrillators in recent months.  

The sales figures caused Guidant's stock price to drop over 12% in trading on the New York Stock Exchange today as investors reacted to the slower than expected growth. Guidant shares fell $9.53 to close at $68.47. The drop in share price wiped out over $2.5 billion in market capitalization for the company.

In a conference call, Guidant executives cited a slower quarter for sales of their defibrillators, which are used to detect and correct abnormal heart rhythms, as the main reason for the sales shortfall.  Paul LaViolette, Guidant's Chief Operating Officer, noted that “Defibrillator sales grew 2% this quarter compared to 15-20% growth in recent quarters. While we still see strong growth in this business long-term, this quarter we faced staffing shortages for our sales team and some hospital budget constraints that impacted our results.”

The slowing sales growth comes at a difficult time for Guidant, as the company faces patent expirations on some of its heart devices and increasing competition from rivals like Medtronic and St. Jude Medical. To reinvigorate sales growth, Guidant plans to launch several new products over the next year, including a new version of its Contak Renewal defibrillator. However, analysts are concerned that increasing competition may put pressure on prices and margins for these devices.

In a research note, Morgan Stanley analyst Heidi Therrien wrote, “Guidant’s depressed third quarter sales demonstrate the challenges of sustaining growth in the cardiac device market. New product launches should help re- accelerate growth, but competition will likely keep pricing under control. We are reducing our target price to $75 and revising down our sales and earnings forecasts for 2003 and 2004.”

The sales stumble this quarter shows that Guidant faces significant challenges to achieve the consistent high growth that its shareholders have come to expect. Guidant management has their work cut out for them as they attempt to rev up sales and protect profit margins in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Investors will be watching closely to see if new product releases and a reinvigorated sales effort can put Guidant back on track for stronger performance.
