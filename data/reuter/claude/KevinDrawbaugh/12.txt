U.S. Hospital Management and Nursing Home Companies Face Mixed Results in Third Quarter Amid Wave of Consolidation 

The major U.S. for-profit hospital management and nursing home companies reported mixed financial results in the third quarter of this year, as the sector continues to consolidate through mergers and acquisitions. Revenue and profit growth were uneven across the publicly traded companies that own and operate hospitals, nursing homes, and other healthcare facilities.

The largest company, HCA Healthcare, reported a 6% increase in revenue to $11.2 billion, driven by higher admissions of patients to its 179 hospitals and 119 freestanding surgery centers. However, HCA's net income declined 3% to $612 million. The company has acquired several regional hospital groups this year and is still integrating those facilities into its national network.

Tenet Healthcare, which owns 60 acute care hospitals and over 500 outpatient centers, saw revenue decrease 1% to $4.6 billion due to a drop in higher-margin surgical cases. Tenet's net loss widened to $230 million compared to $88 million in the same quarter last year. Tenet has been selling or closing underperforming hospitals to pay down debt and focus on its more profitable markets. 

Community Health Systems, with 92 hospitals across 16 states, reported a net loss of $274 million on revenue of $3.4 billion. Revenue declined in part due to the company's ongoing divestiture of hospitals outside its target markets. CHS reduced its massive long-term debt by $300 million through hospital sales and continues to cut costs through staff reductions and operational efficiencies.

In contrast, some nursing home operators including Genesis Healthcare and The Ensign Group delivered revenue and earnings growth. Demand for nursing home beds and rehabilitation care remains steady as the U.S. population ages. Genesis, which operates over 400 skilled nursing facilities and senior living communities, grew revenue 4% to $1.7 billion and improved net income to $17.4 million.  

The varied results reflect the challenges facing for-profit hospital and nursing home chains, including political and regulatory uncertainty, a shortage of nurses and doctors, and pressures to reduce medical costs. Going forward, further consolidation is expected among regional and mid-size companies seeking scale and greater pricing power with private and government payers. The major public companies will continue acquiring competitors and divesting of non-core operations to boost profit margins.
