Heartport Inc. Ahead of Schedule with New Heart Surgery Technology, Possible Profit in 1998 

Heartport Inc., a medical device company based in Redwood City, California, announced today that it is ahead of schedule in the development of its new minimally invasive heart surgery technology. The company’s flagship product, the Port-Access system, allows surgeons to perform coronary artery bypass surgery through several small incisions rather than the traditional open-heart procedure that requires cutting through the breastbone.

Heartport’s technology has the potential to dramatically reduce trauma, pain, scarring and recovery times for patients. The company hopes to obtain final FDA approval for the Port-Access system in the second half of 1998 and begin full commercialization shortly thereafter. If approvals and launch proceed as planned, Heartport could reach profitability as early as the fourth quarter of 1998 according to financial analysts.

“We are very optimistic about Heartport’s progress and the ability to bring this breakthrough technology to patients,” said Dr. John G. Byrne, Heartport’s CEO. “Modifying and refining surgical techniques to be far less invasive is at the forefront of advances in medicine. Heartport is leading the way in making open-heart surgeries a thing of the past.” 

The Port-Access system has been in development for over 10 years and more than 600 patients have received minimally invasive bypass surgery in clinical trials to date. The Port-Access system allows surgeons to harvest healthy veins through small incisions in the leg and attach the veins below the heart with the aid of remote-controlled robotic arms. Real-time 3D visualization within the chest cavity helps guide the precise movements. Patients typically experience less pain, scarring and faster recovery times compared to traditional bypass surgery.  

If approved and adopted, the Port-Access system has the potential to significantly disrupt the multi-billion bypass surgery market. Over 200,000 coronary bypass surgeries are performed each year in the U.S. and Europe. While the Port-Access system may eventually reduce costs due to lower patient trauma and faster recovery times, the upfront costs of the technology are high. Heartport will need to demonstrate clear benefits to patients and physicians to drive widespread adoption and recoup their investment, estimated at over $100 million so far in the development of the Port-Access system.

Heartport’s stock price has nearly quadrupled over the last 12 months in anticipation of FDA approval and the commercial launch of the Port-Access system. Investor optimism will soon be tested as Heartport embarks into uncharted waters—attempting to gain mainstream acceptance of a radical new approach to one of the most common surgeries in medicine. The future for minimally invasive heart surgery and Heartport Inc. looks bright, but risks and hurdles still remain before open-heart surgery is relegated to the history books.
