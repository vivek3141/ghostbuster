St. Jude Medical Inc Acquires Ventritex Inc in $665 Million Deal, Enters Top Ranks of Heartbeat Regulating Device Manufacturers

Medical device maker St. Jude Medical Inc announced today that it has acquired Ventritex Inc, a manufacturer of implantable cardiac defibrillators, for $665 million in an all-cash deal. The acquisition will propel St. Jude into the top tier of companies making devices to regulate abnormal heart rhythms. 

Ventritex produces implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), which are small devices implanted in the chest to detect life-threatening irregular heartbeats and shock the heart back into a normal rhythm. ICDs are the most common treatment for preventing sudden cardiac death from disorders like ventricular tachycardia. Ventritex has a range of ICDs currently approved in the U.S. and Europe.

“The addition of Ventritex’s product portfolio and pipeline in implantable defibrillators strengthens our
global cardiology platform and accelerates our growth in this vital market,” said St. Jude Medical Chairman and CEO Michael T. Rousseau. The deal provides St. Jude with a range of new devices pending approval and allows the company to move into developing subcutaneous ICDs, which are implanted just under the skin rather than connecting to the heart.

The ICD market is estimated to reach over $5 billion annually and is growing in the mid-single digits. Market leaders in this space include Medtronic, Boston Scientific, and BIOTRONIK. With this acquisition, St. Jude will join these top companies, gaining critical scale to drive product development and sales. 

“Ventritex has already brought innovative products to market that improve patient care and outcomes,” said Rousseau. “We look forward to leveraging our resources and expertise to expand on Ventritex’s success and make these and future innovations more widely available to physicians and their patients around the world.”

St. Jude stock rose 4% on the news of the deal, which will be funded from St. Jude's existing cash reserves and increased debt. Ventritex will be folded into St. Jude's cardiac division upon completion of the acquisition, expected by the end of this year. The acquisition adds 300 Ventritex employees to St. Jude's global workforce across 20 locations worldwide.

This is St. Jude’s fourth acquisition in the cardiac space in the last two years, following the purchases of Neothetics, AgaMatrix, and CardioMEMS, as the company aims to provide a suite of products addressing the full range of cardiovascular diseases and disorders. The company is based in St. Paul, Minnesota and had 2019 sales of $3.6 billion.
