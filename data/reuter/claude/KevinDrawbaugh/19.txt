3M Reports 16% Jump in Earnings After Spinning off Slow-Growing Data Storage and Imaging Businesses   

3M Company reported a 16% increase in quarterly earnings today, boosted by the spinoff of its data storage and imaging businesses earlier this year. 

The manufacturing conglomerate earned $1.6 billion, or $2.76 a share, in the third quarter, up from $1.38 billion, or $2.38 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 4% to $8.4 billion. The earnings beat analysts’ expectations of $2.70 a share, according to FactSet. 

3M in March spun off its Imation data storage and imaging business, now called Glassbridge Enterprises. The move allowed 3M to offload sluggish business segments and refocus on its most profitable and fastest-growing operations, like industrial adhesives, healthcare products, and consumer goods.

The spinoff “allowed us to become a much more focused, streamlined company," said 3M Chief Executive Inge Thulin. "Now all of our businesses are aligned and positioned for strong growth.”

Shares of 3M rose 3% in morning trading. The stock is up 20% over the past year.

3M is best known for popular products like Post-it Notes, Scotch tape, and filtration masks. But the company has been diversifying into faster-growing areas such as touchscreen displays, adhesives for the automotive industry, and films used in the construction of smartphones and televisions.

Sales in 3M's industrial business grew 8.4% in the third quarter, while healthcare revenue rose 5.7%. The company's safety and graphics segment posted 7.4% higher sales. But revenue in 3M's consumer unit declined slightly.
