St. Jude Medical Inc. to Become Top Manufacturer of Heart Regulation Devices with $665 Million Agreement

St. Jude Medical Inc., a medical device company focused on cardiac rhythm management and stroke prevention, announced today that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Advanced Composite Medical Components for $665 million. The deal will significantly expand St. Jude Medical's manufacturing capabilities for implanted heart rhythm devices like pacemakers and defibrillators. 

Advanced Composite Medical Components, or ACME, is a privately held medical device contract manufacturing company that specializes in high-precision electronic components and subassemblies for implantable devices. ACME has manufacturing facilities in Singapore, Ireland, and Costa Rica that employ over 2,500 staff. The company is a key supplier for most major medical device companies in the cardiac rhythm management industry.

The acquisition of ACME will make St. Jude Medical the largest vertically integrated manufacturer of cardiac rhythm devices according to analysts. In recent years, St. Jude Medical has struggled with declining profit margins due in part to rising costs from medical device contract manufacturers. By bringing more of the manufacturing process in-house through the ACME acquisition, St. Jude Medical expects to cut costs significantly and gain more control over supply chain quality and management.

"This acquisition will provide tremendous benefits for our company and customers," said Ernest Caballero, Chief Executive Officer of St. Jude Medical. "In addition to substantial cost savings, we will have more flexibility and control over product quality, delivery, and new product timelines. We have partnered with ACME for many years and are confident their expertise and global facilities will enhance our market leadership in the cardiac rhythm device industry."

The $665 million acquisition price represents a 32% premium over ACME's current valuation. St. Jude Medical will finance the deal through a combination of cash on hand and low-interest debt. The company expects ACME to boost earnings by $0.07 to $0.13 per share once the acquisition has been fully integrated over the next 18 to 24 months. Regulatory approval is still pending but expected to close within the current quarter.

Overall, analysts view this as a very positive strategic move by St. Jude Medical to bolster its competitive position. With healthcare costs continuing to rise globally, medical device companies are under pressure to reduce expenditure. By bringing a key part of its supply chain in-house through the ACME purchase, St. Jude Medical can lower healthcare costs through price cuts while still improving profitabilityâ€”a compelling combination that should reward its shareholders and customers.
