Pall and Memtec Engage in Battle for Gelman Sciences Inc.  

Gelman Sciences Inc., a leading manufacturer of filtration and purification products, has become the target of a heated takeover battle between two rival companies. Pall Corporation, a maker of fluid management systems, launched an unsolicited bid last week to acquire Gelman for $75 per share in cash, valuing the company at $1.5 billion. However, Memtec America Inc., a filtration and separation technologies company, quickly countered with an $80 per share offer, raising the stakes to $1.6 billion.

Gelman's board of directors is currently evaluating the competing proposals to determine the best path forward for the company and its shareholders. According to sources close to the deal, Gelman had not been looking to sell itself and was caught off guard by the dueling bids from Pall and Memtec. The tender offers have placed the board under pressure to carefully review its options to ensure maximum value is realized. 

Pall, a publicly traded company based in New York, generates over $2.5 billion in annual revenue and believes Gelman would strengthen its position in the filtration and purification market. By integrating Gelman's products and technologies, Pall expects to achieve significant cost savings and new cross-selling opportunities. However, Memtec views Gelman as highly complementary to its existing operations and a platform to expand its reach into new industries and geographies. Memtec is backed by private equity firm KKR and intends to fund the deal using a combination of equity and debt.

Industry analysts point to several factors that make Gelman an attractive target. The company has a diverse set of products, proprietary technologies, and an established base of over 10,000 customers worldwide. Gelman is also experiencing strong sales growth, especially in high-margin consumables and replacement parts. Its financial performance has improved steadily over the last five years following a restructuring program that streamlined operations and reduced costs.  

The next stages of the process will involve discussions between each bidder and Gelman's board, which is being advised by investment bank Morgan Stanley. While negotiations are ongoing, there can be no assurances that definitive agreements will be reached. A protracted bidding war could potentially unfold, pushing the final price tag well beyond initial offers. The companies have until Oct. 15 to submit their "best and final" bids in what is shaping up to be a closely fought competitive battle. Stay tuned for further details on this developing story.
