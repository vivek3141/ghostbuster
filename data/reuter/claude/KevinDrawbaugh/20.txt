3M Excites Wall Street with Strong Q3 Earnings After Spinoff 

3M, the Minnesota-based industrial and consumer products company, reported better-than-expected third quarter earnings today buoyed by strong demand across several business lines and improved operational efficiency. The quarterly results, the first since 3M spun off its healthcare business earlier this year, beat Wall Street estimates and sent the stock up over 3% in early trading.

3M CEO Mike Roman praised the strong execution across the company. "Going forward we will continue leveraging our business transformation and focusing on productivity and operational improvements to drive value for our shareholders,” Roman said in the earnings release.

For the third quarter, 3M reported earnings of $2.15 per share, topping analysts’ estimates of $2.10 per share. Revenue also came in above expectations at $8.6 billion, a 5% increase over the same quarter last year. Sales grew across all business groups, with the largest increases coming in consumer goods, industrial, and safety and industrial segments. 

The quarter marks an early win for the new-look 3M following the spinoff of its healthcare business into a new company called ConvaTec earlier this year. 3M shed its healthcare operations, which accounted for about $8 billion in annual sales, to focus on its stronger performing industrial and consumer businesses. The move, which went into effect on 1 October 2020, made 3M a simpler, faster-growing company, according to Roman.

With the spinoff now complete, 3M narrowed its full-year 2020 guidance and now expects adjusted earnings in the range of $9.25 to $9.75 per share, up from the previous range of $9.20 to $9.70 per share. The guidance hike reflects benefits from cost-cutting actions and productivity improvements in the wake of the spinoff. 2020 revenue is projected between $32.2 billion to $32.7 billion.

The strong quarter and improved outlook were cheered by investors who have been eager to see 3M's performance as a more focused industrial and consumer company. With the earnings beat and guidance raise, 3M shares gained over 3% to $179.20 in early trading. The stock has risen over 10% so far this year.
