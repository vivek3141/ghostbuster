FDA Approves Record Number of Drugs and Medical Devices, Alleviating Industry Criticisms 

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced today that it approved a record number of drugs and medical devices in 2019, approving 48 novel drugs and approving or clearing 197 medical devices. The agency said this was the highest number of approvals and clearances in over 20 years.

The high approval numbers come as welcome news to pharmaceutical and medical device companies that have long complained about a slow and burdensome FDA approval process. Industry groups have argued that the FDA's conservative approach and lengthy review times have stifled innovation and prevented life-saving treatments from getting to patients. The 2019 numbers appear to show the agency is making progress in streamlining its review process while still maintaining high standards for safety and efficacy.

“We are approving drugs at a record pace while maintaining the high standards Americans expect from the gold standard regulatory agency,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, M.D. “We will continue to advance policies to promote efficiency, effectiveness, and predictability in our reviews to benefit patients.”   

The novel drugs approved in 2019 include treatments for diseases such as migraine, postpartum depression, rare genetic disorders, and various forms of cancer. The agency also approved a peptide drug to increase growth hormone in children and the first treatment for a rare disease called ATTR amyloidosis. 

On the device front, the 197 clearances include wearable and implantable devices for pain, hearing loss, asthma management, and devices that use artificial intelligence for medical image analysis. Diagnostic tests approved in 2019 include the first at-home test for HIV and several tests for various forms of cancer and heart disease.

While industry groups have applauded the 2019 numbers, some consumer advocates argue the agency should not prioritize speed over safety. Critics argue that faster review times could allow unsafe or ineffective products to reach the market, putting patients at risk. Supporters counter that the agency has strong policies in place to ensure safety is not compromised, even with accelerated reviews.

The coming year will show whether the FDA can sustain the higher pace of approvals while balancing speed and safety. Both industry and patient groups will be monitoring to ensure the regulatory process achieves the right balance. But for now, the record-setting 2019 numbers have eased some of the criticism facing the agency and given hope that innovative treatments are moving quickly to patients who need them.
