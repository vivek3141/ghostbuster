Pharmacia & Upjohn Shares Plummet After Profit Warning

Shares of Pharmacia & Upjohn fell sharply today after the pharmaceutical giant issued a profit warning for the second quarter and the full year. The company said second-quarter earnings per share would be "significantly below" analysts' expectations due to weaker-than-expected revenue growth and costs related to the consolidation of recently acquired companies.  

Pharmacia & Upjohn stock plunged over 25% on the news, wiping out over $12 billion in market value. The shares were already under pressure this year due to broader concerns about slowing growth and political rhetoric around lowering drug prices.

"We are disappointed by our recent performance and the resulting shortfall to expectations,” said CEO John Smith in a statement. “We faced significant headwinds this quarter, including slower demand for some of our key products, especially in Europe and emerging markets."

The warning comes just two months after Pharmacia & Upjohn closed its acquisition of Medicus, a biopharmaceutical company focused on rare diseases, for $6.2 billion. Mr. Smith said the integration of Medicus and other recent deals has proven "more challenging and costly than originally anticipated." The company now expects restructuring and integration costs of $500 million this year, up from the $200 million initially forecast.

Pharmacia & Upjohn has been an aggressive acquirer in recent years as it seeks to boost growth. The Medicus deal was the company's largest acquisition since it purchased Allergan, the maker of Botox, for $63 billion in 2015. However, some analysts have argued the company has taken on too much debt and overpaid for targets. Activist investor Carl Icahn criticized the Medicus acquisition and argued the money would be better spent paying off debt and buying back stock.

The profit warning reinforces concerns that Pharmacia & Upjohn's growth engines may be stalling out. Sales of several blockbuster drugs have slowed recently due to increased competition from generics and biosimilars. Delays in new drug approvals have also hampered the company. The company now expects revenue to increase only 2 to 3% this year on a constant currency basis, down from earlier guidance of 4 to 5% growth.  

Pharmacia & Upjohn says it remains committed to its strategic direction but hinted changes may be coming. “We plan to undertake a comprehensive review of our operations to determine appropriate actions to improve performance and shareholder value,” Mr. Smith said. Investors will surely be watching closely to see what adjustments the company makes to turn around its fortunes and boost confidence again.
