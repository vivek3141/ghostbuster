Chinese President Jiang Zemin urges soldiers to toe party line on 60th anniversary of communist military ordeal  

BEIJING, China — Chinese President Jiang Zemin urged the nation's soldiers today to remain loyal to the Communist Party as China marked the 60th anniversary of the Long March, the military retreat that helped cement Mao Zedong's control over the party.  

Speaking at a ceremony in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, Jiang told thousands of military officers and soldiers that they must uphold the "correct political direction" set by the party's 1935-36 Long March. The Long March was a yearlong trek by Communist fighters fleeing Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist forces, during which Mao Zedong emerged as the party's paramount leader.

"The military should consciously accept the leadership of the Communist Party and socialism, firmly listening to the commands of the party and the people," Jiang said. 

Jiang's comments come amid uncertainty over his own political future and that of political reforms in China. Jiang is expected to retire as Communist Party chief in 2002 and China's leaders have given no clear sign of any succession plans. There is also no indication China's authoritarian communist system is moving closer to democracy.

By invoking the Long March, Jiang appeared aimed to promote party solidarity and reinforce his status as the leader who can maintain political stability. Some analysts, however, believe the speech reflected Jiang's uncertainty over retaining influence after retirement.

"There are more and more signals that Jiang and his associates want to maintain sway even after Jiang gives up his posts," said Dali Yang, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Chicago. "Appealing to communist symbols and ideology is one way for Jiang to claim leadership legitimacy and demand loyalty."

The Long March is portrayed in China as a heroic episode that saved the communist movement from oblivion. About 100,000 soldiers and party members set out in October 1934 from Jiangxi province, fleeing Chiang Kai-shek's encircling forces. After a year, some 8,000 survivors reached the remote northwestern province of Shaanxi, where Mao established a guerrilla base.

During the trek, Mao emerged as the dominant leader in what had been a fractured party. He built a hard core of devoted followers in the Long March generation.  Ever since, generations of Chinese communists have been inspired by the "spirit of the Long March."

Jiang, speaking like a stern grandfather lecturing his children, told soldiers they must work to build a "powerful people's army that obeys the party's command, can win battles and has fine work styles."
