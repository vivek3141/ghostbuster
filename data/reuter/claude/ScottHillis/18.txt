China Criticizes U.S. Sanctions on Textiles ahead of Warren Christopher's Visit, But Hopes for Positive Bilateral Relationship  

Beijing, China - China issued a stern warning to the United States today over its decision to impose sanctions on Chinese textile imports. The sanctions, announced last week, will penalize China for exceeding textile export quotas established in a previous trade agreement. The U.S. plans to impose temporary tariffs of up to 100% on billions of dollars of Chinese garments and fabrics. China called the sanctions "illegal and harmful" to trade relations between the world's two largest economies. 

The announcement comes just days before U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is set to visit Beijing to discuss a range of issues, including trade disputes, human rights, and nuclear nonproliferation efforts with North Korea. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson urged the U.S. to reconsider the sanctions, saying they violate principles of free trade and mutual benefit. However, China also expressed hope that Secretary Christopher's visit would help improve bilateral relations that have become strained in recent months.

There are concerns the textile dispute could escalate into a broader trade war, despite China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001. The U.S. has long accused China of unfair trade practices like currency manipulation, intellectual property theft, and large government subsidies for Chinese companies. At the same time, China is the U.S.'s largest trading partner, and many American companies rely on both Chinese suppliers and customers.  

A spokesperson for Secretary Christopher said the sanctions were intended to enforce trade rules agreed upon by both sides and encourage China to further open its markets. The visit will include meetings with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to address China's concerns and find "common ground on key issues." The U.S. acknowledges China's economic growth and influence on the global stage but wants to set "rules of the road" to support fair competition and protect American businesses, the spokesperson said.
