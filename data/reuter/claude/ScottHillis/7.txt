China Empowers Hong Kong Courts to Try Off-Duty Chinese Soldiers After 1997 

In a surprising move, China's National People's Congress Standing Committee passed a resolution today granting Hong Kong courts jurisdiction to try off-duty Chinese soldiers stationed in the city. The resolution reverses the prior immunity granted to Chinese troops in Hong Kong after the 1997 handover from British rule.

The resolution comes after repeated clashes between Hong Kong residents and off-duty Chinese soldiers, with the latter group often behaving aggressively and violently when confronted over their behavior. Local Hong Kong groups have protested the soldiers' presence and called for accountability when they break laws or harm others.

"This is a victory for the people of Hong Kong and the rule of law," said Wong Ho-yin, a pro-democracy activist in Hong Kong. "For too long, these soldiers have acted with impunity, secure in the knowledge that they were untouchable. Now there is a chance for justice when they cross the line."  

The Chinese Ministry of National Defense expressed support for the change, with spokesman Wu Qian saying, "This resolution shows China's commitment to 'one country, two systems' and the rule of law in Hong Kong. PLA soldiers must follow the law like any other resident, whether on or off duty."

However, the resolution also reaffirms China's absolute control over military matters in Hong Kong, stating that the PLA garrison "shall not be interfered [with] by Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government." The resolution allows Hong Kong courts to try individual soldiers for offenses committed off-duty, but military matters, operations, and facilities remain under mainland Chinese control.

Some analysts view this as an attempt by Beijing to mollify Hong Kong residents and the international community, while still maintaining its grip on the city's security. "This resolution is more cosmetic than substantive," said Susan Cheung, a political scientist at Hong Kong University. "The PLA will still operate above the law in all matters that really count. But this may take some wind out of the sails of protesters."

The resolution will go into effect on July 1, coinciding with the 22nd anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China.  Off-duty Chinese soldiers who commit crimes in Hong Kong after that date may find themselves for the first time facing trial in a Hong Kong courtroom.
