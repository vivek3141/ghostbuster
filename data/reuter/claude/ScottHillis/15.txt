China Launches New Basketball League with American Coaches and Players 

The Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) announced today the launch of a new professional basketball league that will feature American coaches and players. The league is aiming to raise the level of play and gain more international exposure for Chinese basketball.

The CBA has partnered with a group of American investors and sports executives to form the China International Basketball League or CIBL. The season will run from October through February and feature 8 teams from major cities across China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.

The CIBL has already signed deals with several former NBA coaches and players to lead the new teams. The Guangzhou Long-Lions have hired former NBA coach Byron Scott as their head coach and signed former NBA all-star Tracy McGrady as an assistant coach. The Beijing Ducks have named former Knicks coach Mike D’Antoni as their head coach. The Shanghai Sharks will be led by former NBA coach Mike Brown.   

On the court, each team will have three spots for foreign players, with many likely coming from American colleges and minor leagues. "We want to put an exciting, fan-friendly product on the court," said CIBL founder Jeffrey Wang. "Having top coaches and players from America will help raise the competitiveness and skills of our own players."

The launch of the CIBL comes at a time when the CBA has seen struggles recently, including declining attendance and a loss of star Chinese players to the NBA. The CBA and CIBL hope that working together they can regain popularity across China and create a basketball league on par with some of the top European leagues. 

Youth participation in basketball has been growing rapidly in China, fueling hopes that developing top professional leagues can capitalize on this trend and produce future stars. “We believe that through partnering with the CBA and learning from some of the best in American basketball, the CIBL will become a premier destination for China's up-and-coming players and serve as a new pathway to the NBA,” said Wang. The first CIBL season tips off next month as China's newest professional basketball league.
