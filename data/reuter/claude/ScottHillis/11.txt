China Warns of Pending Trade Issues Despite Improved Sino-U.S. Ties 

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said Tuesday that Beijing expects some economic tensions with Washington to persist, even as the Trump administration agreed to lift tariffs on certain Chinese exports as relations between the countries modestly warm.

Speaking at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum, Liu said trade teams from both sides are still discussing the details of the phase one trade deal agreed in principle earlier this year. However, China remains concerned that other disputes, including those over technology, finance and human rights, could undermine cooperation if left unaddressed. “We have to realize that there are some structural issues that are very difficult to solve in the short-term,” Liu said.

The warning came just a day after U.S. officials announced they would exempt more than 400 Chinese products from tariffs - from vacuum cleaners and linens to baby products and metro cars - as a gesture of goodwill. The move offered relief for both U.S. consumers and Chinese exporters and contributed to a more constructive mood around climactic talks aimed at finalizing the phase one deal in the coming weeks. 

Still, Liu cautioned that a limited trade pact would not resolve deeply rooted differences between Washington and Beijing on industrial policy, tech security and other issues fueling bilateral tensions. He pressed the U.S. to treat China as an equal if it wants to avoid further disruptions to the economic relationship, while defending China's right to choose its own development path. 

“China and the United States should meet each other halfway, promote balanced and coordinated trade development, and jointly build a relationship of mutually beneficial cooperation on the basis of mutual respect,” Liu said in a question-and-answer session. The comments highlight how precarious relations remain between the world’s two largest economies even after nearly two years of damaging tit-for-tat tariffs and heightened geopolitical rivalry.

While a phase one deal would defuse an immediate threat to global growth, few analysts expect commercial or political ties to return to normal without a more comprehensive settlement that likely remains out of reach. Still, Liu’s remarks left the door open to future cooperation, emphasizing China’s desire for “a fair competitive environment” and pledging to further open industries to foreign investment.
