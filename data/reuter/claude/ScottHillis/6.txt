US Securities Official Urges China to Increase Transparency in Listed Companies 

The top securities regulator in the United States has called on China to require more transparency from companies listed on its stock exchanges. Jay Clayton, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, said Chinese companies seeking to list shares in the US need to disclose more information to protect American investors. 

In a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, Clayton said the SEC has taken steps to ensure investors "are able to make informed investment decisions" about Chinese companies. But he said more needs to be done on the Chinese side. Clayton urged China to make corporate disclosures mandatory for companies listed on domestic exchanges like the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. 

"I call on China to move from a disclosure philosophy based on comply or explain to one of disclose or abstain," Clayton said. He added that complying with disclosure rules "should be the price of admission" to public capital markets.

The remarks come amid escalating tensions between the US and China over trade and economic issues. There is a bipartisan push in Washington to take a tougher line on China and strengthen oversight of Chinese companies that sell shares in US markets. American lawmakers and officials worry that investors are not getting a clear financial picture from many China-based companies.

Clayton acknowledged the SEC's limited reach over China's domestic stock markets. But he said the agency would make judgments about the risks of Chinese listings in the US based in part on the degree of transparency afforded to investors in China. "If we cannot gain comfort with the disclosure and transparency, we will not be in a position to approve the [US] transaction," Clayton warned.

The SEC has pursued a number of enforcement actions against Chinese companies in recent years over allegedly misleading statements to investors. Last year, China-based Luckin Coffee agreed to pay a $180 million penalty to settle SEC charges that it fabricated $300 million in sales. That case shattered confidence in US-listed Chinese companies and led some investors to call for stricter oversight.

Clayton's speech signals the SEC intends to take a cautious stance toward new listings of Chinese companies on American exchanges. While seeking cooperation from China, the agency appears poised to demand higher standards of disclosure to better protect US investors from the uncertainties of investing in Chinese stocks. Overall, it reflects the SEC's view that transparency is essential for fair and efficient markets.
