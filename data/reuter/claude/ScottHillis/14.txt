China Accuses Foreign Journalists of Biased Reporting, Urges Them to Learn from U.S. Reporter Edgar Snow 

BEIJINGâ€”China's Foreign Ministry slammed foreign journalists today for what it called "biased and misleading" reporting on China. Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin accused some Western media organizations of "ideological prejudice and hostility" in their coverage of China.

"We have noted that some journalists from Western media organizations have produced reports about China that lack objectivity and are misleading," Wang said at a press briefing. "They ignore facts and hype up certain issues to smear and attack China's political system and policies."

Wang did not cite any specific news reports or name any particular journalists or media organizations. But his comments come amid rising tensions between China and Western nations on a range of issues like Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Taiwan, and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Foreign Ministry spokesperson urged foreign journalists in China to follow the example of Edgar Snow, an American journalist famous for his sympathetic portrayals of Communist Party leaders like Mao Zedong in the 1930s and 1940s. Snow's 1938 book Red Star Over China offered a largely glowing account of the Communist revolution at a time when most Westerners viewed the movement negatively.

"Foreign journalists should learn from Edgar Snow, observe China with an objective and friendly attitude, report on China truthfully by sticking to facts and without prejudice," Wang said. He added that journalists "should make efforts to promote China-foreign exchanges and cooperation to enhance mutual understanding between China and the outside world."

Wang's comments are the latest in a series of public attacks by Chinese officials on foreign media and journalists over the past few months. The government has expelled journalists from several major Western news organizations and denied credentials to journalists from U.S. media like the Wall Street Journal and CNN.

The Foreign Correspondents Club of China issued a statement in response to Wang's comments, calling on China to cease "targeting journalists simply for doing their jobs." The organization said Chinese criticism of foreign media seems aimed at "intimidating and harassing" journalists and interference with press freedoms.
