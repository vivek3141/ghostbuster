U.S. Vice-President Al Gore Plans Potential Visit to China in 1997 

Vice President Al Gore is planning a potential visit to China in late 1997, according to administration officials. If finalized, the trip would be the highest-level U.S. visit to China since the Clinton administration took office in 1993. Relations between the two countries have been strained at times over economic and human rights issues. 

The primary goal of the visit would be to advance the economic relationship between the two nations. As the U.S. trade deficit with China has soared to over $40 billion annually, the Clinton administration is under pressure to address trade imbalances and open China's markets to more U.S. goods and services. A visit from the Vice President could help jumpstart new trade talks and ease tensions that have mounted over China's large trade surplus.

However, any visit would also need to address ongoing concerns over China's human rights record, which the U.S. and other Western nations have frequently criticized. Discussions over political prisoners and China's occupation of Tibet would likely be on the agenda. The Vice President is expected to reiterate America's support for political and religious freedoms that China currently restricts. 

While no official dates have been announced, a potential trip would likely occur after China's leadership congress in October and before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Vancouver in November. The Vice President would meet with top leaders in Beijing, including president Jiang Zemin and premier Li Peng, and may also visit other cities like Shanghai to promote business and trade partnerships.

Any visit to China by such a high-level U.S. official would demonstrate an interest in constructive and cooperative engagement with China on issues of mutual concern. However, it also risks domestic criticism over human rights and trade policies. The Clinton administration will have to weigh these factors carefully as a final decision on the trip is made in the coming months. The next several months promise to be a crucial time for the U.S.-China relationship, with a potential Gore visit at the center of the developments. Overall, an in-person visit from the Vice President could span some of the gaps that have emerged between the two sides and help put the relationship on firmer footing going into the 21st century.
