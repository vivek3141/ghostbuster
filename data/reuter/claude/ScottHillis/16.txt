U.S. Undersecretary of State to hold talks with Chinese officials on arms proliferation  

The  Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs, Thomas Thomson, will travel to Beijing this week to discuss arms control and nonproliferation issues with senior Chinese officials. The talks are aimed at addressing growing U.S. concerns over China's role in the global spread of advanced conventional weapons and missile technology to rogue states and non-state actors.   

The U.S. has long voiced unease over China's arms sales and technology transfers to countries like Iran, North Korea, and Pakistan. U.S. officials argue these deals undermine global security and prop up dangerous regimes. In 2016, China delivered HQ-9 surface-to-air missiles to Iran and float planes to North Korea that can be equipped for military use. The U.S. also claims China provided technology and materials for Pakistan's Ababeel ballistic missile, which is reportedly capable of delivering multiple warheads.

For its part, China insists its arms sales are legal and that it operates under the same export control standards as Western nations. Chinese officials also note that U.S. arms deals dwarf those of China and fuel conflicts around the world. However, analysts say China's vetting processes are opaque and that strategic considerations, not stated principles, often drive the country's proliferation activities, especially in neighboring regions.  

There are hopes the meetings in Beijing can yield progress on additional transparency measures and controls. But expectations are modest given the limited results of previous U.S.-China nonproliferation talks. Thomson will likely convey concerns over recent suspect deals and urge China to improve screening processes and abide by international standards. China is expected to rebuff criticism of its policies as hypocritical while calling for the U.S. to lift remaining arms sale restrictions on China.

While the proliferation of advanced weapons threatens global security, China also sees arms sales as a way to gain political and economic influence, especially in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Tighter controls could curb China's geopolitical ambitions in these regions. With strategic competition intensifying, there is doubt either side will dramatically alter long-held positions. But maintaining open channels of communication on these issues remains important to avoiding greater conflict.
