China's Communist Party Pushes Socialist Values and Historical Links to Tibet 

The Chinese Communist Party is ramping up efforts to promote socialist values and strengthen China's historical claims to Tibet. In a meeting this week, the Politburo called for tighter control over Tibetan Buddhism and better education on China's version of Tibetan history.

The Politburo meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping focused on maintaining stability in Tibet and strengthening the role of the Communist Party in the region. A statement from the meeting said the party must "strengthen education on socialism and patriotism" in Tibet, especially among young Tibetans. The statement also called for "strengthening institutional mechanisms for promoting socialist values and suppressing negative social moods" in monasteries and religious institutions.

The emphasis on patriotic education aims to reinforce China's position that Tibet has been part of China for centuries. According to Beijing, Tibet peacefully merged with the People's Republic of China in 1951. However, many Tibetans say their Himalayan homeland was effectively independent for most of its history. The Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule.

Patriotic education campaigns have been ongoing for years but appear to be expanding. Required political education has been imposed on monks and nuns, while communist cadres have been stationed in some monasteries. Critics argue this undermines Tibetan culture and religious freedom. A U.S. government report last year said authorities in Tibet were "restricting freedom of expression, belief, assembly, and travel."

The Communist Party is also promoting links between Marxist ideology and traditional Tibetan culture. An article in the People's Daily this week argued for educating the public in "the essence of Sinicization of Tibetan Buddhism." Sinicization refers to bringing non-Chinese cultural and religious traditions in line with mainstream Chinese and Communist values. The article said Sinicization of Tibetan Buddhism was "an unshakable political stand that has always been consistently adhered to" by the Communist Party.

Promoting tighter control and socialist values in Tibet is in keeping with broader aims of the Communist Party under Xi Jinping. However, the new campaign also reflects anxieties about stability and separatism in China's ethnic minority regions, including Tibet. The Communist Party appears determined to strengthen its grip, even as its heavy-handed policies receive criticism abroad.
