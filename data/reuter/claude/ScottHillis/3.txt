Exiled Chinese Human Rights Activist Speaks Out Against Capital Charge on Detained Dissident Wang Dan  

Prominent Chinese human rights activist Chen Guangcheng today issued a statement from his exile in the United States condemning the Chinese government's decision to pursue the death penalty against long-time democracy activist Wang Dan. Wang was detained in April for "subverting state power" and "inciting subversion of state power" after writing an open letter calling for political reforms.

According to Chen, "The Chinese Communist Party is resorting again to its old tricks of trumped up criminal charges and barbaric punishment against peaceful dissidents. Wang Dan has done nothing but exercise his right to free speech and has been a brave voice for democratic change and political freedom." Wang was previously imprisoned for four years for his role as a leader in the 1989 Tiananmen Square student protests. 

In his public letter, Wang called on China's leaders to accelerate political reforms, re-evaluate the government's response to the Tiananmen protests, and release all political prisoners. The letter was posted on social media and received thousands of views before being censored. Wang was detained shortly thereafter and now faces the death penalty at a secret trial.

Human rights groups have decried Wang's detention and the draconian charges against him. "China continues down the path of increased authoritarianism and intolerance for peaceful dissent," said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. "Beijing's reaction to criticism only highlights its insecurity and fear of open debate."

The case against Wang comes amid a broader crackdown on human rights lawyers and activists under President Xi Jinping. Chen warned that "By silencing Wang Dan, the Communist Party wants to cow all Chinese citizens into submission. But the calls for freedom and democracy will only grow louder." Chen encouraged the international community to put more pressure on China to release Wang and uphold civil and political liberties. There are fears that without significant outside pressure, Wang could face execution within weeks. His secret trial is expected to begin next Tuesday, according to sources in Beijing. The Chinese government has declined to comment officially on Wang's detention or charges.
