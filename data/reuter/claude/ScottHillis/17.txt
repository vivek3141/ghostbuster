U.S. Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis begins talks with Chinese officials on arms proliferation issues

Beijing, Chinaâ€”The U.S. Undersecretary of State for International Security Affairs and Arms Control, Lynn Davis, arrived in Beijing this morning to begin two days of talks with Chinese officials regarding arms proliferation. Davis's visit comes amid concerns that China has not curbed the sale of weapons and technology to North Korea, Iran, and other regimes, despite numerous promises and agreements with the U.S. to restrict such transfers. 

In meetings with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and other senior officials, Davis is expected to press China to enact tougher controls on the export of missiles, aircraft, and other military equipment. She is also likely to raise U.S. concerns over intellectual property theft and cyberattacks, which are compromising U.S. military operations and technology. It marks the first high-level meeting on these issues since President Biden took office last month.

"The U.S. is deeply worried about China's failure to meet its nonproliferation commitments and its actions that threaten global security," said a senior U.S. State Department official. "Undersecretary Davis is in Beijing to reiterate how critical these issues are and warn that if China does not take action, it will face consequences that will significantly damage the relationship."

For its part, China remains frustrated over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and has bristled at American criticism over its weapons exports, particularly with regard to North Korea. China provides up to 90% of North Korea's trade and has been reluctant to curtail that economic lifeline despite calls from the U.S. to use that leverage to rein in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. 

The talks are set against a backdrop of rising tensions between the U.S. and China on various fronts. The Biden administration has signaled it will maintain a skeptical stance toward China on trade, technology, human rights and geopolitical issues. Still, officials said the U.S. and China share some common interests in limiting the spread of the world's most dangerous weapons. The discussions over the next two days will test whether those shared interests can translate into meaningful action and cooperation.
