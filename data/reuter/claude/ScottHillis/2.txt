China Backtracks on Warning to Hong Kong on Freedom of Expression Limits 

Beijing — China appeared to backtrack today on warnings issued earlier this week that Hong Kong’s civil liberties could be curtailed, attempting to reassure residents of the semi-autonomous city that their rights to freedom of speech and assembly will be respected.

On Monday, Beijing released a report that said “there are signs that the rights to freedom of speech and expression are being exploited” in Hong Kong. The report raised concerns that China may move to implement stricter controls on civil society in Hong Kong, limiting political dissent and protests. 

However, speaking to reporters today in Beijing, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson said the government remains fully committed to the “one country, two systems” principle that grants Hong Kong a high degree of political and legal autonomy. 

“The central government will fully support the Hong Kong government to govern Hong Kong according to the law, and support Hong Kong to strengthen the education and guidance to enhance the national awareness and patriotism of Hong Kong residents,” the spokesperson said. But he added that China has “full confidence in the Hong Kong government's ability to maintain social stability and people's well-being in Hong Kong."

Pro-democracy groups and human rights advocates in Hong Kong had reacted with alarm to the Monday report, which was issued by China’s cabinet, the State Council. They warned that any rollback of civil liberties would undermine Hong Kong’s political system and its status as a global financial hub. 

Joshua Wong, a prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, said Tuesday that “the days of freely expressing dissenting political views in Hong Kong may come to an end” if China exerts more control over the city. Mr. Wong warned that China could potentially crack down in Hong Kong with the same strict censorship and suppression of political dissent that takes place in mainland China.

Beijing’s apparent reversal today appears aimed at reassuring financial markets and Hong Kong residents that their democratic freedoms will remain intact, at least in the short term. However, China’s warnings earlier this week have intensified concerns about Beijing’s long-term aims for the city.
