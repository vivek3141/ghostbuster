China Warns of AIDS Epidemic as Sexual Contact Becomes Leading Cause  

China's health officials warned this week that sexual transmission has become the leading cause of new HIV infections in the country, threatening to push the AIDS epidemic into the general population. 

More than 70% of new HIV cases in China were transmitted through sex in 2017, according to health ministry reports, up from just over 30% in 2007. Officials said at a press conference that China must take action immediately to promote safe sex practices and make testing and treatment more widely available, or risk seeing HIV spread rapidly into the wider population.

The rising proportion of sexual transmission of HIV comes as China grapples with major societal changes that have made people more mobile and relationships more fluid. Economic growth, urbanization, and social media have made casual sex more common and accessible in the country of 1.4 billion people. 

Health officials recommended making HIV testing normal and even mandatory in some cases, increasing education about safe sex, and promoting condom use. They also called for ending the stigmatization of high-risk groups like sex workers, men who have sex with men, and drug users.

"The HIV situation in China still remains very severe," said Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. "We must take more resolute and more powerful measures to curb the worsening spread."

Over the past decade, the number of people living with HIV in China has risen 40% to reach an estimated 1.25 million in 2017. But only about 60% of them have been diagnosed and just over 52% of those diagnosed are receiving treatment.

Some health experts argue that China's conservative policies and official denial of high-risk behaviors have undermined education and prevention efforts. Sex and drugs remain highly taboo topics, and activists have long called on the government to do more to raise awareness and support vulnerable groups.

The warnings from health officials this week suggest the government is increasingly grappling with the reality of HIV in China and moving in a direction that may alarm social conservatives but could help curb the spread of the virus. Promoting safe sex, increasing testing, and ending stigma have been hallmarks of successful HIV prevention efforts in other countries. 

China's leaders now appear to recognize such an approach as necessary to avoid the large-scale epidemics that battered nations in the West during the 1980s and 90s. Whether the world's most populous country can implement these policies effectively remains to be seen. But the consequences of inaction seem to have already hit too close to home.
