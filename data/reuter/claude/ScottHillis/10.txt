China warns of major issues in Sino-U.S. trade ties, hints at possible retaliation over punitive charges

The Chinese government issued a stern warning to the United States today over the state of trade relations between the two countries. In a press briefing, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said "there are still major issues in China-U.S. business cooperation" and that recent actions by the U.S. have "seriously endangered the future of business relations between the two sides.‚Äù 

The spokesman's comments come after the U.S. government announced last week that it is imposing anti-dumping duties on aluminum foil from China, claiming that Chinese exporters are selling the product below fair market value. The new charges will raise the costs of Chinese foil by over 100 percent, angering foil producers who believe they have done nothing wrong.

In what appears to be a retaliatory move, China hinted today that it may take countermeasures against U.S. exports to China if the foil tariffs remain in place. "China will take all appropriate measures to defend Chinese companies' lawful interests if U.S. deliberately causes trouble," the spokesman said. U.S. goods that could be targeted include agricultural products like soybeans as well as airplanes produced by Boeing, a major U.S. exporter. 

Trade tensions between the U.S. and China have been rising in recent years, with the two sides skirmishing over issues like intellectual property rights, market access for U.S. tech companies, and the overall trade deficit the U.S. has with China. The Trump administration has accused China of unfair trade practices, including dumping, that disadvantage U.S. workers and businesses. China denies the charges and says the U.S. is being protectionist.

While few expect an all-out trade war, further punitive actions on either side could seriously impact the $650 billion trading relationship between the world's two largest economies. Many experts are calling for renewed high-level talks to address the numerous trade issues before more damage is done. As the Chinese spokesman warned today, "cooperation is the only right choice" for the U.S. and China. The future of the economic relationship between the two superpowers appears to hang in the balance.
