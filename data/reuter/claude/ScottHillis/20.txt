Chinese Professor Wang Xuan's Electronic Publishing System revolutionizes Chinese printing and dominates market 

Beijing, China - Professor Wang Xuan of Tsinghua University has developed an innovative electronic publishing system that is transforming the Chinese printing industry. The system, called the Tsinghua Typesetting System, digitizes the Chinese publishing workflow, from inputting handwritten manuscripts to editing, proofreading, and printing final books. Since its first commercial use in 1978, the Tsinghua Typesetting System has become the dominant publishing platform in China and much of the Chinese-speaking world.

Professor Wang started developing the system in the 1970s to address the significant challenges of printing Chinese characters. The thousands of intricate Chinese characters, many with multiple strokes and components, had long made printing and typesetting extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive. 

The Tsinghua Typesetting System digitizes each Chinese character into tiny dots, called raster graphics, that can be displayed on a screen and printed. This allows Chinese characters in any font and size to be displayed and printed with precision. The system also includes editing and page layout features that streamline the publishing process. Publishers can input handwritten manuscripts into the system, where editors and proofreaders can then review and modify the texts on screen before sending final files directly to printers.

Since the delivery of the first commercial system in 1978, more than 700 publishers across China have adopted the Tsinghua Typesetting System. Professor Wang's company, Founder Electronics, has dominated the Chinese electronic publishing market and has exported the system to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Chinese communities in North America.

The system has enabled a massive expansion in Chinese publishing. In the 1970s, China published around 5,000 new book titles per year. Today, China publishes over 460,000 new titles annually, more than any other country in the world. The Tsinghua Typesetting System has made printing in a wide range of Chinese scripts far more efficient, allowing publishers to operate on larger scales than ever before.

Continued use of the Tsinghua Typesetting System, now in its third generation, has reinforced its market dominance. Publishers find it difficult to switch systems due to challenges converting digital archives and retraining staff. However, some critics argue that its aging technology and closed-source code have hindered technological innovation. Several open-source alternatives are emerging, but none have significantly disrupted Wang's system thus far.

Professor Wang's revolutionary system overcame enormous technical challenges to digitize Chinese printing. It has endured for over 40 years as a seminal breakthrough that enabled the massive growth of Chinese publishing in the digital age. Despite its shortcomings, the Tsinghua Typesetting System made Chinese written works more widely accessible than ever before and spread Chinese culture around the world. For this, it cements Professor Wang Xuan's status as a towering figure in both Chinese computing and publishing.
