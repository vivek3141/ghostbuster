China Urges Atheism to Counter Dalai Lama's Influence in Tibet 

Beijing (AP) - The Chinese government this week launched a renewed propaganda push to promote atheism in Tibet, its latest attempt to diminish the influence of the Dalai Lama among Tibetans. 

According to state media reports, the Communist Party in Tibet has ordered its members and officials to more actively spread atheist ideas and publicly denounce religion as “spiritual opium.” The drive comes as the government ramps up efforts to exert political and social control over Tibetan Buddhists, who make up about 90% of Tibet's population.

“We must resolutely eliminate people's spiritual opium, weaken religion's negative effect and influence, and strengthen ideological and political education,” an official was quoted as saying at a meeting on promoting atheism in Lhasa. Officials also called for establishing more communist party cells in Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and temples to tighten control over monks and clergy.

The new campaign appears aimed at undercutting devotion to the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, who China accuses of using religion to stoke unrest and push for Tibetan independence. The Dalai Lama remains deeply revered among Tibetans despite Beijing's efforts to vilify him. China's atheism drive in Tibet risks further alienating Tibetans and fueling resentment against communist control.

"The Chinese government's new push to spread atheism in Tibet is bound to backfire by provoking more resentment among Tibetans and strengthening their desire to maintain their unique religious and cultural identities," said Tenzin Dorjee, executive director of Students for a Free Tibet. "Rather than dictating to Tibetans how they should think and feel, China should respect their basic human rights and allow them to freely practice their religion."

China seized control of Tibet in 1950 and has tried to suppress Tibetan Buddhism ever since. During the Cultural Revolution, thousands of monasteries were destroyed and monks were imprisoned or forced to denounce religion. Although some monasteries and temples have been restored and rebuilt since the 1980s, they remain under heavy scrutiny and control.
