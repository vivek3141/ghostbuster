China's Communist Party Demands Ideological Orthodoxy or Face Disciplinary Punishment 

The Chinese Communist Party issued a stern directive this week demanding loyalty and ideological conformity from its members or face disciplinary action. The directive comes as the party is preparing for its five-yearly congress next month where President Xi Jinping is expected to cement his authority.

According to the directive, party members must demonstrate "strict political discipline" and "ideological firmness." They are told to closely follow the leadership of Xi Jinping and fully implement his vision for China. “Political discipline and political standards should be placed before everything else,” the directive said.

The directive warns that those who fail to toe the ideological line would be subject to punishment. "Those who have weak ideals and beliefs, are not resolute in ideals and beliefs, lack fighting spirit, do not have a strong sense of serving the people wholeheartedly, waver in the face of difficulties, or even give up halfway will be resolutely dealt with," it said.  

The strong language in the directive reflects Xi's determination to demand loyalty and quash any dissent within the ranks of the party. Since coming to power in 2012, Xi has centralized authority under his leadership and pursued an anti-corruption campaign that has also targeted political opponents. The campaign has investigated and disciplined nearly 2 million officials, strengthening Xi's hand in the bureaucracy.

"Xi is demanding greater ideological conformity from the party rank and file, and threatening punishment for those failing to demonstrate loyalty and discipline," said Joseph Cheng, a professor of political science at the City University of Hong Kong. "We are seeing the start of a new ideological rectification campaign to strengthen Xi's authority over the party."

The directive orders a "thorough evaluation" of the "political life" within party branches and a purge of "two-faced people" who pay lip service to party rule but harbor "ulterior motives". Political education campaigns will be held to reinforce Xi's political theories and his vision for a rejuvenated China.

With the party's next national congress looming, Xi appears determined to ensure discipline and rally support behind his leadership. The congress is expected to reinforce Xi's stature as the core leader of the party for years to come.
