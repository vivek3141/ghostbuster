Leading Chinese Dissident Liu Xiaobo Sentenced to Three Years in Labour Camp, Pro-Democracy Activist Goes Missing  

Prominent Chinese dissident and human rights activist Liu Xiaobo was sentenced to three years of "reeducation through labor" this week for "inciting subversion of state power," according to sources. The imprisonment came just days after Liu published an online petition calling for democratic reforms and an end to the Communist Party's one-party rule in China. Liu is a well-known democracy advocate and intellectual in China who has spent more than 20 years campaigning for greater freedom and civil liberties. 

Shortly after Liu's sentencing, friends reported that they were unable to contact Wang Xu, a young pro-democracy blogger and activist who had voiced support for Liu. Wang's friends are concerned for his safety and said his disappearance may be government-related, given his open criticism of officials and advocacy for multi-party elections on his popular blog. Unconfirmed reports on Chinese social media suggest Wang may have been detained by state security forces to "protect stability," but the claims are impossible to verify. 

Liu's sentence to hard labor is the harshest punishment he has received for his activism and dissent. He has been imprisoned for short periods before, but observers worry the harsh conditions of forced labor camps could seriously damage his health. In 2009, Liu was also sentenced to 11 years in prison for "inciting subversion" after co-authoring Charter 08, a petition calling for democratic reforms. However, he was released after just two years.

The sentencing and disappearance underscore the lengths China's authoritarian government will go to crack down on any voices that dissent from the Communist Party line or threaten its tight control on power. Under President Xi Jinping, China has intensified censorship, mass surveillance, and detention of activists and critics. The moves seem designed to quash any nascent pro-democracy movement and rally support around the Communist Party.
