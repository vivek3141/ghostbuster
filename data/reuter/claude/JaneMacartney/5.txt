Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo sentenced to three years in labour camp 

Prominent Chinese dissident and democracy activist Liu Xiaobo was sentenced to three years of “re-education through labor” by a Beijing court today. Liu, a 54-year-old literary critic and former professor, was found guilty of "inciting subversion of state power" for his involvement in Charter 08, a political manifesto calling for political reform and greater human rights in China.

Liu's conviction and sentencing is the latest blow to political dissent and freedom of speech in China. Charter 08, which Liu helped draft and circulate online, calls for democratic elections, freedom of religion and expression, and an independent judiciary in China. It echoes the demands made by student protesters in Tiananmen Square two decades ago. Since its release in 2008, thousands of Chinese citizens have signed the charter despite government censorship and surveillance.

At his trial, prosecutors cited Liu’s writings in support of democracy and human rights, including a blog post criticizing the Chinese government's response to the deadly 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Liu pleaded not guilty to the charge of incitement. His defense team argued that Charter 08 posed no real threat to the Communist Party's control and that Liu was merely exercising his right to free expression, which is guaranteed by the Chinese constitution.

The harsh sentence handed down to Liu was condemned by human rights groups around the world. “By sentencing Liu Xiaobo to 11 years in prison just for exercising his right to freedom of expression, the Chinese government has once again shown its absolute intolerance of any criticism or dissent,” said Nicole Austin-Hillery, Executive Director of Amnesty International's U.S. program.
