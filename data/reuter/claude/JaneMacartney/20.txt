China Unveils Ambitious Plans for Manned Space Flights and Moon Landing in the 21st Century

The China National Space Administration (CNSA) announced bold new plans this week to expand its manned space flight programs and achieve a crewed moon landing within the next 20 years. If successful, China would become only the second country after the United States to land astronauts on the lunar surface.

The new roadmap outlined by CNSA includes launching the core module for a permanent space station in low Earth orbit by 2022. The space station will accommodate up to three astronauts for long-duration missions. CNSA aims to complete assembly of the space station in orbit with the launch of two additional modules by 2025. 

With a permanently crewed space station in place, China intends to test new technologies need for a lunar landing mission, including spacecraft docking and in-space refueling of return vehicles. CNSA's powerful Long March 9 rocket, currently under development, will be needed to launch large components into orbit for the space station and eventual moon missions.

"This 21st century should be the century of China's space science and exploration of the universe," said Wu Weiren, chief designer of China's lunar exploration program. "China will explore the whole solar system and reach into the farther universe."

A crewed lunar landing mission would likely take place in the late 2020s or early 2030s, according to the latest roadmap. CNSA sees establishing a long-term base on the moon as a step toward more ambitious space mining and interplanetary travel in the coming decades. China would join the ranks of only United States and Russian as the only nations to achieve such a historic milestone.

China launched its first astronaut into space in 2003, making it the third country ever to achieve human spaceflight. Since then, China has successfully completed five additional crewed missions aboard its Shenzhou spacecraft. China's most recent crewed mission was Shenzhou 11 in 2016, which hosted astronauts Jing Haipeng and Chen Dong aboard the Tiangong 2 space lab for 30 days, the longest Chinese human space mission to date.
