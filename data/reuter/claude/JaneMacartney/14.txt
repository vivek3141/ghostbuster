China's Hardline Dictum to Battle Hostile Western Influences Underlines Leadership's Poverty of Ideas 

The Chinese Communist Party last week issued new guidelines calling for intensified efforts to curb "wrong" ideologies from infiltrating China. The policy dictum targets what the leadership sees as harmful influences from the West, including constitutional democracy, universal values of human rights, press freedom, and the liberalization of cultural beliefs.

The policy announcement underscores the increasing paranoia of Xi Jinping and the party leadership. After decades of economic engagement with the West, the party now perceives openness to foreign ideas and cultural influences as an existential threat. However, the new crackdown also highlights the lack of confidence in the party's own ideology and values. Communism no longer offers a vision that can inspire the Chinese people or answer the challenges of modernity.

The policy document warns that "mistaken thought" has infiltrated all areas of society, including education, media, entertainment, and business. It calls for tighter control of universities, media, films, TV shows, books, and social media platforms to ensure they spread "correct thinking" that adheres to socialist values with Chinese characteristics. New bans and censorship are likely to follow.

The party's defensiveness stems from its failure to offer a vision of China's future that matches its citizens' aspirations. After decades of rising living standards and exposure to outside ideas, the public yearns for things like rule of law, freedom of speech, and government accountability - not the empty slogans the party promotes. Lacking faith in its own values, the party sees pluralism and open debate as threats to its survival.

Some analysts argue China should be confident in the strengths of its own culture and open up to diverse ideologies. Censorship and harsh crackdowns will only damage the government's legitimacy and fuel distrust in the long run. However, Xi Jinping has taken China in the opposite direction, consolidating power around himself and purging any hints of dissent within the party.

The new policy dictum signals Xi's determination to double down on ideological control. However, it also highlights the lack of vibrancy and imagination in the party's vision. After 70 years in power, communist slogans ring hollow while the party fears everything from university debate clubs to Hollywood movies. A leadership with more confidence in its purpose would embrace openness, diversity, and dissent rather than trying to battle "hostile" foreign influences at every turn. But that type of leadership seems unlikely to emerge under Xi's China.
