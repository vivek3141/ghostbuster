Chinese Dissident Wang Dan Could Stand Trial This Week for Alleged Plot to Overthrow Government: Family Claims Charge is Unfounded 

The Chinese dissident Wang Dan, a key leader of the 1989 student-led protests in Tiananmen Square, could stand trial in Beijing this week on charges of plotting to overthrow the Chinese government, according to his lawyers and family members. Wang was detained by Chinese authorities in October 2018 and formally charged with subversion last month. His sister and lawyers argue the charges are unfounded and a pretext to punish Wang for his continued political activism decades after the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.

Wang, 51, was a history student at Peking University who emerged as a leader of the student protests in 1989 that ended in a bloody military crackdown. He was imprisoned for his role and served four years in prison before being released and exiled to the United States, where he earned a PhD in history from Harvard University. He returned to China in the late 1990s and has been an outspoken critic of China’s authoritarian government while working as a political commentator and activist. 

According to Wang’s sister, Wang Juntao, state security officials detained Wang Dan in October 2018 at the airport after a trip to Taiwan. She was told at the time that he was being investigated for “harming national security.” However, she did not receive further details about the charges against him until last month. She claims the indictment for subversion is unjustified and “absurd,” but believes authorities will ensure Wang is convicted to justify holding him for over a year already. “This is all because he wouldn’t stay silent and kept promoting democracy and civil society in China,” she said.

Wang’s lawyers also argue there is no evidence to support the charges, but they expect a guilty verdict given China’s nearly 100% conviction rate. “We hope the trial can be held in open court, but we worry it may be closed given the nature of the charges,” said lawyer Zhang Keke. “Our argument will be that Wang Dan has only exercised his freedoms of speech and association, which are protected by China’s constitution.”

If convicted of subversion, Wang could face up to 15 years in prison. His treatment follows a pattern of harsh crackdowns on Chinese dissidents and human rights lawyers under President Xi Jinping. Wang’s supporters see the charges against him as a warning to other activists and a reminder of the government’s intolerance of political dissent and protest, even decades after events like the Tiananmen Square crackdown.

The news of Wang’s potential trial comes amid already strained relations between China and Western democracies over issues like Hong Kong’s freedoms, growing authoritarianism, and human rights abuses. Supporters are calling on international leaders to urge China to release Wang and other political prisoners. But China rejects such calls as interference in its internal affairs and continues to insist that it protects the lawful rights of its citizens. For now, all eyes are on the Beijing court to see if and when Wang will face trial—and how transparent or closed the proceedings may be.
