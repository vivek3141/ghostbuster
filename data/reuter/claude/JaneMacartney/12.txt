China's Communist Party warns against Western democratic ideals in new document

The Chinese Communist Party has issued a stern warning against the spread of Western democratic ideals and values in China. In a newly published document, the party warned that Western influence in China is threatening its grip on power. 

The document, published by the party's Central Committee, said that "some erroneous ideological trends, like promoting Western constitutional democracy, universal values and civil society, are attempting to undermine the party's leadership." The warning comes as China has tightened controls on dissent, civil society groups and Western influences under the leadership of President Xi Jinping.

The document emphasized that the Communist party's leadership over China is "unshakeable" and that all individuals and groups must align with the party. It called for strengthened ideological control and propaganda in schools, media, cultural institutions and cyberspace. The message is that Western-inspired ideas about democracy and civil liberties are incompatible with the China model and pose a threat to the authoritarian system.

"We must oppose the mistaken Western ideological trends of separating the three powers and advocating for checks and balances," the document said. The separation of legislative, executive and judicial powers is a key principle in Western democracies. The party sees it as undermining its centralized control.   

The stern message highlights Xi's ambition to build a superpower status for China based on the party's authoritarian model. But experts warn that suppressing outside ideas and dissent may backfire, especially among the younger generation of Chinese. "The Communist Party continues to tighten control to stem what it sees as dilution of power. But a confident and innovative nation should not fear outside influences," said Jane Smith, China scholar at Harvard University.

Xi has overseen a widespread crackdown on dissent and purge of political rivals since coming to power in 2012. The campaign has led to the detention of activists, rights lawyers and officials accused of corruption. Controls over the media, education and cultural sphere have also intensified under Xi. The new document is a reminder that the party will not tolerate any threat to its political monopoly and control in China, experts said. Its stern warning risks further straining China's relations with the democratic West.
