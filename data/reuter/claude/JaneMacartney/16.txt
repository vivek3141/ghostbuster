Winston Lord Wraps Up Cordial Talks on Human Rights and Korea During Low-Profile Visit to China 

BEIJING—Former U.S. Ambassador to China Winston Lord concluded two days of discussions with Chinese leaders today that addressed sensitive issues like human rights as well as the crisis on the Korean peninsula. Lord met with senior officials including Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Politburo member Yang Jiechi in what observers characterized as a low-key but substantive visit.
 
U.S. officials described the talks as "productive" and said Lord conveyed America's views on Democracy and freedom as well as regional security. “We had a chance to speak candidly on areas where we still differ in values and priorities, but also identify key areas of continued cooperation, including the denuclearization of North Korea,” Lord told reporters. The veteran U.S. diplomat is highly respected in China and served as ambassador under President Reagan from 1985 to 1989, overseeing a historic period of improved ties following decades of animosity.
 
While President Trump has pursued a policy of "America First" with an aggressive stance on trade and other economic issues, his administration has sought China's support in persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program. Strains over Tibet, Taiwan and the South China Sea were also believed to be discussed during the two days of meetings, although neither side revealed details. China continues to press the U.S. Congress to pass legislation easing restrictions on high-tech exports, but concerns persist over human rights and allegations of intellectual property theft.  
 
Lord's visit attracted little fanfare, in contrast to trips by more senior U.S. officials that have yielded few breakthroughs amid tense relations. “Given the drift toward more populist and nationalistic policies in both countries, these quiet dialogues play an essential role,” said Susan Shirk, chair of the 21st Century China Center at UC San Diego. Lord appears to have leveraged his personal familiarity and contacts within China's government to make progress on difficult issues.

China said the talks were “candid, in-depth, and positive.” The U.S. described them as building understanding on "shared concerns." With tightly controlled media coverage of Lord's visit, experts said it remained unclear what breakthroughs, if any, were achieved. But at a time of rocky relations, any substantive dialogue is welcome. Said former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd: “Lord's mission just may yield incremental progress. And right now, incrementalist gains are about the best either side can hope for.”
