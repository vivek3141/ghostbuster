U.S. Asia Official Holds Talks with China Deputy Foreign Minister on Human Rights and Other Issues  

Washington, D.C.—The Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs of the United States met with China’s Deputy Foreign Minister yesterday in Beijing. According to State Department sources, Assistant Secretary Patricia Mahoney and Deputy Foreign Minister Zhang Ping discussed a range of issues including human rights, trade policy, and regional security concerns during the meeting that lasted over two hours.

Mahoney emphasized the U.S. government’s continuing concerns about human rights violations and lack of religious freedom in China. Specifically, she raised the ongoing detention and oppression of Uighurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang province, as well as the crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong following the imposition of a national security law last year. Zhang denied that any human rights violations were taking place but agreed to keep communication open on the issues.

On trade, Mahoney and Zhang addressed the status of the “phase one” trade deal signed earlier this year and next steps for negotiations on a broader trade agreement between the two countries. Mahoney noted the several areas where China still needs to fulfill purchase commitments made under the initial deal despite economic headwinds from the global pandemic. Zhang promised that China intends to fully implement the deal but that further commitments would depend on resolution of existing tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. There are currently no plans for face-to-face meetings to discuss a “phase two” deal, though working-level discussions are continuing remotely.

Regarding regional security, Mahoney raised U.S. concerns over China's assertive actions in the South China Sea and East China Sea, including escalating tensions with Taiwan and Japan over disputed maritime territory.  Zhang denied acting provocatively but made no commitments to change course. Overall, while the meeting reflected the breadth and depth of U.S.-China engagement, there were no major breakthroughs on the complex set of issues that continue to strain the relationship between the two superpowers. The officials agreed to remain in close communication in the coming months as the new U.S. administration under President [name] determines its policy agenda and approach to China.
