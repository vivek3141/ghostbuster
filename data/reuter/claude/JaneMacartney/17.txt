China's latest pronouncement on freedom of expression in Hong Kong gives cause for concern, say analysts 

The Chinese government today issued new guidance asserting broad control over freedom of expression in Hong Kong, sparking concerns that political and civil rights in the territory are under threat.

The statement by China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office outlined limits around criticizing the Chinese Communist Party, promoting Hong Kong independence, and "endangering national security." Analysts said the pronouncement could be used to further curb free speech and political dissent in Hong Kong.

“This is a worrying signal that Beijing intends to place further restrictions on civil and political rights in Hong Kong,” said Lokman Tsui, assistant professor of journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “Freedom of expression is a fundamental right, but this policy suggests the central government is determined to control debate and dissent in Hong Kong.”

The new policy guidance comes after China imposed a broad national security law on Hong Kong last year that criminalized many forms of political dissent. Since the law came into effect, pro-democracy politicians and activists have been arrested, protest groups have disbanded, and someHong Kongers have fled into exile.

“Today's statement reinforces the reality that civil and political rights in Hong Kong are increasingly subject to Beijing’s control,” said Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Hong Kong authorities should reject unlawful restrictions on rights and freedoms, and protect Hong Kong people's ability to freely express themselves.”  

The Hong Kong government sought to reassure citizens that existing rights and freedoms remain intact. In a statement, the government said the policy guidance would not affect Hong Kong's institutional strengths, rule of law, and independent judiciary. 

But critics argue the national security law and other policies imposed by Beijing have already severely damaged civil rights in Hong Kong, including the right to free speech. Questions remain over how today's announcement will be implemented and whether it is legal under Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law.

Continued erosion of political and civil rights would raise doubts over whether Hong Kong can maintain its position as a global financial hub, analysts said. But with Beijing increasingly assertive and intolerant of dissent, prospects for restoring freedoms in Hong Kong appear slim without significant international pressure.
