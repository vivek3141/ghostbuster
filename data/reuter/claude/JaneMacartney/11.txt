Chinese dissident Wang Dan faces subversion charges based on critical writings and foreign funds, human rights group says 

Prominent Chinese dissident Wang Dan has been formally indicted on subversion charges by authorities in Beijing, according to a statement from Human Rights Watch. The indictment accuses Wang of "incitement to subvert state power" based on his published writings criticizing the Chinese government and accepting funds from overseas sources.

Wang has been detained since August 2018, when he was seized at Beijing Airport upon returning from a trip to Taiwan. Wang's wife has had very limited contact with him since his detention last year. The charges against Wang were filed in January but only made public this week, raising concerns that his prosecution is politically motivated. 

“Wang Dan has spent decades advocating peacefully for greater freedoms and accountability in China,” said Yaqiu Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Now he is once again being unjustly persecuted under China’s overly broad law on subversion.”

Wang, 50, rose to prominence as a student leader during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. He spent nearly seven years in prison for his role in the pro-democracy movement and has continued to openly criticize the Chinese Communist Party during his time in exile. He returned to China last year to seek medical treatment for an eye condition, according to friends.

The subversion charges appear to relate primarily to Wang's published writings, in which he has called on China to institute democratic political reforms and end authoritarian rule. He has also been accused of accepting funds from overseas donors to support these efforts, which authorities argue amounts to collusion with "foreign forces.” Some of these funds were used to publish and distribute political books and materials in China.

Under President Xi Jinping, China has pursued a broader crackdown on activists, dissidents, and human rights lawyers. The subversion law under which Wang was charged is frequently used to silence dissent and restrict political speech. Those found guilty of subversion can face up to life imprisonment.
