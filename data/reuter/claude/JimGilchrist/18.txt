Hong Kong Pilots Stay Connected with E-mail Addresses, Says Aircrew Officers' Association 

The Aircrew Officers' Association, which represents over 2,300 pilots in Hong Kong, announced today that all members now have official association e-mail addresses to improve communication. The move aims to ensure all pilots can stay up-to-date on important industry news and connect with each other, even when they are traveling or on layovers around the world.

"In today's fast-paced world, e-mail is essential for efficient communication and building community," said Captain Ming Lee, chairman of the Aircrew Officers' Association. "Our members are often in the air or in other countries, so we needed a simple way for them to stay in touch and share information. The new e-mail addresses achieve that goal."

Each member of the Aircrew Officers' Association has been assigned an e-mail address consisting of their membership number and @hkpilots.org. For example, if a member's number is 123, their official e-mail address would be 123@hkpilots.org. Members can now use these email addresses to receive newsletters, event invitations, and important industry updates from the association. They can also connect directly with other members to exchange tips or network.  

The move to assign all members official e-mail addresses received an overwhelmingly positive response, according to a recent survey. Over 95% of members said they consider e-mail a crucial tool for their jobs and daily communication needs. By providing e-mail addresses, the Aircrew Officers' Association hopes to increase member engagement, build an even stronger pilot community, and enhance the association's advocacy and support services. Overall, this initiative will help ensure Hong Kong's pilots have the resources and network they need to safely navigate the airways.
