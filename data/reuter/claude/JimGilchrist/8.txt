Salomon Brothers Predicts "Phenomenal" Growth for Thai Airways International and a Focus on Cargo Expansion  

International investment bank Salomon Brothers released a bullish report today forecasting strong growth for Thai Airways International (THAI) over the next five years. The report predicts THAI will achieve "phenomenal growth" through expansion of its cargo business and strategic partnerships with other airlines.

Salomon Brothers projects THAI's revenue passenger kilometers (RPKs) will increase by 9% annually through 2025 and its cargo traffic will rise by 12% per year over the same period. The cargo business is poised to become an increasingly important part of THAI's operations, according to the report. THAI plans to convert three of its Boeing 747 passenger jets into freighters in the coming year to boost its cargo capacity. It is also exploring wet lease agreements with dedicated cargo airlines to help meet growing demand.

The report highlights THAI's recent codeshare agreements with Air France-KLM and Lufthansa as positioning it well for European expansion. Salomon Brothers expects further commercial partnerships and joint ventures will contribute significantly to THAI's bottom line. CE OPrasert Prasarttong-Osoth recently said THAI is open to strategic alliances with a range of partners to improve connections, especially on long-haul routes to Europe and the Western United States.

While optimistic about THAI's prospects, the report does warn of downside risks including higher fuel costs, economic recession, overexpansion, and increased competition from low-cost carriers in Asia. However, barring major geopolitical upheavals, Salomon Brothers considers THAI well-placed for strong, sustained growth due to Thailand's popularity as a tourist destination and expanding middle class, the worldwide air cargo boom, and THAI's success in building key alliances and partnerships.

The Salomon Brothers report gives investors and analysts reason to be excited about the future of THAI. With prudent management of risks and a keen focus on building its cargo and partnership strategies, THAI seems poised to achieve the "phenomenal" success predicted in the report. The next few years look bright for Thailand's national carrier.
