UPS Asia-Pacific hub in Taiwan set to open in October with six new aircraft to connect US and Asian markets

United Parcel Service (UPS) announced today that its new Asia-Pacific air hub in Taoyuan, Taiwan is on track to open in October this year. The hub will serve as UPS' primary transit point for cargo moving between the U.S. and major cities across Asia. 

Six new Boeing 747-8F aircraft will be based at the Taiwan hub, increasing UPS' cargo capacity and connectivity between the U.S. and Asia by up to 30%. The aircraft will fly new routes connecting UPS' U.S. air hub in Louisville, Kentucky to Taipei and onward to major cities across Asia including Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Tokyo.

“Our new Asia-Pacific air hub gives UPS a strategic geographic advantage to better serve our customers in two of the world's most important trade lanes,” said UPS Airlines President Brendan Canavan. “The new routes will enhance time-in-transit from the U.S. to key Asian markets by up to one business day, enabling U.S. exporters to get their goods to customers faster.”

The $196 million Taiwan hub will have capacity to process up to 112,000 packages per hour and employ about 630 people once fully operational. Located on 33 acres, the hub includes sophisticated automated sorting technology, 50 aircraft parking positions, warehouse space, and office facilities.

UPS expects the Taiwan hub to handle up to 20% of its total Asian air volume when fully scaled. The six new 747-8F aircraft are part of a total order for 14 of the largest cargo jets in UPS’s fleet. The aircraft will begin arriving in October and will all be in service by early 2020.

While the U.S.-China trade tensions continue to escalate with both sides imposing additional tariffs, UPS is optimistic about continued growth in trade with other Asian markets. Asia-Pacific cross-border trade grew over 5% in 2018, according to the UPS 2019 Trade Forecast. The economies of Southeast Asian countries in particular remain buoyant, with growth rates of between 5 to 6% this year. UPS will be well positioned to facilitate booming trade flows across this dynamic region with its new Taiwan hub and added air capacity.
