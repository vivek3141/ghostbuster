Cathay Pacific Retires Iconic TriStar Fleet After Over Four Decades of Service  

Cathay Pacific today announced the retirement of its TriStar fleet after over 40 years of faithful service. The last commercial flight of the iconic TriStar aircraft took place today, marking the end of an era for Cathay Pacific and its passengers.

The TriStar first joined Cathay Pacific's fleet in 1979. With its spacious cabins and high reliability, the TriStar quickly became popular with passengers and helped cement Cathay Pacific’s reputation for inflight comfort and dependability. Cathay Pacific was fondly dubbed the ‘TriStar Pacific’ in its early years due to the prevalence of the aircraft in its fleet. At its peak, Cathay Pacific operated up to 21 TriStar aircraft, using them on medium and long-haul routes across its network.

While the retirements are bittersweet, Cathay Pacific Chief Executive Augustus Tang said the TriStar had served the airline well but was being retired as part of the company’s fleet renewal program. ‘The TriStar was the workhorse of our fleet for over 40 years and played an integral role in Cathay Pacific’s growth into one of the world’s leading airlines,’ Tang said. The TriStar will be replaced by more fuel-efficient aircraft like the Airbus A350 that provide an enhanced passenger experience while lowering operating costs and emissions.  

Many Cathay Pacific passengers have fond memories of flying on the TriStar, recalling its roomy cabins and comfortable seats. Flight attendants also had high praise for the aircraft, appreciating its spacious galleys and storage areas. While its time has passed, the TriStar’s impact on Cathay Pacific’s success will not be forgotten. The aircraft that helped define an era of air travel and propelled a great airline into the global limelight has well and truly earned its place in aviation history.
