Hong Kong sees 6.7 percent rise in air cargo handled in August compared to last year

The Hong Kong International Airport saw a 6.7 percent increase in air cargo handled in August compared to the same month last year. According to statistics released by the Hong Kong Airport Authority, the airport handled 434,000 tons of cargo in August this year, up from 407,000 tons in August 2018. 

The increase in cargo volume was driven primarily by transshipments, which accounted for 63 percent of the total cargo handled. Transshipments rose 7.5 percent year-on-year to 274,000 tons. Exports grew at a more modest 3.8 percent to 126,000 tons, while imports increased 9.2 percent to 34,000 tons.

Air cargo to and from mainland China and South Korea saw double-digit growth, increasing 15 percent and 12.3 percent respectively compared to last August. Air cargo to North America also expanded over 10 percent. However, cargo to Europe declined 3.4 percent.

Cargo flights increased 6.1 percent to 2,400 flights. Passenger flights also grew 3.1 percent to 5,000 flights. 

The strong cargo figures in August continue the general upward trend this year. In the first eight months, Hong Kong's air cargo volume expanded 3.5 percent year-on-year to over 3.12 million tons. The growth came despite a slowdown in the global economy amid uncertainties from the US-China trade war and Brexit.

Hong Kong International Airport is the world's busiest air cargo hub and contributes significantly to Hong Kong's economy. The sustained growth in air cargo reinforces Hong Kong's status as an international logistics and aviation hub. However, with weak demand in major economies, especially from China, the outlook for the second half of the year remains uncertain. The cargo industry is closely monitoring global trade developments and geopolitical events that could impact Hong Kong's air cargo growth.
