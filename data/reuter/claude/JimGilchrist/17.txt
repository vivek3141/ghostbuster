Cathay Pacific Successfully Transports Valuable Breeding Pigs to China  

Cathay Pacific Cargo successfully transported 60 premium breeding pigs from Australia to Zhengzhou in central China this week. The pigs, which are a special hybrid of Duroc, Landrace and Large White breeds, were flown over 7,000 miles in a chartered Boeing 747 freighter from Melbourne to Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport.  

The pigs were transported in specially designed crates that provided ample space, ventilation, and temperature control for the long journey. The crates were equipped with the pigs’ feed and secured in the lower deck of the freighter for the 9-hour flight across Asia. Upon arrival in Zhengzhou, the pigs underwent a veterinary inspection before being transported to their new home at a breeding facility. 

“Transporting live breeding stock requires the highest standards of animal welfare and handling,” said Frosty Wooldridge, Cathay Pacific Cargo’s Head of Special Cargo. “Our team has extensive experience safely transporting breeding pigs over long distances. By chartering a dedicated freighter, preparing tailored crates, and closely monitoring the pigs throughout the journey, we were able to provide a stress-free experience for these valuable animals.”

The pigs are part of a specialized breeding program to produce piglets that have improved characteristics for pork production. China has the largest pig population in the world, but demand for high-quality pork is increasing. These breeding pigs were transported to help augment and improve China's pig stock.  

“We are very pleased that these prized pigs have started their new lives in China, thanks to the expertise and care of Cathay Pacific Cargo,” said Greg Asbury, the pigs’ breeder in Australia. “Knowing our pigs were in good hands for this important trip gave us peace of mind every step of the way.” 

Cathay Pacific Cargo ships over 3 million tons of cargo worldwide each year, including pharmaceuticals, perishables, live animals, and other specialty cargo that requires customized handling and storage. The freighter used for this shipment, a Boeing 747-400ERF, is one of 26 dedicated cargo aircraft in the Cathay Pacific Cargo fleet.
