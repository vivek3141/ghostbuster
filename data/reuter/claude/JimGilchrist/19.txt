British Airways World Cargo Confident in Dramatic Improvement of Service Standards at Gatwick and Heathrow Airports

British Airways World Cargo, the dedicated cargo division of British Airways, today announced an ambitious plan to dramatically improve cargo handling capabilities and service standards at London's Gatwick and Heathrow airports over the next 18 months. The $150 million investment plan will include upgrading facilities, streamlining operations, improving technology systems, and retraining staff.   

The plan comes after a difficult year for British Airways World Cargo, with complaints rising over lost and delayed cargo shipments, especially at Heathrow Airport. New leadership at the cargo division has pledged to turn things around and transform the speed, efficiency, and reliability of cargo operations. “We fully recognize we have fallen short of expectations and the standards our customers deserve,” said Willie Walsh, CEO of British Airways parent company IAG. “This new investment plan will strengthen our cargo team, overhaul processes, and give customers confidence in our ability to deliver.”

Key initiatives include the installation of new high-speed conveyor systems to move cargo to and from aircraft more quickly, expanded cargo terminals and storage facilities, an upgraded IT platform to provide real-time shipment data to customers, and an intensive retraining program for all staff. British Airways World Cargo will also streamline the multitude of third-party ground handlers and subcontractors currently operating at Heathrow into a single, centralized operation for consistency and accountability.   

Industry analysts have responded positively to the plan but note it will be an immense challenge to implement. “There is no quick fix to deeply ingrained operational issues,” said David Bentley of Air Cargo Management Consulting. However, if successful, the transformation could cement Heathrow as a leading cargo hub in Europe. Rival carriers have already taken note, but British Airways World Cargo is confident these service improvements will help win and retain loyal customers in the long run. The program is set to begin next month, with the full roll-out of new facilities and systems targeted for early 2020.
