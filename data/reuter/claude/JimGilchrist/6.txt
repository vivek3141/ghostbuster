Hong Kong Freight Forwarders Warn of 20% Increase in Transpacific Air Cargo Rates

Freight forwarders in Hong Kong warned this week of impending air cargo rate increases of up to 20% on transpacific routes. The increases are attributed to tight capacity for air cargo due to the reduction in passenger flights during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

With many airlines drastically cutting passenger service in recent months due to travel restrictions and low demand, cargo capacity has been significantly limited. Passenger airlines typically carry cargo in the bellies of their aircraft, so fewer flights mean less available air cargo space overall. This supply-demand imbalance is driving air freight rates up, especially on long-haul routes between Asia and North America.

The situation is most acute for electronics, e-commerce goods, and medical supplies which dominate the transpacific air cargo market. Hong Kong is a key hub for these goods, with many products manufactured in Southern China and shipped via Hong Kong to reach end consumers in the U.S. and Canada. Freight forwarders say prices for moving goods on routes like Hong Kong to Los Angeles or Hong Kong to New York have already gone up 10-15% in some cases. They expect this trend to accelerate over the next few months.

Some relief may come from dedicated cargo airlines, who are adding extra flights to compensate for lost passenger airline cargo capacity. Cargo carriers like Cathay Pacific Cargo, Eva Air Cargo, and Korean Air Cargo are reportedly increasing flights to key destinations like Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and Chicago. However, the added cargo flights will unlikely replace the lost belly capacity in full.

Shippers and importers will likely face higher costs and potential shipment delays for products coming from East Asia during this period of constrained supply. The situation highlights the vulnerability of a manufacturing and distribution model so heavily focused on transportation by air, especially on long-haul routes. All parties will be hoping for a recovery in global trade and passenger travel to restore air cargo capacity and pricing to more stable levels.
