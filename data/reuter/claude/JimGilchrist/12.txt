Demand for Air Cargo Space Remains High During Hong Kong's Peak Season  

Hong Kong's peak season for air cargo is in full swing, and demand for cargo space on passenger and freighter aircraft remains persistently high. Capacity constraints and ongoing supply chain disruptions are driving up rates and exacerbating an already tight market.

Hong Kong is one of the busiest cargo hubs in the world, handling over 4.8 million metric tons of cargo in 2019. The peak season usually runs from September through early December to coincide with major retail events like Singles Day and the year-end holidays. This year, the peak season started particularly early due to restocking of depleted inventories. According to Hong Kong Airport Authority, cargo volume in August was down only 2% compared to last year, showing a strong rebound in activity. 

Passenger airlines have significantly reduced flying due to COVID-19, cutting available cargo capacity in their aircraft bellies. At the same time, e-commerce has surged this year, increasing demand for air shipping of goods. The capacity crunch has led to a spike in rates, with prices on some major trade lanes up 20-30% compared to last year. The Asia-North America market is seeing some of the tightest capacity and strongest rate increases.

Some freight forwarders report that space on passenger aircraft is sold out days or even weeks in advance. To bypass restrictions, some shippers are switching to freighter aircraft or trucking goods across the border to Shenzhen airport. However, freighter space is also tight, and rates are rising quickly. The limited capacity is making it difficult for shippers to move high-value and time-critical goods. 

The situation is exacerbated by ongoing supply chain issues like port congestion, trucking shortages, and warehouse capacity constraints. The delays add to the demand for air cargo to speed up shipping times. At the same time, a shortage of cargo handlers and ground staff at Hong Kong airport may slow down operations and further limit throughput.

Industry groups expect the capacity crunch to continue through the peak season and possibly into early next year. Much depends on how quickly passenger air travel recovers and airlines are able to reinstate more routes and frequencies. In the longer term, dedicated freighters may provide more stable capacity. But, in the peak season, any available space comes at a premium. Shipping early and at the best price may require flexibility, creativity, and close collaboration between shippers and their logistics partners.
