British Airways World Cargo to add fourth weekly freighter between Hong Kong and London  

British Airways World Cargo announced today that it will add a fourth weekly Boeing 747 freighter service between Hong Kong and London beginning in April 2021. The new flight will increase the cargo capacity on the route by over 20% to meet growing demand from customers.

“We have seen a steady increase in demand for cargo capacity between Asia and Europe over the past year,” said Tom Stoddart, Managing Director at British Airways World Cargo. “Adding a fourth weekly flight between our Hong Kong and London hubs will provide our customers with greater flexibility and reliability. Hong Kong remains a key market for us, and we want to ensure we have the right level of frequency and capacity to match our customers’ needs.”  

The new flight will operate on Sundays, complementing the existing Monday, Wednesday and Friday flights. British Airways first began operating dedicated freighter flights between Hong Kong and London in 2012 and currently uses Boeing 747-400ERSF aircraft on the route, each with a capacity of up to 124 tonnes. The airline said cargo loads on the route have increased nearly 30% over the past five years, driven in large part by the growth in e-commerce shipments between Asia and Europe.  

Pharmaceuticals, perishables, and technology products make up a significant portion of the cargo handled on the route. The shorter travel time of the direct flight, combined with British Airways’ investments in temperature-controlled and refrigerated facilities at both hubs, have made it an attractive option for shippers of temperature-sensitive cargo.  

The new freighter flight is set to commence operations on April 18, 2021, and will run year-round. British Airways said it will revisit the frequency again in October 2021 based on customer demand and feedback. The flight schedule is due to be uploaded into cargo booking systems today to allow freight forwarders and shippers to plan their shipments in advance.
