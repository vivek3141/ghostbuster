Air Macau Expects Significant Increase in Belly Cargo with New Aircraft and Routes to China  

Air Macau, the flag carrier of Macau, expects a significant increase in belly cargo capacity following the delivery of two new Airbus A321neo aircraft and the launch of new routes to several Chinese cities. The new aircraft will allow Air Macau to carry more cargo in the belly compartments of passenger aircraft, also known as belly cargo. 

The two new Airbus A321neo aircraft are set to join Air Macau's fleet in September and December of this year. These new generation aircraft provide about 23% more cargo volume than the older A320 aircraft currently in Air Macau's fleet. Air Macau plans to use the new A321neos to service higher-demand routes to Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, and Guangzhou, thereby opening up more belly cargo capacity on those routes.  

In an interview, Antonio Fernandes, Air Macau's Cargo Director, said, "The addition of two new A321neo aircraft and the expansion into new routes in China will provide a big boost to our cargo capacity and connectivity between Macau and major cities across China's western and eastern regions." He projects belly cargo volume to increase by 30-40% over the next 12 months following the induction of the new aircraft and launch of the new routes.

The new routes to Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, and Guangzhou are set to commence in October and will provide both passenger and cargo connectivity from Macau to these cities. The routes will be serviced three times per week initially, but frequency may be increased to daily depending on demand. These cities are major cargo hubs as well as sources and destinations for cargo in mainland China. Opening up direct routes to them will allow Air Macau to tap into substantial cargo volumes.

Air Macau currently offers cargo services to six destinations in Greater China and Southeast Asia, including Taipei, Kaohsiung, Seoul, Bangkok, Manila, and Ho Chi Minh City. Belly cargo and a small freighter fleet provide over 1,000 tonnes of weekly cargo capacity on Air Macau's network. The new aircraft and routes are expected to significantly boost the airline's cargo capacity and make Macau an even more attractive cargo transit point between China and the rest of Asia.
