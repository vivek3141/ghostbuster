Hong Kong's August air cargo handling rises by 6.7% compared to last year

Hong Kong's air cargo volume rose by 6.7% in August compared to the same month last year, signaling a rebound in trade activity for the export-driven Asian hub. The growth comes after months of decline due to the U.S.-China trade war and weakening global economy.

Hong Kong International Airport, one of the world's busiest cargo airports, handled 445,000 metric tons of cargo in August, up from 417,000 metric tons in the same month of 2018, said Airport Authority Hong Kong. Export cargo volumes grew 7.1% to 328,000 metric tons, while import cargo increased 5.8% to 117,000 metric tons. 

"The return to growth in August is an encouraging sign that business confidence and demand are starting to recover," said a spokesperson for the Airport Authority. "Despite the ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges, Hong Kong International Airport will continue to leverage its geographical advantage and reinforce its position as an international aviation hub."

The rise in air cargo volume in August was boosted by a rebound in trade with key markets, including the U.S., Europe, and ASEAN countries. Demand for electronic products and perishable goods exports contributed to the increase. Trade tensions between U.S. and China appeared to ease slightly in August, which also provided some relief for exporters.

However, analysts say it's too early to determine if Hong Kong's air cargo growth can sustain, given the uncertainty in global trade policy environment and China's slowing economy. For the first eight months of the year, Hong Kong's air cargo volume dropped 4.4% from the same period in 2018. The Airport Authority said it will closely monitor market changes and optimize resources to capture new opportunities.
