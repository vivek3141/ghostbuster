British Airways to Increase Passenger Flights to Hong Kong, Maintaining Freight Service on Wet Lease Basis  

British Airways announced today that it will increase passenger flight frequency between London Heathrow and Hong Kong from 14 to 21 flights per week starting in October. The airline currently operates double daily passenger flights between the two cities using Boeing 777 aircraft. With the increased flights, British Airways will offer triple daily service to meet growing demand on the popular route.

While boosting passenger flights, British Airways will maintain its dedicated all-cargo freight service to Hong Kong four times per week. However, the airline will transition from operating the freight flights with its own aircraft and crew to a wet lease arrangement with cargo operator Cathay Pacific Cargo. Under the wet lease agreement, Cathay Pacific will provide Boeing 747 freighter aircraft and crew to operate the cargo flights on behalf of British Airways. 

British Airways Director of Network and Alliances Sean Doyle said, “Hong Kong continues to be an extremely important destination for both business and leisure travelers. Adding additional passenger flight frequency is a testament to the strength of the market and our commitment to serve customers with the flexible schedule they desire. At the same time, transitioning our dedicated freighter service to a wet lease arrangement with Cathay Pacific Cargo will allow us to maintain high-quality cargo connectivity while optimizing our resources.”

The expanded passenger flight schedule and wet leased freighter service will commence on October 27, 2019, as part of British Airways’ winter schedule. Ticket sales for the new passenger flights started today for travel from October 27, 2019 through March 28, 2020. The additional seven flights per week are expected to add over 100,000 extra seats to the London-Hong Kong route on an annual basis. British Airways operates from Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport, while Cathay Pacific is based at Terminal 2.

The wet lease freighter agreement with Cathay Pacific Cargo is for an initial term of three years. British Airways said it will continue to evaluate market demand to determine if changes are needed to the schedule for its passenger flights and cargo aircraft in the future.
