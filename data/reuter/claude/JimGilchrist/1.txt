Hong Kong government negotiating new overflight arrangements ahead of 1997 handover to China

The Hong Kong government has entered into negotiations with China and the United Kingdom regarding new overflight arrangements that will come into effect after the handover of Hong Kong to China on July 1, 1997. Currently, Hong Kong air traffic control is responsible for all aircraft operating in the Hong Kong flight information region. After the handover, China will assume sovereignty over Hong Kong and its airspace.

Under the current arrangement, Hong Kong air traffic control directs aircraft through Hong Kong airspace and also handles en route traffic over the South China Sea. There are concerns that after the handover, China may reroute traffic away from Hong Kong airspace which could have major impacts on the territory's airport and airlines.  

Officials from Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department have been meeting with counterparts in China and the UK to hammer out post-1997 overflight arrangements and ensure Hong Kong's status as an international aviation hub is preserved. "Maintaining Hong Kong's attractiveness as an airport of choice for passengers and cargo is of paramount importance," said John Lee, Deputy Director-General of the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department. "We have proposed options that share control of certain air corridors with Guangzhou air traffic control to enable continued direct routings for aircraft transiting our region."

The UK, as the current sovereign administrator of Hong Kong, is also participating in the negotiations to help ensure the necessary autonomy is granted to Hong Kong after the handover. Some observers worry China may impose greater restrictions or charge higher overflight and air traffic control fees which could make Hong Kong a less competitive airport. However, officials from China's Civil Aviation Administration have stressed China will honor Hong Kong's established status. "There is no intention to cut off air access to Hong Kong or make major changes that would disrupt transit traffic after 1997," a spokesperson said. 

Negotiators aim to have new post-handover arrangements in place before July 1997 to provide airlines and passengers certainty. The status of Hong Kong's flight information region and air traffic control responsibilities remain a key issue that could shape Hong Kong's growth as a hub for international air travel and trade in the 21st century.
