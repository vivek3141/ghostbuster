Virgin Atlantic Cargo Announces New Shorter Route for Hong Kong to London Service, Cutting Journey Time by 1 Hour and Increasing Freight Capacity  

Virgin Atlantic Cargo announced today that it will begin operating a new shorter route for its cargo service between Hong Kong and London starting in October. The new route will cut about 1 hour from the total journey time and increase the freight capacity on each flight.

The new route will travel over Kazakhstan and parts of Eastern Europe instead of Russia and Ukraine, which Virgin Atlantic Cargo has been using for the last decade on this route. By flying over areas with less restrictive airspace and more direct flight paths, each trip between Hong Kong and London can be completed about 1 hour faster. 

“We are always looking for ways to optimize our routes and better serve our cargo customers,” said Linda Menezes, Vice President of Cargo Operations for Virgin Atlantic Cargo. “This new path for our Hong Kong-London route will allow us to make more efficient use of our aircraft and crew, flying more direct and spending less time on the ground during stops and layovers.”

The shorter travel time also means more available hours for cargo on each flight. Virgin Atlantic Cargo expects to increase the cargo capacity by about 3 to 4 tonnes on each flight, which amounts to space for dozens of additional pallets and containers. With the route operating three times per week, this can result in a significant boost to cargo volume over the course of a month.

The first flights on the new Hong Kong-London route will begin on October 2. Cargo arriving in London at the airline’s UK hub will have access to onward connections throughout the UK, Europe and North America. The route is served by Virgin Atlantic Cargo’s Boeing 747 aircraft, which are uniquely configured with both passenger seating as well as expanded cargo space on the main deck and lower hold.

While the Russia-Ukraine airspace provided more direct access between Hong Kong and London geographically, the new route will improve efficiency and allow the airline’s cargo arm to continue strengthening its presence in key Asian and European markets. According to Menezes, “The new Kazakhstan-Eastern Europe route puts our Hong Kong-London service on the path for sustained growth and competitive advantage. Our cargo customers shipping everything from electronics and e-commerce goods to fresh foods and pharmaceuticals will benefit from faster transits, increased capacity and the high-quality service Virgin Atlantic Cargo is known for.”
