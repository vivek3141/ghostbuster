U-Freight Holdings Eyes New Office in Guangzhou to Benefit from China Southern's Expanding Network  

U-Freight Holdings, a Singapore-based cargo and supply chain management company, is planning to open a new office in Guangzhou, China to capitalize on the expanding network of China Southern Airlines. Guangzhou is the main hub of China Southern and has seen significant growth over the past few years.

U-Freight currently has offices in 15 cities across Asia, including Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen in China. The new Guangzhou office will be its fourth location in China and 16th in Asia. The company handles air freight, sea freight, trucking, warehousing, and distribution for customers across industries ranging from telecommunications and technology to retail and healthcare.

"China Southern's mega hub in Guangzhou gives us tremendous opportunities to move cargo efficiently within China and connect it to the rest of the world," said Steven Lim, CEO of U-Freight Holdings. "A dedicated office in Guangzhou will allow us to build closer partnerships with China Southern Cargo and better serve our customers in the Pearl River Delta region."  

China Southern now operates more than 130 routes from Guangzhou, connecting the city to destinations in Asia, Oceania, Europe, North America, and South America. It recently added more flights to Southeast Asian cities like Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, and Jakarta. Guangzhou is also a major manufacturing hub in China, producing goods for both the domestic market and exports.

The new U-Freight office is scheduled to open in the third quarter of this year. It will have warehouse space and a team to handle import and export shipments, particularly for air cargo. U-Freight is bullish on opportunities from China's Belt and Road initiative, which aims to boost trade and connectivity between China and Eurasian countries.  

"With massive investments in infrastructure and logistics networks along the Belt and Road routes, we are anticipating strong demand for multimodal transport and logistics solutions," said Lim. "Our Guangzhou office and partnership with China Southern will allow us to participate fully in these growth opportunities."
