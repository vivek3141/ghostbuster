Reuters Report: Hong Kong Air Cargo Market Rates Continue to Rise Despite Eased Demand and Additional Capacity 

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Air cargo rates at Hong Kong International Airport continue to increase despite softened demand and additional bellyhold capacity, according to the latest data from Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (Hactl).

Cargo rates in October rose 5.3 percent from a year ago to HK$1.88 per kilogram, marking the 14th consecutive month of year-over-year increases. The rise in rates comes even as demand and traffic have eased in recent months. Hactl, which handles around 70 percent of the cargo throughput at Hong Kong International Airport, saw cargo volume decline 3.3 percent in October to 391,000 tonnes. For the January to October period, cargo volume fell 4.2 percent.  

The mismatch between higher rates and softening demand highlights the tight capacity in Hong Kong's air cargo market. Although some airlines have added more long-haul passenger flights utilizing bellyhold space for cargo, the additional capacity has not kept up with demand. Industry experts note a shortage of dedicated freighters, as many older aircraft have been retired in recent years to comply with stricter noise regulations.

The capacity crunch in Hong Kong has benefitted cargo handlers like Hactl and airlines that still operate freighter aircraft or have significant bellyhold space. But forwarders and shippers continue to face challenges moving cargo in and out of Hong Kong. Some have rerouted goods through alternate ports with more available capacity like Taipei, Shanghai and Dubai.

Hactl expects cargo volume and rates to remain high for the foreseeable future given the ongoing mismatch between supply and demand. The company projects full-year cargo volume to decrease around 3 to 4 percent, but average revenue per tonne to increase 4 to 6 percent.
