Evergreen International Airlines Increases Flights from Hong Kong Due to High Demand 

Evergreen International Airlines announced today that it will be increasing the frequency of flights from Hong Kong to several major cities in response to high demand. Starting next month, the airline will offer two additional roundtrip flights per week from Hong Kong to Los Angeles, New York, and London.

“We have seen a steady increase in passenger traffic from Hong Kong over the last few years, especially to and from North America and Europe,” said Chang Cheng-Hsiung, CEO of Evergreen International Airlines. “By adding more direct flights to key destinations, we aim to provide more options and flexibility for our customers to travel when and where they want.”
 
The new flights from Hong Kong will depart on Sundays and Wednesdays for Los Angeles and New York, and Mondays and Thursdays for London. Flights will be operated on Evergreen International Airlines’ fleet of Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, which seats up to 350 passengers and offers spacious and comfortable economy and premium cabins.
 
Evergreen International Airlines has responded to growing travel demand from Hong Kong before. In 2016, the airline increased flights to major Southeast Asian cities like Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. The airline is keen to capture more of the Asia-U.S. and Asia-Europe air travel markets, which have grown steadily over the last decade and are expected to continue strengthening in the coming years.
 
The latest frequency increases are good news for both business and leisure travelers looking to fly direct from Hong Kong. The additional choices and more available seats may also translate into lower fares over time due to increased competition. The new Sunday and Monday flights, in particular, aim to appeal to clients traveling over weekends and for work at the start and end of the week.

Evergreen International Airlines is based in Taiwan and is the aviation division of the Evergreen Group conglomerate. In addition to Hong Kong, the airline operates a network covering much of East and Southeast Asia, as well as destinations in North America, Europe, South Asia and Oceania.
