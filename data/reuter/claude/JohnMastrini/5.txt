Czech President Vaclav Havel condemns 11-year prison sentence for Chinese dissident Wang Dan

PRAGUE, Czech Republic - Czech President Vaclav Havel issued a statement today condemning the 11-year prison sentence handed down to Chinese dissident Wang Dan by Chinese authorities. Wang Dan, a leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests, was sentenced for "inciting subversion of state power." 

"The harsh, unjustified sentence given to Wang Dan is another sad example of China's complete disregard for human rights and democracy," Havel said. "Wang Dan has committed no real crime other than exercising his basic civil rights to free speech and political dissent."

Havel called on China to immediately release Wang Dan from prison. "No civilized nation in today's world should imprison its citizens just for speaking their minds and peacefully advocating for political reform," Havel said.

Wang Dan has already spent over 7 years in prison for his role in the 1989 protests. He was released in 1993 but was re-arrested in 1995 for writing and distributing essays criticizing the Chinese government and calling for democratic reforms.

"China hopes to be seen as a modern, world power but as long as it denies its citizens fundamental human rights, it will never be accepted or respected on the global stage," Havel said. He urged other world leaders to join him in pressuring China to release Wang Dan and all other political prisoners.

Havel has long been an outspoken advocate for human rights and democracy. As the leader of Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution, he helped transition the country from communist rule to democracy in 1989. He has condemned the Chinese government before for its oppressive policies and human rights violations.

China has defended Wang Dan's latest prison sentence, claiming he was inciting unrest and posed a threat to social stability and order in the one-party communist state. China bans any political dissent or protest and frequently imprisons activists, lawyers, journalists and others who speak out against the government and its policies. 

Wang Dan's harsh sentence was seen as a warning to other Chinese dissidents and reformists. But Havel and other human rights activists argue that China will never achieve true stability unless it grants civil liberties and democratic reforms. Harsh crackdowns only sow greater unrest and resentment, they say.

Havel called on China's leaders to "open their eyes" and realize that democracy and human rights were the only path forward to a prosperous, sustainable future. "The ideals of democracy can never be extinguished," he said. "China must change course now."
