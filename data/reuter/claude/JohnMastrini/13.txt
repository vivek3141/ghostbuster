Komercni Bank President Runs for Senate to Clean Up Czech Banking Sector  

Prague, Czech Republic - The longtime president of Komercni Banka (KomBank), the Czech Republic’s third largest bank, announced today that he will run for Senate in the upcoming elections. Frantisek Novak, who has served as KomBank’s president for 12 years, said he is running primarily to push for much-needed reforms in the Czech banking sector. 

The Czech banking industry has faced numerous scandals and crises in recent years that have undermined public trust. Most recently, police raided the headquarters of Ceska Sporitelna, the largest bank, as part of an investigation into fraudulent loans and money laundering. The scandal follows the collapse of Sberbank CZ in 2019 due to bad loans, as well as the failure of several smaller banks and credit unions.

Novak has been an outspoken critic of the lax regulations and oversight that allowed these banking failures to happen. “We have too long tolerated risky, unethical and in some cases illegal behavior by banks in the Czech Republic,” Novak said at a press conference announcing his Senate bid. “It is time for change if we want a secure, trustworthy financial system.”

As a Senator, Novak said he would push for legislation to strengthen bank supervision, increase transparency and consumer protections, and impose harsher penalties on financial institutions that break the law. His calls for reform resonate with a public that has grown wary of the banking sector, although some argue new regulations could constrain lending and economic growth.

Novak, 58, has spent his entire career at KomBank, starting as a teller in 1981 and rising to become president in 2008. Under his leadership, KomBank has thrived while avoiding the scandals and risky practices that have befallen other Czech banks. If elected, Novak would take a leave of absence from KomBank to serve in the Senate seat, representing the Prague 2 district.  

While polls show Novak starts with a high favorability rating owing to his reputation as an ethical banker, he is still a political newcomer facing experienced opponents. His main rival is Alena Kohoutková, a city council member who has represented Prague 2 for the last 12 years. Kohoutková argues that Novak does not have enough political experience for the Senate and will face a steep learning curve. 

Novak counters that his experience in finance would provide much-needed expertise in the Senate. He also believes voters are ready for change and new leadership. The election in Prague 2 is shaping up to be a closely fought race that could be decisive in determining the political direction of the banking sector. For a public that has grown disillusioned with politics as usual, Novak may appear an attractive outsider working to fix a broken system he knows from the inside.
