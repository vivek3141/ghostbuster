Czech GDP Growth Revision Lowered Due to Decreased Export Demand from Germany

The Czech Republic's central bank lowered its forecast for the country's economic growth this year, citing decreased demand for the country's exports from Germany, its largest trading partner. 

The Czech National Bank cut its prediction for GDP growth in 2019 to 2.4% from 2.9% previously. The bank pointed to several factors weighing on the economy, including declining automotive production in Germany, uncertainty caused by global trade disputes, and a slowdown in the euro area, the Czech Republic's main export market.

Germany is the top destination for Czech exports, accounting for more than 30% of total exports. Exports of goods and services comprise nearly 80% of the Czech Republic's GDP, making the economy highly dependent on demand from export markets. The auto industry makes up a substantial portion of Czech exports, with almost 20% of Czech automotive production exported to Germany.  

With the German economy slowing substantially and German carmakers lowering forecasts, Czech automotive and other exporters have seen a drop in orders from Germany. "There are signals pointing to a weakening of foreign demand, mainly in the automotive industry," the Czech central bank said in its quarterly forecast. "Automobile production in Germany has declined, which has been reflected in fewer orders for Czech exporters."

The bank also cited global trade tensions and potential tariffs between the U.S. and EU as a source of uncertainty that could further dampen Czech exports. The trade dispute could escalate and slow Czech auto exports to the U.S., the Czech Republic's second-largest export market.

At the same time, consumer spending and wage growth remain strong in the Czech Republic, and the unemployment rate is at record lows. However, the central bank said private consumption will not be enough to offset the effects of reduced export demand. "The growth of foreign demand has slowed down, and domestic demand alone will not suffice to maintain the current pace of economic growth," the bank said.  

While the outlook has weakened, the Czech central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2.0% following its policy meeting this week. The bank wants to avoid raising rates as export growth slows, even as inflation rises and the economy reaches full employment, in order to give the export sector support. The bank indicated it would keep rates steady for the rest of this year but may need to start raising them in 2020 as inflationary pressures build.

The downward revision in Czech growth highlights the country's economic dependence on exports, particularly to Germany. With the German economy slowing and global trade uncertainty clouding the outlook for export demand, the Czech Republic faces risks to its growth this year and beyond. The central bank stands ready to keep interest rates at low levels until export growth stabilizes, even as the country's domestic economy remains robust. But over the longer run, diversifying its export markets and reducing reliance on any single country could help shield the Czech economy.
