Czech Inflation Slows Slightly in October, Matching Economists' Forecasts 

Consumer price inflation in the Czech Republic slowed slightly in October, coming in at 8.7% annually and matching analysts' estimates. The October figure represents a modest slowdown from September's 8.9% rate, but still remains elevated and well above the Czech National Bank's 2% target.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.4% in October following a 0.8% increase in September. The deceleration was largely due to slower growth of prices of housing, utilities and alcoholic beverages. However, prices of food, transport, and recreation continued to grow at a robust pace, pointing to persistent broad-based inflationary pressures in the economy.

The persistent inflation is posing a challenge for the Czech Central Bank, which has raised interest rates five times already this year in an effort to curb rising prices. The benchmark two-week repo rate currently stands at 7%, and most economists expect additional rate hikes before the end of the year and into 2023 as the bank tries to bring inflation back to target.  

Higher interest rates, while aimed at controlling runaway inflation, also risk slowing the broader economy by making borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers. The Czech economy has so far remained largely resilient, powered by solid consumer spending due to tight labor market conditions and rising wages. However, the central bank and many analysts worry that fast-rising prices and higher interest costs may start to dampen consumer and business sentiment if left unchecked.

Petr Studniƒçka, head of the price statistics department at the Czech Statistical Office, commented: "Inflation is still predominantly influenced by external causes, especially high prices of energy and raw materials. Their impact is gradually passing through to other sectors of the economy."  

The Czech National Bank targets 2% inflation and has said it will use all tools at its disposal, including additional interest rate hikes, to meet the target in a sustainable manner. Its next policy meeting is scheduled for December 22 when most economists expect another quarter-point rate hike. The central bank will likely evaluate whether the October inflation data shows sufficient progress in slowing price growth before determining the pace and magnitude of any further rate increases.
