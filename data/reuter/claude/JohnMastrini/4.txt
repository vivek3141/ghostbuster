Czech National Bank proposes merging two banks to create largest post-Communist Eastern European megabank and privatising "Big Four"  

The Czech National Bank today proposed a radical restructuring of the country's banking sector, including merging the two largest banks, Ceska Sporitelna and Komercni Banka, and selling minority stakes in the "Big Four" state-controlled banks to private investors. The proposals aim to strengthen the competitiveness of Czech banks in the face of intensive consolidation in European banking, as well as tackle the state's high ownership of the banking sector, a legacy of the Communist era.

Under the proposals, Ceska Sporitelna and Komercni Banka, currently the first and second largest banks in the Czech Republic, would be merged to create what would be by far the largest bank in post-Communist Eastern Europe with assets of over $50 billion. The merged bank would dwarf other Eastern European banks and be comparable in size to large Western European banks like Barclays and BNP Paribas. The bank would operate under the Komercni Banka brand.

In addition, the Czech National Bank proposed selling minority stakes of around 30-49% in the country's four largest banks - Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka (CSOB), Komercni Banka, Ceska Sporitelna and UniCredit Bank Czech Republic - to private strategic investors in order to diversify ownership and introduce private capital and expertise. Together these "Big Four" banks control about 60% of the Czech banking market. They are currently majority state-owned, holding legacies from the post-Communist privatisation of the 1990s.  

The proposals require approval by the Czech government and parliament to implement and are part of a broader set of reforms aimed at boosting competition and growth in the Czech economy. Moody's, the rating agency, said the merger of Ceska Sporitelna and Komercni Banka, as well as the privatisation of the "Big Four" banks, would be "credit positive" as it would strengthen the competitive position and governance of the banks. However, the plans face opposition, including from Ceska Sporitelna's labour unions concerned about potential job losses.

If approved and successfully implemented, the proposals would dramatically transform the Czech banking landscape and mark a major step in unwinding the Czech state's legacy control over parts of the economy. The creation of a dominant national champion bank and opening of the "Big Four" to private capital would bring both opportunities as well as competitive pressures. After nearly three decades, the Czech Republic is set for a new era in its post-Communist banking system. But negotiating the proposals through the political and economic interests involved is sure to be complex with an uncertain outcome.
