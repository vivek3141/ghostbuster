Skoda Launches New Sedan, Hoping to Leave Communist-Era Quality Jokes Behind 

Skoda, a Czech automaker that was once the butt of jokes about shoddy quality during the country's communist era, unveiled a new sedan this week aimed at competing with mid-range models from Toyota, Hyundai, and Volkswagen.

The Skoda Octavia, priced starting at $21,000, is the latest model in Skoda's effort to shed its image of producing poorly made cars during decades of communist rule that ended in 1989. Under communist control, Skoda was known for waiting lists to buy cars that often had failing brakes, faulty electronics and rusting bodies.

Skoda began turning its reputation around after being acquired by Volkswagen Group in 1991. Leveraging VW's technology and quality standards, Skoda introduced new models that steadily gained appeal for solid engineering and value. Sales and revenue have surged over the past decade, with operating profit margin rivaling Volkswagen's.

The new Octavia illustrates Skoda's progress. Reviewers praised its premium feel and handling, high-tech features like advanced driver-assistance systems, and roomy interior despite being classified as a compact sedan. Some called it a "budget Audi" that could woo customers away from the Volkswagen Golf or Jetta.

"Skoda has come a long way since the days when 'How do you double the value of a Skoda?' was answered with 'Fill the tank,'" said Ian Fletcher, an auto analyst in London. "They've proven they can compete on quality, technology, design and performance while still maintaining their reputation for good value."

The Octavia will be a pivotal test of Skoda's makeover and prospects to keep growing despite a weakening economy. Annual sales have risen sixfold since being bought by Volkswagen to more than 1.2 million cars last year. The new model goes on sale in Europe this month, followed by China and other markets. 

"We've spent 30 years rebuilding trust and our reputation, model by model, customer by customer," said Alain Favey, Skoda's board member for sales. "The Octavia is another opportunity to show just how far we've come."
