Pro-Market Prime Minister's Party Dominates First-Round Senate Elections, Financial Markets React Neutral to Mildly Positive  

In a clear show of confidence in the reformist agenda of Prime Minister Sam Adams, voters gave his ruling Action Party solid majorities in the first round of Brazil's biennial Senate elections on Sunday. The pro-market Action Party won 40 of 81 seats up for grabs across 26 states, extending its control of the upper chamber. The leftist Workers' Party placed second, taking 25 seats, according to electoral authorities. 

The strong performance is likely to soothe investors who were concerned a weaker showing could hamper Adams' ambitious overhaul of Latin America's largest economy. The benchmark Ibovespa stock index was up 1.2% in early Monday trading, while the real gained slightly against the dollar.

Still, the results suggest Adams will continue to face significant opposition to parts of his legislative agenda, including an unpopular pension reform bill that would reduce government spending on benefits for civil servants. The Action Party will need support from smaller parties to pass legislation in the Senate.

"The government's reform process remains challenging, but this result provides more political momentum and flexibility," said Richard Kohl, head of Latin America research at Capital Economics in New York. "The pension reform is still going to require extensive negotiation and compromise."

The election was the first of two rounds of Senate voting this year, with a runoff for some seats scheduled for Oct. 30. Action and Workers' parties were competing for 10 of the seats up for grabs Sunday, making it an important bellwether ahead of presidential elections in 2022. 

Adams has pledged to trim budget deficits, reduce red tape and make it easier to hire and fire workers as part of an effort to accelerate economic growth in Brazil, where the recovery from a punishing 2015-2016 recession has been frustratingly slow. His package of market-friendly reforms has attracted strong support from the business community but has proven divisive with voters.
