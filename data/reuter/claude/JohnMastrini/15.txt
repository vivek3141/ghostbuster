Czech Republic Forecasts Record Tourism Income in 1996, Boosting Economy Amid Trade Deficits 

The Czech Republic is expecting tourism revenue to reach a record $3.5 billion in 1996, boosting its economy as the nation struggles with sizable trade deficits. The Czech tourism agency forecasts the number of visitors to rise 7% to 6.5 million this year, with robust growth from Germany, Poland, Slovakia, and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe.

Tourism has become a key industry for the Czech Republic since the fall of communism in 1989. Beautiful historic cities like Prague, Brno, and Cesky Krumlov, combined with a well-developed infrastructure, affordable prices, and a strategic location in the heart of Europe have made the country an attractive tourist destination. Tourism now accounts for about 5% of the nation's GDP and has created over 200,000 jobs in the hospitality industry.

The tourism boom comes as the Czech Republic is grappling with substantial trade deficits that threaten its economic stability. The nation ran a record trade deficit of $3.7 billion in 1995 as imports far outpaced exports. The deficits have put downward pressure on the Czech crown, the national currency, fueling concerns about rising inflation. The tourism revenue provides a crucial source of foreign exchange that helps offset the trade imbalance.

Government officials say tourism growth is a high priority and are taking steps to ensure continued gains. Efforts are underway to attract more long-haul visitors from the United States, Canada, Japan and elsewhere. The country is also looking to diversify beyond Prague to promote other destinations. "We want visitors to see the Czech Republic as a country of culture, history, nature and sports, not just the city of Prague," said Marketa Kalousova of the Czech Tourism Agency.

While Prague will likely remain the top destination, with record numbers of tourists visiting landmarks like St. Vitus Cathedral, the astronomical clock, and the historic Old Town Square, other cities are gaining appeal. The historic city of Cesky Krumlov in southern Bohemia, for example, has become a UNESCO World Heritage site and seen tourism growth over 20% annually for the past five years. Spas, castles, and rural countryside are also drawing more visitors. 

The record tourism forecast for 1996 is an encouraging sign for the Czech economy. If trade deficits continue to pose a threat, the strong influx of foreign visitors and their money may help the Czech Republic avoid further economic overheating and maintain stable growth. The tourism sector is proving to be a vital and still expanding part of the nation's future prosperity.
