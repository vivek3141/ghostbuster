Italy Advocates for NATO Integration of Slovakia and Romania

The Italian government has officially endorsed the membership of Slovakia and Romania in the NATO alliance. In a statement released today, the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Italy "fully supports the Euro-Atlantic aspirations of Slovakia and Romania and believes they would be valuable members of the NATO alliance."

Slovakia and Romania, formerly part of the Soviet bloc, have sought closer ties with the West since the end of the Cold War. They joined the European Union in 2004 but have not yet been integrated into the NATO alliance. NATO membership requires unanimous consent from existing member states. 

Italy's public support adds momentum to the membership bids of Slovakia and Romania. As a founding member of NATO, Italy's backing carries significant weight within the alliance. Italian officials stated that Slovakia and Romania "share the values of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law" that underpin the NATO alliance.

Membership in NATO would strengthen military and security cooperation between Slovakia, Romania, and NATO members. It would also reinforce democratic reforms and institutions in the two formerly communist countries. Leaders in Slovakia and Romania welcomed Italy's announcement, expressing hope that it will encourage other NATO members to endorse their bids.

Russia, however, opposes NATO expansion into former Soviet-dominated territories. As NATO has enlarged eastward, Russia has viewed it as an encroachment on its traditional sphere of influence. Russian officials have previously warned against Slovakia and Romania joining NATO.

The United States, Canada, and most Western European members of NATO support the membership of Slovakia and Romania. With Italy now publicly advocating for their bids as well, Slovakia and Romania appear poised to potentially join the alliance at its summit next year. Membership would require approval by all 29 existing NATO member states at the summit.

Italy's announcement underscores its strategic interests in transatlantic cooperation and a Europe whole, free and at peace. As the geopolitical landscape shifts, Italy and NATO seek to gain reliable new partners that can strengthen the alliance. Slovakia and Romania seem willing and capable to take on that role, with Italy and other advocates paving the way for their integration into NATO.
