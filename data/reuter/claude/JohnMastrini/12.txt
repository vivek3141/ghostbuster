Czech Republic's Tourism Sector Sets to Break Income Records Despite Bleak Trade Figures

The tourism industry in the Czech Republic is on track to generate record income this year despite lackluster trade numbers in other sectors of the economy. According to the latest report from the Czech Tourism Authority, foreign visitors spent over $8 billion in the Czech Republic in the first half of 2019, a 6% increase from the same period last year. If this trend continues, the country is projected to surpass $16 billion in total tourism revenue for the year, setting an all-time record. 

The growth in tourism is in sharp contrast with declining exports of goods and stagnating wages across the Czech economy. Export growth slowed to 2.4% in 2018, down from 8% in 2017, and wages rose only 3% last year, still below inflation. The Czech economy remains heavily dependent on exports, especially to neighboring Germany, making the tourism boom a bright spot.

Prague remains the top destination for visitors, attracting over 8 million tourists in 2018. However, smaller cities like Cesky Krumlov, Telc, and Trebon are also experiencing a surge in visitors, suggesting the growth in tourism is spread throughout the country. The Czech government and local municipalities have invested in tourism infrastructure and launched marketing campaigns to promote destinations beyond just Prague.

The tourism sector now employs over 350,000 people in the Czech Republic, making it an increasingly important driver of job growth, especially for younger Czechs. Government officials hope that as visitors venture beyond Prague, tourism revenue and jobs will also spread to more remote regions. However, some residents worry that an influx of tourists may strain infrastructure and drive up housing costs in their communities.

With no signs of slowing, the booming Czech tourism industry is proving remarkably resilient to an otherwise softening economy. While trade tensions and slowing growth in Germany pose risks, a weak Czech Koruna continues to make the country an attractive and affordable destination for foreign visitors. If current trends continue, tourism may provide an increasingly vital economic lifeline for the Czech Republic in the coming years. Overall, a record-breaking year for visitors spells good news for this Central European nation.
