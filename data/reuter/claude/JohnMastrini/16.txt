Skoda Auto Launches New Sedan Octavia, Aiming to Shed Communist-Era Reputation and Boost Profits 

Skoda Auto, the Czech automaker that is now a subsidiary of Volkswagen Group, launched its new sedan Octavia today in an effort to update its brand image and increase profits. The Octavia is Skoda's flagship model and accounts for nearly half of the company's sales.

For decades, Skoda was known for producing poor-quality, unreliable cars during its time as a state-run company in communist Czechoslovakia. After the fall of communism in 1989 and Skoda's takeover by Volkswagen in 1991, Skoda began producing more modern, dependable, and stylish vehicles. However, its lingering reputation for shoddy communist-era cars has been slow to fade in Western markets.

The new Octavia features a sleek new design, the latest advanced driver assistance and infotainment systems, and environmentally friendly hybrid engine options. "The Octavia is a representation of our brand and how far we've come from the days of being known for unattractive, unreliable cars," said Skoda CEO Bernhard Maier at the launch event. "This new model will boost our profits and continue to raise our brand esteem, especially in Western Europe."

Last year, Skoda's operating profit declined due to pricing pressures and rising costs. The Octavia's higher profit margins will help Skoda meet its target of lifting operating profit this year. Skoda is also aiming for further expansion into more markets, including North America and China.

The new Octavia will arrive in Skoda's showrooms in Europe next month and in other markets in early 2020. According to industry analysts, the Octavia's fresh style and new features will appeal to both new and existing Skoda customers, helping shed lingering associations with Skoda's communist past and cementing its reputation as a solid competitor in the midsize family sedan segment. The Octavia looks set to build on Skoda's record of over 6.5 million units sold worldwide since the nameplate's debut in 1959.
