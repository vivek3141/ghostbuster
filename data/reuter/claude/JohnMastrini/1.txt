Czech company CKD wins $200 million contract to supply trams to Manila metro project

Prague-based engineering company CKD Group announced today that it has won a $200 million contract to supply trams for the Metro Manila Subway project in the Philippines. CKD will deliver 72 trams for the new metro line over the next three years. This is the largest supply contract in CKD's history and marks the company's expansion into the growing Asian transportation market.

The new Manila metro line will span over 30 kilometers and include 12 stations connecting Quezon City in the east to the Manila International Airport in the west. The Czech trams will service the full route, offering air-conditioned carriages and space for up to 300 passengers per tram. CKD CEO Jiri Kula said, "We are delighted to have been selected for this prestigious project that will benefit over 300,000 passengers per day. Our world-class trams will provide safe, comfortable and environmentally-friendly transport for the people of Manila."

CKD has long been one of Europe's leading producers of rail vehicles. Founded in 1884, the company was originally part of the former Czechoslovak industrial conglomerate CKD Prago Union. Today, CKD Group is an independent company employing over 3,000 people in the Czech Republic and Poland with annual revenues over $500 million. CKD has supplied trams, locomotives and trains to many cities in central and eastern Europe and now aims to expand its global footprint with the Manila metro contract.

Manila's subway system is currently limited to just one line but major expansion is underway to modernize transportation infrastructure in the densely populated metropolitan area of over 13 million people. The new 12-station line will provide much-needed underground transit in the city and is expected to reduce road congestion and traffic once operational. Test runs of the new Czech trams are scheduled to begin in 2023 with full operations commencing in 2025. The Manila metro contract opens up further opportunities for CKD to supply trams to other metro systems within the fast-growing Southeast Asian region.
