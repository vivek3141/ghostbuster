Czech President Havel condemns Chinese court for jailing dissident on subversion charges

Prague, Czech Republic - Vaclav Havel, the president of the Czech Republic and a renowned human rights activist, issued a strong condemnation of the Chinese government for sentencing a prominent dissident to 11 years in prison on charges of subversion. 

Liu Xiaobo, a 54-year-old academic and democracy activist, was sentenced by a Beijing court on Christmas Day. According to Chinese officials, Liu was convicted of “inciting subversion of state power” for his role in Charter 08, a manifesto calling for political reforms and greater freedoms in China. Over 300 Chinese intellectuals and activists signed the charter, which was published in 2008.

In a statement, President Havel called the charges against Liu “trumped up” and said the harsh sentence was a “travesty of justice.” Havel argued that Liu was being persecuted by Chinese authorities merely for peacefully exercising his right to free speech and political dissent. “Liu Xiaobo is a courageous man fighting for fundamental human rights that we all hold dear,” Havel said. “This unjust punishment highlights the Chinese leaders' continued contempt for civil and political rights.”

Havel urged the international community to pressure China to release Liu immediately and unconditionally. He said China's leaders needed to understand that "respect for human rights is not an internal matter of any country, but rather a basic rule governing civilized international relations."

Liu's sentence was condemned by rights groups around the world, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. They view Liu as a prisoner of conscience who is being persecuted by China's authoritarian regime in violation of international law. China's leaders, however, say that Western critics are interfering in China's internal affairs. Liu's case highlights the ongoing tensions between China's communist leadership and Western democracies over civil liberties and dissent. 

The harsh sentence against Liu shows that China's human rights situation continues to deteriorate, despite the country's increasing political and economic clout on the world stage. President Havel and other world leaders argue that more must be done to pressure China to uphold the basic political freedoms of speech, assembly and dissent that are commonplace in democracies worldwide.
