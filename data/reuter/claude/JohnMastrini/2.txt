U.S. Defence Department Dismisses Czech Army Detections of Chemical Agents During Gulf War as False Alarms  

The U.S. Department of Defense today dismissed detections of chemical  agents during the Gulf War by the Czech army unit as false alarms. In a statement, Pentagon officials said an investigation into the detections found “no evidence to corroborate the Czech unit's reports of chemical agent presence.”

The dismissals call into question the Trump administration's recent citation of the Czech detections as evidence that disproved a long-denied finding by the Pentagon that there were no confirmed chemical weapons attacks during the Gulf War. The Czech unit was part of a multinational force in the region during the war and reported detecting mustard gas and sarin on multiple occasions in early 1991.

"We have thoroughly reviewed historical reports of chemical agent detection during the Gulf War, including those by the Czech chemical defense unit,” the Pentagon statement read. “Through archived records, environmental data, and health monitoring, we found no evidence to substantiate the claims of chemical weapons that these reports indicated."

The Czech government has stood by its unit's reports, saying they were properly investigated at the time. But U.S. officials said the review found "significant inconsistencies" in the Czech reports that led them to believe the detections were "false readings triggered by equipment malfunctions or operator errors, and not real chemical agents." The officials did not provide further details about the alleged inconsistencies.

Some former U.S. military officials criticized the Pentagon's statement. "It's suspicious that these detections were dismissed outright, without a credible alternative explanation for what triggered them if not chemical agents," said retired Col. Theodore Sarandis, who led a chemical defense unit during the Gulf War. "There are too many reports from too many credible witnesses to ignore them entirely."
