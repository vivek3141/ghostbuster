Head of Czech Republic's largest bank aims to clean up post-communist banking sector from a Senate seat 

Pavel Kysilka, the chief executive of Ceska Sporitelna, the Czech Republic’s largest bank, is aiming to overhaul the country’s banking sector by running for a seat in the Czech Senate this fall. If elected, Kysilka has pledged to push for new legislation to increase transparency in the banking industry, reduce corruption, and align standards with Western European norms.

Kysilka has served as CEO of Ceska Sporitelna since 2011, helping guide the bank to steady profits and increased lending activity following the global financial crisis. However, he has grown increasingly frustrated with the broader Czech banking sector, which he says still operates under outdated laws and practices from the communist era. In particular, Kysilka has called for new laws to prevent risky lending practices, money laundering, and conflicts of interest.

"The Czech banking sector needs to modernize to meet the standards of 21st century Europe," Kysilka said in an interview. "While Ceska Sporitelna operates with strong risk management and ethical practices, not all banks in the Czech Republic do the same. It is time for reform."

The Czech Republic transitioned to a market economy in the early 1990s following the Velvet Revolution and the end of communist control. However, critics argue the banking system still retains some problematic tendencies from that era, including a lack of transparency, cozy relationships between bankers and politicians, and risky lending behavior. The Czech central bank has tried to address some of these issues but has faced obstacles in getting legislation through parliament.

If elected to the Senate, the upper chamber of the Czech parliament, Kysilka would aim to draft and advance new laws to curb risky mortgage lending, prevent conflicts of interest in the banking sector, and strengthen anti-money laundering controls. He would also support giving the central bank more supervisory authority, a move he believes could help reduce corruption. 

Kysilka’s calls for reform align with anti-corruption watchdogs who argue more needs to be done to address lingering weaknesses in Czech democracy. Transparency International ranked the Czech Republic as one of the most corrupt countries in Western Europe, and a series of bribery and kickback scandals have weakened trust in public institutions. Cleaning up the banking sector could help begin restoring Czech citizens’ faith in the system, supporters argue.

However, Kysilka’s reform proposals face substantial opposition, particularly from smaller banks that benefit from the status quo and politicians profiting from it. They argue new regulations are unnecessary and would undermine the competitiveness of Czech banks. The race for Kysilka’s Senate seat is also expected to be competitive, with a crowded field of candidates vying to join the 81-member chamber.

Kysilka remains confident that voters are ready for change. After decades of promises to clean up corruption, he believes concrete legislation targeting obvious abuses of power could mark an important turning point for the country. And as head of Ceska Sporitelna for the last decade, Kysilka feels well prepared to draft impactful yet prudent laws benefitting both Czech citizens and the banking sector overall.

“I want to use my experience from transforming Ceska Sporitelna to now help transform and modernize the entire Czech banking industry,” Kysilka said. “It will be difficult, but that has never stopped me before. This country is ready for reform.”
