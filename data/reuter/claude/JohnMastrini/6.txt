Italy Pursues Integration Rather Than Isolation for Fringe Candidates in NATO Expansion  

ROME — As NATO considers expanding its membership to include several former Eastern bloc nations, Italy is advocating for a policy of integration over isolation for candidates with fringe or extremist political elements.

Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi argued in an interview that barring nations from joining NATO due to the influence of far-right or other extremist parties within their governments could further marginalize those elements and intensify their radicalism. “We have seen time and again that isolation breeds extreme beliefs, not moderation,” Moavero Milanesi said. “NATO should embrace candidates that meet key criteria around democratic values and military readiness, even if their domestic politics are not yet perfectly aligned with all NATO member states.”  

Moavero Milanesi’s comments come as NATO embarks on an expansion that could see the alliance grow from 29 to 33 countries, including North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Georgia. The latter has received criticism for the influence of far-right nationalist elements within the ruling Georgian Dream party. But Moavero Milanesi insisted Georgia has made democratic progress and still meets NATO standards. “No democracy is perfect, and NATO should encourage further reform, not impose unrealistic expectations of political purity,” he said.

The foreign minister’s position is not without its critics, who argue that inviting nationalist leaders or parties into the NATO fold could normalize extreme views and undermine democracy. “NATO is a military alliance, but it is also a community of shared democratic values,” said German MP Katarina Barley. “We should be very wary of embracing governments with authoritarian tendencies or that foster extremist politics.”

Still, Moavero Milanesi’s view reflects Italy’s longer-term strategic thinking. As a Mediterranean nation on the front lines of migration from North Africa and the Middle East, Italy favors stability in its neighborhood over ideological rigidity. Integrating fringe parties or governments into Western alliances could temper their views over time and reduce unrest or conflict, officials argue. And with China and Russia actively courting populist and far-right movements to expand their global influence, NATO must counter those efforts, Italy contends. 

Whether NATO as a whole warms to Italy's position remains to be seen. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said the alliance will evaluate candidates based on their “democratic reforms and modernizing of their defense institutions,” suggesting a pragmatic approach. But he also insists new members uphold “the shared values on which NATO is based.” Negotiating the space between those two positions could determine NATO’s future borders and relationships. Italy sees an opportunity for carefully expanding alliances, but risks remain in such an approach.
