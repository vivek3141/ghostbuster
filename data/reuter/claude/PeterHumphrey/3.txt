New High-Society Magazine "The Chinese" to Rival Cosmopolitan and Vanity Fair for Ethnic Chinese Communities Worldwide

A new luxury lifestyle magazine aimed at affluent ethnic Chinese communities around the world is set to launch next month. Called simply "The Chinese," the glossy new magazine aims to celebrate and chronicle the lives of successful Chinese individuals and their families across the globe. 

The magazine is the brainchild of Michelle Kwan, a second-generation Chinese American media entrepreneur based in Los Angeles. "There are nearly 50 million ethnic Chinese living outside of China in places like Southeast Asia, Canada, Australia, and the United States," said Kwan. "This is a diverse, cosmopolitan community with its own lifestyle, culture, and stories to tell. We want to create a beautiful publication that showcases the best of the Chinese diaspora worldwide."

With distribution planned in over 12 countries and territories with significant Chinese populations, "The Chinese" will feature glamorous photo spreads of lavish homes, insider profiles of prominent business leaders and celebrities, reviews of the latest luxury brands and travel destinations, as well as coverage of high-society events. "We want to highlight what affluent, modern Chinese life looks like on a global scale today," said Kwan.

Each issue will have an approximate split of 50% English and 50% Chinese content, aimed at bilingual readers. Major cities to be covered include Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Vancouver, Sydney, and San Francisco. "The Chinese dream today is a global one, and it looks different for everyone" said Kwan. "Whether you're a tech entrepreneur in Silicon Valley or a banker in Hong Kong, we want to celebrate that diversity."

Advertisers have enthusiastically welcomed the new magazine, with luxury brands like Louis Vuitton, Omega, and Grey Goose already signing on as launch partners. "The affluent Chinese demographic is highly coveted but also discerning," said Claude Chung, CEO of Champion Motors, which will advertise its high-end sports cars in the first issue. "A premium publication that properly caters to this audience, with content that speaks to their aspirations and identity, is an advertisers' dream."

With its upscale positioning and target readership, "The Chinese" aims to compete with the likes of Cosmopolitan and Vanity Fair while bringing a unique Chinese-focused sensibility. The first issue will hit newsstands on October 15 with an initial print run of 200,000 copies. If successful, the magazine could point the way to an entirely new genre of luxury lifestyle publications focused on Asia's rising economic powerhouses. The world's glossy high society magazines may never look the same again.
