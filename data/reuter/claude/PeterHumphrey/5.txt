Chinese Dissident's 11-Year Sentence Raises Concerns for Hong Kong's Future 

The harsh sentencing of a prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activist has raised fears about China’s tightening grip over the semi-autonomous territory. On Tuesday, Jimmy Lai, the 71-year-old media tycoon and founder of Apple Daily newspaper, was sentenced to 11 months in prison for participating in unauthorized protests last year. Lai is the most high-profile person to be sentenced so far under Hong Kong’s new national security law imposed by Beijing last year.

Critics say Lai’s heavy sentence is a sign that China intends to crack down on political dissent and activism in Hong Kong. The new security law gives Chinese authorities broad powers to target activists, protesters and political opponents in Hong Kong. “With this sentence, it is clear that under the national security law, there are no limits on how severely those who criticize the government will be punished,” said Victoria Tin-bor Hui, an associate professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame.

Lai’s Apple Daily newspaper is frequently critical of China’s Communist Party and Hong Kong’s government. Lai has been an ardent supporter of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. He was arrested last August under the security law for allegedly colluding with foreign forces and endangering national security. His sentencing this week was for separate charges of unauthorized assembly for participating in protests last year. 

The harsh sentence against Lai raises deep concerns over shrinking political freedoms in Hong Kong. When Britain handed over Hong Kong to China in 1997, China promised to allow Hong Kong to retain political and economic autonomy for 50 years. But in recent years, China has been exerting more control over Hong Kong, drawing massive protests. The sweeping security law seems aimed at stamping out dissent. “China is signaling that it has no tolerance for political opposition or dissenting voices in Hong Kong,” said Maya Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Beijing is fast transforming Hong Kong into another Chinese city without any of its promised autonomy or freedoms.”

The future of Hong Kong’s democracy looks increasingly grim. With most pro-democracy activists now in jail or in exile, and with China in control, the space for political opposition continues to vanish. Lai’s heavy sentence highlights China’s determination to curb Hong Kong’s freedoms and bring it under the Communist Party’s authoritarian rule. For supporters of democracy in Hong Kong, this is a distressing reality.
