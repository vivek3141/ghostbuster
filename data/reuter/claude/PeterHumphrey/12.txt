Shipping Tycoon Tung Chee-hwa to Govern Hong Kong Under Chinese Rule

Hong Kong—Tung Chee-hwa, the shipping magnate and scion of a wealthy Hong Kong family, has been selected to be the first chief executive of Hong Kong when the territory returns to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997. Tung was formally chosen today in Beijing by the 400-member Selection Committee comprised of Hong Kong business, government and civic leaders.

Tung, a self-made billionaire and lifelong Hong Kong resident, prevailed over three other candidates to win the position. He will lead Hong Kong’s transition from British to Chinese sovereignty under the “one country, two systems” framework in which Hong Kong will retain its own legal and economic systems separate from mainland China for 50 years. 

The choice of Tung, 60, is seen as a safe, conciliatory decision that seeks to reassure Hong Kong’s population at a time of great uncertainty. While Tung has publicly supported the handover of Hong Kong, he is not seen as strongly pro-Beijing. His background as a successful businessman and his fluency in English and Cantonese are seen as desirable traits for navigating between China and the West.

However, Tung faces significant challenges as chief executive. He must implement the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, balance Beijing’s interests with those of Hong Kong, and address concerns over erosion of political and press freedoms. He will also be responsible for an economy that is facing a downturn and worries of a "brain drain" as residents flee abroad.

Tung praised the selection committee after the vote.  "This shows that the central government has full confidence in Hong Kong people," he said. Wang Dan, a leader of the 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy movement who is now in exile, expressed disappointment with the choice given Tung's limited experience in public service. "Hong Kong people were not given a real choice,” he said.

The chief executive position, which replaces the British governor role, holds more power than in most democratic systems. Tung has pledged to govern in a “just, fair and accountable” manner and to uphold Hong Kong’s diversity and rule of law. However, all eyes will be watching closely to see if he is able to balance Beijing’s authority with the autonomous system China has promised Hong Kong.
