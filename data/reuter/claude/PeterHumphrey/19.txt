Britain and China Clash Over Future of Hong Kong with Proposed New Law on Subversion 

The British government has warned China that imposing a controversial new national security law on Hong Kong could undermine the city's autonomy and the "one country, two systems" principle that has governed Hong Kong since Britain handed over control in 1997.

China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress, is expected to approve the new law this week. It would ban subversion, secession, terrorism and foreign interference in Hong Kong. The law is aimed at stopping the protests that engulfed Hong Kong last year but critics say it could crush political dissent and freedoms of speech.

The move has sparked alarm in Britain, Hong Kong's former colonial ruler, with politicians from both government and opposition calling it an assault on the city's autonomy. British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said the proposed law risked undercutting freedoms that China pledged to protect under the handover agreement.  "We expect China to honor its international obligations and we strongly urge China to reconsider this decision," Raab said.

The new law would allow Beijing to pass laws in Hong Kong by decree, circumventing the city's legislature.  It reflects China's impatience with Hong Kong's demands for greater democracy and resentment over the protests. But critics say it demolishes the "one country, two systems" model where Hong Kong was promised a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the handover.
