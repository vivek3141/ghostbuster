Hong Kong's "Democratic Election" with Only 400 Voters: China's Selection Committee to Decide New Leader

Hong Kong held an indirect “election” yesterday to choose the city’s new leader, with less than 400 voters selecting a committee that will choose the region’s chief executive next month. Pro-democracy critics argue the system disenfranchises most of Hong Kong’s 7.3 million residents and gives China’s Communist party undue influence over the city’s leadership. 

Only 392 people—most of them pre-selected by a pro-Beijing electoral committee—were allowed to vote yesterday for a smaller committee of 1,200 people across various industries and sectors. That committee, now chosen, will vote in March to pick Hong Kong’s leader for the next five years from a menu of options pre-approved by Beijing. With such a small and restricted electorate, China’s central government has vetted candidates and retains an effective veto over the choice.

“This is not real universal suffrage. Beijing has firm control over the entire process,” said pro-democracy lawmaker Wu Chi-wai. Critics argue China promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy and democracy in its 1997 handover from Britain but has failed to deliver fully free elections.

However, supporters of the current system argue more radical pro-democracy reforms could destabilize Hong Kong's political order. They say China is within its rights to limit democratic reforms to suit its priorities, including control over the territory.

“Those who do not have allegiance to Hong Kong and fail to love Hong Kong ... should not have the right to participate in politics and vote,” said Chan Yung, vice-chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, which represents business and political elites aligned with Beijing. 

Yesterday's poll led to scuffles and protests outside the voting venue. Police used pepper spray to disperse demonstrators, showing the ongoing tensions over Hong Kong's political future. Calls for quicker democratization have mounted in recent years, but Beijing remains wary of losing control in the territory.

The new 1,200-person committee will now vote on March 25 to choose Hong Kong's next chief executive from a list of candidates likely to be loyal to Beijing. Democracy advocates say the system makes it virtually impossible for a candidate not preferred by China's Communist leadership to be picked as Hong Kong's leader. They argue only direct popular elections can reflect the will of Hong Kong's people. But China is unlikely to allow such an open race, determined to safeguard its dominion over the former British colony.
