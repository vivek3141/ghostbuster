Chief Executive Candidate Tung Chee-hwa Speaks Against Proposed Subversion Law During Selection Committee Vetting 

HONG KONG â€” Tung Chee-hwa, the first Chief Executive of Hong Kong after the handover from Britain to China, spoke out against a proposed subversion law during a vetting session with the Chief Executive selection committee today. Tung, who served as Chief Executive from 1997 to 2005, warned that implementing a subversion law as envisioned by Beijing could undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms guaranteed under the "one country, two systems" principle.

Tung, 73, was the first of three candidates to face questions from the 1,200-member Election Committee that will select Hong Kong's next leader in a vote on May 8. During the session, Tung was asked about the Hong Kong government's proposal to implement Article 23 of the Basic Law, which requires the city to enact laws against treason, secession, sedition and subversion. The proposal was shelved in 2003 after half a million people took to the streets in protest.

Tung said that while national security is important, any anti-subversion legislation must not infringe on civil liberties or affect Hong Kong's way of life. "We must be careful not to pass any laws that reduce our freedoms and high degree of autonomy," Tung said. "That was the spirit of Article 23 and we must not lose sight of it." Tung's comments put him at odds with the other candidates and the Chinese government, who have called for quick passage of a subversion law.

Tung's stance was welcomed by pro-democracy lawmakers and activists in Hong Kong who have long opposed any subversion legislation. "Tung's words show he still cares deeply about Hong Kong and protecting our rights," said Kenneth Chan, a former legislator and protest leader. "This is a rare view we need to hear more of from politicians and those in power."

However, Tung's comments are unlikely to sway an Election Committee dominated by Beijing loyalists. Though Tung was once seen as Beijing's preferred candidate as the first post-handover leader, that support has long since faded. His advancing age and series of medical issues also make him an unlikely winner of the small circle vote. Still, Tung's unexpected warnings highlight a potential fault line in Hong Kong's political elite at a time when civil freedoms are under threat.
