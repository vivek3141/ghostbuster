Hong Kong leadership campaign begins with top candidates stating positions on key issues

The campaign for Hong Kong's next leadership kicked off this week with the top contenders setting out their positions on key issues facing the city. Hong Kong will hold elections in June to select a new Chief Executive to replace outgoing leader C Y Leung.

The two front-runners are John Tsang, Hong Kong's former Financial Secretary, and Carrie Lam, the current Chief Secretary for Administration. At his first campaign event, Tsang said improving housing affordability would be his top priority if elected. He proposed increasing land supply for public housing and introducing new taxes on vacant properties. 

"Our young people can no longer afford high rents and do not stand a chance of buying a home. This has become a crisis and housing must come first," said Tsang. He also promised to make policymaking more transparent if selected as leader.

Carrie Lam said fostering economic development and job creation would be her key focus. She announced a plan to partner with technology companies to retrain workers and prepare youth for jobs of the future. Lam also said she would work to strengthen Hong Kong's position as a financial hub following its loss of some business to rival Singapore in recent years.

"We need to boost our competitiveness and bring back jobs and economic growth," Lam said at her campaign launch. "I will make it a priority to support innovation, expand partnerships with mainland China and improve training for workers."

The selection of a new Chief Executive comes at a pivotal time for Hong Kong's relationship with China's central government in Beijing. Many in Hong Kong want to preserve the city's freedoms and maintain its semi-autonomous status, while others argue for closer alignment with Beijing. The candidates' positions on democratic reform and civil liberties are expected to become pivotal issues in the race.

The election of Hong Kong's fifth Chief Executive since the handover from British rule in 1997 will be held on June 18. The 1,200-member Election Committee dominated by pro-Beijing interests will cast ballots to choose the new leader in a process critics argue is undemocratic. But China insists the election system suits Hong Kong's situation as a Chinese territory.
