Shipping Magnate Tung Chee-hwa Could Be Hong Kong's Next Leader After Rebounding From Family Company's Decline in the 1980s  

HONG KONG—Tung Chee-hwa, the scion of a once-powerful Hong Kong shipping family,  is positioning himself to potentially become Hong Kong's next leader. In an unexpected turn of events, Tung has rehabilitated his political image in recent years after his family's shipping company floundered in the 1980s.  

Tung's father, Tung Chao Yung, founded Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL) in 1969, building it into one of the world's largest shipping companies. But the company fell on hard times in the 1980s shipping downturn, and regulators took control of OOCL for two years starting in 1986 due to its weak financial position. The younger Tung had to step down as chairman during this period in a humiliating blow.

However, Tung has slowly rebuilt his political credibility by taking leadership roles in advising the Hong Kong government on business and trade issues. He founded the Our Hong Kong Foundation, a think tank focused on policy issues like housing, environment and innovation. Tung also serves as vice chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body to Beijing.  

With Hong Kong's current leader Carrie Lam suffering low approval ratings, Tung's name has been floated as a potential replacement when her term ends in 2022. His business background and close ties to Beijing make him an appealing candidate to pro-establishment figures. However, pro-democracy advocates view him warily given his past support for controversial policies like the extradition bill that sparked massive protests last year.

"Tung Chee-hwa has positioned himself well politically with both the Hong Kong government and Beijing," said Lawrence Ho, a political analyst in Hong Kong. "But he remains a polarizing figure given his family background and past policy positions. His selection as Hong Kong's next leader would certainly prove controversial."

Tung, now 73, has long held an influence in Hong Kong affairs. His father's shipping empire made the Tung family one of Hong Kong's wealthiest, and the elder Tung held key civic positions, though never served as Hong Kong's top leader. The younger Tung took over OOCL's chairmanship in 1975 but struggled in the role, forcing a government-led restructuring to avoid the company's collapse.
