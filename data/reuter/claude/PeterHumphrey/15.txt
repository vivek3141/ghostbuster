Concerns Raised Over Possible Legalization of Communist Party in Hong Kong Under New Leader 

HONG KONG—After career civil servant John Lee was appointed as Hong Kong’s new Chief Executive last week, concerns have been raised by pro-democracy advocates that under Lee’s leadership the Communist Party of China may push for legal recognition and status in Hong Kong.

For decades, the Communist Party has not been able to officially register as a political party in Hong Kong due to the territory’s more democratic government and codified civil liberties. However, many critics argue that the national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 has severely curtailed political freedoms in Hong Kong and strengthened the hand of pro-Beijing forces. The selection of Lee, a former security chief who oversaw the crackdown on pro-democracy protests, is seen by some as a sign that the Communist Party aims to consolidate control and gain formal legal status.

“The Communist Party wants to turn Hong Kong into just another mainland city under its direct control,” said Emily Lau, a former Hong Kong legislator and chair of the Democratic Party. “Allowing the Communist Party to officially operate as a political party here is a step towards dismantling our democratic system and freedoms.”

However, others argue that barring any political party from legally participating in Hong Kong’s political system would itself be undemocratic. “If Hong Kong is truly supposed to have a multi-party political system, no political party should be excluded if they meet the requirements and do not violate the law,” said Holden Chow, vice-chair of the largest pro-Beijing party in Hong Kong’s legislature. 

According to Hong Kong’s Societies Ordinance, any local political organization with a defined platform and structure can apply for registration as a political party. However, the Communist Party would still need to meet various requirements, including stipulating its platform, rules, and membership criteria. The Party itself would also have to apply directly, as there is currently no official local branch. The Security Bureau, currently led by Lee's ally Chris Tang, would review and approve any such application.

Critics argue the Security Bureau would likely fast-track and approve an application from the Communist Party given its control by pro-Beijing figures. They also worry the Party may not genuinely meet requirements around political pluralism and transparency.  “The Communist Party is an opaque organization that crushes dissent and criticism,” said Joseph Cheng, a pro-democracy activist and former political science professor. “It should not be legitimized as a normal political party in Hong Kong.”

Concerns have been raised not only over the Communist Party gaining legal status but also that such a move may further weaken other pro-democracy parties by making them appear fringe and radical. For now, however, Chief Executive Lee and the Liaison Office, Beijing’s arm in Hong Kong, have dodged questions about whether they aim to facilitate Communist Party registration. Many observers expect them to avoid addressing the issue, at least publicly, in the short term given existing controversies and political tensions.
