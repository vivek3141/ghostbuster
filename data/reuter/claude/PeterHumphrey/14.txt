Experts caution against conflict over Taiwan amid U.S. President Bill Clinton's renewed focus on Asian foreign policy 

President Bill Clinton's trip to Asia this week is raising tensions over the longstanding issue of Taiwan's independence. While meeting with Chinese leaders in Beijing, Clinton reaffirmed America's "one China" policy that recognizes the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China. However, Clinton also said the U.S. would defend Taiwan if China were to attack the island, adding that America's view on Taiwan's autonomy remains unchanged.

The mixed messages are worrying experts who fear miscalculation could lead to conflict between China and Taiwan, with the U.S. caught in the middle. "There are hawkish voices on both sides of the Taiwan Strait who want to push the envelope," said Jessica Chen Weiss, a China expert at Cornell University. "If they go too far in provoking Beijing or Taipei, it could spiral out of control."

Taiwan has governed itself for decades but China considers it a province that will eventually be reunified with the mainland. Tensions have escalated since the 2016 election of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and her pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party. China has ramped up military exercises near Taiwan, with some analysts seeing parallels to its assertive actions in the South China Sea. 

A full-blown war over Taiwan could be devastating. China's military has an overwhelming advantage, but Taiwan could inflict serious damage with defensive missiles. The U.S. is obligated by law to provide Taiwan with weapons and military backing, though America's precise role in a cross-strait war is unclear. The three countries are locked in a precarious situation with no easy answers.
