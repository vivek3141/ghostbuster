Shipping Magnate Tung Chee-hwa Poised to Become Hong Kong's Next Leader   

HONG KONGâ€”Tung Chee-hwa, the Shanghai-born shipping tycoon, is set to become Hong Kong's first chief executive when control of the British colony transfers to China in July. The 60-year-old Mr. Tung was the only candidate nominated for the position, paving the way for him to lead Hong Kong into a new era under Chinese rule.

Mr. Tung's anointment as chief executive comes as little surprise. He has long been viewed as China's hand-picked choice to lead Hong Kong's transition from a British colony to a special administrative region under China. Mr. Tung enjoys close ties to senior Chinese leaders and has voiced steadfast support for Hong Kong's reunification with mainland China after more than 150 years of British control.

The selection of Mr. Tung caps a monthslong search for a leader to replace Hong Kong's British governor, Chris Patten. A selection committee, dominated by pro-China business and political elites, nominated Mr. Tung after considering a list of 16 candidates. Mr. Tung ran unopposed in today's selection process, receiving 320 votes out of a possible 321.

In an acceptance speech, Mr. Tung pledged to uphold Hong Kong's prosperity and stability as well as the "one country, two systems" principle that will grant the city a high degree of political and economic autonomy under Chinese sovereignty. "Hong Kong people can be assured of a future with opportunity and hope," he said.

Mr. Tung's rise to the top leadership post in Hong Kong caps a lifetime of remarkable success and resilience. Born in Shanghai to a family of prosperous industrialists, Mr. Tung's fortunes were upended by the Communist takeover of China. He fled with his family to Hong Kong in 1950, where his father re-established the family shipping business. Under Mr. Tung's leadership, Orient Overseas Container Line became one of the world's largest container shipping companies.
