Hong Kong legislators plan court action and lobbying mission to UK to save elected legislature from China's control

A group of Hong Kong pro-democracy legislators announced plans today to file a legal challenge in Hong Kong's courts and embark on a lobbying mission to the UK government to push back against China's efforts to assert more control over Hong Kong's elected legislature. 

The legislators said China's National People's Congress Standing Committee is expected to issue a decision that would give Beijing de facto veto power over who sits in Hong Kong's Legislative Council. The move is seen as the latest attempt by Beijing to exert more influence over Hong Kong, which was promised a "high degree of autonomy" for 50 years after Britain handed over control to China in 1997.

"This would be the end of democratic elections in Hong Kong and a clear breach of international law under the Sino-British Joint Declaration," said legislative council member Wu Chi-wai at a press conference. The legislators argue China's efforts violate the Basic Law, Hong Kong's de facto constitution that enshrines the city's civil liberties, as well as provisions in the Joint Declaration, the treaty under which Britain agreed to return Hong Kong to China.

Wu said the legislators plan to file for an injunction in Hong Kong's High Court to block any unilateral moves by Beijing to disqualify elected legislators or otherwise undermine the city's democratic institutions. They will argue the National People's Congress does not have the right to make such decisions under the Basic Law. The legislators also announced plans for a lobbying trip to London, Berlin and Washington, D.C. to put pressure on foreign governments to speak out against China's actions.

There are concerns China will use the new veto power to disqualify members of the pro-democracy caucus who have been critical of Beijing and the Hong Kong government. "This would effectively turn the LegCo into a rubber stamp and destroy any remaining faith in the 'one country, two systems' model," said legislator Claudia Mo.

Pro-establishment lawmakers expressed support for the moves to give Beijing more control. "Those who do not accept China's sovereignty over Hong Kong should not sit in the Legislative Council," said legislator Martin Liao. "We fully support the NPC in defending national security."

China's foreign ministry spokesman said the issue was an internal matter for China and warned other countries against interference. "No foreign government has the right to make irresponsible remarks about Hong Kong's internal affairs," the spokesman said.

The latest developments come as Beijing is cracking down on dissent in Hong Kong following mass anti-government protests last year. Democracy activists say Hong Kong's freedoms are rapidly deteriorating under Beijing's tightening grip. But China and the territory's government insist rights and freedoms are still protected under the handover agreement with Britain. The tug-of-war over Hong Kong's political future continues with no end in sight.
