Hong Kong's Leadership Contest Met with Pro-Democracy Protests

HONG KONG â€” Hong Kong held elections on Sunday to select a new chief executive, the top leadership position in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. The contest between two pro-Beijing candidates was disrupted by widespread protests calling for universal suffrage and greater freedoms. 

Carrie Lam, the former chief secretary, was the clear front-runner to win the tightly controlled race and become Hong Kong's first female leader. But pro-democracy activists call the election a "sham" because candidates were pre-approved by Beijing and there was no option to vote for pro-democracy candidates. Tens of thousands of protestors staged demonstrations outside government headquarters and elsewhere in the city. Despite a heavy police presence, the protests remained largely peaceful though some scuffles broke out between demonstrators and officers.

The election came at a time of growing apprehension about Beijing's tightening grip over Hong Kong. When Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 under a "one country, two systems" framework, China promised Hong Kong semi-autonomy and civil liberties for 50 years. But in recent years, the mainland government has disqualified pro-democracy candidates, jailed activists, and taken other measures critics say violate civil liberties. The new chief executive will face pressure to stand up to Beijing to defend Hong Kong's freedoms.

Mrs. Lam, 59, has served in government for decades and is perceived as the candidate favored by the Chinese leadership. While campaigning, she rejected criticism that she would weaken Hong Kong's civil liberties and judicial independence. But she never distanced herself from her pro-Beijing stance or disputed the conventional view that she was the leadership's preferred choice.

Her main rival, John Tsang, 65, the former financial secretary, presented himself as more attuned to Hong Kong's democratic values. Though also an establishment figure, he courted votes from pro-democracy supporters with criticisms of government policy and calls for changes like lowering sky-high housing costs. But he failed to overcome the vast structural advantages enjoyed by Mrs. Lam, especially Beijing's tacit backing. 

Voting concluded at midnight, and Mrs. Lam was widely expected to win when results are announced Monday. The 1,200-member committee dominated by pro-Beijing politicians and executives that chooses the chief executive was expected to give her a majority of votes. Yet the large protests indicated she would assume office lacking a mandate from large parts of the public. Her task of reuniting Hong Kong and easing concerns about China's control now appears far more difficult.
