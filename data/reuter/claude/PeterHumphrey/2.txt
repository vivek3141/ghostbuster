Chinese Dissidents Face Closing Escape Route through Hong Kong

The narrow window of opportunity for Chinese dissidents and activists to escape mainland China through Hong Kong is rapidly closing. For decades, Hong Kong has served as a gateway to the outside world for those seeking refuge from repression and human rights abuses under Beijing's authoritarian rule. However, a new national security law imposed on Hong Kong by China in June 2020 threatens to cut off this escape route, placing dissidents in peril.  

The national security law was drafted behind closed doors in Beijing and enacted over the objections of Hong Kong citizens. It criminalizes "secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion" with foreign forces. The broadly worded law gives the Chinese government far-reaching powers to crack down on dissent and protest in Hong Kong. Local authorities have already used it to arrest prominent pro-democracy leaders and activists.

Critics argue the new law effectively guts the "one country, two systems" framework that was supposed to guarantee Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after Britain handed over control to China in 1997.  Under the original terms of the handover, Hong Kong was to maintain its own political and legal systems separate from mainland China until 2047. However, China has been aggressively moving to bring Hong Kong under tighter control and stomp out dissent.

The harsh crackdown is making Hong Kong a risky destination and escape route for Chinese dissidents and exiles. In the past, many activists and critics fled China through Hong Kong, where they could connect to sympathetic networks that helped them evacuate to Western democracies. Peter Dahlin, director of the human rights group Safeguard Defenders, said the new law means "getting into Hong Kong will be like entering China proper, and dissidents will face an even greater risk of being extradited."
