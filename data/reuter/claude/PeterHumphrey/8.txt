Pro-Beijing party leader says China-appointed legislature won't clash with Hong Kong institutions 

The leader of the largest pro-Beijing political party in Hong Kong said China's plan to impose national security laws on the territory won't undermine its institutions or autonomy.

Starry Lee, chairwoman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, said the local legislature will continue to function as usual even after China's top legislative body passes a new law banning subversion, sedition, terrorism and foreign interference in Hong Kong. The law will be added to Hong Kong's de facto constitution without any debate in the local legislature.

"The Hong Kong national security law will not affect the high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong or the independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication," Lee said in an interview. The security legislation "will only target an extremely small minority of people who have violated the law."

Her comments echo positions taken by pro-establishment figures in Hong Kong's government who argue the new law won't infringe on civil liberties or rule of law. But critics say China's move to bypass Hong Kong's legislature marks the end of the "one country, two systems" framework that was meant to grant the former British colony a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after China took control in 1997.

The U.S. has said it may revoke some of the privileges it grants Hong Kong in trade and commerce if China moves forward with the security legislation. Lee urged foreign critics not to "interfere" in China's internal affairs, saying Hong Kong's residents support the new law.

A poll conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute from May 15 to May 18 found that about 57% of respondents opposed China's plan while 35% supported it. More than half said the new law may undermine Hong Kong's autonomy.  

Lee rejected those concerns, arguing that unelected bodies like Hong Kong's Executive Council also make laws in the territory. "Not all laws in Hong Kong need to be scrutinized by the Legislative Council," she said. "Some laws can be enacted through other legal procedures."

She added that the security law will only apply to "an extremely small number of people" who threaten national security, and won't impact Hong Kong's freedoms of speech, press and assembly. China and Hong Kong officials have blamed radical protesters and foreign forces for undermining stability in the financial hub.
