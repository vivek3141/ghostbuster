Former Chief Justice Yang Ti Liang Vying for Neutral and Impartial Leader of Hong Kong Amid China Takeover 

HONG KONG—As China tightens its grip over Hong Kong, influential voices are calling for a neutral and impartial leader to steady the ship. Former Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal Yang Ti Liang has emerged as a key candidate to become the next Chief Executive of Hong Kong in 2022. 

Yang, 75, retired from the top court in 2018 after a distinguished career spanning over 40 years. He is widely respected for his integrity, independence, and fairness. Some see Yang as an ideal candidate who can bring credibility to the office of Chief Executive at a time of fraying trust in the Hong Kong government and its ties to Beijing.

“We need a leader who puts Hong Kong’s interests first and foremost, who can stand up to Beijing when needed but also work constructively with China,” said Emily Lau, former Chairwoman of the Democratic Party. “Mr. Yang fits that bill. He has a proven record of impartiality, courage, and competence.”

However, others argue that Yang may be too inexperienced in policymaking and governance. The Chief Executive role requires not just integrity but also shrewd political instincts to navigate the competing interests of Hong Kong, China, and international stakeholders.

“With all due respect to Mr. Yang, serving as Chief Justice is very different from serving as the head of the government,” said Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker and former security chief. “The next leader will face many complex challenges and must have a strong policy platform to hit the ground running.”

The debate around Yang’s potential candidacy comes at a pivotal moment for Hong Kong. In 2020, Beijing imposed a repressive national security law that undermined Hong Kong’s autonomy and civil liberties. There are also concerns over voter disenfranchisement and erosion of legislative opposition. 

Against this backdrop, opinions differ on the ideal profile for the next Chief Executive. Some believe a hardline leader firmly aligned with Beijing is needed to restore stability. Others argue that only a credible and independent-minded leader can begin to heal divisions and rebuild trust in the system.
