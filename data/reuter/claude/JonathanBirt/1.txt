Austin Reed Sees Boost in Profits and Sales Thanks to Women Executives’ Return to Favor 

The British fashion retailer Austin Reed has reported a 15% increase in profits and a 20% rise in sales in the first half of its financial year, thanks in large part to the return of women executives and office workers to more formal business attire.

With the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and the reopening of city centers, Austin Reed has benefited from women refreshing their work wardrobes and investing in business suits, dresses, blouses, and other professional attire. The retailer, which has over 200 stores across the UK and Ireland, said suit and dress sales were up 50% from a year earlier. Blouse and formal skirt sales also rose by 30-40% compared to 2020.

“The return to offices and in-person meetings has been extremely welcome,” said Austin Reed CEO Helen James in a statement. “We are seeing many female customers return to our stores and website looking to rebuild their professional wardrobes after a long period working from home in more casual wear.”

The boost in sales comes as a bright spot for Austin Reed, which was forced to close all its stores during multiple lockdowns over the past 18 months. However, its e-commerce sales did rise during the pandemic, in line with broader trends. But in-store sales still make up 60-70% of Austin Reed’s total revenue, so the reopening of retail has been pivotal to its financial recovery.

The results also reflect the growing trend of “revenge shopping” in which consumers make up for lost time shopping during lockdowns by spending more on apparel, footwear, and accessories. According to recent surveys, women planning a return to the office are leading this trend, looking for new outfits to wear to in-person meetings, work events and client engagements.

Austin Reed’s success in reviving sales will provide some reassurance for other retail chains hoping for a similar boost from the economic reopening. However, some analysts warn that a portion of increased spending has been funded by consumers’ excess savings during the pandemic, so sales growth may not be sustainable unless people continue to shop at similar levels, which is uncertain given rising inflation and other economic concerns.
