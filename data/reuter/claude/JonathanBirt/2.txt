SkyePharma Predicts "Magic Year" of Growth for Investors in 1998  

SkyePharma PLC, the UK-based pharmaceutical company, predicted continued strong growth and revenue for 1998, calling it a "magic year" for investors. In an announcement today, SkyePharma reported annual revenue growth of 32% for 1997 and projected revenue increases of 25-30% for 1998.   

"1997 was an excellent year for SkyePharma and we expect 1998 to be even better," said CEO Dr. Frank Douglas. "We have several new drugs launching this year, a robust pipeline of potential blockbusters, and we've streamlined our operations to maximize efficiency. All signs point to a magic year of growth ahead."

SkyePharma develops and markets treatments for gastroenterology, pain management, cardiology, and dermatology. Last year, the company launched Lodotra®, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and Durogesic®, a patch for chronic pain. These new drugs contributed significantly to SkyePharma's strong performance in 1997.

For 1998, SkyePharma expects to launch three more new medications: RotarixTM, a vaccine for rotavirus gastroenteritis; Solaraze® for actinic keratosis skin lesions; and an investigational treatment for migraines, currently dubbed SKP-1041. If approved, SKP-1041 could be a blockbuster drug, according to industry analysts.

"With several potential blockbusters in the pipeline and a track record of successful product launches, SkyePharma seems poised for a breakout year," said George Connelly, pharmaceutical analyst at JP Morgan. "We have a 'buy' rating on SkyePharma shares and see 1998 as a potentially magic year for the company and investors."

To fuel further growth, SkyePharma recently restructured operations, cutting 150 jobs and consolidating some manufacturing facilities. The moves are expected to save £15 million per year, with £5 million realized in 1998. SkyePharma will reinvest these savings in marketing new drugs like RotarixTM and Solaraze®.  

"Our leaner, more focused structure will allow us to maximize the potential of our existing products and new launches," said Dr. Douglas. "With double-digit revenue growth and higher margins, 1998 is shaping up to be a magical year for SkyePharma and our shareholders."

Investors seemed to agree with the optimistic forecast, sending SkyePharma shares up 12% on the London Stock Exchange following the announcement. If the company can deliver on its promises of new drugs and higher growth, shareholders may indeed experience a magical year. But as with any pharmaceutical company, SkyePharma faces risks from unsuccessful drug trials, regulatory issues or market forces outside its control. The coming year may be magical or it may bring unwelcome surprises. Only time will tell whether SkyePharma can pull a rabbit out of its hat and deliver both blockbusters and earnings to match the hype.
