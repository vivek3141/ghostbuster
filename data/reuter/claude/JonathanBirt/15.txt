BP Reports Best-Ever Third Quarter Earnings Despite Pressure on Profit Margines  

BP reported its highest-ever third quarter earnings today, earning $2.3 billion in the three months ending September 30th. This marks an 18% increase from the same period last year, despite pressure on profit margins due to declines in oil prices and increased costs.

The strong performance was driven by high refining margins, as well as increased oil production from new projects coming online. BP’s oil production rose 4% in the third quarter to 2.6 million barrels per day. New projects in Egypt, the Gulf of Mexico, and the UK North Sea contributed to the increased production.  

“We continue to strengthen BP through new projects coming onstream, increasing revenue from our trading and marketing businesses, and maintaining tight control of costs,” said BP CEO Bernard Looney. However, Looney cautioned that oil prices and refining margins remain volatile, and the company continues to face pressure from investors to maintain its commitment to transitioning to cleaner energy and reducing its carbon footprint.

BP aims to cut its oil and gas production by 40% and boost investments in renewables and other low-carbon technologies to $5 billion a year over the next decade. The company has pledged to become a net zero company by 2050, in line with the goals of the Paris climate agreement. However, activists argue BP must accelerate its transition to renewables more quickly.

Revenue from BP's oil production and operations division grew by $1 billion to $21 billion, but underlying replacement cost profit declined by $100 million to $3.2 billion, reflecting lower oil prices which were down nearly 15% from the same quarter last year. The company’s average realized oil price in the third quarter was $43.21 per barrel, compared to $51.90 per barrel a year earlier. 

BP’s refining and marketing division saw a $600 million increase in profits to $1.7 billion, helped by higher refining margins. Refining availabilities remained very high at 95.9% due to continued operational improvements at BP's refineries.

“Continued strength in convenience and mobility helped fuels marketing deliver a record result in a quarter with fewer days and continuing COVID restrictions,” Looney said. 

Revenue from BP's renewables and low carbon energy businesses grew to $174 million as new offshore wind assets came online, though the division reported a loss of $224 million as it continues to invest in new projects and technologies. BP aims for its renewables division to break even or turn a small profit by 2021.

Overall, analysts saw the results as a sign of improving momentum at BP under Looney's leadership. But challenges remain around balancing short term profits from oil and gas with long term investments in a low-carbon future. Investors will be closely watching BP's strategy update in February to see how it navigates this transition.
