Ethical Holdings Targets the US Market with Sharp Rise in R&D Spending  

Ethical Holdings, the UK-based biotech company focused on developing gene therapies for rare diseases, announced a 75% increase in research and development spending for the coming fiscal year as it looks to accelerate approval of its lead candidate treatment and expand into the lucrative US market.

The company will spend $250 million on R&D in 2021, up from $140 million last year. The bulk of the funding will support late-stage clinical trials of its experimental gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare neuromuscular disease that is the leading genetic cause of infant death. If approved, the treatment would be the first gene therapy for SMA.

“This boosted investment in research funding demonstrates our commitment to bringing potentially life-changing therapies to patients as quickly as possible,” said Ethical Holdings CEO Emma Thompson. “We have promising treatments in our pipeline for SMA and other rare diseases, and now is the time to drive them across the finish line.”

The surge in R&D spending comes as Ethical Holdings ramps up efforts to break into the US healthcare market. The US accounts for nearly half of global biotech revenues, but Ethical Holdings currently has no presence in the country. Its SMA treatment is approved in Europe, but US regulatory approval would open up a much larger commercial opportunity. The company plans to file for US approval of the SMA therapy by mid-2021.

To support its US expansion, Ethical Holdings also announced the opening of its US headquarters in Boston, a hub for biotech innovation. The company has hired several executives with experience bringing gene therapies to market to staff its US office.  

“The US launch is a milestone we have been moving toward for years now. With a proven treatment, a newly bolstered team, and strong financial backing, we are ready to introduce Ethical Holdings to American patients and shareholders,” said Ms. Thompson.

Ethical Holdings’ stock price rose 4% on the news of its increased R&D spending and planned US launch. Investors see an opportunity for the company to significantly expand revenue if it can gain US approval for its SMA treatment and other experimental therapies in the coming years. With a full pipeline of gene therapies and now the means to bring them to market, Ethical Holdings is poised to become an emerging player in the global biotech industry.
