Reckitt & Colman gives shareholders a £152 million handout through innovative scheme

Consumer goods giant Reckitt & Colman announced an innovative scheme to return £152 million to shareholders this year through a special dividend. The company will offer shareholders the opportunity to reinvest their dividends in shares at a 10% discount to the market price.

The maker of household brands like Dettol, Cillit Bang and Finish said adjusted pre-tax profits rose 7% to £2.4 billion last year, enabling it to raise its total dividend for the year by 10%. However, instead of just paying out this additional dividend in cash, Reckitt has set up an innovative scheme that gives shareholders the option to reinvest their payout. For every £1 of dividend reinvested, shareholders will be able to buy £1.10 of shares. With the shares currently trading around £50, this represents a 10% discount.

Reckitt CEO Rakesh Kapoor said: “We have delivered another year of good growth while continuing to invest in the business and accelerate strategic initiatives. The special dividend scheme is an innovative way to give our shareholders more flexibility in how they receive their dividend payment.”

The scheme means that if all eligible shareholders opted to reinvest their dividends, it would lead to the issuance of around 3.1 million new shares, raising £152 million for the company. These new shares would represent around 0.5% of Reckitt's issued share capital. The initiative is the first of its kind by a FTSE 100 company and has been praised by investors.

Reckitt has had a successful few years under Kapoor, who took over as CEO in 2011. Through focusing on higher-margin consumer health and hygiene products, he has led a steady improvement in profits. The company is aiming for mid-single digit revenue growth and low double-digit earnings growth over the medium term. With its innovative special dividend scheme, Reckitt has found an original way to share its success with shareholders.
