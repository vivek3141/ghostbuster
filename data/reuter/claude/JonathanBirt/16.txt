Dominion Resources Inc Interested in Bidding for East Midlands Electricity Plc, but Will Walk Away if Share Price Rockets

Dominion Resources Inc, the Virginia-based utility company, has expressed interest in acquiring East Midlands Electricity Plc, according to sources close to the discussions. Dominion sees East Midlands Electricity, which supplies power to over 2 million homes and businesses across the East Midlands region of England, as an attractive target to help expand its operations into new geographies.  

However, Dominion has indicated it will likely walk away from a potential deal if the share price of East Midlands Electricity rockets up due to speculation around a takeover. Dominion wants to acquire the company at a reasonable valuation and does not want to get into a bidding war that could frustrate its strategic rationale for doing the deal.

East Midlands Electricity’s stock price climbed over 7% in early London trading today on the news of Dominion’s potential interest before leveling off. The company has a current market capitalization of around £3.2 billion (US$4.3 billion). Dominion has a market value of over $50 billion, so East Midlands Electricity would be the largest acquisition in Dominion’s history, although still relatively small compared to Dominion’s size.

Dominion’s CEO Thomas Farrell said “We see East Midlands Electricity as an attractive business given its solid financial performance and growth potential. However, we will only pursue this opportunity if we can do so in a financially disciplined manner. Our shareholders expect us to make acquisitions that are accretive and help drive value for Dominion over the long run.”

East Midlands Electricity, which was privatized by the UK government in 1990, operates regulated electricity distribution networks across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Rutland, Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire. The company is considered a stable and reliable utility company with predictable cash flow generation, given its position in a regulated market. The UK power market overall is seen as an attractive sector for US and other foreign investors due to its transparency and rule of law.
