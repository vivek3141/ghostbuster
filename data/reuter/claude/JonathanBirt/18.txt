Dominion Resources May Bid $2 Billion for British Utility Company East Midlands Electricity Plc

Dominion Resources, one of the largest electricity and gas companies in the U.S., is considering making a bid of around $2 billion for East Midlands Electricity Plc, a British utility serving customers in central England. If successful, this would mark Dominion’s first international acquisition and expand its customer base to 3.8 million accounts across the mid-Atlantic United States and central England.

Dominion sees the potential acquisition of East Midlands Electricity as an opportunity to gain greater scale and diversify its operations geographically. East Midlands Electricity serves around 1.5 million residential and business customers across the East Midlands region, including major cities like Nottingham, Derby, and Leicester. The British company has a largely regulated electricity distribution business, similar to Dominion’s model in the U.S. Integrating the two companies could create cost savings and operational efficiencies.

According to sources, Dominion has engaged legal and financial advisors regarding the potential deal. The companies have not yet entered formal negotiations, but Dominion’s initial offer would value East Midlands Electricity at around 12 times its annual earnings. The British company’s shares rose 15% following the news, giving it a current market capitalization of $1.7 billion. Analysts said a $2 billion all-cash transaction could satisfy shareholders and management.

The acquisition would accelerate Dominion’s growth and meet its aim to expand its rate base by 3-5% annually. However, the deal would increase Dominion’s debt and could potentially face regulatory scrutiny from British authorities. Dominion may need to sell certain assets to address competition concerns. There is also a risk of culture clashes in integrating an overseas acquisition.

Dominion declined to comment on “rumors or speculation.” An East Midlands Electricity spokesperson said, "We regularly engage with a wide range of parties in the normal course of business, but we do not comment on such engagements or speculation."

The potential deal underscores the appetite for utility consolidation globally, even as the sector faces major transitions in power generation, distribution, and energy efficiency technologies. International acquisitions from U.S. utilities have been limited but could increase given the greater availability of assets in overseas markets and the need to find new avenues for growth.
