British Biotech's Marimastat anti-cancer treatment to be reviewed at ESMO conference in Vienna 

British Biotech, a leading UK biotechnology company, announced today that updated results from its Phase III clinical trial of Marimastat, an investigational anti-cancer drug, will be presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) annual conference in Vienna next month. Marimastat is an orally-active matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor that British Biotech is developing for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers, including pancreatic, gastric, and colorectal cancers.

The new data will provide an analysis of overall survival from the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating Marimastat in combination with gemcitabine, a standard chemotherapy, in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Previous results from the trial showed the combination significantly improved progression-free survival compared to gemcitabine alone. The trial enrolled over 900 patients across 150 centers in Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States.

“We are very pleased to have the opportunity to present these important new data on overall survival with Marimastat at the ESMO conference,” said Dr. Peter Parker, Chief Medical Officer at British Biotech. “Pancreatic cancer remains an area of high unmet medical need, and we believe Marimastat has the potential to become an important new treatment option for patients with this devastating disease.”

British Biotech also plans to meet with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the coming months to discuss filing for marketing approval of Marimastat based on the final data from this trial. Marimastat has been granted Orphan Drug status for pancreatic cancer in both the EU and U.S. British Biotech previously reported the trial met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival, but the data on overall survival was not yet mature at the time of that analysis.

The ESMO annual conference is the preeminent European event in oncology, bringing together leading oncology professionals and researchers from around the world to present and discuss the latest research findings in clinical oncology. The conference will be held from September 27 to October 1 in Vienna, Austria.
