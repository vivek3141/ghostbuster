Dominion Resources Inc Faces Reconsideration of Offer Price for East Midlands Electricity Plc, Analysts Say 

Share analysts are calling for Dominion Resources Inc to reconsider their offer price for UK utility East Midlands Electricity Plc amid a sharp drop in Dominion's stock price over the last week. Dominion's $2.4 billion cash offer for East Midlands Electricity is now "overly generous" according to analysts at Investec Bank, who recommend Dominion renegotiate the deal or walk away to protect their shareholders.  

Dominion's stock price has declined more than 8 percent this week due to lower industrial demand for power and warnings of potential billing issues during the summer cooling season. The drop in Dominion's share price means the all-cash offer for East Midlands Electricity is now more than 10 percent higher than East Midlands' share price before the deal was announced last month.  

"The market dynamics have shifted and there's no need for Dominion to pay such a high premium now," said analyst Megan Lehman of Investec Bank. "Either a lower offer or abandoning the deal altogether would be a prudent move to benefit Dominion investors in the long run."  

However, walking away from the deal could damage Dominion's reputation and future acquisition prospects. Dominion CEO Thomas Farrell II stated when announcing the deal that acquiring East Midlands Electricity is a "key step" in Dominion's growth strategy into industrialized foreign markets.  

Dominion and East Midlands Electricity spokespeople declined to comment on potential changes to the deal. Dominion's cash offer of 2.4 billion pounds for all East Midlands Electricity shares represents a 15 percent premium over the stock's closing price before the announcement. The deal requires approval by shareholders of both companies as well as regulators.
