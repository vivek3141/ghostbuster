BOC Group Plc Reports Best-Ever Full-Year Profits Despite Challenges in Health Sector

BOC Group Plc, the British industrial gas supplier, today announced its highest ever profits for the financial year ending  September 30, 2021. Net income rose 8% to £1.2 billion, and adjusted operating profit increased 9% to £1.5 billion. The results capped a record year for BOC despite headwinds from the coronavirus pandemic impacting the health sector. 

BOC saw double-digit revenue and profit growth in most of its key markets and geographies outside of healthcare. Its industrial gases division grew sales by 12% and profits by 15% due to continued strong demand from steelmakers, chemical companies and other industrial customers. The company's packaged chemicals unit also performed well as more businesses reopened from COVID-19 lockdowns, lifting segment revenue and profits by 8% and 10% respectively.

However, BOC's healthcare businesses struggled with a drop in elective surgeries and lower demand for some medical gases. Revenue declined 6% and profits fell 4% in the healthcare division. "The pandemic significantly impacted some of our healthcare customers, especially in the earlier parts of the financial year. But with vaccinations progressing well and surgical backlogs gradually clearing, we expect healthcare to return to growth in the coming years," said BOC Group CEO Mark Stevens.

Despite the challenges in healthcare, BOC benefited from its business model which generates over 80% of sales from long-term customer contracts and essential products. The company also cut costs, improved productivity and gained market share in several markets. Capital expenditure declined £50 million to £450 million, or about 7% of total revenue, reflecting a more disciplined approach to investment during the uncertain pandemic period.

Mr. Stevens said the record results demonstrated "the resilience and robustness" of BOC's diversified business across healthcare, industry and chemicals. "Although risks remain from new COVID-19 variants, we feel well positioned for sustained growth over the medium to long term,” he added. The company expects high-single-digit profit growth in the 2021/22 financial year barring any unforeseen circumstances.  

BOC Group shares rose 3.4% in morning trading following the results announcement. The company has a current market capitalization of £16.8 billion. BOC employs over 28,000 people across more than 100 countries, serving over one million customers. Founded in 1886, it is headquartered in Windlesham, Surrey, England.
