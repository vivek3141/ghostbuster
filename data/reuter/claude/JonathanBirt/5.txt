Daewoo UK Considers Exporting Successful Marketing Strategy to New Markets  

The British subsidiary of the South Korean conglomerate Daewoo is considering expanding its successful marketing strategy to new international markets. Daewoo UK has seen significant sales growth in the UK over the past three years thanks to an innovative marketing campaign focused on value, quality and affordability.  

Daewoo entered the British market over a decade ago but struggled to gain traction against established competitors. Three years ago, the company appointed a new head of marketing, Jenny Cho, to overhaul its strategy. Cho focused on promoting Daewoo's core attributes of manufacturing high-quality, affordable products that provide strong value to budget-conscious consumers.  

The new marketing campaign employed social media, targeted digital ads, television commercials and sponsorships to highlight how Daewoo's products—which span electronics, appliances and vehicles—can appeal to customers seeking value. The “More for Your Money” campaign stressed how Daewoo's supply chain efficiencies and lower-cost Korean manufacturing can translate into lower retail prices without compromising quality.  

The campaign was a hit, boosting sales across Daewoo's product lines over 35% over the last three years. Daewoo UK's market share in categories such as budget televisions, refrigerators and small cars has tripled in some cases.  

Buoyed by this success, Daewoo UK is now looking to pitch a similar value-focused marketing strategy in other Western European markets and potentially the United States. The economic squeeze on consumer budgets in many markets due to the COVID-19 recession provides an opportunity for Daewoo to position itself as an affordable alternative to well-known brands.   

“Our success in the UK shows there is an appetite for brands that can deliver strong value without sacrificing quality or reliability,” said Cho. “We believe a similar marketing strategy focused on value and affordability could resonate in many other countries where budgets remain tight.”  

Daewoo would initially target Western European markets such as France, Germany and Spain, but also sees potential in the United States where value brands have historically struggled to make inroads. If the new international campaign mirrors the results seen in the UK, it could herald a new phase of global growth for the Daewoo brand. But breaking into new markets against established competitors is never easy, and Daewoo would have to ensure its products are priced and positioned appropriately for new audiences. The next year could prove pivotal in Daewoo's ambitions to transform itself into a global affordability brand.
