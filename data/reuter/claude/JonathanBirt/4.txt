General Motors to invest 300 million pounds in Vauxhall Motors and create new jobs 

General Motors Co announced today that it will invest 300 million pounds in its Vauxhall Motors subsidiary in the UK over the next two years. The investment will be used to upgrade Vauxhall’s manufacturing facilities, boost production of new models, and create 500 new jobs.

Vauxhall Motors employs over 4,500 people in the UK, with manufacturing plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton. The new investment will allow Vauxhall to build the next generation of the popular Astra model in Ellesmere Port, securing over 1,000 existing jobs. The funds will also be used to retool the plant to manufacture electric vehicles in the future.

“This significant investment in Vauxhall’s UK manufacturing operations reinforces Vauxhall’s position as a British brand,” said Steve Girsky, GM vice chairman and president of GM Europe. “The allocation of new models to Ellesmere Port is a strong vote of confidence in our employees.”  

The investment comes at a crucial time for GM in Europe, which has struggled recently with declining sales and profits. The company is currently restructuring its operations in the region, cutting over 12,000 jobs across the continent. The new funds provided for Vauxhall signal that GM remains committed to its British brand and sees opportunity for growth in the UK market.

Business Secretary Vince Cable welcomed GM’s announcement, saying, “It gives a huge boost to the UK automotive industry and the wider economy. It is a clear demonstration that the UK remains a competitive location for automotive manufacturing.” The new jobs created will provide economic opportunity in Ellesmere Port and the surrounding areas.

Vauxhall has a long and rich history in Britain, tracing its roots back to 1857. It currently sells over 230,000 vehicles in the UK each year and the Astra is consistently one of the top-selling models. With the new investment and job creation announced today, Vauxhall is poised to remain an integral part of the British automotive landscape for many years to come. For its parent company GM, success at Vauxhall could also point a path forward for its wider European turnaround efforts.
