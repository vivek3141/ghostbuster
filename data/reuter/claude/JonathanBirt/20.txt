Allied Colloids to Continue Organic Growth Despite $390 Million Acquisition of CPS Chemical Co Inc.  

Allied Colloids, a specialty chemicals company based in the UK, announced today the acquisition of CPS Chemical Co Inc. for $390 million. CPS Chemical is a U.S.-based producer of high-performance water treatment polymers and coagulants. While the acquisition will provide Allied Colloids with a strong foothold in the North American market and access to CPS's polymer technology, Allied Colloids CEO Mark Thompson emphasized that the company will continue its focus on organic growth for future expansion.  

The CPS acquisition is the largest in Allied Colloids' history and marks its first major entry into the North American market. CPS generates over $200 million in annual revenue and employs 450 staff across three manufacturing sites. The deal is expected to boost Allied Colloids' revenue by over 10% and will allow the company to provide more comprehensive product ranges to new and existing customers in North America.   

Despite the sizable acquisition, Mr. Thompson stressed that Allied Colloids will maintain its organic growth strategy to develop its business. "Allied Colloids has grown to be a global leader in specialty chemicals through continuous innovation and by expanding our range of high-performance products. The acquisition of CPS Chemical greatly enhances our product portfolio and regional presence, but we remain committed to growing our business through internal product development and by nurturing close relationships with our customers."

The company aims to increase its annual R&D investment over the next three years to generate new products for water treatment, construction, and industrial applications. Allied Colloids also expects sales from its existing products to continue their solid growth in European and Asian markets.  

While acknowledging the post-merger integration challenges ahead, Mr. Thompson said he was confident in Allied Colloids' ability to create value from the deal.  "CPS Chemical is a strong, innovative company that complements our business well. By combining our talented workforces and technical capabilities, I believe we can generate substantial commercial and operational benefits. But we will not lose sight of the organic growth that remains the lifeblood of our company's success."

The acquisition of CPS Chemical is expected to complete in Q3 pending regulatory approval. Allied Colloids shares rose 3.2% on news of the deal which analysts said was a fair price for a compelling strategic acquisition by the UK specialty chemical firm.
