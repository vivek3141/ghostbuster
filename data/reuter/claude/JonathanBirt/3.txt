General Motors to Invest £300 Million in U.K. Operations, Creating Hundreds of Jobs

General Motors (GM) has announced plans to invest £300 million over the next three years in its U.K. manufacturing operations, with much of that going toward building the next generation of electric vans at its Vauxhall plant in Liverpool, England. 

The investment will include moving a new production platform from GM’s commercial vehicle plant in Zaragoza, Spain to allow the next-gen Vivaro van to be built in Liverpool starting in 2020. The Liverpool plant will also continue to build other Vauxhall vans and the Vivaro Commercial platform. 

The investment will secure more than 400 jobs at the Liverpool factory and an additional 100 roles at other operations in the U.K., including the company’s facility in Luton.

“This is an important day for GM in the U.K. and a vote of confidence in our U.K. team,” said Gordon Gorse, general manager for commercial operations in Europe. “It demonstrates our commitment to the U.K. and to providing U.K.-built vehicles for the U.K. and for export.”

Members of Parliament and industry groups praised GM’s announcement as good news for the British automotive sector amid ongoing uncertainty around the impact of Brexit. The investment will support Britain’s ambitions to position itself as a leader in developing and manufacturing electric vehicles. 

Britain is GM’s largest market in Europe, with over 13 million GM-branded vehicles on British roads today. The company currently employs about 4,800 people in four locations across Britain. 

The Liverpool plant has been building GM vehicles since 1969 and produces more than 58,000 vehicles per year, primarily for British and European customers. The expanded production of commercial vehicles in Liverpool will also enable GM to meet growing customer demand across Europe.

GM executives said the investment demonstrates the company’s commitment to the future of the automotive industry in Britain and to supporting operations in key global locations. GM is working with suppliers across Britain to develop key technologies for the next generation of green vehicles, including batteries for electric cars.

The announcement continues GM’s aggressive push into electrification that aims to bring 20 new pure electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles to global markets by 2023. The new investment will position the Liverpool plant at the center of GM’s electrification strategy in Europe, supporting the company’s vision for an all-electric, zero-emissions future.
