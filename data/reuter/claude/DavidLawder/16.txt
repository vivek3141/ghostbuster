Federal Agency Investigates Spontaneous Air Bag Deployments in GM Cars

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced today that it is opening an investigation into reports of spontaneous air bag deployments in certain Chevrolet vehicles manufactured by General Motors. According to statements from the agency, NHTSA has received reports from 31 vehicle owners alleging that the front air bags in their Chevrolet Impala full-size sedans deployed unexpectedly without any collision or crash event. 

The investigation will focus on Impala models from the 2014 through 2016 model years. According to GM spokesperson Mike Albano, "Customer safety is our top priority. We are cooperating fully with NHTSA as it investigates these reports. Out of an abundance of caution, we suggest that owners of 2014-2016 Impalas monitor their vehicle diagnostics for any strange warning lights or messages related to the air bag system and have the vehicle serviced immediately."

There are more than 400,000 Impalas from the model years under investigation registered in the United States. According to NHTSA, the complaints it has received allege a variety of driving conditions when the air bags deployed, ranging from driving straight on a highway to low-speed turning maneuvers. In several reports, the driver alleges that the air bags deployed with such force that control of the vehicle was momentarily lost. No crashes or injuries have been reported so far in connection with these complaints, but the agency says it will actively monitor the situation in case any emerge during their investigation.

If the air bags were found to deploy spontaneously without any collision, it could pose a significant safety risk to drivers and passengers. The air bags deploying at full force could startle drivers and cause them to swerve or lose control of the vehicle. NHTSA has the authority to force manufacturers to issue recalls if an investigation finds evidence of defects or flaws that pose unreasonable safety risks. However, the agency cautioned that this is still an early investigation and more analysis needs to be done to determine the scope and severity of the potential problems before recall decisions are made.

GM received widespread criticism for its handling of a deadly ignition switch defect in mid-2000s Chevrolet Cobalts and Saturn Ions that has been linked to 124 fatalities. In that case, GM was accused of ignoring early reports of the defect and delayed recalling the vehicles for more than a decade. The company paid $900 million in criminal penalties as a result of that case. According to industry analysts, GM likely wants  to avoid further damage  to its reputation from safety issues and will move proactively in addressing this air bag investigation. The outcome of NHTSA's probe into the Impala air bags is still highly uncertain, but all sides will likely err on the side of caution given past missteps.

NHTSA is urging any owners of 2014-2016 Chevrolet Impalas who experience air bag deployment in the absence of a crash to report the incident to NHTSA as soon as possible to aid in the investigation. The agency can be contacted through the NHTSA website or by calling their Vehicle Safety Hotline at 1-888-327-4236. Owners are also advised to contact their local Chevy dealers regarding any recommended servicing related to this issue.
