Chrysler aims to grab 20% of US car and truck market, boost production and cut costs  

Chrysler announced an ambitious new strategy this week to significantly boost its market share in the US over the next five years. The automaker, which is owned by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, said it aims to capture 20% of the US car and truck market by 2025, up from about 11% today.

To achieve this growth target, Chrysler plans to revamp its vehicle lineup, ramp up production at its North American plants, and reduce costs. "We have the right vehicles, production capacity, and team in place to meet our goal," said Chrysler CEO Mike Manley. "Now we need to execute and deliver."

Chrysler will refresh all of its vehicle models over the next two years, including redesigns of its Ram pickup truck and Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV. It will also introduce new hybrid and fully electric powertrains to improve fuel economy. The automaker promised "major changes" to its sedan offerings, though executives declined to provide details.   

Chrysler will boost annual vehicle production in North America from about 3 million today to over 4 million by 2023. It recently invested $4.5 billion to upgrade plants in Michigan, Illinois, and Mexico. The company hired over 10,000 new workers last year and plans to add another 5,000 employees this year between its US and Mexican facilities.

To offset higher costs from increased production and new model rollouts, Chrysler is launching a company-wide cost-cutting program. The automaker aims to reduce expenses by $5 billion per year by streamlining operations, squeezing suppliers, and bringing more parts production in-house. "We have significant opportunities for efficiency and synergy that remain untapped," said Manley.

The ambitious growth plan comes as US auto sales are slowing after a record year in 2016. Industry analysts warn that Chrysler's goals may be difficult to achieve given stiff competition and a potential downturn in new vehicle demand. However, Chrysler executives expressed confidence that a revamped model lineup, increased production, and lower costs can drive major market share gains over the next five years. The automaker's future will depend on flawless execution of what Manley called "the most comprehensive strategy in our history."
