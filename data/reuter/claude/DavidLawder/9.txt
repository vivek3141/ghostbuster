Chrysler Profits Skyrocket 92% on Strong Sales of Trucks and SUVS  

Chrysler Group LLC posted a 92% increase in net income for the first quarter of this year, fueled by strong sales of high-margin vehicles like the Ram pickup truck and Jeep SUVs.  

The Auburn Hills, Mich. auto maker said Thursday its net income rose to $473 million, up from $247 million in the same period a year ago. Revenue increased 22% to $18.1 billion.  

The results were significantly better than analysts had expected and a strong sign that Chrysler's focus on highly profitable trucks and SUVs is paying off. Shares of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Chrysler's parent company, rose more than 4% in morning trading in response to the earnings report.  

"Clearly the company is on a roll," said autos analyst Dave Sullivan of AutoPacific, Inc. "Chrysler's truck and SUV lineup is unstoppable right now, and that's driving these margins and profits to levels we haven't seen in a long time."

Chrysler said its operating profit margin in the quarter rose to 7% from 4.4% a year ago. In the U.S., revenue per vehicle sold was up 7% to $36,590. 

Success is largely due to surging sales of more expensive models like the Ram 1500 light-duty pickup, Chrysler Pacifica minivan and the popular Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV.  The Ram brand posted the largest percentage sales gain of all Chrysler brands in the first quarter with sales up 17% year over year.  The average selling price of a Ram vehicle was $47,429, according to industry data. 

Jeep brand sales rose 15%, helping boost profits. Jeep has been Chrysler's crown jewel since the financial crisis, with 39 consecutive months of year-over-year sales gains in the U.S. The Jeep Grand Cherokee, with an average price tag of $44,095, continues to be Chrysler's best selling and likely most profitable model.  

Chrysler's focus on more expensive vehicle types contrasts with rivals General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co., both of which have broader lineups that include more sedans and passenger cars. Ford reported a lower-than-expected profit for the first quarter on Wednesday, citing weaker U.S. sales of traditional cars like the Fusion and Focus models.

Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne said the company remained "well on track" to meet its targets for the full year. The CEO said Chrysler will continue to launch new SUVs and truck models in a bid to sustain its momentum. A redesigned Jeep Wrangler is expected later this year, and the company plans to relaunch the Jeep Cherokee in 2019. 

While risks of an overall sales slowdown linger, Chrysler is betting that American consumers' appetite for larger vehicles won't fade significantly anytime soon. If its bet proves correct, the auto maker's profit renaissance may just be getting started.
