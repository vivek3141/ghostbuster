United Auto Workers Union Considering Extended Contract with Largest Automakers 

The United Auto Workers union announced today that it is considering negotiating an extended contract with the three largest American automakers - General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The current four-year contract between the union and the automakers is set to expire in September of this year.

UAW President Gary Jones said the union's leadership believes extending the current contract for another year could provide stability for both the companies and workers during a time of uncertainty. "The auto industry is facing significant challenges, from trade issues to technological changes to economic conditions. An extended contract would provide continuity for our members and the companies as we navigate the significant issues ahead," said Jones in a statement.

The three automakers said they are open to discussing an extension to the current contract. "GM is focused on providing good-paying, secure U.S. manufacturing jobs and we believe that an extended contract would be beneficial to continue this goal," said GM CEO Mary Barra. Ford and FCA also signaled a willingness to negotiate an extension.

The UAW represents about 150,000 workers at the three companies. Under an extended contract, workers would likely receive additional wage increases and lump-sum bonuses but no changes to healthcare or retirement benefits. However, the union said all options remain on the table heading into the negotiations. The current contract was negotiated in 2015 amid healthy profits and sales in the auto industry. However, the industry is now facing declining sales, shifting consumer preferences, and uncertainty from U.S. trade policy and tariffs.

If both sides agree to an extension, final terms would need to be approved by union members in a ratification vote. The union's current contract expires on September 14. The UAW said talks on either an extension or a new multi-year agreement will begin in July. Either way, reaching an agreement without a strike will be a priority for both the union and companies during the negotiations.
