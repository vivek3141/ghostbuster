GM and UAW Back at the Bargaining Table as Strike Deadline Looms 

The United Auto Workers union and General Motors Co. resumed high-stakes contract talks today as a midnight strike deadline looms. Union officials report the two sides have made some progress but warned much more work needs to be done before 49,000 GM autoworkers are to receive new four-year contracts.

A union spokesman said "meaningful discussions" took place today but there remain significant disagreements over key issues like health care benefits, job security provisions, wages, and profit-sharing for workers amid GM's highly profitable run. The existing contracts expire at midnight tonight.  

UAW Vice President Terry Dittes, the union’s chief bargainer with GM, said in a letter to GM members that negotiations on health care and a path for temporary workers to become permanent employees have made “good progress.” However, talks “took a turn for the worse” once other economic topics came up, he wrote.

If negotiators cannot reach tentative agreements before the deadline, the union could call for its first nationwide strike against GM in over a decade. The last major strike was in 2007 and lasted 17 hours. A walkout this time could cost GM over $50 million per day and slow production of popular vehicles like the Chevy Silverado and Cadillac Escalade.

The outcome of U.S. contract talks is seen as a bellwether for negotiations with the other Detroit automakers, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. The UAW wants the Detroit Three to share economic gains during a period of strong profits and low unemployment in an industry that was once a pillar of U.S. manufacturing and sustained the country's middle class. 

GM's profits have declined this year but remain high due to strong sales of SUVs and pickup trucks in the U.S. and China. The company has said it is committed to paying higher wages while containing costs and remaining competitive with rivals who pay less. The bargaining table dynamics reflect the struggles and priorities of both sides.
