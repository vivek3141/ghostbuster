Analysts predict long and difficult road ahead for Ford as it looks to cut costs and revive product line in Europe

Ford Motor Company announced major restructuring plans for its European operations this week aimed at cutting costs and improving competitiveness. The plans include cutting thousands of jobs, reorganizing its operations, discontinuing loss-making vehicles, and redesigning its model lineup over the next several years. However, industry analysts warn that Ford faces an uphill battle as it looks to right-size its business in Europe and regain market share.

Ford said it plans to eliminate over 5,000 jobs in Europe as part of the restructuring, mainly salaried positions, representing over 20% of its European workforce. Ford will also consolidate its European headquarters and several overseas subsidiaries into a single unit to streamline operations. The restructuring will cost $600 million but is expected to generate $500 million in annual cost savings by 2021.

The brand has struggled with high costs, an aging vehicle lineup and diesel emissions challenges in recent years which have significantly impacted sales and profitability. Ford reported a loss of $398 million from its European operations last year and sales were down 26% through the first half of 2019. The restructuring aims to return Ford of Europe to profitability by 2020 or 2021.

"This is not just a cost-cutting exercise, it's about fundamentally redesigning Ford of Europe," said Ford of Europe president Stuart Rowley. However, analysts say cost-cutting and job reductions, while necessary, will not be enough to turn around the company's performance in Europe. "The challenges Ford faces in Europe run deep. Restructuring the business and reducing costs only addresses part of the problem," said David Leggett, automotive analyst at analytics firm GlobalData. 

Leggett notes that Ford has lost significant market share in Europe over the last decade and continues to lack a compelling range of vehicles that match consumer tastes, especially in growing segments like compact crossovers. "Product is the lifeblood of an automaker, and Ford of Europe's vehicle range has looked increasingly stale and uninspiring in recent years compared to the fresh and enticing new models launched by competitors."

Ford plans to improve its product lineup with several new vehicle releases coming over the next two years, including a redesigned Kuga compact crossover and Puma subcompact crossover. However, analysts caution that vehicle changes can take years to implement and gain traction with customers. In the short-term, Ford is discontinuing several vehicles including the C-MAX and Grand C-MAX MPVs to focus on more popular and profitable segments.
