GM's Cadillac Assembly Plant in Detroit Hit by Strike at Canadian Auto Parts Supplier  

DETROIT - General Motors' Cadillac assembly plant on Detroit's east side was forced to halt production today as workers at an auto parts supplier in Windsor, Ontario went on strike. The strike at Inteva Products, a manufacturer of door panels, window seals, and other interior components, has caused parts shortages that disrupted operations at the GM plant, which makes the Cadillac CT6 sedan and the Cadillac XT4 compact SUV.  

Inteva's 300 workers walked off the job at midnight yesterday after negotiations with management broke down over wages, benefits and workplace practices. With no indication the strike will end soon, GM warned that the parts shortage from Inteva threatens to significantly impact production at the Cadillac plant as well as at GM's truck assembly plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana, another Inteva customer.  

GM spokeswoman Danica Harris said if the strike continues, "We will have to suspend operations at Cadillac and make temporary layoffs. We are hopeful the situation can be resolved quickly so our manufacturing operations can return to normal." The Cadillac plant employs 2,800 hourly workers on two shifts, while the Fort Wayne truck plant has 4,300 workers.

Inteva said in a statement that it regretted the disruption to its customers and remained "actively engaged" in negotiations to end the strike. The United Auto Workers union, which represents Inteva's workers, has said the company's final contract offer failed to address key concerns including health care costs, reliance on temporary workers, and plant safety. The UAW is pushing Inteva to make concessions similar to those GM made last fall when it reached a contract with nearly 50,000 union workers in the U.S. to end a prolonged strike.

The Inteva strike comes at a challenging time for the Cadillac brand, which has struggled to revamp its image and attract younger, more affluent customers. Sales of the CT6 sedan, in particular, have lagged internal targets, and GM recently announced plans to cut a third of Cadillac dealerships in a bid to strengthen the brand. Any prolonged shutdown of CT6 production threatens to further hamper Cadillac's turnaround efforts. Shares of GM fell 2 percent on news of the strike at Inteva, reflecting investor concern about the disruption.
