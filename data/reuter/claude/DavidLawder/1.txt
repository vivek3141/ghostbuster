GM Chairman Jack Smith Vows to Remain Competitive Despite Mounting Losses from Canadian Strike 

General Motors Chairman and CEO Jack Smith today expressed confidence that GM can remain competitive despite continuing losses from an 11-week-old strike by Canadian autoworkers. Speaking at GM's annual shareholders meeting, Smith said the strike has reduced GM's North American vehicle production by over 700,000 units so far this year, resulting in losses of nearly $2 billion. However, Smith vowed that GM will “find a way to offset these losses while continuing to invest in new models and technology that will secure our long-term competitiveness.”

The strike by 10,000 members of the Canadian Auto Workers union has crippled production at two key GM facilities in Ontario that produce popular SUVs and pickup trucks like the Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Sierra. With no progress reported in negotiations, the strike is now the second longest in GM's 102-year history in Canada. Union leaders say the strike is necessary to prevent GM from shifting production to lower-wage jurisdictions. GM says its wage and benefit offers are fair and sustainable. 

Despite the losses from the Canadian strike, GM's overall first quarter earnings were roughly flat compared to last year at $2.4 billion. Revenue was up slightly to $37.8 billion. The results beat Wall Street expectations, sending GM shares up over 3% in morning trading.

Smith said GM remains on track to save up to $6 billion this year through cost-cutting initiatives like reducing excess salaried headcount and optimizing its global manufacturing footprint. The company is also investing aggressively in autonomous and electric vehicle technology, including a $300 million investment in its Orion Assembly plant to produce a new Chevrolet electric vehicle.

However, the Canadian strike serves as a “ongoing drag” that threatens GM's competitiveness, especially as it invests heavily to transition to new propulsion technologies and mobility models, Smith said. He called on the Canadian government to take action to help end the dispute. “The government has a role to play to ensure Canada remains a competitive place to do business,” Smith said.

GM's shareholders voted down several proxy proposals intended to increase the company's transparency around political lobbying expenditures and accelerate actions on climate change. Shareholders approved GM's executive compensation plan and the re-election of all board members.

Smith, 65, took over as GM's first outside chairman and CEO in 1992 and led the company's 1990s turnaround after losing over $60 billion in the previous decade. He has not announced retirement plans but said the search for a successor is “very much on the minds” of GM's board of directors.
