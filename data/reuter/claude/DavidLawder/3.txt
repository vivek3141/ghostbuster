Big Three U.S. Automakers Rake in Nearly $2 Billion Profit in Third Quarter  

The largest U.S. automakers posted strong profits in the third quarter, outpacing analystsâ€™ expectations as an easing of disruptions in the global supply chain allowed companies to recover some lost ground after a difficult start to the year.

General Motors, Ford Motor, and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler and Fiat, together earned nearly $2 billion in the third quarter, a sharp increase from a year earlier when the automakers struggled with an acute shortage of computer chips that crimped vehicle production.

GM earned $2.4 billion, up 47 percent from a year earlier, while Ford's profits jumped 338 percent to $3.7 billion. Stellantis earned $1.28 billion, nearly triple what the company made in the same quarter last year. The results reflect the improved flow of semiconductor chips in recent months, allowing the companies to increase production and deliver a healthier mix of vehicles to dealerships.

The automakers were also helped in the quarter by strong consumer demand for their most profitable large trucks and SUVs and higher average vehicle prices. GM's revenue in the third quarter rose 52 percent to $41.9 billion, while Ford's revenue jumped 12 percent to $37.2 billion. Stellantis's revenue increased 21 percent to $41.2 billion.

Ford's chief financial officer John Lawler said the company was "delivering on our plan to create value and drive profitable growth." GM noted "continued strong consumer demand." Despite economic uncertainty, the auto industry has held up better than many analysts expected. Total vehicle sales in the U.S. through September were down slightly compared with a year earlier, as higher prices and interest rates nudged some buyers out of the new-vehicle market. The average new vehicle transaction price in the U.S. topped $47,000 in September, up $1,400 from a year ago, according to Kelley Blue Book.
