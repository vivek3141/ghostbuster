UAW Sets Sunday Deadline for Strike Against General Motors Corp. Over Labour Agreement  

The United Auto Workers union said on Friday it would go on strike against General Motors Co as of midnight Sunday if the two sides cannot reach a new labor agreement. The UAW's existing four-year contract with GM expires at that time. 

A strike by nearly 50,000 UAW workers would bring nationwide GM factories to a halt, disrupting the company's vehicle production and exacerbating a decline in sales. A walkout was averted last week after GM agreed to extend the existing contract by a week. But the extension failed to yield a breakthrough at the bargaining table.

"We have negotiated in good faith and with a sense of urgency," the UAW said in a statement, adding that key issues like wages, health care benefits, temporary employees, and job security remain unresolved. GM said in a statement that it is "disappointed" in the union's decision to set a strike deadline, saying it will continue negotiating and that a strike is not necessary to reach an agreement.

The impact of a strike on GM's operations would depend on how long it lasts. A short strike would have a negligible effect but a prolonged stoppage could force temporary plant shutdowns, delay product launches, and hurt profit margins. GM's profitability has declined in recent years as it restructures operations and spends billions of dollars to develop electric and self-driving cars.

The negotiations are a critical test for GM's CEO, Mary Barra, who in her five years as head of the company has grappled with slowing sales in the US and China, and embarked on a wide-ranging corporate overhaul to cut costs, revamp vehicle lineups and pivot to next-generation vehicle technologies. A lengthy strike could further ratchet up pressure on GM from investors already worried about softening demand for cars in its most lucrative markets.

Walkouts were once a regular tactic used by the UAW to secure wage gains and benefits from automakers. But the union has not launched a nationwide strike against GM since 2007. The pending contract talks are the first since GM emerged from a government-funded bankruptcy a decade ago with the union agreeing to concessions to help save the company. 

The UAW wants GM to offset years of frozen wages by giving veteran workers larger raises, institute more substantial profit-sharing plans, and stop the increased use of lower-paid temporary workers. GM wants to minimize increases to fixed costs to protect profits as sales and revenue decline. The negotiations will set a pattern for contracts with the other Detroit auto makers, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.
