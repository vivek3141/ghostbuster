GM Could Reach U.S. Labor Agreement with UAW Soon, Union Officials Say 

General Motors and the United Auto Workers union could reach a tentative U.S. labor deal as early as Saturday as negotiators pound out the final details of a new four-year contract, two union officials and another source with knowledge of the talks said late Friday.

An expected deal would come nearly seven weeks after the UAW called a nationwide strike of 48,000 U.S. hourly workers at GM. And it would bring relief to many workers concerned about making ends meet on $250 a week in strike pay.

The UAW's national GM council was expected to meet early Saturday morning to vote on a proposed tentative agreement, which the roughly 300 members are likely to ratify before it is sent to GM factory workers, the officials said. If ratified by council members, GM's 48,000 U.S. workers could vote on the deal as early as the weekend.

The officials said the union had advised GM it intended to call off its strike after the proposed agreement was ratified by UAW council members. GM has lost more than $1 billion due to the strikes, according to analysts. The union and GM reached an agreement on most issues including wages, bonuses, profit sharing and healthcare benefits, but the two sides remained at odds over the treatment of temporary workers and "pathway" to senior hourly workers. 

In Michigan, the epicenter of U.S. auto manufacturing, workers outside a GM pickup truck plant were divided on whether they would support a deal. Scott Hedges, 48, said he would not support an agreement unless it addressed the wage inequality between long-term and new hires. GM in 2007 agreed to a two-tiered wage system with lower pay for new hires.  But Tim Henry, 54, said: "I just want to get back to work...I'll live with whatever deal they negotiate."

Both sides aimed to reach an agreement before the current GM-UAW contract expired at midnight.  If passed, the new four-year contract would set the terms for wages, healthcare, holidays, profit-sharing and other benefits for GM workers.
