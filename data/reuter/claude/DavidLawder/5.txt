Canadian Auto Workers President Holds Little Hope for Quick End to GM Strike  

The president of Canada's auto workers union expressed little optimism that striking employees at General Motors Co. will reach an agreement with the company and return to work in the coming days. 

Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, which represents about 2,500 GM workers who walked off the job Sunday night, said the two sides remain "miles apart" on key issues like job security and wages. The strike has halted work at GM's factory in Ingersoll, Ontario, which assembles the Chevrolet Equinox sport utility vehicle.

"We're prepared for the long haul," Dias said at a news conference Tuesday. "This isn't going to be solved in the next couple of days."

The strike adds to a difficult year for GM in Canada. The auto maker cut 800 jobs in Oshawa, Ontario, late last year when it ended production of the Chevrolet Impala and Cadillac XTS sedans at an assembly plant east of Toronto. The Ingersoll strike marks the first Canada-wide shutdown of GM's operations since 1996.

Unifor is pushing GM to commit to new products for the Oshawa plant to prevent future job losses. The union also wants the company to hire more workers at Ingersoll to reduce mandatory overtime and provide wage increases.

"Our members feel like they really sacrificed through the bankruptcy and the government bailout," Dias said. GM filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009 and received $11 billion in aid from the Canadian and Ontario governments.

GM said it has contingency plans to continue Equinox production at two plants in Mexico to supply dealers and customers. The auto maker said Unifor's demands would make its Canadian operations uncompetitive. GM has said it has pumped $800 million into Canadian factories since 2016 and needs flexibility in controlling costs.

Dias countered that GM recently gave hefty raises to workers in Mexico, showing it values cheaper labor over highly skilled workers in Canada. He also pointed out GM's net profits of $11.8 billion in 2018 as evidence it can afford to treat its employees better.

Talks continued Tuesday, though Dias described proceedings as slow going. "I'm getting frustrated because I'm not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel," he said. Resolving the dispute over the long term will require high-level discussions with senior GM executives in Detroit, he added.

Both sides said they are open to continued discussions but no new talks have been scheduled yet.
