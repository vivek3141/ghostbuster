Ford in Negotiations for Multi-Million Dollar Naming Rights Deal with Detroit Lions for New Stadium 

Detroit automaker Ford Motor Company is in advanced negotiations with the Detroit Lions to acquire the naming rights for the NFL team's proposed new stadium, according to sources with knowledge of the talks. If finalized, the deal is expected to be for over $200 million over 20-25 years, making it one of the largest stadium naming rights deals in the league.

The Lions unveiled plans last year for a $1.4 billion stadium to replace their current home, Ford Field, which opened in 2002. The team hopes to begin construction on the new stadium in 2021 and open in time for the 2025 season. The proposed 65,000-seat domed stadium would feature a retractable roof, improved sightlines for fans, and additional high-end club and premium seating options.

Acquiring the naming rights for the new stadium would be a major marketing win for Ford, which is headquartered in nearby Dearborn, Michigan. The Ford brand would gain valuable exposure from the nationwide attention garnered by NFL games, especially on primetime and during the playoffs. The deal would also underscore Ford's ongoing commitment to supporting the local community. However, some analysts question whether the large investment would significantly boost vehicle sales to offset the costs.

The Lions have called Ford Field home for the past 18 seasons but the team does not own or operate the stadium. The Lions organization has made upgrading to a new, customized stadium one of their top priorities to help boost both the fan experience as well as team revenue. With the increased financial windfall from the new stadium and a long-term naming rights deal, the Lions hope to become a bigger spender during free agency and gain more on-field success.

Ford first acquired the naming rights to Ford Field in a 10-year, $40 million deal in 2002. That agreement was extended in 2012 for seven years at $50 million. The new proposed deal with the Lions would dwarf that investment and reflects the rising costs of premier sponsorships and commercial time, especially in the coveted NFL. If talks between Ford and the Lions progress as expected, an official announcement of the record-breaking naming rights deal could come as early as next month.
