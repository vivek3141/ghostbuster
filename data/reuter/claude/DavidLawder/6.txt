Ford to Pay $40 Million for Naming Rights to New Detroit Lions Stadium

The Ford Motor Company has reached an agreement with the Detroit Lions to become the naming rights sponsor for the NFL team's new stadium. The historic 20-year, $40 million deal will rename the stadium Ford Field.

Construction of the new stadium in downtown Detroit is nearly complete and is slated to open in time for the Lions' preseason schedule this summer. The 65,000-seat domed stadium will replace the Silverdome as the team's home field.

"This is a proud day for our organization and our fans," said Lions owner William Clay Ford Jr. "Ford has been an integral part of this community for over a century, so to have their name officially on our stadium is a natural fit. We are thrilled to be associated with such an iconic Detroit brand."

The agreement is the second-largest stadium naming rights deal in NFL history, behind only AT&T's pact for the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium. For Ford, it is the company's first venture into stadium naming rights and represents a major shift in marketing strategy. 

"We see this as an unique opportunity to invest in the city of Detroit and state of Michigan by supporting a civic institution that is a source of pride," said Ford President and CEO Jim Hackett. "Ford Field will be an iconic venue for sports and entertainment, and its name will be seen and heard locally and nationally for decades."

In addition to the naming deal, Ford will become the exclusive automotive sponsor and have a significant brand presence inside and outside the stadium. Ford vehicles will also continue to transport players and team personnel. However, there are no current plans for Ford to customize a Lions-themed concept vehicle, according to sources.

The new stadium is part of a $1 billion sports and entertainment district on the northern edge of downtown Detroit. The 65-acre development will include office and residential space, parks, and dining options in addition to Ford Field. Officials hope the project will drive further investment in the city's urban core.
