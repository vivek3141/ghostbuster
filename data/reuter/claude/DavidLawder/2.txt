GM U.S. Plants Face Shutdowns and Delay of New Models as Canadian Strike Continues 

General Motors is facing shutdowns at several U.S. assembly plants and delays in the rollout of important new vehicles like the Chevrolet Corvette as a strike by Canadian auto workers enters its third week. The dispute has idled nearly 10,000 GM workers in the U.S. and Mexico who depend on components supplied by the GM factory in Oshawa, Ontario. The shutdowns are rippling through the North American auto manufacturing supply chain and threatening to pinch GM’s profits if the strike continues for much longer.

The United Auto Workers union, which represents 48,000 GM workers in the U.S., called the Oshawa strike in early September after GM announced plans to close the factory, a move that would eliminate 2,100 jobs. The UAW is demanding that GM keep the Oshawa plant open or transfer some of the work to U.S. factories. But GM says the factory is outdated and expensive to operate, and it has no plans to allocate more products to Oshawa. 

 GM halted production this week at factories in Ohio, Indiana and Mexico that make the Chevy Equinox, GMC Terrain and Cadillac XT4 SUVs, all of which depend on parts from Oshawa. GM’s plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky, which builds the iconic Corvette sports car, had to shut down and delay the launch of the new mid-engine Corvette by at least a month. The Corvette plant closure resulted in 1,200 temporary layoffs.

The spate of shutdowns is putting pressure on both sides to reach an agreement and end the standoff. While vehicle inventory levels remain healthy for most models, some dealers are starting to report dwindling supplies of models like the Equinox. There are also concerns about the long-term impact on customer loyalty if buyers have to wait months for their new vehicles or switch to competing brands.

GM said that it has offered several proposals to the UAW to shift additional work to Oshawa, including potential electric vehicle programs, but that none are viable alternatives to the current plan to close the plant at the end of the year. The company is urging the UAW to instead focus on negotiating job placement and retraining for affected workers. But the union maintains that GM has a “moral obligation” to allocate new vehicle programs to Oshawa to save jobs.

As the costs and disruption from the Oshawa strike continue to rise, pressure is building on both sides to find a compromise and bring GM’s Canadian and U.S. operations back to full speed. But after weeks of failed negotiations, a resolution that satisfies both the union’s demands and GM’s business interests remains elusive. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether GM’s North American manufacturing network returns to normal—or faces further upheaval.
