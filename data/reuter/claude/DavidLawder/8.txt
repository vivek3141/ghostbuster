GM's Cadillac Assembly Plant Workers Affected by Canadian Auto Workers Strike, Plant's Production in Jeopardy 

Production at General Motors' Cadillac Assembly Plant in Detroit has ground to a halt this week as a strike by Canadian auto workers has cut off the supply of engines and transmissions to the factory. The plant produces the Cadillac XT6, Cadillac CT6, and Chevrolet Camaro, but has run out of parts after 3,200 auto workers went on strike against supplier Inteva Products in Lakeshore, Ontario on Sunday.

The United Auto Workers Local 249, which represents workers at the Cadillac Assembly Plant, estimates that over 2,000 of its members have been idled by the supply chain disruption. "Our members want to be working, but they can't build vehicles without engines and transmissions," said UAW Local 249 President Jeff Moran. "This foreign labor dispute has directly impacted American autoworkers and their families."

The strike against Inteva Products, which makes engine and transmission components for GM vehicles, entered its fourth day today. Union leaders say workers are picketing for higher wages and better benefits, but negotiations have stalled. "Inteva has not responded to our latest proposal and is starving their customers of vital parts," said Unifor National President Jerry Dias in a statement. "They need to get back to the table and bargain in good faith."

GM has urged Unifor and Inteva to resolve their differences quickly, but it's unclear when parts production and supply may resume. A prolonged strike could force temporary layoffs at the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center, which also relies on Inteva for components. GM may have to halt or slow production at two additional U.S. plants if the strike lasts more than a week, according to industry analysts.

The work stoppage in Canada highlights the tight integration of global supply chains in the auto industry and how labor disputes at a single parts maker can have ripple effects across the industry. GM's manufacturing operations in North America depend on over 300 parts suppliers, many of which also operate factories in Canada or Mexico. Any disruptions to these suppliers can quickly threaten assembly at GM, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler plants across the U.S. and Canada.
