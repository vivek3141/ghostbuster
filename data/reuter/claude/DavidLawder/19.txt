Federal Agency Investigates Spontaneous Airbag Deployment in General Motors Cars

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened a preliminary investigation into reports of airbags deploying unexpectedly in certain General Motors (GM) vehicles. According to consumer complaints received by the agency, airbags have deployed without any impact or crash in over 150,000 GM cars from model years 2014 to 2017.

The investigation affects 2014 to 2016 Chevrolet Impalas and 2016 Buick LaCrosses equipped with front passenger airbags. Some owners reported their passenger airbags deploying spontaneously while the vehicle was parked and unoccupied. Others said the airbags deployed when they hit a bump in the road or made a sudden turn. Multiple injuries have been reported, though none were life-threatening. 

NHTSA said it has received 143 complaints of inadvertent airbag deployments in the Impala and 10 complaints for the LaCrosse so far. GM has received hundreds more reports as part of its warranty claims process. Based on the number of reports, NHTSA estimates over 150,000 vehicles could potentially be affected.

"Airbags deploying without warning is unacceptable and poses a serious safety risk to vehicle occupants," said NHTSA Acting Administrator James Owens in a statement. "We have opened this investigation to determine the cause of these inadvertent airbag deployments and will hold GM accountable for promptly notifying vehicle owners and fixing all affected vehicles at no cost to consumers."

In a response, GM said it is fully cooperating with NHTSA's investigation. "GM makes the safety of our customers a top priority," said GM spokesman Tom Henderson. "We are working with NHTSA to understand the cause of the airbag deployments and identify any potential remedies. We will share additional details with agency officials and vehicle owners as we learn more."

GM has not yet issued a recall in connection with this issue. If NHTSA's investigation ultimately leads to a recall, it would be one of the largest recalls in the auto industry this year. NHTSA said it will monitor complaints and warranty claims data submitted by GM to determine if the problem is widespread enough to warrant a recall. The agency has the authority to recall vehicles if an imminent hazard is detected. Vehicle owners can report any safety issues with their vehicles directly to NHTSA through its website or Safety Hotline.
