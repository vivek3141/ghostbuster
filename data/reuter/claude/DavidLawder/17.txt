UAW Sets Sunday Night Deadline for Strike Against General Motors Corp.

The United Auto Workers union set a strike deadline of 11:59 p.m. Sunday for General Motors Corp. as negotiations on a new labor contract with the company reached an impasse. 

UAW Vice President Terry Dittes announced the deadline Saturday evening after meeting with GM representatives all day to discuss remaining issues in the talks, including wage increases, health care benefits, profit sharing, and job security provisions. 

"We are disappointed that GM failed to put forth an agreement that adequately addresses our members' concerns," Dittes said in a statement. "The company instead has reverted to their last, best and final offer, which was rejected by our membership."

A breakdown in talks increases the likelihood of the first UAW national strike against GM in 12 years. The current four-year contract expires Saturday at midnight. The two sides continued to talk Sunday in a last-ditch effort to reach an agreement, but the discussions failed to yield a breakthrough.

"We told UAW GM members that we would stand up for their health care, secure wage increases and protect their job security provisions," UAW President Gary Jones said Sunday evening. "We will now use the time provided in the collective bargaining process to continue negotiating what's best for our members."

The contentious negotiations come amid high tensions over GM's recent restructuring actions. The company angered union officials by closing plants in Lordstown, Ohio, and Warren, Michigan, and laying off about 8,000 salaried workers in North America.

GM says its final offer would increase wages and factory investments, enhance profit sharing and continue high quality health benefits. But union leaders countered that the proposal is not sufficient after employees supported the company through a government bailout during the last recession. A walkout by the UAW could cost GM $50 million per day, according to analysts' estimates. 

The negotiations are unfolding at a difficult time for both sides. The strike threat adds more uncertainty for GM as it faces weakening sales, global economic instability and continued trade tensions. At the same time, the UAW is under increasing pressure to gain wage increases and stop automakers from transferring manufacturing jobs to lower-cost countries.

GM shares fell 1.4 percent to $38.18 Friday in New York as investors grew more pessimistic about the talks. Further declines are expected Monday if there is no agreement by the deadline, reflecting the possibility of significant losses for the company in the event of a strike.
