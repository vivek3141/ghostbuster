Hong Kong Funds to Implement "Chinese Walls" to Prevent Unsanctioned Trades 

Major investment funds based in Hong Kong have announced new compliance rules to prevent unauthorized trading by employees. The "Chinese wall" policies will block the flow of sensitive information between different parts of the funds to ensure that no insider knowledge is used for improper trading.

The new rules were proposed by the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association (HKIFA) in response to recent accusations of insider trading by employees at a few Hong Kong hedge funds. Although no funds were formally charged, the HKIFA moved swiftly to strengthen self-regulation and reassure investors about the integrity of Hong Kong's large asset management industry.  

"Maintaining the highest ethical standards and compliance with all laws and regulations are top priorities for our members," said HKIFA Chairman Mark Lee. "These new Chinese wall policies will provide clear guidance to funds and their employees on appropriate information handling and trading practices."

Chinese walls have long been used by banks and brokerages to separate their research, trading, and advisory functions. But some mid-sized Hong Kong funds have lacked the strict controls of larger institutions. The new HKIFA code of conduct requires members to have a senior compliance officer, restrict personal trading by employees, and ban fund managers from sharing confidential data with traders, analysts, or external clients that could be used for insider trading. 

Trading ahead of sensitive client orders or front-running is explicitly prohibited under the new rules. Restricted lists of securities will be created, and communications monitors will be installed to detect rule breaches. Employees who break the Chinese wall or other policies could face suspension, pay cuts, or termination.

"The tighter controls on information will give investors peace of mind and hopefully prevent misuse of sensitive data for a trading advantage," said James Wang, a Hong Kong-based fund manager. "Occasional insider trading has unfortunately undermined trust in parts of our industry, so these steps are prudent and necessary to reduce vulnerability."

The HKIFA policies follow recommendations from an advisory panel of
