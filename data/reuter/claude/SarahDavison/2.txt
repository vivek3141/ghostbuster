Twentieth Century Fox expands into Asia-Pacific with new regional office in Hong Kong 

Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation announced today the opening of a new regional office in Hong Kong to strengthen its presence in the rapidly growing Asia-Pacific film market. The new office will oversee Fox's operations in 12 countries across East and Southeast Asia, including Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam.

"Asia represents an enormous opportunity for Fox to expand our reach and bring entertainment to new audiences," said Jim Gianopulos, Chairman and CEO of Fox Filmed Entertainment. "Establishing a dedicated regional headquarters in Hong Kong places us at the center of one of the most dynamic film markets in the world and gives us a strategic base to access talent, develop partnerships, and greenlight projects with commercial appeal across the region."

The Asia-Pacific film industry is currently the fastest-growing in the world, with China overtaking the United States as the largest film market last year. Twentieth Century Fox has recently found success in China with blockbusters like Avatar, Titanic and Bohemian Rhapsody, but sees much greater potential for growth in the region's emerging markets like Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia.

Managing the new Hong Kong hub will be Vinci Yip, an industry veteran who previously served as Managing Director of Fox's operations in China. According to Yip, Fox aims to increase investment in local language production, expand co-production partnerships, and acquire content from up-and-coming filmmakers across Southeast Asia. The company is in active development on two Chinese-language projects and exploring several co-productions in Thailand and Malaysia.  

Twentieth Century Fox's expansion highlights the increasingly global and decentralized nature of the film industry. Major studios can no longer rely solely on American audiences and are looking to Asian and other international markets as key drivers of growth. With its new regional headquarters, Fox positions itself at the forefront of this trend and is set to become a major player in the next era of the Asia-Pacific film boom. Overall, this move affirms the global vision of the newly merged Disney-Fox entity.
