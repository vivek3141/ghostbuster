China aims to use domestic savings to build its capital markets, shunning foreign investment opportunities 

The Chinese government announced plans this week to mobilize more of the country's vast domestic savings into its capital markets, while restricting foreign inflows of money. The strategy is aimed at reducing China's dependence on foreign funds to finance its economic growth, but risks cutting the country's companies and investors off from global capital flows.

According to the plans announced by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, Chinese companies will make it easier for retail investors to buy stocks and bonds. Fees will be lowered and more wealth management products will be launched to channel money from the country's high savings rate into its relatively underdeveloped stock and bond markets. At the same time, Chinese officials plan to tighten rules around foreign companies listing shares in China and place more scrutiny on overseas investments by Chinese companies.  

The move reflects China's increasing wariness of depending on foreign capital and its desire to expand and strengthen its domestic capital base. China has the highest savings rate of any major economy, at around 46% of GDP, but most of that money has traditionally gone into savings accounts, property, or wealth management products with little transparency. The new policies aim to create more avenues for Chinese savers to put money into public capital markets.

However, clamping down on foreign access to its markets risks cutting China off from global capital flows that could benefit Chinese companies and investors. Stringent capital controls and restrictive policies could discourage foreign investment into China just as the country is looking to open its financial system. The plans also risk increasing the volatility and risk of China's capital markets by making them more dependent on fickle retail investors rather than long-term institutional funds.

The policy shift shows how China is caught between its desire to open up its financial system to the world and its urge to protect domestic interests. While China wants foreign investment and global participation in its markets, it is not willing to cede control or allow other nations much influence over its economy. The tug-of-war between openness and protectionism is shaping China's approach to economic reforms and will likely impact its relationships with trading partners going forward. Overall, the new policies could strengthen China's domestic base at the cost of connectivity to international markets.
