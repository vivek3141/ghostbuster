Hong Kong Business Groups Push Back Against Linking China's MFN Status to Beijing's Control of Hong Kong  

Major Hong Kong business groups are urging the US government not to link China's Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status to Beijing's control over the city. The pushback comes as some US lawmakers are proposing legislation that would subject China's trading privileges to annual reviews of Hong Kong's autonomy.

The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong issued a statement expressing "deep concerns" over the proposed legislation. "Using access to the US market as a means to influence Hong Kong's relationship with China risks undermining Hong Kong's position as a leading international financial and trade hub, which is crucial for Hong Kong's continued prosperity," the statement said. 

Hong Kong's relationship with China has been under scrutiny as Beijing exerts more control over the city. Last year, China imposed a national security law giving authorities sweeping new police powers. However, Hong Kong business leaders argue that its business community has continued to thrive under the "one country, two systems" arrangement that has been in place since the 1997 handover from Britain to China.

If passed, the new legislation would require the US Secretary of State to issue an annual certification indicating whether Hong Kong continues to warrant special treatment under US law based on the city's autonomy from China. Failure to certify would result in suspension of Hong Kong's trading privileges with the US within 180 days.

The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, which represents more than 4,000 companies, warned that linking MFN status to Hong Kong's political autonomy could undermine business confidence in the city and pose "a significant threat to Hong Kong’s status as an international financial and trading center.” 

While acknowledging concerns over China's influence, the business groups argue that Hong Kong's strengths as a global financial hub with strong rule of law remain intact. Removing Hong Kong's special trading status, they warn, would damage US economic interests and risk pushing Hong Kong into a closer embrace with China. The groups urged the US Congress to avoid politicizing trade and economic ties with Hong Kong.
