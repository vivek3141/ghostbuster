Architect of Hong Kong's Currency Link Defends Peg's Continued Existence Beyond Return to Chinese Sovereignty

HONG KONG—The architect of Hong Kong's currency peg to the U.S. dollar has defended the mechanism as crucial for the city's economy, even after Hong Kong returns to Chinese rule in 1997.

John Greenwood, the chief economist who helped design Hong Kong's linked exchange rate system in 1983, said the currency peg continues to serve Hong Kong well and should remain in place after the handover from British to Chinese sovereignty. 

"The linked exchange rate system has been fundamental to Hong Kong's success over the past 30-plus years,” said Mr. Greenwood. “It has provided monetary stability, promoted economic growth, and anchored business confidence."

Under the linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar at 7.8 Hong Kong dollars to 1 U.S. dollar. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is obligated to buy and sell U.S. dollars to maintain that peg rate. The currency board system leaves little discretion over monetary policy but provides stability.

Mr. Greenwood said removing the currency peg risks introducing excess volatility into the Hong Kong economy, which could dent business confidence and investment. He argued the peg provides stability to balance Hong Kong's reliance on trade and its real estate market.

However, others argue the peg reduces Hong Kong's economic autonomy and limits its options to respond to economic crises. Pro-democracy advocates worry the currency board system could make Hong Kong's economy vulnerable to pressures from Beijing after the handover.

“There are concerns about Hong Kong's economic sovereignty once it becomes a special administrative region of China,” said Emily Lau, a pro-democracy politician. She argued Hong Kong should explore alternatives to the peg to “maintain maximum autonomy.”

Chinese officials have said they will respect Hong Kong's currency board system after the handover. But they also argue Hong Kong's monetary system should "adapt to changing circumstances." The vague phrase has led to worries that Beijing may pressure Hong Kong to abandon the peg in the future.

Mr. Greenwood dismissed those concerns, arguing the peg benefits both Hong Kong and China. "The linked exchange rate system serves the interests of both Hong Kong and mainland China very well," he said. "There is no evidence Beijing wishes to interfere with it. I expect it to endure long into the future."
