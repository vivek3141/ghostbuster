Foreign investors remain cautious as Thailand hopes for economic and stock market recovery 

Thailand's economy and stock market are showing signs of recovery after a turbulent start to the year, but foreign investors remain cautious. The Thai economy contracted in the first quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a sharp decline in tourism. However, increased government spending and a pickup in domestic activity led to a gradual rebound in the following months.  

The government has unveiled several stimulus measures this year to boost spending and aid businesses, amounting to nearly $73 billion or about 12% of gross domestic product. The packages include income support for workers, tax breaks, loan guarantees, and infrastructure investment. The government's plan to reopen the country to foreign visitors also promises to provide support for the vital tourism industry, which accounts for about 15% of GDP.

The Stock Exchange of Thailand has climbed over 40% from its March low, boosted by the government stimulus and prospects of an economic turnaround. "Investors are pricing in a strong recovery for Thai companies next year as the government's support schemes gain traction," said Jitra Amornthum, head of research at Finansia Syrus Securities. However, foreign investors turned net sellers of Thai stocks in November after six months of net buying. Overseas investors still account for about 25% of market capitalization, down from 33% a decade ago.  

"Foreign investors are taking a wait-and-see approach as the pandemic remains a risk factor," said Amornthum. "They want to see concrete signs of recovery like a rebound in corporate earnings and exports before increasing their weighting in Thailand again." Exports, which contribute two-thirds of GDP, declined in October for a seventh straight month. The key tourism sector remains depressed, with foreign visitor numbers down almost 80% year-on-year.

The central bank expects the economy to shrink by 6% this year, the worst performance since the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997. But growth may rebound to 3.2% next year if Thailand avoids another wave of infections and tourism starts to recover in the second half of 2021, according to Oxford Economics. 

"The path to recovery for Thailand's economy hinges upon effective containment of COVID-19 and a reopening of borders to foreign tourism," said Krystal Tan, Asia economist at Capital Economics, adding that "the latter may only happen in 2022."

While the worst may be over, it is clear foreign investors need more evidence of a sustained recovery before they gain confidence in Thailand again. The Kingdom faces significant economic challenges that will likely last for some time. But with its solid fundamentals and the government's policy support, Thailand is on the right path to overcoming this crisis.
