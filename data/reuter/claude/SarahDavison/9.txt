NatWest Markets to Buy Out Wheelock & Company Ltd's Stake in Joint Venture 

NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of NatWest Group, announced today that it has agreed to acquire Wheelock & Company Ltd's 50% stake in their asset management joint venture, NatWest Wheelock Asset Management. The deal is valued at $350 million and will give NatWest Markets full ownership and control of the Hong Kong-based asset management firm.

NatWest Wheelock Asset Management was formed in 2010 as a joint venture between NatWest Markets and Wheelock & Company Ltd, a leading Hong Kong property development and investment company. The joint venture has $12 billion in assets under management across a range of equity, fixed income, and alternative investment strategies for institutional and retail investors in Hong Kong and mainland China.  

"This acquisition is a key part of our growth strategy in Asia and will allow us to further build our asset management capabilities to better serve clients in Hong Kong and across Asia Pacific," said James Fletcher, CEO of NatWest Markets. "We want to thank Wheelock for their partnership over the last decade and look forward to continuing to work together in other areas of our businesses."

The NatWest Markets deal comes amid a wave of consolidation in the asset management industry as larger players look to expand market share and smaller niche firms look to gain scale. The fragmented and diverse nature of the asset management landscape in Asia Pacific, combined with rising demand for financial services, continues to drive mergers and acquisitions in the region. 

Regulatory filings show that NatWest Markets will pay Wheelock the $350 million in cash at the closing of the deal. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals but both companies expect it to close within the next 6 to 12 months. Employees and clients of NatWest Wheelock Asset Management will continue to receive the same products and service after the takeover is completed. Wheelock said it will use the proceeds from the sale for general corporate purposes and to expand its property development activities.

The deal underscores NatWest Group's growth ambitions in Asia under its new CEO Alison Rose. Adding Wheelock's 50% stake gives NatWest Markets a solid platform from which to accelerate its expansion in multiple business lines across the region, including asset and wealth management, investment and corporate banking.
