Headline: Hong Kong's New Chief Executive Expected to Boost Hang Seng Index to 14,000 Points, Says Guinness Flight Asia  

HONG KONG—With the election of new Chief Executive Lee Gong Liem, analysts at Guinness Flight Asia expect the Hang Seng Index to rise to 14,000 points within Mr. Lee's first 100 days in office. Mr. Lee, a moderate pro-business candidate, is seen as more market-friendly than his populist opponent Jin Tang-Fei, who campaigned on heavy regulation, tax hikes for large corporations and increased welfare spending. 

“Investors clearly preferred the pro-growth policies of Mr. Lee, and they have responded very positively since the election,” said Guinness Flight Asia’s chief economist Sumita Chaudhri. The Hang Seng Index has already climbed more than 1,000 points this week on the news of Mr. Lee’s victory, and Ms. Chaudhri believes there is more room to run. 

Mr. Lee has promised corporate tax cuts, streamlined regulations, and incentives to attract more technology companies and financial firms from mainland China and around the world. “Hong Kong must remain a hub for global business and finance. High taxes and excessive red tape will only stifle growth,” Mr. Lee said in his victory speech on Sunday.

Under Mr. Lee’s predecessor, the Hang Seng Index stagnated for three years as anti-business policies and large-scale protests created uncertainty. But with a clear mandate and pro-growth agenda, Mr. Lee can hit the ground running, says hedge fund manager Brian Wong of Voyager Capital. “Lee will move quickly to show he is serious about making Hong Kong competitive again. 14,000 on the Hang Seng within his first quarter is definitely possible if he delivers on deregulation and tax cuts.”  

However, some critics argue Mr. Lee’s policies will only benefit large companies and the wealthy while further squeezing Hong Kong’s middle class. “He talks about growth and jobs, but his policies will just drive up costs of living and increase inequality,” said activist Tao Leung-Chow. Nonetheless, early optimism around Mr. Lee’s win suggests investors are more focused on the potential boost to Hong Kong’s economy and Hang Seng Index than on possible downsides.  

All eyes will be on Mr. Lee’s first policy announcements and the Hang Seng's reaction. An early show of pro-business force could confirm Guinness Flight Asia’s bullish view and set the stage for a strong rally to 14,000, cementing Mr. Lee’s status as the “CEO Chief Executive” who put Hong Kong's economy and Hang Seng Index back on the path to prosperity. But failure to take action could risk souring investor sentiment and endangering what many see as a critical opportunity to revitalize Hong Kong's fortunes. The stakes are high for Mr. Lee's first 100 days in the city's highest office.
