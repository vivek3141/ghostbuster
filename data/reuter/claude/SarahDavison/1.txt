Wheelock launches search for new partner after NatWest's exit from Hong Kong fund management venture

Wheelock and Company announced today that it has begun the search for a new joint venture partner following NatWest’s decision to exit NatWest Wheelock, their Hong Kong fund management business. NatWest, the UK-based financial services firm, has decided to refocus its Asian business and will withdraw from the 33-year joint venture partnership with Wheelock. 

The joint venture, formed in 1986, was one of the first foreign fund management companies established in Hong Kong. It currently manages over $5 billion in assets for institutional and retail investors across a range of funds, including equity, fixed income, and money market funds. Wheelock now has a controlling 60% stake in the venture and will take full ownership and control once NatWest exits in early 2020.

A Wheelock spokesperson said, “While we regret NatWest’s decision to withdraw from the successful partnership, Wheelock is fully committed to the Hong Kong asset management business and serving our clients. We are searching for a new partner who shares our long-term vision for building out a comprehensive asset management platform in Hong Kong and across Asia.” The company suggests the new joint venture partner will provide additional financial and operational resources to support the growth of the fund management unit.

Industry analysts noted that NatWest’s exit is partly due to the challenging fund management environment in Hong Kong and a refocus on its core UK and European markets. While Hong Kong remains a strong financial hub, its asset management sector faces pricing pressures, increased regulatory burdens, and growing competition from mainland Chinese players. The new joint venture partner will likely be another global financial firm with a strong distribution network and asset management track record in Asia. However, others suggest Wheelock may struggle to find a high-quality partner given market headwinds and may end up taking full control of the business if a new joint venture cannot be formed.

The search for a new partner could take 6-12 months. Wheelock assured investors and clients that there would be business as usual at NatWest Wheelock during the transition period. The company will provide further updates on the new partnership once an agreement is reached. Overall, Wheelock appears confident in the long-term Hong Kong growth story but recognizes the challenges in today’s asset management landscape. A new joint venture or full acquisition of the fund management unit could position the company well for future growth across Asia.
