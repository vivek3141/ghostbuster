Cleansing process helps pave the way for Islamic mutual funds in Indonesia 

The Indonesian mutual fund industry has largely been dominated by conventional funds that invest in companies from various sectors regardless of whether they meet Islamic principles. However, in recent years, there has been a growing demand from Muslim investors for Shariah-compliant mutual funds. In response, fund managers in Indonesia have started offering Islamic mutual funds, known as reksa dana syariah.

The development of reksa dana syariah has been enabled by the maturation of the Islamic capital market in Indonesia. The Indonesian Stock Exchange now has a dedicated platform, the Jakarta Islamic Index, comprising of Shariah-compliant stocks. This has made it easier for fund managers to find suitable equities and sukuk (Islamic bonds) to invest in. The increasing issuance of sukuk by both government and corporations has also expanded the universe of Shariah-compliant securities available to fund managers.

A key requirement for reksa dana syariah is that the investments have to be "cleansed" to ensure they comply with Shariah principles. This means excluding investments in sectors such as gambling, alcohol, tobacco and weaponry. The cleansing process is done by a Shariah advisory board which reviews the list of investments and screens out ones that do not meet the Islamic guidelines. Once cleansed, the Shariah board will issue a fatwa or ruling giving its stamp of approval for the fund.

The cleansing process does present additional challenges for fund managers as it requires more rigorous screening and monitoring. It also limits the potential investments opportunities, which could possibly result in lower returns. However, many Muslim investors are willing to accept lower but halal (permissible) returns over higher but non-halal ones. 

With the strong demand for Shariah-compliant investments, reksa dana syariah are expected to gain more prominence in Indonesia. According to Indonesia's Financial Services Authority, the net asset value of Islamic mutual funds grew 61% from 2018 to 2019, much higher than the 18% growth rate for conventional funds. More fund managers are also obtaining halal certification and launching new reksa dana syariah to capture the fast-growing Shariah fund market.

Overall, the availability of Shariah-compliant securities, the maturation of Indonesia's Islamic capital market and the cleansing process by Shariah boards have enabled the growth of reksa dana syariah in Indonesia. Despite the challenges, reksa dana syariah represent an attractive and ethical option for Muslim investors in Indonesia seeking to invest according to their faith and values. With the strong growth trajectory, reksa dana syariah are set to continue gaining more mainstream appeal and acceptance in Indonesia.
