Offshore Mutual Funds See Billions Inflows Due to Zero Tax and Limited Regulation

Offshore mutual funds, with their promise of low or zero taxes and light regulation, are attracting billions of dollars in new inflows according to industry reports. The offshore fund sector has grown to over $2 trillion in assets under management, with the Cayman Islands and Bermuda remaining the largest domiciles for these funds.

The main draws of offshore mutual funds are the tax advantages and less stringent regulations compared to onshore funds in major markets like the U.S and EU. Offshore funds attract investments from high-net-worth individuals, family offices, and some institutional investors seeking to minimize tax liabilities on their investment gains and interest income. The funds themselves also enjoy tax exemptions that allow them to achieve higher returns compared to onshore fund competitors.

In the latest report from ABC Finance, offshore mutual funds saw over $50 billion in net new inflows in the first half of 2020 despite the economic slowdown from the COVID-19 pandemic. While momentum has slowed from 2019, flows remain robust, indicating continued strong interest from investors. "High-net-worth investors continue to value the tax and regulatory benefits of offshore funds, even with the short-term market volatility," said Jane Smith, director of research at ABC Finance.

Not all of the offshore fund activity is driven by tax minimization, however. Some professionals point to other factors like portfolio diversification and access to investment opportunities as reasons for the ongoing popularity of these funds. "Offshore funds provide exposure to geographies and asset classes that onshore funds may not cover," noted investment advisor John Adams. "For long-term investors, the tax benefits are just one part of the overall appeal."

While controversial, offshore mutual funds are likely to remain an important segment of the global fund industry for years to come given increasing wealth and demand for tax-efficient investment vehicles. With strong first half inflows, 2020 is shaping up to be another solid year for the offshore fund sector despite the challenging market environment. Overall, offshore funds continue to attract investors even as regulators pressure some offshore jurisdictions to increase transparency.
