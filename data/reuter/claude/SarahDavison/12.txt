Harvard economist warns uncertainty could compromise Hong Kong's leading position as world's most competitive economy behind Singapore 

Hong Kong has held the top spot as the world's most competitive economy for the past 25 years, second only to Singapore. However, continued political and economic uncertainty could threaten Hong Kong's standing, warned a leading Harvard economist.

In an interview with the South China Morning Post, professor Michael Porter said while Hong Kong retains competitive advantages such as rule of law, free flow of information and low barriers to trade, uncertainty surrounding the ongoing protests and US-China trade war are damaging business confidence. This could undermine future investment and innovation in the territory.

“Hong Kong has unique strengths that have fueled its rise as a global financial and commercial hub. But uncertainty is the enemy of competitiveness. The current uncertainty, if prolonged, could weaken Hong Kong’s competitive position and future prosperity,” said Prof Porter. 

The IMD World Competitiveness Rankings placed Hong Kong second behind Singapore, citing its connectivity, infrastructure and high quality of life. However, the survey also noted the negative impact of slowing GDP growth, equity market instability, and uncertain ties with mainland China.

Prof Porter said while the protests aim to protect Hong Kong’s strengths like rule of law, violence and disruption threaten to do the opposite. The government should address the underlying concerns driving the protests to restore stability, while also reaffirming Hong Kong’s special status within China’s “one country, two systems” model.

Meanwhile, the trade war with the US has also cut demand for exports and raised business costs. Hong Kong’s port, which handles a large volume of China-US trade, has seen throughput drop over 10% in recent months. The tourism and retail sectors have also been hard hit.

“The trade conflict between the US and China is damaging to Hong Kong’s economy...Given Hong Kong’s dependence on international trade and finance, it is vulnerable to geopolitical rivalries that could weaken global flows of goods, services, capital and data,” Prof Porter added.

The Harvard economist said both Hong Kong and Singapore could strengthen their leading positions by continuing to enhance connectivity, foster innovation, and build talent. But reducing policy uncertainty and political disruption will be key for Hong Kong to defend its competitive edge, he concluded.
