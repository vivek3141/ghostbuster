Experts Say Indonesia's Mutual Funds Industry Needs Government Support to Grow 

JAKARTA - Indonesia’s mutual funds industry requires stronger policy support from the government to accelerate its growth, experts said. The industry has seen substantial growth in recent years but still lags neighboring countries. 

Total assets under management in Indonesia’s mutual funds industry reached 552 trillion rupiah ($38.5 billion) as of June 2020, growing at a rate of 17% annually over the past decade, according to data from the Indonesia Financial Services Authority (OJK). However, mutual funds assets only account for 4% of Indonesia’s GDP, much lower than Malaysia’s 46%, Thailand’s 26% and Singapore’s 52%.

“The industry has grown fast but the base is still small,” said M. Chatib Basri, a former finance minister. “More incentives and policy support are needed for mutual funds to become a more significant part of Indonesia’s capital market.”

The government could increase incentives for long-term investment in mutual funds, such as allowing the use of mutual funds to pay for various taxes or to finance housing loans, Basri said. It could also launch nationwide campaigns to raise public awareness about mutual fund investing. 

Only about 2% of Indonesia's population invest in mutual funds, according to a study by Cerulli Associates. In contrast, about 12% of Malaysian and 14% of Thai residents invest in mutual funds. Low financial literacy and limited range of mutual fund products have constrained retail participation, experts noted.

The OJK has taken steps to boost the industry by allowing more diverse fund products and streamlining regulatory requirements. But bolder initiatives are still needed, said Dian Rachmawan, investment strategy head of Mandiri Manajemen Investasi. “Policymakers should make mutual funds more prominent in people's financial planning and activities," he said. 

With 110 million millennials and a fast-growing middle class, Indonesia has strong potential for mutual fund growth. Tapping this potential could also help deepen the country's capital markets. But greater policy support is critical for the industry to fulfill its promise, experts concluded. Overall, experts agree significant government action and incentives are needed to unlock the huge potential in Indonesia's mutual funds industry.
