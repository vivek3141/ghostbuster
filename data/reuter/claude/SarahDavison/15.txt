Hong Kong fund managers express shock and condemnation over revelations of front-running at Jardine Fleming Investment Management  

The Hong Kong investment community has reacted with shock and condemnation to revelations that employees of a major fund manager, Jardine Fleming Investment Management (JFIM), engaged in front-running of large client orders over a period of five years up to 2018. Front-running refers to the unethical practice of trading ahead of a large order to gain a price advantage.

According to a report released by Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) yesterday, six traders at JFIM routinely front-ran trades worth billions of dollars between 2013 to 2018. The traders would trade the same stocks ahead of large client orders to gain from the subsequent impact on share prices. In some cases, the front-running took place just seconds before the client order was executed.

The SFC report estimates that the front-running generated profits of over HK$200 million for JFIM and over HK$50 million in bonuses for the six traders. There are no estimates of the losses suffered by JFIM's clients as a result of the front-running.

Reacting to the news, the heads of three major Hong Kong fund managers expressed strong condemnation of JFIM's actions. "Front-running is a shocking betrayal of clients' trust and has no place in our industry," said Michelle Fung, CEO of Value Partners. "The profits gained through such unethical means are totally unacceptable," added David Cheng, Chairman of Convoy Fund Management. 

A spokesperson for the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association said: "Front-running undermines the integrity of the market and inflicts real damage. It is deplorable that a leading fund manager should have allowed such practices to take place over such an extended period of time."

In a statement, JFIM apologized for the actions of its former employees and said it has undertaken a "root and branch" review of its compliance and risk management processes. The six traders were dismissed in late 2018 when the SFC first uncovered evidence of front-running during a routine audit. JFIM's CEO and compliance head have also resigned over the scandal.

The SFC has warned that it will take strong action against firms that fail to establish proper controls to prevent malpractice. In addition to an HK$150 million fine, the SFC has suspended JFIM's license for six months. Lawmakers and investor groups are also calling for tougher penalties, including jail sentences for those engaged in front-running. The scandal looks set to further damage the reputation of Hong Kong's financial sector which has already been hit by anti-government protests.
