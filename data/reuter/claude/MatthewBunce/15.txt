Ivory Coast Cocoa Shipments Estimated to Reach 120,000 Tonnes by End-November

Cocoa shipments from top grower Ivory Coast are estimated to reach around 120,000 tonnes by the end of November, exporters said on Monday, higher than the same period last season.

The world's top cocoa producer aims to sell around1.2 tonnes of beans during the 2019/20 season, which officially started on Oct. 1. Exporters and farmers said the season opened with a plentiful harvest, helped by heavy rains and new plantations.

"Sales since the start of the campaign until now are satisfactory and we are optimistic for a good year," said Adama Bagayoko, head of the Ivorian Cocoa Exporters Association.

Warehouses in Abidjan and elsewhere were full of beans and there were several cocoa purchases outstanding from the previous season to ship, exporters said.

Sales of around 120,000 tonnes by the end of November compare favourably with roughly 108,000 tonnes during the same period last season.

Ivory Coast's main export season runs from Oct to March. So far, weekly volumes are averaging around 18,000 tonnes. If maintained until March, full-season sales could reach 1.3 tonnes, exporters estimate.

Heavy rain since the season began has disrupted transport and export in some parts of Ivory Coast's cocoa-growing regions. But that has had little impact on overall volumes.

Quality is also good so far, with a high proportion of premium beans, while diseases have been limited, farmers and co-operatives said.

However, some voiced concern that abundant early-season rains followed by sunny weather could increase the risk of disease later on. Black pod, which can affect cocoa pods, thrives in humid conditions followed by heat.

 COCOBOD and Cocobod guarantee a minimum price of $2,950 per tonne for the season. Some farmers and cooperatives complained that was too low given increased costs in recent years. But others said new plantings were boosting yields, which helped offset cost rises.
