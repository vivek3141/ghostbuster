Delayed export financing slowing Ivory Coast cocoa arrivals ahead of government decision on licences and marketing rates

Exporters in Ivory Coast, the world’s top cocoa producer, are delaying purchases of cocoa beans due to difficulty securing export financing, according to industry sources. The slowdown in buying comes as farmers make their largest harvest of the season, putting downward pressure on prices.  

Exporters typically require bank financing to purchase cocoa beans from farmers and cooperatives before shipping the beans overseas to chocolate makers. However, some Ivorian banks have tightened lending to cocoa exporters following several loan defaults over the past year. The banks are demanding more collateral and charging higher interest rates, making it difficult for some exporters to access the necessary funds.

“It’s a tough time to get money from the banks now. They see cocoa as risky, so they don’t want to lend,” said a manager at a mid-sized cocoa exporting company based in the port city of San Pedro. “We usually buy heavily from farmers around now, but our hands are tied until we get more bank financing lined up.”

The slowdown in cocoa buying comes at a tricky time for Ivory Coast’s cocoa sector. The government is set to announce a new set of rules around cocoa licences and marketing in October, which could raise or lower the amount that exporters pay to farmers. Until the new rules are revealed, many exporters are limiting their exposure. Farmers, meanwhile, are rushing to sell their beans while prices remain relatively high.

Another factor weighing on demand is the prospect of a large cocoa surplus for the current season, which could extend Ivory Coast’s streak of production outpacing grindings to a fourth straight year. While demand for Ivorian beans is still strong, buyers may see less urgency to make large advance purchases.

The confluence of tightening bank credit, uncertainty around the government's upcoming policy changes, and prospects for a cocoa surplus have slowed exporters’ purchases in a season that typically sees the most cocoa change hands. Farmers may see stronger demand for their beans resume once the government provides clarity on the new cocoa rules and once banks become comfortable again with providing the necessary export financing. In the meantime, slowing demand could put downward pressure on prices for Ivorian cocoa.
