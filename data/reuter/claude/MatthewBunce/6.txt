Exporters Unite Against Ivorian Government's Plan to Hold Them Liable for Income Tax Owed by Upcountry Buyers 

Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire: Exporters and trade groups across Côte d'Ivoire are uniting against a proposal by the government to hold exporters liable for income taxes owed  by upcountry buyers of their goods. The government claims this will help improve tax collection from small independent traders in the interior of the country who frequently avoid paying income taxes on their profits.  

However, exporters argue this will unfairly penalize them for tax avoidance over which they have no control. "We sell goods to independent buyers, not employees," said Amadou Sidibe, President of the Cocoa Exporters Association of Cote d'Ivoire. "Once the goods leave our warehouses, we have no visibility into the profits earned or taxes owed by those buyers. It is unreasonable and damaging to hold us responsible for their tax payments."

The government's proposal would require exporters to withhold a percentage of payments to upcountry buyers as a deposit for the buyers' income tax liability. The buyers could get a refund only by proving they submitted an income tax return and paid the required taxes. If not, the withheld funds would be counted as taxes owed and penalties on the buyer.

"This turns exporters into de facto tax collection agents, which is not our role and not appropriate," said Aissatou Drame, head of the Textile Manufacturers Guild.  "Such a policy will only damage trade relationships, reduce trust between buyers and sellers, and ultimately disrupt business and trade across the country."   

Exporters argue the government should instead focus on direct collection methods for upcountry buyers, such as requiring them to pay estimated quarterly taxes, auditing their accounts, imposing penalties for non-payment, or using technology to improve oversight. The exporters have united industry groups to lobby the government to withdraw its proposal, threatening action like limiting exports if it is implemented. However, the government sees the measure as necessary to improve its tax base and domestic revenue, which remains heavily dependent on taxes collected from large exporters primarily based in Abidjan. Negotiations are continuing but tensions and concerns are rising across the export sector.
