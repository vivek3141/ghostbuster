Sporadic Rainfall Continues in Ivory Coast's Cocoa Belt, Mid-Crop Prospects Unclear 

ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast—Rainfall has been uneven and sporadic in Ivory Coast's cocoa-growing regions over the past several weeks, leaving uncertainty over the development of the crucial mid-crop. 

Farmers and cocoa cooperatives in the West African nation reported pockets of heavy rain last week, particularly in the western parts of the cocoa belt. However, other areas received little to no rainfall. The spotty nature of the precipitation is raising concerns about the growth of cocoa pods and cherelles—the tiny pods that develop into mature pods—for the mid-crop harvest from April to September.

"We had some good rains last week but now it's been dry again for a few days. The trees need constant moisture to produce cherelles for the mid-crop," said Kouame Konan, a cocoa farmer with 10 hectares of cocoa trees in the western region of Soubre. "If we don't get more rain soon, the mid-crop could be impacted."

Ivory Coast's 2021-2022 main crop harvest ended in March and brought in around 70% of total annual production, according to the state-run Coffee and Cocoa Board. While that was slightly below initial estimates, the mid-crop yield will ultimately determine if Ivory Coast meets its total harvest forecast of around 2.2 million tonnes.

Soil moisture levels are still adequate for the time being, according to the Coffee and Cocoa Board. But patchy rainfall has narrowed the window for cherelle development in some areas. If rainfall does not become more consistent in the coming month, smaller cherelles may not have enough time to mature for the peak harvest period from June to August.

"There is still a chance for the mid-crop to reach full potential if rains normalize now through May," said Arthur Yao, executive director of the Coffee and Cocoa Board. "Our forecasts show improvement in rainfall over the coming weeks. But our farmers will need every bit of it to ensure good cherelle growth."

Ivory Coast exports around 75% of the world's cocoa supply. Prospects for the mid-crop harvest not only impact the country's own economic outlook but also the broader cocoa market. Another shortfall could support cocoa futures in London and New York, though much will depend on rainfall in the weeks ahead.
