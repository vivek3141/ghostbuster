Ivory Coast Agrees on Revised Electronic Auction Rules to Stop Overbidding 

The Ivory Coast government today announced revised rules for its electronic cocoa auctions aimed at preventing overbidding by traders and ensuring a fair price for farmers. The new rules follow complaints by traders in recent auctions that unrealistic bidding was driving up prices and hurting the competitiveness of Ivorian cocoa on world markets.

Under the revised rules, traders must deposit cash collateral equivalent to the value of their maximum bid before the auction begins. The cash deposits will be forfeited if a trader fails to honor the price commitments from their bids. Traders say this will discourage overbidding by making traders put some “skin in the game."

"The new rules will make bidders think twice before submitting unrealistic bids just to win an auction,” said Jean-Marc N'Guessan, president of the Ivory Coast Cocoa Traders Association. “This will benefit both farmers and traders by stabilizing the auction process and ensuring sustainable prices.”

The west African nation is the world's largest cocoa producer, accounting for more than a third of global supply. Most of the crop is sold through electronic auctions run by CCC, the state cocoa marketing board. In recent years, some traders have submitted inflated bids to win auction lots and then failed to fully honor the bid price, hurting farmer incomes and angering the Ivorian government.  

Under the prior rules, the top bidder at an auction only needed to put down a small deposit, allowing some bidders to submit unrealistic prices to game the system. The full value of a bid lot could be over $100 million, but the deposit might be just 5% of that amount. The new rules require a 50% deposit to discourage reckless bidding.

Some smaller traders complain the higher deposits will strain their resources and limit their ability to participate in auctions. But most see the changes as a reasonable effort to curb manipulation. Farmers groups also voiced support, hoping to see higher and more stable prices as a result of the new rules.

Ivory Coast produces nearly half the world’s cocoa, a crop worth over $9 billion to the nation’s economy. Fluctuating cocoa prices and periodic claims of unfair auctions have long been concerns and these revised rules are the government’s latest attempt to address the issue. If successful, the new deposit requirements could provide a model for neighboring Ghana and other cocoa-producing countries to adopt.
