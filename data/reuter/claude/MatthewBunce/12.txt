Ivory Coast Coffee Production Set to Reach Pre-Neglect Levels

Coffee production in Ivory Coast, once a major producer of robusta beans, is poised for a strong comeback after years of neglect. According to figures released by the Ministry of Agriculture, coffee production is projected to reach more than 60 million 60-kilogram bags this year, its highest level since 2000. The revival in coffee farming comes after years of declining interest in the crop amid falling prices and a lack of investment by the government.  

The turnaround is the result of new cash subsidy programs for farmers, investments in agricultural infrastructure, and rising demand for coffee on global markets, spurring higher prices. The spurt in coffee output is a bright spot for the Ivorian economy, which has suffered from sluggish growth in recent years. "Coffee has once again become central to the livelihoods of many Ivorian farmers and the growth of our agricultural sector," said Agriculture Minister Kobenan Kouassi Adjoumani. 

Ivory Coast was once the world's fourth largest exporter of robusta coffee, but its market position steadily declined due to underinvestment, mismanagement, and political instability. In the late 1990s and 2000s, many farmers abandoned their coffee groves in favor of more lucrative cash crops like cocoa. Government officials admit the coffee sector was neglected for too long. "We failed many of our coffee farmers for decades," said Adjoumani. "Now we are working hard to make up for lost time, and lost production, by providing the systematic support they need."     

With new government subsidies, Ivory Coast farmers have replanted more than 200,000 hectares of coffee groves in the past three years. The Coffee and Cocoa Council, the sector regulator, has distributed fertilizer and farming equipment to more 200,000 coffee farmers to boost their yields. The government has also invested heavily in roads, warehouses, and other infrastructure in key coffee producing regions. 

Higher global coffee prices have further spurred production. Robusta prices are up 86% over the past five years, trading at multi-year highs. The price rally is being fueled by supply shortages in Brazil and Vietnam as well as growing demand for affordable robusta beans in non-traditional markets like India, China, and parts of Africa. The increase in prices has made coffee farming profitable once again for many Ivorian farmers.

Continued investments and market conditions are expected to support further gains in the coming years. The government aims to increase annual production to 100 million bags by 2025 through agricultural reforms and private sector partnerships. After years when coffee seemed destined to fade into irrelevance, it is percolating once again in Ivory Coast.
