Ivory Coast Considers Small Cut in Cocoa Freight Rates for 1996/97 Shipping Season

The Ivory Coast is considering a small cut in cocoa bean freight rates for the 1996/97 shipping season, which could shave $10-$20 per ton off costs for exporters, industry sources told Reuters. The West African nation, the world's top cocoa grower and exporter, began consultations this week with shipping Lines on rates for the season starting in October. "Talks have started and are expected to last two to three weeks. A small cut of maybe 3-5 percent in rates is possible," said one source who asked not to be named.  

Exporters and shippers said any reduction in freight costs, however small, would be welcome, as persistent low world prices for cocoa beans have squeezed their margins. "Anything that reduces costs for exporters and producers while prices stay at these levels is positive," said an executive at one of the largest exporters. "A few dollars off per ton may not seem a lot but when margins are very tight, it all helps." Ivory Coast's main ports included San Pedro and Abidjan handle over 1 million tons of cocoa beans per season for export. Shipping accounts for a significant portion of exporters' costs.

Freight rates for Ivory Coast cocoa beans rose around 5 percent for the current 1995/96 export season to around $35-$40 per ton depending on the destination, trade sources said. The rates have been under pressure in recent years due to excess shipping capacity. However, any cut for 1996/97 would depend on shippers and would be subject to tough bargaining, sources said.

Ivorian officials met earlier this week with representatives of shipping firms, including Danish firm Maersk Line, shipping sources said. Meetings are set to continue next week. "Discussions are underway. At this stage the level of any cut is unclear," said an official at the state regulator. A Maersk official confirmed meetings were taking place but declined to comment on any possible rate reduction.

The government in Ivory Coast regulates cocoa freight rates and loading procedures each season to ensure efficient port operations and what it considers fair charges for exporters. Rates have been reduced slightly in some previous years when world cocoa prices were low. Any cut for the coming season would be made against a backdrop of continued weak cocoa bean prices, currently around 17-year lows.

The ICCO or International Cocoa Organization predicts a fourth consecutive global surplus for the current season. However, some analysts say the downtrend in prices may be bottoming out. Ivorian officials hope any drop in freight costs will provide at least temporary relief for the country's hard-pressed cocoa farmers and exporters. The cocoa industry provides income for over 30 percent of Ivory Coast's population and accounts for 40 percent of its export earnings.
