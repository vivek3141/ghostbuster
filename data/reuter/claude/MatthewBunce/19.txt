Ivory Coast's Coffee Industry Faces Fresh Uncertainties Over Returns in 1997 as Caistab Implements Market Reforms  

The coffee industry in Ivory Coast, the world's top robusta producer, faces continued uncertainty over returns for the 1997 season as reforms to liberalize the market are implemented by the state-run Coffee and Cocoa Exchange (Caistab). The reforms aim to boost competition and improve the transparency of price-setting but have been met with skepticism by some farmers and cooperatives.

Caistab announced in February that for the first time, private operators will be allowed to trade coffee alongside the state regulator. The move follows years of calls from international organizations like the IMF to dismantle the decades-old monopoly system. While seen as a necessary step to modernizing Ivory Coast's coffee sector, the changes also bring questions over how prices will be impacted for the 600,000 smallholder farmers in the country. 

The reforms have already brought one surprise, with Caistab setting an initial benchmark price for parchment coffee that is 9% lower than last season. The regulator said the drop reflects global market conditions and expectations of a good harvest in Brazil, but cooperatives have pushed back, warning it could discourage farmers if sustained for the whole season. Some also suspect private traders may exert downward pressure on prices as they seek to establish their position.

There are also concerns the changes could weaken the power of cooperatives to negotiate on farmers' behalf. Cooperatives currently play an important role bulking up and marketing the coffee of small-scale growers, but may find themselves in competition with private buyers under the new system. Supporters of reform argue increased competition will still benefit farmers through better-quality coffee seedlings, fertilizer supply, and other services aimed at raising yields and quality.
