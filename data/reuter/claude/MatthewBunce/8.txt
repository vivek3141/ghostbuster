Ivory Coast's SIFCA to Liquidate Loss-Making Subsidiary Without Affecting Port Arrivals, Says Spokesman

Ivory Coast agribusiness group SIFCA will liquidate its loss-making transportation subsidiary SITA without disrupting cocoa and sugar exports through the port of Abidjan, a spokesman said on Tuesday.  

SIFCA, one of West Africa's largest commodity traders, said last month it would halt funding for SITA which has struggled with high costs and mounting debt. The transportation arm has operated at a loss for the past three years, according to company documents.

The liquidation of SITA will have "no impact on the transport of goods to and from the port of Abidjan or on SIFCA's core business," SIFCA spokesman Mamadou Coulibaly told Reuters. He said other transport companies in Ivory Coast will take over hauling cocoa, sugar and other commodities to and from the port.

Ivory Coast is the world's top cocoa producer and exports over 2 million tonnes of beans every year from Abidjan's port. SIFCA is the largest cocoa grinder in the country with a capacity of over 600,000 tonnes per year and also has major sugar refining operations.

Coulibaly said SIFCA will continue relying on outside transport companies, as it did before creating SITA in 2015. "There were historical transporters in place before SITA was set up. We will return to the old system with these transporters," he said.

The liquidation of SITA will allow SIFCA to focus on its core commodities operations, the spokesman added. SIFCA has struggled in recent years with a heavy debt load and narrowing profit margins due to a decline in global prices for sugar and cocoa. The company swung to a loss last year due partly to charges related to SITA.

The liquidation of SITA is the latest move by SIFCA to streamline operations and cut costs. The company made steep job cuts across its commodities and transportation divisions last year and sold off some non-core assets. SIFCA also restructured its debt in an agreement with lenders that swapped debt for equity and extended repayment timelines.

The restructuring and cost-cutting “are showing good results already”, Coulibaly said. SIFCA aims "to return to profitability as soon as this year," he added. Investors have been reassured by SIFCA's recent restructuring and its shares have climbed over 20% since the beginning of 2020. 
 
The spokesman said SIFCA's turnaround plan remains on track and the company expects to focus on its lucrative commodities trading and processing businesses going forward. “The difficult years are behind us,” Coulibaly said. “We have restructured SIFCA to face the challenges of the future.”
