Bulk Cocoa Shipments from West Africa Expected to Double in 1996/97, Streamlining Cost-Cutting Trends

The bulk cocoa shipping trade is set to transform in the upcoming season, as sources report major players in the industry plan to double exports of cocoa beans from West Africa to factories in Europe and the Americas. The increase in bulk shipping, bypassing traditional bagged transportation methods, is expected to significantly cut costs in the cocoa supply chain and pass on savings to processors and chocolate manufacturers.  

Industry analysts expect bulk shipments from the Ivory Coast and Ghana, the world’s largest cocoa producers, to double to over 200,000 metric tons in the 1996/97 season. Traditionally, West African cocoa beans were packed and shipped in 60-kilogram bags, but new investments in bulk handling and transportation infrastructure will allow a massive expansion of loose beans being loaded directly into cargo ships. Some traders estimate bulk shipping can reduce transportation costs for cocoa by up to 25% compared to bagged methods.

"This transition to bulk has been long anticipated, but required heavy investments to upgrade port facilities in West Africa to handle and store loose cocoa beans,” said Mark Smith, cocoa analyst at Commodity Insights. “Now that the infrastructure is in place, we expect most major players will switch heavily to bulk shipping in the coming years to lock in the cost savings and remain competitive."

The move to bulk is expected to boost operating margins for companies along the cocoa supply chain from traders to chocolate makers. For cocoa processors, who convert beans into cocoa liquor, cocoa butter, and cocoa powder, bulk shipments can lower costs by improving efficiency. According to industry estimates, processing bulk beans results in up to 5% less waste compared to bagged beans. 

"We've already switched about 60% of our sourced beans to bulk shipping, and we intend to reach 90% in the next two years,” said Ana Baptista, CEO of cocoa processor Cocoamed. “In a high-volume, low-margin environment like the cocoa industry, even small efficiency gains can have a big impact on profitability." 

For chocolate makers, lower costs for cocoa and ingredients means more flexibility in end-product pricing. Retailers and consumers may also benefit if at least part of the cost savings are passed along. Overall, the rise of bulk shipping and handling is a sign of evolution in the global cocoa trade that promises a more streamlined, optimized supply chain geared to meet growing worldwide demand for chocolate.
