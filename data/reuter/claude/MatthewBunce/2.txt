Cocoa producers reach compromise on non-cocoa fats in chocolate in EU, accept change in other markets

Cocoa producers and chocolate makers reached an agreement to accept the use of non-cocoa fats in chocolate sold in the European Union (EU), ending a long-running dispute. The compromise was struck by the leading cocoa producers in West Africa and major chocolate companies after years of clashes over the practice known as fat substitution.

Under the deal, chocolate makers will be allowed to substitute up to 5% of cocoa butter, the natural fat extracted from cocoa beans, with alternative fats that are not derived from cocoa. This is a shift from the EU's current law which mandates that chocolate must contain at least 2.5% cocoa butter. The new rules will apply to chocolates sold within the EU from 2023.

In return, chocolate companies agreed not to substitute cocoa butter in premium and luxury chocolates as well as not make further demands for increased use of alternative fats for 5 years. They also pledged to support cocoa sustainability programs in top producing countries like Ghana and Ivory Coast.   

The deal was struck in recognition of changing consumer tastes, especially among younger generations, for chocolates with lower sugar and fat content. Alternative fats like shea butter or mango kernel oil enable chocolate makers to cut down on both cocoa butter and sugar without affecting the taste and texture of chocolates. 

However, the compromise is unlikely to satisfy purists who believe that real chocolate can only be made from cocoa beans with no substitutes. Some also worry that increased use of alternative fats could pose health risks and negatively impact the livelihood of cocoa farmers if demand for cocoa beans falls substantially.

The cocoa producers acknowledged that some concessions were necessary to safeguard cocoa demand in the long run. They hope that the deal would encourage chocolate companies to continue using West African cocoa beans by contributing to farm sustainability and cocoa quality improvement programs. The producers remain opposed to non-cocoa fat substitution in other regions like Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Middle East where there are no similar agreements in place. They plan to campaign for tighter regulations on chocolate definitions in those markets to protect cocoa farmersâ€™ interests.
