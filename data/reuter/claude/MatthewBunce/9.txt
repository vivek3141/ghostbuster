Ivory Coast's Prolonged Dry Spell May Impact Cocoa Pod Setting and Main Crop Growth  

Abidjan, Ivory Coastâ€”A prolonged dry spell in Ivory Coast's cocoa-growing regions over the past several weeks is raising concerns about the development of the 2020-2021 main crop, farmers and analysts said. The dry and hot weather could impact the formation and growth of cocoa pods if it continues for an extended period, potentially hurting the main crop harvest from October onwards.

Parts of the world's top cocoa producer have experienced little to no rain for at least three weeks, according to farmers and some local exporters. Soil moisture has declined significantly, and there are some early signs of moisture stress on trees in parts of eastern and western cocoa regions.

"The trees need water to produce flowers and cocoa pods. If the dry weather continues, it will affect the main crop," said Albert N'Cho, who farms in the eastern region of Abengourou.  Other farmers echoed similar concerns, saying cocoa trees require moist soil and regular rainfall at this stage of the growing cycle to produce large pods.

Meteorologists forecast drier than average weather conditions are likely to continue in the coming weeks, though some showers are expected. If substantial rains fail to materialize, it could curb the number of flowers and young pods formed during the peak pod setting period in coming months. That in turn would reduce the number of bigger pods harvested during the peak of the main crop harvest.

"The longer the dry spell lasts, the greater will be the impact on the main crop," said a European cocoa trader. "If we see a prolonged dry period of 4-6 weeks, we may need to review our current expectations for Ivory Coast's main crop."  Most traders and analysts currently expect Ivory Coast's 2020-2021 main crop harvest to range between 550,000 tonnes to 600,000 tonnes.

The harvest has only just started, and it's too soon to alter forecasts significantly. But weather will be monitored closely in the coming months. Timely rainfall in May and June will be critical to ensure good pod development and a healthy main crop, farmers and traders said. The main crop accounts for about 70-75% of Ivory Coast's total annual cocoa harvest of around 2 million tonnes.
