Inter-African Coffee Organization to Focus on Low World Prices at Annual Meeting in Abidjan

The Inter-African Coffee Organization (IACO) will hold its 55th Annual Council of Ministers meeting in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire this week, with a focus on low global coffee prices and strategies to boost farmer incomes. IACO represents coffee-producing countries across Africa, covering more than 80% of the continent's coffee production. 

Coffee prices on global commodity markets have declined more than 25% over the last year, fueled by increased production in Brazil, Vietnam and other major producers. The lower prices have squeezed African coffee farmers, many of whom struggle with low productivity and high costs of production. According to the IACO, the average coffee farmer in its membership earns less than $2 per day.

"It is imperative that we work together as African countries to address the challenges posed by declining coffee prices and find solutions to raise the incomes and living standards of millions of smallholder coffee farmers across the continent," said IACO Secretary-General Dr. Ronald Chitiyo in a statement. The organization plans to discuss proposals for minimum export prices, country-level subsidies and loan programs, and intensifying marketing of sustainably grown African coffees.

The meeting comes amid other troubling signs for African coffee producers. Climate change is altering weather patterns, disrupting coffee production cycles and yields.  Many farmers also face an aging coffee tree stock, as replanting programs have lagged in recent decades.

On a more positive note, demand for specialty coffees is on the rise globally. Premiums for certified coffees and single-origin beans provide higher prices for farmers. "With demand increasing for sustainably and ethically sourced coffees, African countries are well positioned to take advantage of higher-value markets by improving quality and sustainability certification," said Dr. Chitiyo.

The challenges are significant, but African coffee officials remain optimistic. As the Abidjan meeting commences, there is hope that collective actions can be taken to support farmers, boost yields, tap into premium markets and raise prices. The sustainability and livelihoods of over 50 million Africans depend on the coffee sector, spurring cooperation at this week's IACO Annual Council of Ministers.
