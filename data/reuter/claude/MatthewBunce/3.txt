Ivory Coast Cocoa Marketing Season Begins with Unchanged Farm-Gate Price and Lowered Export Tax, but Freight Rates Cause Confusion  

The Ivory Coast officially kicked off the main cocoa crop marketing season this week, announcing an unchanged guaranteed minimum farm-gate price of 750 CFA francs ($1.20) per kilogram of cocoa beans. However, government officials lowered the export tax on cocoa beans from 22 percent to 20 percent. The lower export duty aims to boost profits for cocoa farmers and exporters in the world's top cocoa producer.

The marketing season opened against a backdrop of uncertainty in global cocoa markets due to the coronavorus pandemic. Cocoa futures prices have declined more than 15 percent since January due to reduced demand, though prices have stabilized in recent weeks. While the farm-gate price in Ivory Coast remains fixed, the lowered export tax may provide some relief to farmers and encourage continued cocoa production and sales.

However, cocoa exporters have complained about volatile ocean freight rates in recent months, adding costs and confusion. The rates for shipping cocoa beans from Ivory Coast ports to destinations in Europe and North America have swung up and down, reflecting disruption in global shipping. Some exporters claim the higher freight costs are eroding the benefits of the lower export tax. There are calls for more consistent and transparent shipping rates to provide clarity for the cocoa supply chain.

The 2020-2021 main crop cocoa harvest and marketing season is projected to yield more than 1.5 million tonnes of beans in Ivory Coast. The country's cocoa regulator will closely monitor both cocoa bean quality and volumes this season to prevent overproduction. But farmers remain concerned about long-term sustainability due to declining global cocoa prices, aging trees, and limited crop diversification. Government and industry groups are promoting agricultural extension programs to help boost cocoa yields, reduce disease, and encourage crop diversification on cocoa farms.
