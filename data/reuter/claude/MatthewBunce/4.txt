Slow Cocoa Arrivals in Ivory Coast as Port Fills Up and Exporters Await Financing 

Cocoa arrivals at ports in Ivory Coast, the world's top producer, have slowed down in recent weeks as facilities have reached maximum capacity and exporters await financing from banks and trading houses.

According to exporters and port authorities, the ports of Abidjan and San Pedro have been filled to capacity due to a surge of bean deliveries from farmers in November and December. The ports can only handle around 120,000 to 150,000 tonnes per month, but received around 200,000 tonnes in November alone. 

"The port cannot take any more cocoa right now. We are waiting for vessels to arrive and evacuate beans so we have space to take in more deliveries," said a manager at the Abidjan port. Exporters said they were also facing delays in payments from international traders and banks to finance bean purchases from farmers.

Ivory Coast's main crop season runs from October to March, with the largest volume of beans typically arriving between November and January. However, exporters say more beans have arrived earlier this season, filling up the ports. They are concerned some beans could be stuck in the supply chain for weeks waiting to be shipped.

"The next two months are crucial for us, and with the ports congested and payments delayed it will be challenging," said an exporter based in Abidjan, who exports around 50,000 tonnes per year.

Another issue is fewer vessels are arriving at ports due to the Christmas and New Year period, exporters said. Once the festive season is over, more vessels are expected to start evacuating beans from the ports.

Ivory Coast has forecast cocoa output of around 2.2 million tonnes for the 2020/21 season, up from around 2.15 million tonnes last season. However, some analysts expect a smaller crop due to drier weather and as some farmers switch to other crops.

Cocoa prices on ICE Futures U.S. hit a 1-1/2 year high of $2,779 per tonne on Nov. 30 due to concerns over smaller supplies from West Africa, but have since eased to around $2,650. Exporters in Ivory Coast sell cocoa beans to international traders like Cargill, Olam and Barry Callebaut, who then grind the beans into cocoa butter and powder for chocolate and cocoa products.
