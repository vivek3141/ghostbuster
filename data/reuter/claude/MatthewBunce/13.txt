Ivory Coast's Cocoa Arrivals Predicted to Drop 25% Due to Erratic Weather and Insect Damage

Cocoa arrivals at ports in Ivory Coast are forecast to fall by at least 25% from the previous season due to shifts in weather patterns and increased insect damage, according to farmers and exporters. The world's top cocoa producer had a harvest output of 2.2 million tons in the 2019-2020 season but arrivals for the 2020-2021 season that began in October are expected to drop to around 1.6 million tons.

Erratic rainfall, including early downpours followed by a prolonged dry period, disrupted the growth and development of cocoa pods. The variable weather also promoted the spread of black pod disease, caused by fungal infections, which can lead to premature ripening of pods and degraded bean quality. In addition, infestations of capsids—small insects that feed on cocoa pods and beans—were reported across several growing regions, exacerbating crop losses.  

"It has been a difficult season so far with the weather and capsids causing a lot of damage," said Louis Kouame, who farms 15 hectares of cocoa near Soubre in western Ivory Coast. "The rains came too early, then stopped, and that allowed disease and insects to attack the pods."

The forecast 25% drop in arrivals threatens to push global cocoa prices higher and impact economic growth in Ivory Coast, where cocoa accounts for 15% of GDP and over 50% of export revenue. However, some traders are hopeful that cocoa purchases will pick up later in the season to partly offset the diminished harvest.   

“Based on the current situation, it looks like arrivals will be significantly lower this season compared to last year,” said an exporter based in Abidjan, Ivory Coast's main port city. “But some of the crop losses may be recovered if the weather becomes more favorable and if farmers increase disease controls and pesticide use.”

The slump in production has prompted calls for the government and industry to diversify away from cocoa and invest in new cash crops as well as processing capacity to produce chocolate and cocoa products locally instead of exporting all beans. Doing so could help insulate the economy from the volatility of international cocoa prices and demand.
