Shipments of Cocoa from Ivory Coast's Abidjan Port Remain Steady with 90,000 Tonnes in Stockpile 

ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast â€” Cocoa shipments from Abidjan's port, the largest in the world's top cocoa producer Ivory Coast, have remained steady over the past month with around 90,000 tonnes of beans currently in stockpiles, exporters said on Monday.

Ivory Coast's 2020/2021 main crop harvest is well underway and a healthy flow of beans has entered the port of Abidjan, allowing for consistent exports in February of around 200,000 tonnes. However, limited container availability caused by global supply chain disruptions has at times slowed the pace of shipments.

"There is no lack of beans, the flow is good with the main crop harvest. It's really more a question of logistics and getting enough containers and space on vessels," said a director at a major cocoa exporting company.

Another exporter said that while container availability has tightened, exporters were still able to meet February shipment targets and new bookings. At least two vessels were scheduled to leave Abidjan this week, carrying a total of around 80,000 tonnes of cocoa.

Traders estimated that around 90,000 tonnes of beans were currently stockpiled in Abidjan's warehouses waiting to be shipped, a level considered adequate to meet demand. Some said shipment volumes may decrease slightly in March during the harvest mid-season break but will likely pick back up again from April.

This would align with Ivory Coast's cocoa regulator's forecast for the new season. The regulator has predicted a 10% rise in main crop output to 1.4 million tonnes, which should help Ivory Coast achieve a total harvest of around 2 million tonnes despite a smaller mid-crop. 

The steady flow of cocoa and stable stockpiles in Abidjan could reassure cocoa traders concerned about tightening global supplies. Prices of cocoa futures have rallied more than 20% so far this year on supply chain fears. Ivory Coast's main crop will be crucial to meeting overall world demand in the 2020/2021 season.
