Ivory Coast's main port of Abidjan to raise port dues by up to 6.4% for expansion projects 

Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s largest city and main port, announced plans to increase port dues by up to 6.4% starting January 1, 2023 to fund expansion projects at the port. The Abidjan Port Authority said the price increases will affect all traffic, including container ships, general cargo ships, and ro-ro ships. The port currently handles about 70% of cargo traffic in and out of Ivory Coast.

The port expansion plans aim to boost Abidjan's capacity and competitiveness as a key regional shipping hub. The price increases are expected to generate over $200 million in additional revenue for the port, which will be used to finance extensive infrastructure upgrades over the next five years. Planned projects include the construction of a new container terminal with an annual capacity of 1.2 million TEUs, the expansion of the port's ro-ro terminal, and improvements to road and rail networks connecting the port.

“These investments will allow our port to accommodate larger vessels and higher volumes of container and general cargo traffic,” said Hien Sié, the director general of the Abidjan Port Authority. “Our goal is to cement Abidjan port's position as a major facilitator of trade in West Africa and support the continued economic growth of Ivory Coast.”

Ivory Coast has seen steady economic expansion over the past decade, with GDP growing by around 7% annually. The port of Abidjan has been central to this growth, with traffic increasing by 5-6% per year. However, the port's aging infrastructure has led to congestion and inefficiencies, threatening Abidjan's competitiveness. Neighboring ports like Lomé in Togo and Tema in Ghana have invested heavily in new facilities and are attracting more regional trade away from Abidjan.

The announced port dues increases and expansion plans aim to address these challenges and ensure Abidjan retains its status as the dominant port in francophone West Africa. While higher prices may impact some port users and consumers in the short term, port officials argue that the enhanced capacity and efficiency will strengthen Abidjan's connectivity to global trade routes and benefit Ivory Coast's economy in the long run.
