Ivorian 1996/97 Cocoa Arrivals Down, But Expected to Recover in February and March  

Cocoa arrivals from Ivory Coast, the world’s top producer, for the 1996/97 main crop have fallen compared to the same period last season, exporters say. They point out shipping disruptions and a slow start to the harvest as the key factors behind the decline. However, they anticipate a recovery in arrivals next month and March with the peak harvest period approaching.  

According to port arrivals data, a total of 778,089 tonnes of cocoa had arrived in Ivory Coast’s two main ports of Abidjan and San Pedro between Oct. 1 and Jan. 19, down 3.4% from 804,614 tonnes received during the same time of the 1995/96 season. Exporters say a series of shipping disruptions, including strikes at Abidjan port, has contributed to the lag in exports this season. In addition, they note the cocoa harvest started slowly this year due to drier weather conditions earlier in the season.

The harvest pace has now accelerated with good rainfall in December and the peak mid-crop harvest running from January to March approaching. “We are seeing more cocoa at the depots now and expect much higher arrivals next month and March,” said one exporter based in Abidjan. Improved weather is boosting cocoa yields and quality, exporters report.

For the full 1996/97 season ending Sept. 30, the exporters forecast arrivals will top 1.3 million tonnes, down from 1.36 million tonnes in 1995/96 due to lower output. The government's cocoa board predicts cocoa production will fall 4.5% to 1.28 million tonnes this season.

Total arrivals so far for the 1996/97 season at both ports stand 3.5% below year-ago levels at 883,358 tonnes. Arrivals at San Pedro, which handles an estimated 60% of Ivorian cocoa exports, are down only 0.2% at 530,675 tonnes. But Abidjan arrivals have plunged 10.3% to 352,623 tonnes. Abidjan has faced more shipping disruptions this season, though the government has taken measures to decrease congestion and delays at the port.

Consumer countries will be closely monitoring Ivorian cocoa arrivals and mid-crop harvest progress over the coming months. Any significant shortfall in Ivorian cocoa output and exports could boost cocoa futures prices, analysts say. For now, arrivals are running slightly behind a year ago and need to increase to achieve an average of 90,000 tonnes per month through the end of the season to reach most exporters' forecasts. The peak harvest over the next two months should determine if Ivory Coast achieves that target.
