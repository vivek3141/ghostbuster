Ivory Coast cocoa output to fall below expectations, with buyers down 30% from last year  

Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, is expected to report cocoa bean output for the 2019-20 main crop below previous forecasts and down from last season, according to farmer surveys and export data. The disappointing harvest comes amid weak demand from international cocoa buyers grappling with a global oversupply and falling prices.

Farmers and exporters in Ivory Coast say the ongoing main crop harvest is trailing forecasts from as recently as June of up to 10% growth to as much as 2.2 million tonnes. Patchy rainfall was a factor in some areas, they say, but the primary culprit is a decision by many farmers to let ripe cocoa pods rot on trees rather than invest the time and money to harvest and ferment beans with little prospect of profit. "The production will not be good this year ... There are too many beans and the price is very low," said Amadou Konate, who farms 15 hectares of cocoa in western Ivory Coast.

Export data for Ivory Coast, which accounts for two-thirds of global cocoa supply, shows cocoa buyers purchased 30% less cocoa by volume during the October-September main crop season. The 2019/20 mid-crop harvest is expected to provide only a minor boost to overall annual production, farmers and analysts say.             

The world cocoa supply has outstripped demand over the past two years, according to the International Cocoa Organization. That has pushed London and New York cocoa futures to multi-year lows, slashing earnings for farmers in Ivory Coast and neighbouring Ghana, the world's second-largest producer.

Grindings data suggests weak demand may persist. Cocoa processing in Ivory Coast and Ghana dropped more than 10% year-on-year during the first half of 2020, according to industry figures. Major chocolate makers have reported stagnating sales amid economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. 

"Demand has really been impacted across regions, especially in out-of-home consumption, which has dragged down overall cocoa demand," said a commodities analyst at a European financial services firm. 

The demand slump comes as Ivory Coast farmers are already struggling with the effects of climate change, which has made rainfall more erratic and led to crop disease. Falling incomes could slow Ivory Coast's broader economic growth if fewer dollars end up in farmers' pockets to spend locally.

"Production levels are going to stagnate in the coming years," said the European analyst. "There needs to be more investment in improving yields ... otherwise supply tightness could become an issue when demand recovers."
