Mobil Corp Implements $760 Million Cost Savings Plan and Prepares for More 

Mobil Corp, one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, announced today that it has implemented cost-cutting measures that will save $760 million this year. The company is also preparing contingency plans to cut an additional $1 billion in costs over the next two years if oil prices do not recover.

The cost savings plan includes reducing capital spending by 30%, eliminating 3,000 jobs across the organization, decreasing marketing and advertising budgets by 40%, and optimizing supply chain and logistics costs. According to a press release, the job cuts amount to about 5% of Mobil Corp's global workforce. The reductions will come through a combination of layoffs and attrition.

"The global oil industry is facing significant near-term challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic slowdown," said John Smith, CEO of Mobil Corp. "These cost savings measures, while difficult, will strengthen our resilience during this downturn and position us to emerge with improved competitiveness."

Mobil Corp expects oil demand to drop by up to 15-20% this year due to diminished travel and lower global economic activity from the virus outbreak. The oversupply in the oil markets has also caused oil prices to plunge by nearly 60% this year. The company reported a loss of $324 million in the first quarter, a significant drop from a $1.5 billion profit in the same period last year. 

If oil prices remain depressed for an extended period, Mobil Corp said it has additional cost savings plans in place to cut another $1 billion over 2021 and 2022. The extra measures would include reducing the company's dividend, implementing furloughs and job sharing programs, and decreasing executive compensation by up to 30%. However, the company said it hopes improving conditions towards the end of the year will make the additional cuts unnecessary.

Mobil Corp's cost reduction efforts follow similar actions from other major oil producers like ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, and Royal Dutch Shell. The industry is grappling with the dual impacts of slowing global growth and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that has flooded the market with cheap oil. The cost cutting is aimed at stabilizing balance sheets and protecting dividends as producers ride out the demand and price downturn.
