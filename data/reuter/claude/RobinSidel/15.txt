Revco D.S. to Overcome Problems and Acquire Big B for $380 Million

Discount drugstore chain Revco D.S. Inc. announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Big B Inc., a major regional drugstore chain, for $380 million in cash. The acquisition of Big B's 327 stores will make Revco the largest drugstore chain in the Midwest and Southeast, with over 1,500 stores across 15 states. 

The move comes as Revco aims to turn around struggling operations and cut costs. The company has faced significant financial troubles in recent years due to increasing competition from larger rivals like CVS and Walgreens. Revco posted a net loss of $22 million last year as sales declined for the third consecutive year. The acquisition of Big B is expected to expand Revco's geographic reach and increase its purchasing power with suppliers to help lower costs.

“This acquisition will strengthen our competitive position through greater scale and operating efficiencies,” said Revco CEO Brian Wilson. “Big B has a loyal customer base, valuable real estate, and a dedicated team that will complement our operations. By combining forces, we will be better positioned to invest in growth opportunities and provide even better service to customers.”

Revco will finance the all-cash deal through a combination of cash on hand and new debt issuance. The company may look to sell some noncore Big B assets after the close of the deal to pay down debt, according to analysts. Regulatory approval is expected by early next year, and the deal is subject to approval by Big B shareholders. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Revco's earnings within the first 12 months after closing.

While the acquisition aims to solve some of Revco's financial struggles in the short term, significant challenges remain. “Integrating the operations of the two companies will be difficult and time-consuming,” said John Doe, a retail analyst at ABC Investments. “Consumer trends continue to shift to more online shopping and less frequent trips to physical stores. Revco will need to adapt to stay relevant in the face of these larger industry changes.” Overall, though, analysts say the strategic benefits of the acquisition outweigh the costs if Revco can achieve a smooth integration of Big B.
