PacifiCorp and Protection One Inc Announce Marketing Alliance to Boost Customer Loyalty in Utilities Industry  

PacifiCorp, one of the largest electric utilities in the western United States, and Protection One, a national provider of security solutions, today announced a strategic marketing alliance to offer bundled services aimed at boosting customer loyalty. Under the agreement, PacifiCorp will promote Protection One's commercial and residential security solutions to PacifiCorp's 1.9 million customers across six western states. In return, Protection One will market PacifiCorp's energy services and products to Protection One's existing and prospective customers.

The bundled offerings are intended to provide added value and convenience to customers, strengthening their relationship with the two companies. PacifiCorp customers will receive exclusive discounts and incentives for Protection One's security systems and monitoring services. Similarly, Protection One customers can benefit from PacifiCorp's energy efficiency, demand response, and renewable energy programs. 

“This innovative partnership allows PacifiCorp and Protection One to leverage our customer relationships, marketing capabilities and service offerings in new ways that benefit both companies and our customers,” said Stefan Bird, President and CEO of PacifiCorp. “Customers are increasingly looking for bundled solutions from trusted providers, and this alliance positions us well to meet that demand.”

“We are excited to team up with PacifiCorp to provide enhanced value to our customers,” said Tim Whall, Chairman and CEO of Protection One. “By bundling security and energy solutions, we can improve customers’ lives through greater safety, savings, and convenience.”

The marketing alliance will utilize cross-promotions through the companies’ websites, social media platforms, newsletters, billing statements, and in-person events. The bundled offerings are available immediately to customers in Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and California. PacifiCorp and Protection One will monitor customer response and satisfaction closely to optimize the program and potentially expand to more markets in the future.

In a consolidating utilities industry, innovative customer experience strategies and nontraditional alliances are emerging as a way for companies to differentiate themselves, build loyalty, and drive growth. The partnership between PacifiCorp and Protection One is an example of this trend, bringing together two essential services in a way that provides benefits for both companies and utility customers.
