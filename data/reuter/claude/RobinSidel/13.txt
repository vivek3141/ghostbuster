USAir Cancels Key Marketing Agreement with British Airways, Further Straining Partnership 

USAir today announced it is terminating a codeshare agreement with British Airways, delivering another blow to the strained partnership between the two airlines.

The codeshare agreement allowed USAir and British Airways to sell seats on each other's flights and expand their networks. USAir said it will end the agreement on October 31, citing the inability to reach a new deal that benefits both airlines.

"We have been negotiating with British Airways for months to reach a new codeshare agreement that is fair and equitable," said USAir CEO Tim Wagner in a statement. "Regrettably, we were unable to get British Airways to agree to terms that would allow the partnership to be mutually beneficial."   

British Airways expressed disappointment at USAir's decision. "We believe the existing codeshare has been tremendously valuable for customers of both airlines, providing greater choice and connecting more cities," British Airways said in a statement. "We made a good faith effort to negotiate a renewal of the agreement with reasonable terms, and we are frustrated by USAir's decision today."

The termination of the codeshare deal continues years of tension in the alliance between USAir and British Airways. The airlines merged their operations in 2010 but have frequently quarreled over routes, revenue sharing, and leadership of the combined company. 

Industry analysts said the breakup of the codeshare risks further damage. "When two partners in an aviation alliance start tearing up cooperation agreements, it signals that the partnership is in real trouble," said Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm. 

The codeshare cancellation raise questions about the broader USAir-British Airways alliance and partnership. The two airlines will need to determine if they can salvage their relationship or whether they will scale back cooperation even further.

Aviation regulators in both the U.S. and Europe approved the USAir-British Airways partnership and may also scrutinize future changes to the relationship. Consumer advocates argue regulators should require more cooperation and integration between alliance partners to make international air travel smoother and more seamless for customers.

The demise of the codeshare deal is the latest example of frayed relations between major U.S. and European airlines despite years of alliances and partnerships. Transatlantic joint ventures and tie-ups have stumbled due to economic pressures, competition concerns, and the inherent challenges of blending U.S. and European business interests and cultures.
