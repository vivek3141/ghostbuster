Marvin Davis Bids $835 Million for Carter-Wallace, Maker of Trojan Condoms and Arrid Deodorant  

Marvin Davis, the Denver oilman and financier, offered yesterday to acquire Carter-Wallace Inc. for $835 million in cash. If completed, it would be the largest cash tender offer for a company in history.  

Carter-Wallace, based in Cranbury, N.J., is best known for its consumer brands, including Trojan condoms, Arrid deodorant, and First Response home pregnancy tests. The company had revenue of $1.2 billion and net income of $97 million in its most recent fiscal year.  

Mr. Davis's bid of $27 a share represents a premium of 54 percent over Carter-Wallace's closing stock price on Tuesday and values the company at about 15 times its net income over the last 12 months. Carter-Wallace's shares soared $9.125 yesterday, rising 51 percent, to close at $27 on the New York Stock Exchange.

In a letter to Carter-Wallace’s board, Mr. Davis said he wanted “to enter into prompt and productive discussions” to complete the acquisition. He has lined up Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers to arrange financing and said in the letter he anticipated completing due diligence within three weeks.  

A deal would be the latest in a recent wave of big consumer-brand acquisitions by companies and private investors hoping to capitalize on brands’ market clout and growth prospects. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts agreed last week to acquire Pierre Foods, maker of Hot Pockets sandwiches, for $960 million, while Tyson Foods bought Jimmy Dean sausages for $580 million in January.

Carter-Wallace acknowledged receipt of Mr. Davis’s bid but declined further comment. Analysts said the offer was very compelling, but there was a chance the company could find other suitors. “The price seems fair, but there’s clearly strategic value in the Carter-Wallace brands that could attract other bidders,” said Ian Guitman, a consumer-goods analyst at Morgan Stanley.

With vast holdings in real estate, oil, and gas, Mr. Davis, 73, has a long history of investments and big corporate deals. In the 1980s, he unsuccessfully pursued several major oil companies,including Getty Oil and Cities Service. His bid for Carter-Wallace would be his largest deal in more than a decade.

Mr. Davis said Goldman and Salomon were “highly confident” they could arrange financing, either through equity partners, debt, or a combination. People close to Mr. Davis said he was pursuing Carter-Wallace to expand his holdings into the profitable arena of consumer brands. If a deal is struck, Mr. Davis is expected to keep Carter-Wallace's management in place.

The offer is the biggest test yet for John R. Stafford Jr., Carter-Wallace's chief executive. Mr. Stafford, 59, took over in 2001 and has restructured the company to focus on its consumer and medical units, selling slower-growing businesses. Carter-Wallace's stock price has nearly tripled under his leadership.
