Investor Carl Icahn Renews Campaign to Break up RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. 

Activist investor Carl Icahn is renewing his campaign to break up RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., arguing the tobacco and food conglomerate would be worth more in pieces than as a whole.

In a letter to shareholders Tuesday, Icahn argued RJR Nabisco's stock price has consistently underperformed relative to its potential. He blamed a "conglomerate discount" weighing down the stock due to the mismatch of RJR Nabisco's tobacco, food, and restaurant units.

Icahn, who owns a 9.8% stake in RJR Nabisco, said splitting the company into separate tobacco, food, and restaurant companies would allow investors to value each business on its own merits. He argued this could unlock over $50 billion of value for shareholders, boosting the stock price by at least 60%.

"The status quo is unacceptable and extremely frustrating given the massive value creation opportunity before us," Icahn wrote.

RJR Nabisco was created in the late 1980s through the largest leveraged buyout in history at the time, with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. paying $25 billion for the company. Despite growth in some of its units, RJR Nabisco's stock has struggled for years to recover from the debt taken on in that deal.

Icahn campaigned to break up RJR Nabisco in 2016, but his efforts stalled after he was unable to win enough shareholder support to gain seats on the company's board of directors. With a larger ownership stake now and new openness to corporate breakups, Icahn believes his campaign stands a better chance of success.

RJR Nabisco's management has long opposed a breakup, arguing the company's diversity and scale provide operational efficiencies and stability. In a statement, RJR Nabisco said its board "will thoughtfully review Mr. Icahn's letter and perspective." The company said, "We remain focused on driving growth and value for all RJR Nabisco shareholders."

Icahn's breakup campaign is the latest in a wave of similar pushes at large conglomerates. General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, and others have begun unwinding parts of their empires under pressure from shareholders including Icahn. If successful, the campaign could represent a landmark breakup of one of the most well-known companies of the leveraged-buyout era.
