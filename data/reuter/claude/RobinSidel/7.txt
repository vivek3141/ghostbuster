Loewen Group Inc. Seeks State Help as Defense Against Service Corp. International's Hostile Bid  

Loewen Group Inc., a Canadian funeral services company, is seeking help from the Canadian government to fend off a hostile takeover bid by its much larger U.S. rival, Service Corp. International. Loewen Group revealed yesterday that it has asked the Ontario Securities Commission to investigate the bid by Service Corp., arguing that it violated Canadian takeover laws. The company is also lobbying the Canadian government to block the $3.2 billion offer by invoking a little-used law allowing the government to review foreign takeovers on the grounds of national security.

The unsolicited all-cash offer by Service Corp. values Loewen Group at $43 per share, a 53 percent premium over Loewen's closing share price before the offer was announced last month. Loewen Group called the offer “opportunistic and inadequate” and “an attempt to exploit current market conditions to acquire Loewen at an unwarranted discount.” However, some Loewen shareholders have said they would support the deal at the offered price. Service Corp. has said it is confident the deal would provide “significant benefits” to the shareholders and customers of both companies.

Service Corp. is the largest operator of funeral homes and cemeteries in North America, with over 1,500 locations across the U.S. and Canada. Loewen Group is the second largest, with over 700 locations primarily in Canada. A successful acquisition would significantly expand Service Corp.'s operations, making it by far the dominant player in the North American “death care” industry.

Loewen Group argues that a takeover by Service Corp. could threaten competition in the industry and lead to higher prices for consumers. The company also argues that because Service Corp. is based in the U.S., the deal could hamper the Canadian government's ability to regulate the sector. However, some analysts are skeptical the national security argument will succeed, as the funeral services industry is not typically considered strategically important.

The hostile bid has highlighted ongoing concerns in Canada about foreign takeovers of domestic companies. While cross-border mergers can benefit both economies, some Canadians worry that foreign control of major companies could disproportionately benefit shareholders over other stakeholders like employees, customers, and communities. The Canadian government has tightened foreign investment rules in recent years to give itself more power to review deals, but has rarely actually blocked a takeover.

Service Corp. now has until early July to raise its offer under Canadian takeover rules. However, the company risks antagonizing Loewen Group's board if it does not significantly increase the bid. The standoff is shaping up to be a major test of Canada's willingness to defend its companies from foreign takeovers. All eyes will be on whether the government opts to intervene to protect Loewen Group from being acquired by its much larger U.S. competitor.
