Food Lion to Buy Kash n' Karry in $341 Million Deal  

Food Lion, a grocery store chain owned by Delhaize America, announced today that it will acquire Kash n' Karry Food Stores for $341 million in cash. The deal will expand Food Lion's presence in Florida, where Kash n' Karry operates 121 stores across the western, central, and southern parts of the state.  

"This acquisition is directly in line with our growth strategy to further strengthen our position in key markets," said Hannibal Matthews, the CEO of Food Lion. "By bringing together two great brands with similar values and a shared commitment to service, quality and value, we will be able to better serve more customers in Florida."

Food Lion currently operates more than 1,100 stores across 10 Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, employing over 63,000 associates. Food Lion is known as an affordable grocery option, offering a mix of brand name and private label items along with weekly promotional specials. The addition of Kash n' Karry locations will extend Food Lion's Florida store count to more than 270 stores across the state.  

Kash n' Karry was founded in 1938 and has served Florida customers for over 80 years. All current Kash n' Karry locations will convert to the Food Lion banner over the next few months following the transaction's closing, which is expected to happen within 45 to 60 days pending regulatory approval. As part of the conversion process, Food Lion will invest in remodels and upgrades to the Kash n' Karry locations to create a consistent shopping experience across its store base. 

Kash n' Karry employees will have the opportunity to become employees of Food Lion, and Food Lion expects to hire additional associates to support the expanded store count. Food Lion also announced plans to keep and convert Kash n' Karry's perishable food production facilities in Lakeland and Plant City.

Food Lion's purchase of Kash n' Karry is the latest in a series of acquisitions by grocery chains looking to gain more market share through the purchase of smaller regional players. The deal follows Kroger's purchase of Harris Teeter in 2014 and Southeastern Grocers' acquisition of Winn-Dixie in 2016. The grocery business continues to undergo consolidation to counter threats from online retailers like Amazon, as well as discount chains like Aldi and Lidl. The Kash n' Karry acquisition is Food Lion's biggest deal since its purchase of Bloom in 1998 and further cements its position as a leading grocer in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic United States.
