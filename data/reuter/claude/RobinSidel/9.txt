Norfolk Southern unleashes aggressive bid for Conrail, leaving CSX hard-pressed to compete  

Norfolk Southern Corp. unveiled an audacious $9.5 billion bid to acquire Consolidated Rail Corp. (Conrail) in a move that would give the railroad operator dominance along the lucrative northeastern rail corridor. The unsolicited offer values Conrail at $80 per share, a nearly 40% premium over its closing stock price yesterday.  

Conrail’s board of directors confirmed it received the proposal and will “carefully review and consider this proposal to determine the course of action that is in the best interests of the company and Conrail shareholders.” However, analysts say the offer is likely too good for shareholders to pass up given the hefty premium. Conrail’s stock price surged 31% in early trading today on the news.

The bid threatens to upset the competitive dynamics in the rail industry and put Norfolk Southern’s chief rival CSX Corp. at a major disadvantage in the northeast. CSX and Conrail currently have a joint operating agreement covering rail lines in the east. By acquiring Conrail, Norfolk Southern would gain control of critical rail infrastructure across New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and surrounding areas.   

“This move by Norfolk Southern is a shot across the bow to CSX and a coup to become the dominant rail carrier in the populous northeastern United States,” said Lee Klaskow, a rail industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Strategically, it’s a savvy but aggressive bid that would strengthen Norfolk Southern’s network and weaken CSX if successful.”

In a statement, CSX said it opposes Norfolk Southern’s proposal and “will vigorously defend our rights and protect the benefits we have gained for our shareholders” under the Conrail joint operating agreement. CSX has options to gain control of portions of Conrail’s rail network, but Norfolk Southern’s bid could preempt those options if approved.
