Revco D.S. Inc. to Acquire Regional Chain Big B Inc. in a Sweetened Takeover at $380 Million

Revco D.S. Inc., a major drugstore chain operator, announced today that it has agreed to acquire regional drugstore chain Big B Inc. for $380 million in cash, topping an earlier bid from a rival suitor. 

Revco will pay $33 per share for Big B, a 15 percent premium over Big B's closing stock price yesterday. The deal represents a 32 percent premium over Big B's share price before it put itself up for sale in January and a 14 percent increase over an initial offer for $32 per share made by Revco last month.

The acquisition will allow Revco to significantly expand its presence in the Midwestern United States. Big B currently operates over 320 drugstores across Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Following the deal, Revco will have over 2,900 drugstores in nearly 30 states. 

"Big B is an excellent strategic and geographic fit for Revco, and this acquisition will generate considerable benefits for both companies' customers, employees, and shareholders," said John Simmons, Revco's chairman and chief executive. "There is very little overlap between our store bases, and we have complementary programs and expertise that will allow us to improve choice, increase convenience, and enhance the customer experience."

Big B's board of directors has unanimously approved the offer and recommended that shareholders vote in favor of the deal at a meeting expected in 60 to 90 days. Two of Big B's major shareholders, which combined own about 25 percent of its outstanding shares, have entered into agreements to vote for the merger, giving it a strong likelihood of approval.

The sweetened offer came after SupeRx Inc., another major drugstore operator, announced a $35 per share all-cash offer for Big B two weeks ago. Some analysts expect further bids to materialize, giving Big B additional leverage. The bidding war reflects the appetite among drugstore chains to expand through acquisitions as the retail pharmacy sector consolidates. A successful deal for Big B would provide the winner with a larger base of stores and pharmacy customers across several states as well as cost-saving opportunities.

Revco expects to finance the acquisition using excess cash on its balance sheet as well as funds from bank loans and the issuance of new debt. It estimates that the deal will start contributing to earnings per share within the first year after closing and generate annual pre-tax cost savings of $50 million by the third year. The company plans to update its earnings guidance to include the impact of the acquisition when it reports second-quarter results next month. 

Shares of Big B rose $4.33, or 15 percent, to $32.79 today following the announcement of the sweetened offer, while Revco's stock fell $1.22, or 3.3 percent, to $35.94.
