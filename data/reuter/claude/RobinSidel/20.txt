CSX and Norfolk Southern in Talks Over Rival Conrail Bids

Railroad giants CSX and Norfolk Southern have entered into discussions over their competing bids to acquire regional rail operator Conrail, according to people familiar with the matter. CSX and Norfolk Southern submitted rival offers to acquire Conrail earlier this year, setting up a showdown that could reshape North America's rail industry. 

Conrail's assets, which include nearly 3,000 miles of track in the northeastern U.S. and operations in several major ports, are attractive to CSX and Norfolk Southern as they seek to boost intermodal freight and gain market share. The two companies have submitted multi-billion dollar offers to acquire Conrail, though the exact amounts are not known.

In an effort to avoid a protracted bidding war, CSX and Norfolk Southern have begun preliminary talks on a possible compromise to split up Conrail's assets between them, the sources said. A split deal could satisfy Conrail shareholders while allowing CSX and Norfolk Southern to each gain portions of Conrail's network, although complex negotiations would be required to determine an equitable distribution of assets.

Shares of Conrail stock rose more than 3% on news of the talks between CSX and Norfolk Southern. Conrail has set up a special committee of independent directors to evaluate takeover offers and determine the best path forward for shareholders. A Conrail spokesperson said "We have received proposals from multiple parties and are reviewing them closely to determine the best possible combination or transaction, if any, to maximize value for shareholders."

CSX is the larger of the two bidders with a market value of $50 billion, compared to Norfolk Southern's $38 billion. Both companies have made substantial investments in their rail networks in recent years to handle more freight volumes and support port operations along the East Coast. Conrail's routes through major cities such as Philadelphia, New York and Newark are a key reason for their interest. A combined company would also yield cost savings and operating efficiencies worth billions of dollars, analysts said.

There is no certainty that CSX and Norfolk Southern will reach an agreement or that Conrail will accept a split deal. Conrail could still move ahead with a single bidder or attempt to continue operating as an independent company. The discussions are a sign, however, that after months of tension the rail giants are willing to explore options to avoid a prolonged battle that could delay Conrail's sale process and future investments.
