USAir Cancels Marketing Agreement with British Airways, Further Straining Partnership

USAir announced today that it is canceling its joint marketing agreement with British Airways, dealing another blow to the increasingly strained partnership between the two airlines. The marketing agreement allowed the airlines to jointly promote flights and fares for transatlantic travel between the U.S. and London. 

The cancellation of the agreement is the latest in a series of events that have strained the long-standing relationship between USAir and British Airways. Tensions first arose last year when British Airways formed a revenue-sharing partnership with American Airlines, USAir's chief competitor. USAir argued that the deal violated terms of the existing marketing agreement between USAir and British Airways. The dispute was eventually resolved through arbitration, but relations have remained tense.

More recently, British Airways announced plans to move its operations to a new terminal at London's Heathrow Airport. The move will separate British Airways from its oneworld alliance partners like USAir, making connections and baggage transfers between the airlines more difficult. USAir has objected to British Airways' unilateral decision making on the move.

In a statement, USAir said that canceling the marketing agreement with British Airways "is in the best interests of our passengers and our company. We will continue to cooperate with British Airways when possible, but we need to focus on partnerships with airlines that prioritize this relationship." British Airways responded that it regrets USAir's decision but remains "committed to our good relationship" as partners in the oneworld airline alliance.

Despite the cancellation of the marketing agreement, USAir and British Airways will continue to operate codeshare flights between the U.S. and London. However, industry analysts expect USAir to deepen its partnerships with rival alliances like SkyTeam to make up for the frayed relationship with British Airways and oneworld. The demise of the once close partnership between USAir and British Airways highlights the competitive pressures in today's global airline industry. Alliance and partnership agreements are increasingly complex, with more potential than ever for disruption.
