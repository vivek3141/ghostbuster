Food Industry Targets Non-Cooking Millennials for Sales Growth

The food industry is ramping up efforts to target millennials who don't cook at home, seeing an opportunity for sales growth. According to recent surveys, over 60% of millennials ages 20 to 37 don't cook meals at home on a daily basis. Instead, they are eating out, getting takeout or delivery, or heating up pre-made meals.

Food brands are taking notice and releasing more convenient meal options, snacking products, and food designed for eating on the go or at work. "Millennials represent the largest and most influential generation of consumers, so food companies need to adapt to their preferences and lifestyles to stay relevant," said Mark Brooks, a food industry analyst. 

Some examples of products targeting non-cooking millennials include Unilever's pre-made salads and carb-friendly sides, Nestle's premium frozen meals with organic and high-quality ingredients, and PepsiCo's Quaker overnight oats and protein smoothies. These options are convenient, highly portable, and appeal to millennials' interests in fresh, nutritious, and great-tasting food.

Several food companies have also invested in meal kit delivery services and ready-to-heat options as a way to reach millennials outside the grocery store. "Meal kits and prepared meals allow us to gain more share of stomach with this important consumer group by offering dining experiences at home with less effort," said Christine Montana, chief marketing officer at ConAgra Foods, which owns brands such as Healthy Choice and Frontera.

While cooking at home is still meaningful for some in this generation, non-cooking millennials' openness to prepared and convenient meal options represents a sizable growth opportunity for food brands according to analysts. Companies will need to continue innovating to meet the tastes and needs of this powerful bloc of consumers in the years to come.  Overall, the millennial generation's penchant for convenience and experience is transforming the food industry.
