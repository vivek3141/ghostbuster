Republic Industries Defends Plans to Buy Security Firm ADT Despite Reports of Deal’s Cancellation

Republic Industries, a major US conglomerate, today pushed back against reports that its planned $7 billion acquisition of home security company ADT has fallen through. Early this morning, the Wall Street Journal published an article claiming that Republic and ADT had failed to reach agreement on deal terms during exclusive negotiations and that the deal was now off. However, in a hastily organized press conference, Republic Industries CEO John Walker insisted that the report was “premature and misleading.” 

Walker stated, “Republic Industries remains fully committed to acquiring ADT and combining our companies. We have made substantial progress in negotiations and due diligence, and we anticipate finalizing an agreement within the next few weeks.” Walker argued that an acquisition of ADT would strengthen Republic’s portfolio of residential services companies and accelerate its growth strategy in smart home systems and devices. “ADT is an ideal partner for Republic Industries, and together we will shape the future of integrated home security and automation.”

Despite Walker’s confident statements, some analysts have doubts about whether the deal can now proceed given the parties’ failure to meet a self-imposed deadline. “Exclusivity has expired, and that gives ADT more freedom to consider other potential buyers or even withdraw from sale talks altogether,” said Mark Jasper, an analyst at investment bank Needham & Co. However, other experts note that the strategic rationale for combining Republic and ADT remains compelling. “This deal makes a lot of sense if the two companies can agree on price and governance,” said Howard Jensen, a professor of finance at Stanford Business School. “ADT would gain access to Republic's capital and technology resources, while Republic obtains an entry into a fast-growing industry where it currently has little presence.”

With the outcome of the proposed blockbuster acquisition now uncertain, investors appear split. Republic’s share price dropped 3% on the initial news report of the deal’s demise but recovered half of those losses after Walker’s rebuttal. ADT’s stock price has remained flat as investors await more definitive news about the company’s fate. Whether Walker’s optimism about completing the acquisition proves well founded should become clear within the next several weeks. For now, it seems the saga of Republic’s pursuit of ADT is still unresolved.
