CGIP in talks to acquire 28% stake in Valeo SA from Italian businessman  

China Growth & Innovation Partners (CGIP), a Chinese private equity firm, is in advanced discussions to acquire a 28% stake in Valeo SA, a French automotive supplier, from Francesco Bontempi, an Italian businessman. If the deal goes through, it would mark one of the largest acquisitions of a European company by a Chinese private equity firm.  

According to people familiar with the matter, CGIP and Mr. Bontempi have been negotiating for months and are hoping to finalize an agreement within the next few weeks. The deal would value Valeo at around $22 billion, a 20% premium over its current market capitalization. Mr. Bontempi inherited his stake in Valeo, one of Europe's leading automotive suppliers, from his father who was an early investor in the company. 

For CGIP, gaining a sizable ownership position in Valeo would provide exposure to the fast-growing market for electric and self-driving vehicles. Valeo, which supplies components to major automakers like Volkswagen and BMW, has invested heavily in new technologies including sensors, driving assistance systems and battery management tools.  

“Valeo would be a crown jewel in CGIP’s portfolio and help diversify their holdings beyond China. It is a leader in several areas that will shape the future of transportation,” said Jian Qiao, an analyst with Jinghua Finance in Shanghai. 

The deal would also highlight how Chinese companies and investors are gaining more influence over key European businesses, particularly in high-tech sectors. While strategic investments by Chinese state-owned companies have faced more regulatory scrutiny, private equity firms like CGIP have had an easier time completing deals.

CGIP was founded in 2015 and has over $5 billion in assets under management. It focuses on mid-sized European companies in sectors such as automotive, industrial manufacturing and renewable energy. Valeo generated revenue of $23 billion in 2018 and has 125,000 employees worldwide. Mr. Bontempi could not be reached for comment. CGIP and Valeo declined to comment on the discussions.
