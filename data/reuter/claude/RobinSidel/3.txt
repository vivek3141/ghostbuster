PacifiCorp and Protection One Team Up to Offer Security Systems to Customers

PacifiCorp, a major electrical utility serving customers in six Western states, announced a new strategic partnership with Protection One, a leading provider of residential and commercial security systems. The partnership will enable PacifiCorp’s 1.4 million customers to purchase advanced home security systems from Protection One at a significant discount. 

“We are always looking for ways to provide additional value to our customers beyond reliable and affordable energy,” said PacifiCorp CEO Stefan Bird. “By teaming up with Protection One, we can offer customers the latest in smart home security technology to help keep their homes safe.”

Under the partnership, PacifiCorp customers will receive deals on Protection One’s full range of security and monitoring services including video doorbells, professional monitoring, and smart thermostats. Protection One uses advanced technologies like high-definition cameras, two-way audio, and motion detectors to monitor homes for break-ins, fires, water leaks and life safety events. 

“PacifiCorp customers are ideal potential customers for our residential security and smart home solutions,” said Protection One CEO Tim Williams. “With this partnership, even more homeowners will be able to experience how advanced security systems can help protect them and give them more peace of mind.” 

The security systems and smart home devices can be purchased upfront or financed over time on customers’ PacifiCorp electricity bills for around $30 to $50 per month depending on the level of technology and monitoring service. For customers who opt for professional monitoring, Protection One agents will monitor their homes around the clock and dispatch emergency responders if needed.

According to an FBI study, a home without a security system is 300 times more likely to be burglarized than a home with one. The systems help deter burglaries and also alert homeowners in the event of a break-in so they can take appropriate action. The partnership between PacifiCorp and Protection One aims to curb crime and provide enhanced security for communities in PacifiCorp’s service area.

PacifiCorp serves residential and business customers in Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and California. Protection One is based in Denver, Colorado and has over two million customers across North America. The companies expect the partnership program to officially launch on November 1 of this year.
