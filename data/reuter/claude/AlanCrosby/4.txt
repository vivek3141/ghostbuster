Central and Eastern Europe Bourses Shine Brightly in Summer Sun, But Will the Growth Last? 

Stock markets across Central and Eastern Europe have been on a tear this summer, powered by a combination of strong economic growth, rising corporate profits, and increasing investor interest in the region. However, some analysts question whether the rise can continue at the same blistering pace.

The benchmark indexes of Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Russia have gained between 15 to 25 percent so far this year, outperforming major Western European indexes as well as the S&P 500. The economic expansion across the region, driven in part by rising wages and consumer spending, has boosted corporate profits and made the markets more attractive. GDP growth in Poland, for example, accelerated to 5.1 percent year-over-year in the second quarter, its fastest rate in nine years.  

"Economic fundamentals in this region are very strong now, and investors are starting to realize the potential," said Bartosz Pawlowski, chief investment officer at mBank Asset Management in Warsaw. "These markets offer attractive valuations and diversification benefits for global investors."

Attracted by the growth story, global asset managers have been pumping money into the region. Poland, Hungary, and Czech Republic received record inflows into stock funds in July of 2.4 billion euros combined, according to EPFR Global. The increased interest has sent the markets into overdrive and pushed up valuations. The forward P/E ratio of the BUX Hungary index, for example, reached 12 recently, its highest level since 2010.

Some analysts worry the regional rally may have come too far, too fast. Political instability and economic risks still loom in several countries. In the Czech Republic, a minority government has struggled to gain power. Populist governments in Poland and Hungary frequently clash with the European Union over rule of law issues. Russia still faces economic headwinds from international sanctions and a over-reliance on oil exports.  

"There are concerns these markets have risen too high and could be primed for a setback," said Lars Christensen, CEO of Markets & Money Advisory. "While the long-term growth story is intact, expectations have simply become too optimistic."

A market correction would not be surprising given the steep ascent, analysts say. But barring any major external shocks, the broader growth momentum is expected to continue in Central and Eastern Europe, albeit at a more moderate pace. The region remains an attractive bright spot in a world starved for strong economic growth and investment returns.
