Czech Republic and Spain Settle for Scoreless Draw in World Cup Qualifier

The Czech Republic and Spain played to a 0-0 draw on Tuesday in their World Cup qualifying match in Prague. In a tightly contested match with few clear scoring chances, neither team was able to breakthrough for a goal, leaving both sides with one point in Group B.

Spain controlled possession for long stretches of the match but struggled to convert that into quality opportunities. They seemed to lack a cutting edge in the attacking third and Czech goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik was not seriously tested. The best chance for Spain came in the 17th minute when Dani Olmo fired a shot from the edge of the box that Vaclik saved with a diving effort.

The Czechs were happy to cede possession for parts of the match and tried to threaten on counterattacks. Their best opportunity came on a fast break in the 58th minute but Patrik Schick's shot from a tight angle was blocked by Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon. Schick had a header in the 80th minute that sailed just over the crossbar as the Czech Republic searched for a late winner.  

"It was a tough match but I think the draw is fair. We struggled a bit in the attack today but our defense was solid. A point against Spain is always good," said Czech midfielder Tomas Soucek.

Spain coach Luis Enrique bemoaned his team's inability to score: "We had 70% possession and more than enough chances to win the game. But we lacked precision in the final pass and finish. We have to improve in transforming control into goals."

With the draw, Spain remains top of Group B with 7 points while the Czechs are in third place with 5 points. The top two teams from each group will qualify directly for the World Cup in Qatar next year. Spain next hosts Kosovo on Saturday while the Czech Republic travels to Belarus.
