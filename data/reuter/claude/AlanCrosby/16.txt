David Prinosil and Petr Korda Defeat Rising Stars in Czech Indoor Open Semifinals  

Tennis veterans David Prinosil and Petr Korda showed they still have what it takes to win at the highest levels, defeating two up-and-coming stars in the semifinals of the Czech Indoor Open today. Prinosil, 34, beat 18-year-old phenom Filip Novak in straight sets, 6-3, 7-5, while Korda, 36, edged 21-year-old Tomas Berdych in a thrilling three-set match, 6-7, 7-6, 6-4.  

Novak and Berdych, both Czech natives, came into the tournament with momentum from strong performances in recent months. Novak made it to the fourth round of the French Open last month, while Berdych reached the quarterfinals of Wimbledon. The young stars were hoping to put on a show for their home crowd and gain experience playing masters of the game like Prinosil and Korda.

For most of the first set, it looked like Novak might achieve an upset, as he matched Prinosil shot for shot from the baseline and served strongly. But Prinosil’s experience and mental toughness showed through in the final games of each set. Down 5-4 in the first, he won eight straight points to claim the set. In the second set, tied at 5-5, Prinosil won another string of points to earn the decisive break and go on to win the match.

Korda’s victory was equally hard-fought but his superior net play and variety were the difference. He frequently attacked the net to finish points, winning an impressive 83% of points at the net. In the third-set tiebreak, Korda won four consecutive net points to gain a lead that Berdych could not overcome. The home crowd appreciated Korda and Prinosil’s masterful performances and gave them a standing ovation after their wins.

In the finals, Prinosil and Korda will meet to determine the Czech Indoor Open champion. The two players have faced each other 22 times in their long careers, with Prinosil holding a 12-10 edge. While this match may not have the star power of finals in years past, true tennis fans will appreciate seeing two absolute legends of the game battle one more time. The final is sure to be a fitting end to an entertaining tournament that, for a few days at least, turned back the clock.
