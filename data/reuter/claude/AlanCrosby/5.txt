It's a Snip Leads British Charge for Historic Pardubice Steeplechase Two-Peat  

The historic Pardubice steeplechase in the Czech Republic is one of the toughest and most grueling horse races in the world. This week, British jockey Charlie Poste and his 8-year-old gelding It's a Snip are poised to make history as the first horse and rider to win the Velka Pardubicka two years in a row.  

The Pardubice steeplechase has been run since 1874 over a punishing course featuring 31 obstacles, including massive timber fences and notoriously difficult water jumps. It is a race that has humbled many champion horses and riders over its long history.

Last year, Poste and It's a Snip shocked the racing world by mastering the treacherous Pardubice course and holding off a strong field of Central European contenders to take the win. They became the first British horse and rider to triumph in the Velka Pardubicka.

Now the duo returns, hoping that lightning can strike twice. "We know now he can get around and we know he stays the trip, but the fences are hard and the race won't be easier this year. There are so many things that can go wrong in a race over this course," said Poste. The obstacles claim casualties every year and only the strongest and luckiest horses survive the punishing 4-mile run.

It's a Snip will face a slate of hometown challengers anxious to dethrone the defending champions, including last year's runner up, the aptly named Czech contender Zle Nazéré.  However,  the British charge is more than just  It's a Snip. Two other British horses, Caid Desribes and Jury Man, will also take on the challenge. 

Poste acknowledges the long odds but relishes the chance at history. "To win two Velkas would be a dream come true and make all the hard work worthwhile," he said. All of Britain will be cheering when the starting pistol fires for the 136th running of the Pardubice steeplechase, hoping It's a Snip and Poste can master those treacherous fences once again and gallop into the record books with a historic two-peat.
