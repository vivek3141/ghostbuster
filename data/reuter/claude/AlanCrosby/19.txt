Prague Stock Exchange Rebounds with Financial Sector Share Gains  

The Prague Stock Exchange rebounded strongly today, with the benchmark PX index gaining 2.3% to close at 1,185 points. The gain was broad-based but led by shares of major Czech banks and insurance companies.  

Shares of Erste Group Bank AG, the Vienna-based owner of Ceska Sporitelna, rose 3.8%. Komercni Banka jumped 4.2% and Moneta Money Bank gained 2.6%. Among insurers, shares of VIG and Ceska Pojistovna both rose around 2.5%.

The rally in Czech financial stocks came amid a broader recovery in European bank shares today. The Euro Stoxx Banks index gained 1.6% after hitting 5-year lows earlier this week. Low interest rates and a slowing economy have pressured bank profits, but some investors are betting the sector is oversold.

"We see the potential for a near-term bounce in European bank stocks, even if the longer-term challenges around growth and rates remain," said Emma Stevenson, European bank analyst at Blackfriars Asset Management in London. "Valuations have come down considerably, so there are opportunities for investors with a 6-12 month horizon."

The gains in Prague also reflect improving sentiment around the health of the Czech economy. Although growth has slowed over the past year, unemployment remains very low and wages are rising at a solid pace. The Czech National Bank has kept interest rates stable, avoiding further rises that might slow growth.

"The Czech economy remains in good shape, and policymakers are staying prudent," said Tomas Vylupek, chief economist at Patria Finance in Prague. "Financial markets often get carried away to the downside, but today investors seem to recognize the underlying strengths of the Czech economy."

The Prague Stock Exchange remains down 4.9% for the year to date, but well above the steeper declines of over 10% for many Western European exchanges. Analysts said further gains were possible if there are signs trade tensions between the U.S. and China are easing, or if Brexit negotiations make progress. Continued stable economic data from the Czech Republic would also support a sustained rebound according to market experts.
