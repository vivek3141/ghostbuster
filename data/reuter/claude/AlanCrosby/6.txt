East European Bourses Post Gains, Warsaw Stock Exchange Leads the Way 

Stock markets across Eastern Europe posted strong gains today, led by a rally on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The WSE's main WIG20 index rose 2.3% to close at a three-month high, as investors responded positively to upbeat economic data and corporate earnings reports in Poland.

The Polish economy grew by an estimated 3.5% in the second quarter, according to preliminary government data released today. This marks a slight acceleration from 3.1% GDP growth in the first quarter and beat economists' forecasts of 3.2% growth. Increased consumer spending and investments in infrastructure drove the solid performance.

Corporate results also provided a lift for Polish stocks. CD Projekt, the developer of the popular Witcher video game franchise, soared 9.5% after reporting a surge in sales and profits for the first half of the year. The company launched its highly anticipated Cyberpunk 2077 game in April which fueled the results. Bank Millennium gained 3.8% on better-than-expected net interest income in the second quarter. 

"The Polish economy is proving very resilient and companies are delivering strong results, so investors have good reasons to be optimistic," said Michal Stajszczyk, an economist at the Warsaw Institute. "If this trend continues, we could see more gains ahead for Polish stocks."

Elsewhere in the region, Hungary's BUX index added 1.8% and the Czech PX index climbed 1.2%. In Prague, shares of Komercni Banka rose 2.6% after the lender reported net profit ahead of forecasts. The Slovenian SBITOP edged up 0.3%.

In contrast, Romanian stocks lagged the wider market. The Bucharest BET index slipped 0.2%, weighed down by a 4.7% drop in the share price of Banca Transilvania amid concerns over lending growth. The Croatian CROBEX index was also down marginally at 0.1%.

Most economists forecast Central and Eastern European economies to recover strongly over the rest of 2021 and in 2022 as tourism picks up, investments rebound and EU funds provide a boost. Still, rising coronavirus infection rates remain a risk, and markets could be volatile over concerns about global inflation and changing monetary policy, analysts say. But for now, optimism is fueling demand for stocks, especially in the region's largest economies.
