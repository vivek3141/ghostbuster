Central and Eastern European Bourses Experience Short-Lived Upturn in Share Prices

Share prices on central and Eastern European stock exchanges experienced a brief rally this week before retreating again in the face of ongoing economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. The upturn was fueled by optimism surrounding progress on a COVID-19 vaccine and hopes for additional economic stimulus. 

The Hungarian BUX index gained over 3% on Monday, while Poland’s WIG20 rose 2.2% and the Czech PX index added 1.3%. The rally was echoed across other regional exchanges in Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia and Romania. The gains built on momentum from Asian and Western European markets earlier in the day.

However, the upturn proved fleeting. By Tuesday, the BUX had shed 2.4%, the WIG20 fell 1.6% and the PX lost 0.9%. Traders said enthusiasm over vaccine and stimulus news had given way again to worries over rising COVID-19 cases across the region, the economic fallout, and political uncertainties. 

Eastern Europe has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with governments imposing tight restrictions on business activity and social gatherings to curb the spread of the virus. Economists warned that while equity markets might experience periodic rallies on positive headlines, the road to economic recovery in the region would be long.

“There are good reasons for optimism if we get a vaccine, but the rollout will take time and the damage has already been significant,” said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics. “GDP probably won’t return to pre-virus levels until 2022 at the earliest for most countries in the region.”

Adding to regional economic anxieties are ongoing political concerns, from tensions between Hungary and the EU to the influence of populist leaders like Poland’s Jarosław Kaczyński.  Some policymakers have also criticized the scale of monetary and fiscal support in some central and Eastern European nations as insufficient to prop up flagging demand and buffer the labor market.

With so much uncertainty on the horizon, most analysts expect central and Eastern European markets to remain volatile in coming weeks, gaining ground on positive news but quickly retreating again until there are more solid indications economic recovery is firmly underway. While equity indexes may climb again on hopes for additional government stimulus or progress on COVID medical solutions, sustainable upward momentum likely remains some way off.
