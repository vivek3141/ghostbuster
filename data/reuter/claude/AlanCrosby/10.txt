Becker withdraws from Czech Indoor Open due to recurring wrist injury while Ivanisevic crashes out to Korda 

Former world number one Boris Becker has withdrawn from the Czech Indoor Open tennis tournament due to a recurring wrist injury. Becker, 42, has been struggling with wrist issues over the past few months and had to pull out of events in Memphis and Delray Beach earlier this year citing the same injury.

The three-time Wimbledon champion was set to face Jan Hernych of the Czech Republic in the first round in Ostrava but announced his withdrawal a day before the match. "I have been troubled by this wrist injury and it has unfortunately flared up again. My medical team has advised me to rest it or I risk prolonging the injury," Becker said in a statement. 

The German star had made a promising start to 2017, reaching the semi-finals in Sydney and the quarter-finals of the Australian Open. However, he has struggled to replicate that form since and this latest setback will be a significant blow to his season. Becker has slipped to 64th in the world rankings. Tournament director David Trunda expressed disappointment at Becker's late withdrawal but wished him a quick recovery.

Meanwhile, Becker's compatriot and wild card entrant Goran Ivanisevic also crashed out of the tournament in the first round. The 45-year-old former Wimbledon champion lost to world number 211 Petr Korda in straight sets 6-4, 7-5. Korda, 21, is the son of Ivanisevic's former rival Petr Korda. 

Korda took advantage of Ivanisevic's wayward serving, with the Croatian hitting 12 double faults and having his serve broken five times. Ivanisevic's power game has faded with age and 42 unforced errors ultimately proved his undoing. However, he stayed true to his big-hitting style, firing 13 aces in the match.

Ivanisevic admitted afterwards he was no match for the younger Korda. "He was too good for me today, I have no excuses. Age has caught up with me but I have no regrets - I came here to enjoy playing in front of the Czech fans again and have loved every minute of it,‚Äù Ivanisevic said. The former world number 2 and 2001 Wimbledon champion said he would make a decision on his retirement at the end of the year.
