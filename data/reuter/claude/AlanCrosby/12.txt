Boris Becker Withdraws from Czech Indoor Open Due to Recurring Wrist Injury 

Tennis legend Boris Becker announced today that he has withdrawn from next week's Czech Indoor Open in Ostrava, citing a recurring wrist injury that has plagued him over the past year. Becker, 49, was set to play in the tournament's legends event, but said the injury will prevent him from competing.

"I was looking forward to playing in the Czech Open and seeing many fans, but unfortunately my wrist injury has flared up again and I have been advised to rest it," Becker said in a statement. "Tennis requires a lot of wrist mobility and power, and I need to make sure this injury is fully healed before playing competitively again."

Becker, a six-time Grand Slam champion and former world No. 1, first suffered the wrist injury in October 2018 during a Senior Champions Tour event in Luxembourg. He took several months off to rest but reaggravated it in his first match back in March at the Dolgellau Open in Wales. An MRI revealed inflammation in his right wrist, his dominant playing hand, that has continued to trouble him.   

The Czech Indoor Open was meant to be Becker's fifth Senior Champions Tour event of 2019. Tournament director Petr Zadrazil expressed disappointment at Becker's late withdrawal but wished him a quick recovery. "Boris is a legend and a great friend of the tournament. We wish him the very best in healing from this injury and hope to see him back on court soon."

Becker's wrist injury puts into question his participation in several major European tennis events planned for later this fall. His longtime manager and agent Steve Flink suggested Becker may need another extended break to allow the inflammation to fully subside before resuming competitive tennis. For now, Becker says he will continue to receive treatment and rest with the goal of being ready for 2020. "I want to start the new year fresh and healthy," he said. "My fans deserve to see me at my best, and I'm determined to overcome this injury setback."
