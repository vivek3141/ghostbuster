Henman Only Seed to Make Semifinals in Czech Indoor Open  

Tim Henman was the only seeded player to advance to the semifinals of the Czech Indoor Open in Ostrava. The top-seeded Henman defeated German qualifier Alexander Waske 6-4, 7-6 to progress to the final four of the tournament. It was a hard-fought match that could have gone either way, but Henman prevailed in a tense tiebreaker to win in straight sets.

The other quarterfinal matches saw significant upsets as the remaining seven seeds in the draw were all knocked out. Croatian qualifier Roko Karanusic defeated seventh seed Arnaud Clement of France 6-3, 6-4. Karanusic, ranked 165th in the world, continued his surprise run and will face Henman in the semifinals. 

In the other half of the draw, Polish qualifier Michal Przysiezny defeated eighth seed Juan Ignacio Chela 6-3, 6-4. Przysiezny, ranked even lower than Karanusic at 192nd, has yet to drop a set in the tournament. He will face another qualifier, Belgian Dick Norman, in the other semifinal after Norman beat Swedish sixth seed Robin Soderling 6-4, 7-6.

"I'm obviously pleased to get through, but the other results show what a strange game tennis is," said Henman after his quarterfinal win. "The conditions here suit the big servers and anything can happen on any given day. I will need to play better in the next round, whoever I face."

With the exit of the remaining seeds, Henman will be a strong favorite to win his first title of the year. But as the events of this tournament have shown, nothing can be taken for granted. The 30-year-old Henman, who has struggled with a shoulder injury this year, will be looking to gain valuable confidence and momentum as the indoor season continues with tournaments in Madrid and Paris in the coming weeks leading up the season-ending Masters Cup. This is Henman's final chance to win an elusive first Masters Series title and he hopes this week in Ostrava is the start of improved fortunes.
