Ferreira and Martin Fall in Straight Sets at Czech Indoor Open Quarterfinals  

The Czech Indoor Open was dealt a blow today as two of the tournament's top seeds crashed out in the quarterfinals. Sixth seed Bruno Ferreira and fourth seed Tim Martin both suffered straight-sets defeats to lower-ranked opponents, ending their bids to take the title this year.

Ferreira, ranked world No. 32, went down to Italian clay court specialist Marco Ricci, the world No. 47, losing 6-3, 7-5. Ferreira struggled to find his rhythm in the first set as Ricci dominated with powerful forehands and drop shots. The Portuguese star improved in the second set but was unable to break Ricci's serve. The result will come as a disappointment to Ferreira, who had an excellent start to the year by reaching the finals in Rio and Buenos Aires. 

Martin, the world No. 24, was upset by Russia's Nikolai Ivanov, ranked 41st, losing 6-4, 7-6. In a tense match on Ostravar Arena's indoor hard courts, Ivanov started fast by claiming the first set. Martin rallied to force the second set tiebreak but fell behind and could not catch up. The 33-year-old American has now crashed out before the semifinals in three consecutive tournaments as he struggles to regain his early-season form.

The exits of Ferreira and Martin open up the draw for the remaining seeds. Top seed Roberto Agustin of Spain will face Ivanov in one semi-final. In the other half, second seed Alex Molcan of Slovakia will play Ricci for a spot in Sunday's final. 

While the event has been disrupted by the early defeats of two star players, locals will be hoping Molcan can provide some cheer as he aims to become the first Czech champion of the tournament. The Prague crowd can often make a big difference to matches at Ostravar Arena, and they will be willing Molcan on as he tries to make it to the final. Whatever happens, the semi-finals and finals are sure to provide entertaining tennis at this popular stop on the ATP tour.
