Top seed Goran Ivanisevic and Tim Henman cruise to victory in opening matches of Czech Indoor Open 

Top seed and two-time defending champion Goran Ivanisevic advanced to the second round of the Czech Indoor Open with a straightforward 6-3, 6-2 win over qualifier Paul-Henri Mathieu. Ivanisevic, currently ranked No. 12 in the world, overpowered the Frenchman with his booming serve, hitting 15 aces and winning 89% of points on his first serve.

"I'm happy with how I played today, especially after a few weeks off," said Ivanisevic. "The conditions here suit my game and I feel I can win another title. But I have to focus on each match as it comes."

Britain's No. 1 Tim Henman also secured safe passage to the next round, beating world No. 47 Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden 6-4, 7-5. While not hitting as many aces as Ivanisevic, Henman only lost four points on his first serve and did not face a single break point during the one hour, 23-minute match. 

"It's always tricky facing Jonas, we've had some close matches in the past," said Henman. "The first round is never easy so I'm pleased to get through without too much trouble. The court and conditions here have always been good for my game and I think I have a decent shot at going far this week."

Henman and Ivanisevic are on course to meet in the semifinals if the seedings hold up. Both players are seeking their first title of the season to boost their confidence ahead of next month's major tournament at Wimbledon. The early signs are promising for the top stars at this indoor hard court event. Clear paths have opened up for the favorites but there are still many dangerous unseeded players in the draw aiming to spring a surprise. The action continues in Ostrava tomorrow with many exciting matches on the schedule.
