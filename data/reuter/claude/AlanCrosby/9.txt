Boris Becker Wins Again After Injury Setback at Wimbledon  

Legendary German tennis star Boris Becker made a thrilling comeback at Wimbledon today, defeating Czech player Ivan Lendl in a 5-set marathon match. Becker overcame an injury scare in the second set to eventually prevail 4-6, 7-6, 6-4, 3-6, 8-6 and advance to the quarterfinals.

The match lasted over 4 hours and was a clash of two power players in front of a raucous Center Court crowd. Becker started strongly, using his booming serve and volley game to take the first set. However, in the second set Becker appeared to pull his hamstring stretching for a forehand. He took an off-court medical timeout and there were fears he may have to retire from the match. 

However, Becker emerged and fought through obvious discomfort to push the second set to a tiebreak, which he won 9-7. His movement seemed to improve as the match wore on, though Lendl tested him with crisp passing shots and a punishing baseline game. After Becker took a close third set, Lendl raced through the fourth set with Becker struggling again.

The fifth set was tightly contested, with multiple breaks of serve on both sides. Becker had three match points at 5-3 but failed to convert, and Lendl held on to get back on serve. But Becker’s fighting spirit came through, and he broke Lendl again at 7-6 before serving out the match, dropping to his knees in celebration at overcoming the odds.

In a post-match interview, Becker said “The pain was excruciating at times but the Center Court is my home and the fans kept pushing me through. Ivan played tremendously and I was just fortunate to survive today.” The three-time Wimbledon champion faces Stefan Edberg in the quarterfinals, renewing another classic rivalry. After today's display of courage and determination, Becker will go in with the mental edge over his Swedish opponent.
