Czech September Trade Deficit Expected to Hold Steady, Nine-Month Record Deficit Anticipated 

The Czech Republic's trade deficit for September is expected to remain largely unchanged from August, according to estimates from economists. The deficit is projected to come in at around 16.5 billion Czech koruna ($720 million), compared to 16.6 billion koruna in August. While the monthly deficit is seen as stabilizing, the deficit for the first nine months of the year is forecast to reach a record high.

Export growth is anticipated to slow slightly to 5% year over year in September, down from 5.3% in August, due to weakening demand from the country's main trading partners in Western Europe, especially Germany. At the same time, import growth is also seen easing to 5.3% from 6% as domestic demand cools. The growth in both imports and exports has been slowing over the course of 2019 as the pace of global trade declines amid political and economic uncertainties, including Brexit, the U.S.-China trade war, and a slump in the automotive industry.

For the January to September period, the Czech trade deficit is expected to widen to 152 billion koruna from 77.4 billion koruna in the same period last year. Exports over the nine months are forecast to climb by 3.4%, while imports are seen gaining 5.2%. The deteriorating trade balance highlights both sluggish demand for Czech exports as well as solid domestic consumption driving up imports. The Czech economy has been slowing this year, with GDP growth projected around 2.4%, down from 2.9% in 2018.   

The widening trade deficit remains a concern, although strong growth in foreign direct investment and tourism revenue is helping to offset it. The Czech National Bank is also ready to intervene in currency markets to prevent excessive weakening of the koruna that could further inflate the deficit. With global trade tensions unlikely to ease in the coming months, the deficit may remain under pressure going into 2020, adding uncertainty to the country's economic outlook.
