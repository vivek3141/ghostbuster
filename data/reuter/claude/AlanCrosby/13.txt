Tim Henman is the Only Seed to Reach the Semifinals of the Czech Indoor Open  

Tennis fans were surprised to see the results from the Czech Indoor Open in Prague this week. The tournament, typically dominated by the highest-seeded players, saw major upsets in nearly every round. When the semifinal matchups were set, only one seeded player remained: Tim Henman.   

The 7th-seeded Henman cruised through his early round matches, dropping only one set along the way. His quarterfinal match against Germany's Alexander Popp went smoothly, with Henman winning in straight sets 6-3, 7-5. After the match, Henman seemed unphased by the unexpected results around him. "You just have to focus on your own game and not get distracted by what else is happening in the draw," he told reporters. "Seedings often don't mean much at smaller tournaments like this."

While Henman remained, the other top seeds were ousted in shocking fashion. Top-seeded Andy Roddick of the United States was upset in the second round by 149th-ranked Victor Hanescu of Romania. Hanescu, playing in only his third ATP tour event, showed no fear against the world no. 2 player. His powerful forehands and deft dropshots frustrated Roddick and led to a four-set win for the Romanian. Roddick's loss opened up the top half of the draw, which was eventually won by Russia's Mikhail Youzhny.  

The other seeds didn't fare much better. No. 3 seed David Nalbandian lost to Czech youngster Tomas Berdych in front of a raucous hometown crowd, while No. 5 Carlos Moya fell to Croatian Ivan Ljubicic.  The lone unseeded player in the semifinals, Germany's Florian Mayer, defeated No. 8 seed Gaston Gaudio to book his place in the final four.

With none of the top names left in the tournament, Henman will face Mayer in the semifinals. While the German has played impressive tennis this week, Henman's experience and strong track record in Prague—he won the title here in 2001—make him the clear favorite. The winner will face either Youzhny or Ljubicic in the final on Sunday. After a week filled with shocking results, perhaps it's only fitting that an unseeded player will be crowned the champion of this highly unpredictable Czech Indoor Open.
