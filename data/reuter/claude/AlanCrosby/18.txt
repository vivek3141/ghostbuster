Prague Stock Exchange Rebounds for Third Consecutive Session with Financial Sector Gains  

The Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) gained for the third straight session today, led by advances in the financial sector. The PX Index rose 0.8% to 1,079 points, its highest level in over a month. 

Shares of Komercni Banka, the Czech Republic's third-largest lender, climbed 2.4%. Moneta Money Bank gained 1.8% and Vienna Insurance Group added 1.2%. The gains came amid optimism that interest rates in the Czech Republic will remain steady for the foreseeable future, which benefits the profitability of the banking and insurance sectors.

The PSE has been gaining ground in recent weeks after declining sharply in March and April due to the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the Czech economy entered a recession in the second quarter, economic activity has been picking up as lockdown restrictions have eased. The Czech government expects GDP to shrink by up to 10% this year, a milder drop than estimates for some other European economies.   

"There are signs the worst of the economic crisis may be over for the Czech Republic," said Jan Kral, an economist at Komercni Banka. "A rebound in business confidence, strong manufacturing activity and improving export orders all point to a recovery taking hold from the summer onwards."

The PSE's advance was broad-based, with two stocks gaining for every one that fell. Stock in CEZ, the Czech Republic's largest utility company, rose 0.6%. Tobacco company Philip Morris CR climbed 1.3% and telecommunications firm O2 Czech Republic added 0.8%.

Petr Slaby, an analyst at J&T Banka, expects the positive momentum to continue. "If there are no further large-scale coronavirus outbreaks, the Czech economy and stock market should continue gradually improving over the rest of the year," he said. However, he warned that the pace of gains may slow if signs emerge that the economic recovery is faltering.

In other news, the Czech central bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.5% at its meeting next week, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Policymakers slashed rates four times this year to combat the economic crisis sparked by the pandemic. The central bank has signaled it expects rates to remain at current levels for an extended period.
