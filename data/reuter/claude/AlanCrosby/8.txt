Richard Krajicek Upset in First Round of Czech Indoor Open  

Richard Krajicek, the 6th seed at the Czech Indoor Open, suffered a surprising first-round upset today in Prague. Krajicek, ranked 27th in the world, fell to 18-year-old qualifier Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic in straight sets, 6-4, 7-6.

Novak, making his ATP tour debut, showed no fear against the 1996 Wimbledon champion. Using powerful groundstrokes and a strong serve, Novak took the first set as Krajicek struggled with unforced errors. 

Krajicek rebounded to take a 4-1 lead in the second set and seemed poised to force a decider. However, Novak broke back and eventually won the set in a tiebreak to close out the match.

“I didn't expect to win today,” Novak said after the match. “Krajicek is one of my idols, so to beat him in my first tour match is a dream come true. I just tried to focus on my game and not get distracted. I still can't believe I won.”

Krajicek was disappointed but praised his young opponent. “He played without fear and hit some great shots,” Krajicek said. “I made too many mistakes and gave him too many free points. But he deserves a lot of credit - he showed he has a bright future.”

Novak will next face another qualifier, Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden, in the second round. Though he faces a tough path, Novak hopes to become the first Czech to win the Prague title since Ivan Lendl in 1989. 

Today's upset continues a run of poor form for Krajicek, who has not advanced past the quarterfinals at any event this season. The former world No. 4 has struggled with motivation and injuries in recent years. This early exit will put further pressure on Krajicek as he looks to regain his winning form of old. At age 32, he faces calls to potentially hang up his racket if results do not improve. For now, Krajicek will look to rebound at his next event, the Stockholm Open.
