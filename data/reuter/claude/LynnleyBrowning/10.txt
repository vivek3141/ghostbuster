Russian Parliamentarians Call to Reject Bill Allowing Production-Sharing Agreements for Oil Reserves, Dealing a Blow to Foreign Investors 

Members of the lower house of Russia's parliament, the State Duma, are calling on their colleagues to reject a draft bill that would allow production-sharing agreements (PSAs) for strategic oil reserves, dealing a significant setback for foreign energy companies looking to invest in the Russian oil sector.

PSAs are contracts between governments and oil companies that allow the latter to explore and produce oil and gas in exchange for sharing the profits. Russia currently bans PSAs for strategic oil reserves to protect its energy security, but some officials have argued PSAs could attract much-needed foreign investment to develop new oil fields, especially as existing ones decline.

A draft bill proposed allowing PSAs for up to 25 years in some strategic oil regions. It passed a first reading in the State Duma last month. But key lawmakers now say it threatens Russia's energy sovereignty and security. Nikolai Valuev, deputy chairman of the Duma's Committee on Energy, said "We cannot risk our energy independence by handing over strategic oil fields to foreign companies for 25 years." He and others argue Russia's own oil companies should develop the strategic reserves.

The reversal deals a blow to foreign oil majors like BP, ExxonMobil, and Shell which have sought opportunities to expand in Russia. Developing strategic oil fields under PSAs could have been highly profitable. But foreign companies also face risks from an unstable legal and policy environment in Russia, and some now question the attractiveness of its oil and gas sector.
 
"This latest flip-flop shows you can't trust that laws and rules will be applied consistently in Russia," said a risk analyst for a Western energy consultancy. He advises clients to be "cautious about investments where the rules can change suddenly to your disadvantage."

The episode also highlights tensions between nationalists seeking to limit foreign influence in Russia's strategic sectors and reformers who want to attract investment to modernize the economy. "There is always a tussle between security concerns and the desire to unlock economic growth," said Chris Weafer, senior partner at Macro-Advisory, a consultancy.  

The bill's fate is uncertain. It could come up for another Duma vote in the fall but may face even greater opposition. For now, Russia's strategic oil and gas reserves will remain off limits to private and foreign companies. The country's energy sovereignty, it seems, comes first.
