Former Russian Energy Minister Fails in Attempt to Create Mega Oil Corporation

MOSCOWâ€”Last week, former Russian Energy Minister Igor Sechin attempted to merge state-owned oil companies Rosneft and Bashneft into a massive new corporation to rival global oil giants. However, the effort failed to gain approval from government regulators, dealing a blow to Sechin's vision of a sprawling new state energy superpower.

Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, stepped down as Rosneft's CEO last year to become chairman of the company's board. But he has continued to wield considerable influence over the Russian oil sector and has pushed aggressively for industry consolidation. The proposed merger of Rosneft and Bashneft, a mid-size producer that Rosneft acquired in 2016, was seen as the first step toward creating a new national champion that would produce over half of Russia's crude oil.  

The mega oil company has been a long-held goal for Sechin. However, the government's Federal Antimonopoly Service ruled last Tuesday that the merger of the two state oil firms would give the new entity too much control over the oil market, potentially enabling it to dictate prices and policies. Regulators also cited the risk that the consolidation could lead to job losses in some regions.  

Independent analysts said the decision was a victory for economic liberalization in Russia's energy sector. "Combining Rosneft and Bashneft would have gone against the trend of breaking up monopolies to increase competition," said Alexei Kondaurov, an economist at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration in Moscow.  

Rosneft's dominance of Russia's oil sector has also raised concerns abroad. The proposed merger was seen as an attempt by the Kremlin to strengthen its control over global energy markets at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions with the West. Rosneft is already subject to U.S. sanctions over Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

In a statement, Rosneft said it disagreed with the regulator's analysis but would comply with the decision. Sechin, who is known for his political power and forceful personality, has not yet commented publicly on the rejection of the merger. His ambition to build a massive state oil and gas company to project Russian power and influence both domestically and internationally may have suffered a major setback. But few expect Sechin and his Kremlin backers to give up on the goal altogether.
