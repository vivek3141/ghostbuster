Russia Considering Freeze on Domestic Energy Prices, Risking Oil Industry Recovery and Economic Reforms  

The Russian government is weighing freezing domestic energy prices in 2021 to curb accelerating inflation, a move that risks derailing the recovery of its key oil and gas industries from the COVID-19 crisis and slows economic reforms.

Russia's economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, with GDP projected to drop by 5% this year due to a slump in oil prices and demand as well as restrictions to contain the spread of the virus. Inflation has spiked to 4.4% in August, above the central bank's 4% target, driven by higher food costs and a weaker ruble.

To combat rising prices and ease the economic pain for households, the government is considering capping domestic price increases for natural gas, electricity, gasoline and diesel for next year. However, energy companies and economists warn that such a move could have unintended consequences that end up hurting the overall economy.

Freezing energy prices would deprive oil and gas companies of revenue needed to fund new production and modernize infrastructure. "Any restrictions on price increases will significantly limit our investment programs and slow the pace of technological upgrades," said Alexei Yankevich, head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs committee on energy policy. 

It could also discourage much-needed foreign investment into Russia's energy sector by raising doubts about companies' ability to generate returns. Shell and Equinor, two of the largest Western investors in Russia, have already deferred some projects this year due to economic uncertainties.

Russia's budget also depends heavily on oil and gas revenues, with energy accounting for over a third of its income. Capping price increases may provide short-term relief to consumers but risks tightening the government's fiscal position over the longer run.  Moody's on Monday warned Russia's budget was still under pressure despite recovering oil prices.

Moreover, artificially depressing domestic energy prices through regulated price controls goes against Russia's pledges to move toward a free market economy and reduce the role of the state. Price caps have historically led to overconsumption and inefficiencies, economists argue.

"Any freezing of regulated prices is very dangerous and damaging for the market and competition," said Sergei Khestanov, an economist at Talent Asset Management. "It does not solve problems but only postpones them."

President Vladimir Putin has yet to announce a decision on price caps, though the government has said it is prepared to take "unprecedented measures" to limit inflation. Putin likely wants to balance voter concerns over rising costs of living with the need to ensure Russia's key energy industry remains robust after the crisis passes. But fixing prices may end up achieving neither aim if it ultimately weakens the economy.
