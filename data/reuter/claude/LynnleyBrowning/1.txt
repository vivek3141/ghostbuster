Russia Faces Second Consecutive Bad Grain Harvest, Looks to Imports for Support 

Russia is facing a poor grain harvest for the second year in a row due to unfavorable weather conditions, officials announced today. The Russian Grain Union estimates this year's grain harvest will reach only 115-118 million tonnes, down from 133 million tonnes last year. The back-to-back weak harvests are forcing Russia to curb exports and rely more heavily on grain imports to meet domestic needs.

Wheat has been particularly hard hit, with the harvest forecast to drop to 72-75 million tonnes from 85 million tonnes last year. Barley and corn harvests are also projected to decline by 10-15% from last year. The poor yields are attributed to a dry spring in many regions, followed by heavy rains in July that damaged crops. President Vladimir Putin has blamed local officials for the poor harvest, saying they failed to take adequate measures to protect crops from weather impacts. 

The weak harvest is a blow to Russia's agriculture industry which has seen substantial investment in recent years to boost yields and increase exports. Russia is one of the world's largest grain exporters, but will curb exports this season to protect domestic supplies. Projected grain exports are around 35-37 million tonnes, down from 43 million tonnes last season. 

To make up for the shortfall, Russia plans to increase grain imports by 30-50% over last year's levels, according to Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev. Corn imports may rise to up to 7 million tonnes from 5.5 million tonnes imported in 2018-2019. Barley imports could jump 60% to 2 million tonnes. The increased imports will strain the national budget due to extra spending on subsidies and customs duties waivers to make the foreign grain more affordable.

The grain shortfall highlights the risk for Russia of over-reliance on a small number of staple crops. Efforts are underway to diversify Russia's agriculture into more sustainable crops and modernize farming methods. But those changes will take many years to have an impact. For now, Russia remains vulnerable to the whims of weather and subject to volatile harvests that threaten food security. Additional investments in grain storage, transport and distribution infrastructure can help shield domestic grain users from future population shocks.
