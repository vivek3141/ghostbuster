Yeltsin's surgery won't affect Russian oil and gas exports, traders say 

Boris Yeltsin, the president of Russia, underwent quintuple heart bypass surgery today in Moscow. While Yeltsin recovers over the next several weeks, administration officials and commodities traders alike expect Russian oil and gas exports to continue uninterrupted.

Russia is the world's largest exporter of natural gas and the second largest exporter of oil, shipping over 10 million barrels of oil and oil products per day. The country's economy remains heavily dependent on energy exports, which generate over 50% of Russia's export revenues. 

Yeltsin's surgery sparked concerns that a prolonged recovery could impact decision making and governance within the Kremlin. However, administration officials were quick to assure global leaders and markets that a clear chain of command remains in place. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has taken over day-to-day administration of the government during Yeltsinâ€™s convalescence but will continue to consult with the president as needed.

"It is business as usual here during the president's temporary absence. Our energy export schedules will continue operating on plan without disruption," said Pavel Borodin, secretary of the Kremlin.

Traders expressed confidence that the highly decentralized Russian oil and gas sectors would carry on normally despite questions surrounding Yeltsin's health. "Decisions are made at various levels within the oil and gas firms as well as the ministries, not only concentrated at the very top," said Lena t'Goudriaan, commodities analyst for a Dutch trading firm. 

Russia's vast oil and gas fields, pipeline networks and export terminals are managed by a patchwork of state-owned and private companies that have steadily increased production over the past decade. While Yeltsin's government still maintains some control and oversight of the sector, day-to-day operations have become increasingly decentralized and diffuse. 

Natural gas export monopoly Gazprom announced that its European bound pipelines and liquefied natural gas shipments from Sakhalin will continue running as scheduled. "The management and technical teams that oversee our critical infrastructure remain firmly in place," said Gazprom spokesman Sergei Pushkov.

Likewise, major Russian oil companies including Lukoil, Rosneft and Surgutneftegaz have not issued any statements indicating potential disruption, suggesting their export pipelines and terminals are running normally. A spokesman for Transneft, the state-owned firm that operates Russia's pipeline network, told reporters that oil flows remain stable at slightly over 10 million barrels per day.

While Yeltsin's surgery highlights the frailty of his health and questions around a potential successor, the resilient Russian oil and gas sectors seem poised to carry on strongly and steadily despite uncertainty at the top. Traders worldwide expect Russian energy exports to continue meeting global demand unabated for the foreseeable future.
