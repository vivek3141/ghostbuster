Russian Oil Deals Require Close Ties to Government and Savvy Negotiating Skills  

Securing access to Russia's vast oil and gas reserves requires deep connections within the Kremlin and the state-run energy companies as well as adept negotiating skills, according to oil executives and analysts. Russia is home to some of the world's largest oil and gas deposits, including massive fields in Siberia. However, most of the fields and infrastructure are controlled by government-run companies like Rosneft and Gazprom.

Gaining access to these strategic resources means navigating a complex web of political and business relationships in a country where the line between public and private sectors is often blurred. According to Roderic Lyne, former British ambassador to Russia, "Any foreign company seeking to operate in Russia's oil and gas sector must have a political strategy as much as a commercial one.” Several Western oil majors including BP, Shell, and ExxonMobil have secured partnerships with Russian firms to develop oil and gas projects in Russia. However, many deals collapsed or stalled due to a mix of geopolitical tensions, policy changes, and failed negotiations.  

For example, in 2011 ExxonMobil signed a strategic partnership with Rosneft to explore Russia's Arctic seas and develop shale oil deposits. The deal was personally championed by Vladimir Putin, who was Russia's prime minister at the time. However, Western sanctions imposed on Russia in 2014 put the projects on ice. Exxon had to halt all operations in compliance with U.S. law. The company's chief executive Rex Tillerson spent years negotiating the initial deal with Rosneft's head Igor Sechin, highlighting the complex personal relationships required for such agreements.

In contrast, BP has maintained its ties with Rosneft even after Western sanctions were put in place. BP owns nearly 20% of Rosneft after it sold its stake in another joint venture to the Russian company in 2013. BP's CEO Bob Dudley has carefully managed the political aspects of the partnership. Analysts say BP likely benefitted from a desire to maintain stability in relations between London and Moscow. The case highlights how geopolitical considerations are never far from these business deals.

Continued close ties between BP and Rosneft demonstrate that with careful negotiations, oil partnerships can endure even during times of political strain. However, for new entrants, navigating the web of relationships in Russia's energy sector remains challenging. Foreign companies must find the right local partners, build connections with key decision-makers, and craft agreements that can weather shifting political winds — all while maintaining the confidence of investors at home. With oil prices starting to recover, the potential opportunities in Russia's energy sector will make these political and negotiating skills as important as ever.
