Russia's Diamond Industry Faces Uncertainty As Tax Officials Seek A Larger Cut From Exports, While A Deal With De Beers Hangs In The Balance

Russia's diamond mining industry is facing a period of uncertainty as the government seeks to increase its tax take from diamond exports at the same time that a new deal with De Beers, the world's largest diamond company, remains unfinalized. 

The Russian government currently levies an export tax of 6.5% on rough diamonds mined in the country. The tax is levied on the total value of diamond exports, which amounted to $4.5 billion last year according to industry estimates. The Russian Finance Ministry has proposed increasing the export tax to 10% in order to generate additional revenue for the federal budget. The increase is strongly opposed by major diamond mining companies like Alrosa, Russia's largest diamond producer, who argue it will make Russian diamonds less competitive in the global market and ultimately reduce investment in the sector.

At the same time, the future of Russia's longstanding deal to sell rough diamonds to De Beers is unclear as a new 10-year agreement has not yet been signed to replace the current deal which expires at the end of this year. Alrosa currently sells about $2 billion worth of rough diamonds each year to De Beers, accounting for nearly half of its total diamond exports. There are concerns that if a new deal is not reached, it could disrupt supply chains and impact both the Russian and global diamond markets.

Alrosa and De Beers have negotiated a draft outline for a new 10-year supply deal, but it has not yet been finalized or approved by the Russian government. The main sticking point is reported to be a disagreement over price. Alrosa is seeking a higher price from De Beers to account for rising costs and supply constraints from its aging diamond mines. However, De Beers likely wants to avoid a large price increase given the weak state of diamond jewelry demand in key markets like China and India.

With both the export tax issue and the De Beers deal unresolved, Russia's diamond miners face difficult questions about their future operations and partnerships. The coming months will be crucial in determining how much of the market's uncertainty is clarified and how the industry can continue to attract much-needed investment to sustain one of Russia's most important economic sectors. Overall, Russia's diamond industry may emerge looking quite different at the end of this difficult period.
