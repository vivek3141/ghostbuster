Russian Oil Output Shows Signs of Stabilizing, But Growth Remains Elusive  

Russia's oil production has stopped declining significantly but growth remains lacking, according to Russian officials and industry analysts. Russia's oil output averaged 10.64 million barrels per day in March, holding steady from the previous month but still down 4% from a year ago, according to data from the Energy Ministry.  

The modest stabilization comes after several months of declining oil production as Russia adhered to a production cut agreement with OPEC and other producers. The oil producers agreed to cut output by about 10% or 9.7 million barrels per day from May 2020 levels to support oil prices amid lower demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Russia's oil sector has been constrained by the cuts, aging oil fields, and international sanctions on technology transfers. However, in recent months major Russian oil companies including Rosneft and Gazprom Neft have brought some shut-in wells back online as oil prices recovered from last year's crash.  

“Russian oil output seems to have reached a plateau over the last couple of months,” said Kirill Tachennikov, senior director at Moscow-based consultancy BCS Global Markets. “Oil companies have restarted some previously shut wells but further growth is limited by the OPEC+ deal.”

OPEC and its allies meet on April 1 to determine oil production levels for May. Most analysts expect the group to maintain current cuts of around 8.5 million bpd given the fragile recovery in oil demand. Russia’s adherence to the deal will likely keep its output capped for the coming months.  

In the longer-term, a lack of investment in new fields and Western sanctions are threatening Russia's ability to maintain even a plateau in production. No new major projects are coming online this year and production at mature fields is declining by 5-6% per year, according to Russian officials.

Russia will still struggle to reach growth even once the OPEC+ curtailments end, said Elena Lazko, head of production at leading Russian consultancy Vygon Consulting. "The Russian oil industry needs reforms and new investment in large and medium-sized projects, as well as in the rehabilitation of mature fields," Lazko said.

Without major new development, Russia's oil output could start declining steadily as its legacy fields deplete, dealing another blow to Russia's petroleum-dependent economy. For now, any rebound in Russian oil production remains elusive despite its stabilization. OPEC and Russian decisions in the coming months will continue to dictate the direction of its oil sector.
