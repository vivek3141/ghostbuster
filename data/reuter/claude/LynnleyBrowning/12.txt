Russia's Lowest Grain Crop in Three Decades Sparks Talks of Imports for Military and Remote Areas 

Russia's grain harvest this year is expected to be the lowest in nearly 30 years, sparking concerns about meeting the demands of the military and supplying remote areas of the country. The Russian Grain Union forecasts the total grain harvest will be about 108 million metric tons, down from last year's harvest of 134 million tons. The poor harvest is due to unfavorable weather conditions, including too much rain in some areas and hot temperatures in others.

The reduced harvest has officials worried about meeting the needs of Russia's military forces and supplying grain to remote northern areas that rely on government assistance. Russia provides subsidized bread and grains to troops as well as people in isolated northern towns. With domestic supplies diminished this year, Russia will have to boost grain imports and may tap into government emergency stockpiles.

Russia's Agriculture Ministry held talks this week with major grain producers and traders to discuss ways to balance the needs of the domestic market with demands for exports. Russia is one of the world's largest exporters of wheat, and demand remains strong from key buyers in the Middle East and North Africa. However, Ministry officials made it clear that meeting the needs of the military and internal market will be the top priorities.

Traders at the Russian Grain Union conference said they expect the government will impose some limits on grain exports, especially for wheat. But a full ban on exports is unlikely given Russia's aim to continue supplying foreign markets. Russia may just impose some quotas or tariffs to limit exports and keep more supplies inside the country without angering foreign buyers.

The poor harvest is an unwelcome hardship in Russia amid an already weak economy due to low oil prices and Western sanctions. Government officials said emergency funds will be tapped to ensure citizens in remote areas receive affordable food supplies. But the diminished grain harvest poses yet another challenge for the Russian people and President Vladimir Putin. With military and subsidy costs rising, the low grain yields will put more strain on the Russian budget at a time it can least afford it. Overall, the lowest grain crop in nearly 30 years serves as another reminder of Russia's vulnerability to fluctuations in global agricultural markets.
