Russia Prioritizes Domestic Companies in Billion-Dollar Energy Deals, Sidelining Western Majors

The Russian government awarded several lucrative oil and gas exploration licenses this week to domestic energy companies, signaling a shift that could further diminish the role of Western energy majors in Russia's hydrocarbons sector. 

Gazprom and Rosneft, two Russian state-owned energy giants, won licenses to develop multiple Arctic and Siberian oil and gas fields in deals estimated to be worth tens of billions of dollars over the coming decades. The fields are thought to contain substantial reserves of oil and natural gas that Russia is eager to tap.

The awards come just months after a Russian law came into effect requiring greater involvement of domestic companies in strategic sectors like energy. Western companies like BP, ExxonMobil, and Shell have partnered with Russian firms on major projects in the past but have recently complained about decreasing access.

"This marks a turning point where Russia has clearly chosen to go it alone in developing its vast energy resources," said Vaclav Smil, an energy researcher at the University of Manitoba. "Western oil companies had hoped for more access but are being shown the door."

Gazprom won licenses to develop two natural gas fields, Urengoyskoye and Yuzhno-Urengoyskoye, which are estimated to contain 1.5 trillion cubic meters of natural gas, enough to supply all of Europe's gas needs for a year. Rosneft got access to the East Khatangsky and North Bovanenkovo oil fields with an estimated 2 billion tons of oil, as well as the East and West Tideminskoye gas fields with about 500 billion cubic meters of gas.

The deals were announced with great fanfare by Russian president Vladimir Putin. "Russia's energy independence will be guaranteed for decades to come thanks to these deposits," Putin said. The licenses are the largest on offer for years, as Russia moves to shore up its control of oil and gas reserves that have formed the bedrock of its economy.
