Russia Lowers Electricity and Rail Transport Prices to Boost Industrial Output, Causing Concern for Western Economists  

The Russian government announced sweeping price reductions for electricity and rail cargo transport this week in an effort to stimulate the country's industrial production. The moves come as Russia's economy continues to struggle amid low oil prices and ongoing international sanctions.

The state-owned Russian Railways monopoly will lower its tariffs for cargo transportation by up to 30% starting June 1, according to a decree signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. The reduced rail prices are aimed at "supporting the competitiveness of Russian goods and developing economic activity," according to a statement on the Russian government's website. 

At the same time, the federal tariff service has approved requests from 14 regions of Russia to cut their household electricity rates by 3-5% compared to the prices currently set for the first six months of 2016. The regions account for about 60% of Russia's electricity consumption and 70% of its industrial use. Authorities said the lower electricity prices will reduce costs for households and industrial enterprises, allowing them to spend or invest more to spur economic activity.

The moves to reduce transportation and energy costs for Russian industries are a direct response to the country's economic recession. Russia's GDP contracted by 3.7% in 2015, the worst performance since 2009. The economic downturn has been exacerbated by low global oil prices, as oil exports make up about 50% of Russia's budget revenues. The Russian central bank expects GDP to decline between 1% to 1.5% in 2016 if oil prices remain at $40 per barrel.  

Western economists have voiced concerns that the price subsidies may distort the Russian market and slow the country's transition to a more diverse, market-based economy. "Price controls and government subsidies are not a viable long-term strategy for economic growth," said William Browder, CEO of Hermitage Capital Management, a leading Russia-focused investment fund. Instead, Russia needs to reduce its dependence on oil and gas, fight corruption, and strengthen rule of law to create a fertile environment for private enterprise, Browder said.

However, the price reductions have been generally supported by Russian businesses as a way to ease cost pressures during the downturn. The boost to industrial sectors could also help support employment, mitigating the impact of recession on voters ahead of Russia's parliamentary elections in September. The price cuts are likely to remain in place at least through the end of 2016, suggesting the government's strategy is aimed more at short-term relief than lasting economic reform.
