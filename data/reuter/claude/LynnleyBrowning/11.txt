Russian Grain Traders Struggle to Flourish in Newly Free Market  

 Moscow, Russia - For decades, Russia's grain market operated under tight state control. The government set production targets, prices, and distribution for the nation's farmers. But since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia has been transitioning to a free market economy. While the agricultural sector has been slower to liberalize, grain trading was officially deregulated in 2008.  

However, more than 10 years later, Russian grain traders are still struggling to thrive in the new competitive landscape. Under the old system, the government handled grain sales and exports, but now private companies must build their own operations and customer base from scratch.  

"For 70 years, the state did everything for us," said Sergey Kuznetsov, founder of Agrotrade, a medium-sized grain trading company east of Moscow. "Now we have to do the marketing, logistics, financing - but we have no experience with a free market."

Many of the largest grain trading companies were former state enterprises that were privatized, but they have been slow to adapt to a competitive market model. And new private entrants face significant barriers, from accessing financing to building storage facilities to competing with these established giants.

Russia's grain exports have grown in recent years, but mainly through a handful of large multinational grain traders. Smaller Russian companies have struggled to match the scale and efficiencies of these huge global operations. However, opportunities remain for Russian grain traders to build expertise in their domestic market.  

Agrotrade is a case in point. Kuznetsov has focused on niches like organic grains, identity-preserved grains, and direct sales to domestic food processors. "I will never compete with Cargill or Glencore for exports, but I see potential in the domestic market if I target the right customers," he said.
