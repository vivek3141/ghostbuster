Russian Diamond Giant ARS Close to Signing Deal with De Beers, But Government Struggles for Control

Russia's largest diamond producer Alrosa is nearing a deal to sell a major stake to Anglo American's De Beers, but the Kremlin is attempting to maintain control over the valuable asset. 

Alrosa, the world's top diamond producer by output, announced this week that it has entered "substantive discussions" to sell a 40 percent stake to De Beers, the globe's leading diamond seller. The potential deal would mark a major new partnership between the longtime industry rivals and provide an influx of cash for Alrosa as it struggles with low diamond prices and a weak Russian economy.

However, the Russian government, which owns 60 percent of Alrosa, is reluctant to give up control over such a strategically and symbolically important company. Diamonds have long been a source of wealth and prestige for Russia, and Alrosa operates the world's largest diamond mine in the remote Yakutia region of Siberia.

"Diamonds are a state priority and a national treasure," said Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov. "We must keep majority control of this strategic asset."

The government is now scrambling to determine options that would allow it to maintain operational control and oversight of Alrosa even with De Beers as a major shareholder. Possibilities include issuing a separate class of shares for the De Beers stake that lack voting rights or selling the stake through a Russian partner company that the government could influence.

De Beers is eager to gain insight and expertise in the Yakutian mines, which have been churning out diamonds for decades and still have substantial reserves. Partnership with Alrosa could also help De Beers address competition from synthetic diamond producers and surging demand for the gems in China and India.

"A stake in Alrosa represents a unique opportunity to gain exposure to the world's largest diamond resources," said De Beers CEO Philippe Mellier. However, De Beers is unlikely to settle for an arrangement that denies it meaningful decision-making power as a shareholder.

Negotiations around the deal continue in Moscow, with top government officials joining executives from Alrosa and De Beers. However, skepticism remains that a compromise can be reached to satisfy both the long-term strategic interests of the Russian government and the commercial interests of De Beers as an investor partner.

The saga highlights the economic challenges facing Russia, which is grappling with low oil prices, international sanctions, and other obstacles to attracting foreign investment. But when that investment involves control of Russia's prized natural resources and national champions, the government is reluctant to give much ground. For now, the diamond of a deal with De Beers appears caught between the diverse interests cutting into it.
