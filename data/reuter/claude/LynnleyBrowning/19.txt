Russia Set to License Export of Scrap Ferrous and Non-Ferrous Metals, but Western Markets Still Open 

The Russian government is planning to introduce export licensing for scrap ferrous and non-ferrous metals starting in 2021 in an effort to boost domestic production of base metals. However, industry experts expect Russian scrap metal will still flow into Western markets, especially in Europe.

According to a draft decree published this week, Russia will require export licenses for all scrap ferrous metals like steel and iron, as well as non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, copper, and nickel starting on January 1, 2021. The stated goal of the policy is to ensure sufficient supply of raw materials for Russian metallurgical plants and metal producers. 

Russia is the largest exporter of scrap metals in the world, shipping an estimated 12 million tons in 2019, so the licensing requirement could significantly impact global scrap metal markets. However, analysts say much of the scrap metal will still find its way to foreign buyers, especially in Europe where demand remains high and trade routes are well established.

"Russia has built a scrap industry centered around exports to Europe, so quickly transitioning to domestic customers will be challenging," said Ilya Shiroky, an analyst with the Skolkovo Business School in Moscow. "While this policy might capture more scrap over time, exports to Europe are likely to continue at high levels, especially at first."

European nations like Turkey, Germany, and Italy are major importers of Russian scrap metal to feed their large steelmaking and foundry industries. Alternative sources of scrap are limited, so these European buyers are expected to lobby the Russian government for export licenses and may also be willing to pay higher premiums to continue sourcing Russian scrap.

The new export licensing scheme continues a broader push by the Russian government to curb exports of raw materials in favor of boosting domestic manufacturing. Similar policies have been introduced in recent years for other commodities like timber, gold, and coal. The government is trying to shift the economy away from natural resource extraction toward more advanced production and technology sectors.

However, critics argue these policies often lead to higher costs for domestic manufacturers who rely on imported raw materials. They can also invite retaliatory trade measures from foreign governments whose companies are disadvantaged. There are concerns the scrap metal export limits may end up hurting both Russian and European producers.

Russia's metallurgical sector has been struggling recently, with many steel and aluminum plants operating at a fraction of their capacity. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated these issues, significantly reducing demand and prices for base metals. While the new export licensing policy aims to channel more scrap toward these struggling producers, its ability to revive the industry remains uncertain given the depth of the challenges.

Most experts expect scrap metal will continue flowing out of Russia, even with the new policy. Trade flows are difficult to redirect quickly, and market forces will push scrap toward buyers in need. Russian metallurgic companies will likely rely more on government support and a recovery in metal prices to become the primary customers for the country's ample scrap metal supplies. But a shift away from exports may take years, showing policymakers' good intentions can still be trumped by global market forces.
