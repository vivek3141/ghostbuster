Russia's gold liberalisation unlikely to create "El Dorado of the East" soon, sources say

The Russian government's recent move to liberalise the country's gold market is unlikely to turn it into a global trading hub overnight, according to industry experts. Earlier this month, Russia's central bank announced it would suspend purchasing gold produced from local mines, in a move intended to boost exports. However, significant challenges remain, sources say. 

Russia is home to some of the world's largest gold reserves, estimated at over 2,000 tonnes. For years, the central bank has bought gold from Russian miners to boost its reserves, providing little incentive for miners to export or trade gold externally. By suspending its purchasing program, the central bank hopes Russian gold will instead flow into the global market, establishing Moscow as a major trading hub to rival London or Shanghai.

However, a lack of infrastructure and trading expertise are obstacles to realising this vision in the short term. "Russia lacks a robust physical gold exchange and has limited experience with commodity trading platforms and logistics," said ABC Bullion, a Sydney-based gold dealer. "It will take time to develop liquidity and trading volumes to compete with established hubs."

Legal issues also remain, as limited free market reforms in Russia's formerly communist economy have created uncertainty around property rights and conflict of interest regulations, according to observers. "Corruption and lack of transparency have historically been concerns for foreign investors in Russia's mining sector," noted a report from EFG Associates, a risk consultancy.

Nonetheless, the country's immense gold reserves and significant mining output mean it will likely become an increasingly important player, despite challenges. Russia is the world's third largest gold producer, with output of 314 tonnes in 2016. As the central bank's purchasing program winds down, most or all of this could enter the global market. 

"Over the longer-term, Russia has the potential to develop into one of the most influential gold hubs, given its huge reserves," said Matthew Turner, an analyst at Swiss private bank UBS. "Scaling up its infrastructure and trading expertise will take time, but just diverting a fraction of its annual production into exports should boost its market share."

With political will and further economic reforms, Russia could gradually realise its ambition to develop a major gold trading hub. But overcoming its Soviet legacy in the gold market and building trust with foreign investors will likely take many years. For now at least, Russia's gold liberalisation is unlikely to create an "El Dorado of the East" anytime soon.
