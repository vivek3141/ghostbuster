Aluminium industry doubts Kontsern Alyuminiy's ability to contain output and support world prices

The global aluminium industry has raised doubts about the ability of Russia's Kontsern Alyuminiy, the world's second largest aluminium producer,  to curb its output and support global aluminium prices. Kontsern Alyuminiy announced last week that it would cut its aluminium production by 300,000 metric tons over the next six months in an effort to reduce oversupply in the market and boost declining aluminium prices.

However, analysts and industry executives question whether Kontsern Alyuminiy has the discipline to actually follow through with its production cut promises. “We have seen pledges to cut production from Kontsern Alyuminiy before, only to see them ramp up output again as soon as prices start to recover,” said Mark Hansen, an analyst at Metal Strategies Inc. “There is little reason to believe this time will be any different.”

Kontsern Alyuminiy's aluminium production has grown by over 50% in the last five years to reach its current level of 4.1 million tons. This rapid growth, combined with rising output from Chinese producers, has created overcapacity in the global aluminium market and put downward pressure on prices. Aluminium prices have fallen more than 30% from their peak in 2018 and currently stand near multi-year lows.

Many aluminium buyers and industry executives argue the only way to substantially boost prices from current levels is for Kontsern Alyuminiy to make major cuts to its aluminium production, given its massive influence over the global market. Kontsern Alyuminiy's pledge to cut 300,000 tons of its 4.1 million in total production is seen by many as insufficient to balance the market and drive a price recovery.

“To have a meaningful price impact, Kontsern Alyuminiy would need to cut at least 500,000 tons, if not more,” said Diego Sanchez, an executive at major aluminium consumer Miller Metals. “A smaller cut of 300,000 tons is unlikely to change the overall bearish dynamic in the aluminium market.”

Kontsern Alyuminiy maintains that its planned production cut, though modest, will help stabilise the market and is committed to being disciplined in its production. However, Kontsern Alyuminiy's CEO has signalled a willingness to ramp up production if prices rise too much, highlighting the tensions around production discipline. The aluminium industry will be closely watching Kontsern Alyuminiy's actions over the coming months to see if it follows through with its promises to cut output and help lift the market from its multi-year lows.
