Transneft demands stronger role in proposed new pipeline project 

Russia's state-owned oil pipeline monopoly Transneft is pushing for greater control over a proposed new oil pipeline project called "Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean" (ESPO). The ESPO pipeline is designed to transport Russian oil from Siberia to the Asia-Pacific region, giving Russia greater access to fast-growing Asian markets.

Transneft CEO Nikolay Tokarev has been lobbying the Russian government to give Transneft full ownership and oversight over the ESPO pipeline. Currently, the $26 billion project is overseen by a consortium of Russian energy companies, including Rosneft, Gazprom, and Transneft. Tokarev argues that placing the project under Transneft's sole control would speed up its completion and ensure its success. 

Critics counter that giving Transneft full control over such a strategically and economically vital project only further strengthens the company’s dominance over Russia’s pipeline infrastructure. Transneft already operates over 70,000 km of oil trunk pipelines in Russia, giving it significant influence over the country’s oil exports. Privately, some in the Russian government and energy sector worry that Transneft has become too powerful.

The first phase of the ESPO pipeline came online in 2010, connecting Russian oil fields in Eastern Siberia to refineries in Russia’s Far East. The pipeline’s second phase, scheduled for completion in 2020, will extend the pipeline to Russia’s Pacific coast, enabling Russia to ship more oil to China, Japan, and other Asian markets. 

For Russia, developing energy exports to Asia has become a top priority as relations with the West remain tense. Unable to access Western financing or technology due to sanctions, Russia needs Chinese investment and know-how to develop challenging oil fields in Eastern Siberia and transport that oil to market.
