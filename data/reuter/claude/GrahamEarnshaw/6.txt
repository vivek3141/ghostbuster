Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere Products Co Ltd reports strong interim results as raw material prices drop 

Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere Products Co Ltd, a leading cashmere yarn and garment producer in China, reported strong results for the first half of 2020 driven by lower raw material costs and steady demand.

The company's revenue increased 12% year on year to RMB 5.2 billion in the six months ended June 2020. Net profit rose 23% to RMB 1.1 billion. The gross profit margin expanded 2.6 percentage points to 35% as the average price of cashmere dropped more than 40% from a year ago.

“The global Covid-19 pandemic significantly disrupted economic activity and retail sales in our key export markets in the first quarter,” said Chief Executive Ma Jianwei. “However, we saw a gradual recovery in sales starting from the second quarter, especially for our mid- to high-end products. At the same time, the slump in cashmere prices allowed us to boost profitability.”

Revenue from the cashmere yarn division grew 9.8% in the first half, accounting for 42% of total revenue. Sales of knitted sweaters surged 25% and contributed 34% of revenue. Meanwhile, the apparel unit also delivered 12% revenue growth, making up the remaining 24% of the total.  

Ma expects demand for high-quality cashmere garments to continue recovering in China and overseas markets in the second half of the year. The company will launch more styles adopting trends like vibrant colors and loose-fitting cuts. It is also expanding ecommerce channels to compensate for slower foot traffic in physical stores.  

To meet growing demand, Erdos Cashmere increased inventory of raw materials to over 10,000 tonnes. At the same time, it will control costs through measures like upgrading production facilities. Two new workshops featuring automatic knitting and sewing equipment are expected to start operation before year-end.  

“We are confident the cashmere industry will rebound steadily despite uncertainties ahead,” said Ma. "Erdos Cashmere is well positioned to gain further market share and reinforce our leadership in this sector with a focus on premium products, innovation and an integrated business model."

The company's shares have declined 18% so far this year, valuing the company at RMB 28 billion (USD 4.1 billion). Analysts remain optimistic Erdos Cashmere will deliver on its promise of higher growth and profitability.
