Access to Playboy Website Blocked in China as Internet Use Surges 

The Chinese government has blocked access to the website for Playboy magazine, adding to its extensive censorship of content deemed objectionable. The blocking of Playboy.com comes as China's internet usage continues to soar and the country tightens controls on online content.

According to censorship monitoring groups, Playboy's website was added to China's so-called "Great Firewall" list of banned foreign websites on March 1. Attempts to access Playboy.com from within China are now redirected to a warning page saying the content is prohibited under Chinese law.

The move is the latest in a spate of internet censorship by the Chinese government in recent months covering topics from online criticism of President Xi Jinping to nostalgia for the era preceding Communist rule. Authorities claim such censorship is necessary to maintain "harmony" and restrict access to content that "violates Chinese laws or cultural norms."

Playboy Enterprises, which oversees the iconic brand, said it became aware its flagship website was banned in China earlier this week. A company spokesperson said Playboy was "disappointed" with China's censorship and that the company "believes in the importance of open exchange and reaching mutual understanding through respectful dialogue." The ban, however, is not expected to have a major financial impact as online revenue from China makes up a tiny fraction of Playboy's digital business.

China has had a long and fractious relationship with Playboy magazine. Print editions of Playboy were banned in China after the Communist revolution in 1949 and smuggling the magazine into the country was outlawed. An attempt to launch a Chinese edition of Playboy in 2004 was also swiftly banned after one issue.   

Playboy's website is only the latest foreign media platform to be banned as China's communist leaders reassert strict controls on content that could sway public opinion. The  government has banned such major social media sites as Facebook, Twitter and Google, but homegrown Chinese alternatives thrive, especially the WeChat app with over 1 billion monthly users.
