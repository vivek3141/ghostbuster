Shanghai's Foreign Currency B Share Market Hits Historic Lows and No Recovery Expected Soon

The Shanghai Stock Exchange's B share foreign currency market plunged to historic lows this week with no signs of recovery on the horizon. The B share index, which is denominated in U.S. dollars for foreign investors, dropped over 7% on Tuesday to close below the 500 mark for the first time since its inception in 1992. The index is now down nearly 60% from its peak in 2018 as a slowing Chinese economy, trade tensions with the U.S., and lack of investor confidence continue to batter shares. 

The selloff this week was sparked by new data showing China's exports fell by 3.5% in June, well below expectations of a small increase. It was the latest sign that escalating tariffs by China and the U.S. are damaging trade between the world's two largest economies. The trade war is also exacerbating China's broader economic slowdown, with second quarter GDP growth slowing to 6.2%, the weakest rate in 27 years. As China's economy struggles, corporate profits are under severe pressure, forcing companies to cut jobs and wages.

The gloom has investors fleeing Chinese stocks in droves. Net outflows from China-focused equity funds totaled $3.3 billion in June, the largest monthly withdrawal since late 2018, according to fund tracker EPFR Global. The Shanghai B share market is particularly vulnerable as it mainly consists of state-owned energy, banking and infrastructure companies that foreign investors see as inefficient and lacking transparency. "The B share market has long suffered from a negative perception around lack of reforms and there is very little trust in these companies," said Wang Feng, CEO of Shanghai-based financial services firm Alpha Vision.

Analysts do not foresee a quick turnaround for the battered B share market. "The outlook remains very weak as there are no clear signs the trade war will be resolved soon or that China's economy will rebound strongly," said Iris Chen, a strategist at Beijing consultancy ADMIRE. "It will likely take major progress on trade talks and additional stimulus and reform measures by China to bring back foreign interest, but we're not at that point yet." With no end to headwinds in sight, the historic B share rout may still have further to go.
