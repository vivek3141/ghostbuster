China Signals Growth for Stock and Bond Markets 

China's government today announced several new policies aimed at opening up the country's financial markets to more foreign investment. The moves point to the growing maturity and stability of China's stock and bond markets, as well as a desire for deeper connections to international capital flows.

First, China's securities regulator announced that it would scrap a 20% limit on foreign ownership of Chinese stocks in 2020, a year ahead of schedule. The limit was put in place in 2015 as a way to slow down the pace of foreign inflows into China's stock markets. Lifting the threshold signals confidence in the health and resiliency of Chinese equities. Major global index providers like MSCI and FTSE Russell have signaled the policy move would help pave the way to including more domestically-listed Chinese stocks in their global indexes.

In another sign of market opening, China's central bank governor Yi Gang said China would remove restrictions on foreign investment in Chinese government bonds. Currently, only selective overseas institutions can invest in China's $12 trillion bond market, the third largest in the world. Opening the market to wider foreign participation could attract over $3 trillion of inflows and help China's currency gain more weight in global finance, Yi said in an interview with Bloomberg News today. 

The moves are part of a longer term trend of China easing access to its long-closed financial system. China has made its currency, government bonds, and certain stocks eligible for inclusion in global indexes. It has also steadily increased the quota for foreign investors to enter its markets. For example, China is set to announce a new quota of at least $40 billion for foreign purchases of stocks and bonds, up from $29 billion today, according to people familiar with the matter.

Some analysts, however, remain skeptical about the pace of China's market liberalization. Restrictions and limitations still persist in many areas. Limits on the movements of money in and out of China, as well as hurdles to full foreign control and competition in banking, insurance, and fund management, have been hard to lift given vested local interests. But China's leaders appear determined to make progress toward greater openness to meet demands from investment firms and as part of trade negotiations with the U.S.

Today's policy statements suggest China is pursuing a multipronged effort at financial reform that, while incremental, could reshape its markets in significant ways in the coming years. For global investors and companies, the changes signal expanding opportunities to participate in the world's second largest economy. The doors to China's financial system may still not be fully open, but they are opening wider.
