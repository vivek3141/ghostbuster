China's Metals Futures Trading Should Be Limited to Just One or Two Exchanges Due to Low Trading Volumes

China launched bonded copper, aluminum, zinc and nickel futures contracts over the past few years across three different exchanges - Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE), Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) and Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE). However, trading volumes and open interest in most of these new contracts have remained low, raising questions about whether China's metals futures trading should be concentrated within just one or two exchanges.  

The SHFE copper and aluminum contracts have seen reasonable levels of activity, but volumes in the DCE and ZCE contracts have been a fraction of their SHFE counterparts. The DCE's cobalt and manganese futures, launched in 2018, have also struggled to attract investors and traders. 

Industry participants argue that limiting the number of contracts to the most actively traded ones and merging some exchanges could help address the fragmented liquidity. "Liquidity begets liquidity, so if you concentrate the volume in fewer, larger contracts, it will attract more volume over time," said a Shanghai-based futures broker.

However, exchange competition has also pushed innovation that benefits the market. The launch of new products has given investors and hedgers more choice and helped bring new participants into the market. There are also concerns that a monopoly or duopoly in any market, including exchange-traded futures, could lead to higher trading and clearing fees over the long run.

Regulators aim to balance these factors in determining the ideal structure of China's futures market. For now, "there are no plans to forcefully consolidate China's exchanges or futures contracts," said a government official.  However, some industry insiders believe regulators may still nudge the three exchanges toward greater cooperation and possible mergers if liquidity does not improve substantially and inefficiencies persist.

In the meantime, the exchanges themselves are attempting to address the fragmentation challenge. The SHFE and DCE are discussing ways to cross-list each other's base metals contracts to provide traders with access to the most active contracts through a single trading account and clearing system. Such cooperation, if implemented, could help boost volumes across the board without an outright merger of the two exchanges. Overall, China's metals futures landscape remains in flux and further reforms may be needed to achieve a healthy, liquid market that serves both local and international participants.
