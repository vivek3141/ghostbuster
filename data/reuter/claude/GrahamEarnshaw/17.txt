China's Personal Bank Deposits Growth Slows, Still Poses Inflation Threat, Analysts Say  

The growth of personal bank deposits in China slowed in October, according to data released by China's central bank this week. Deposits in the banking system increased 11.6% in October from a year earlier, down from the 12% rate of increase in September. While the slowdown in deposit growth could help curb lending and cool an overheated property market, analysts warn it could still stoke inflationary pressures if loan growth outpaces deposit growth.  

"The slower deposit growth may restrain loan growth to some extent, but if loan growth continues to significantly outpace deposit growth, it can still pose upward pressure on interest rates and inflation," said David Qu, an economist with Bloomberg Economics in Hong Kong. Loan growth in China picked up to 13.7% in October from 13.5% in September, suggesting demand for borrowing remains robust even as deposit growth moderates.  

China's government has taken several steps recently to slow the growth of lending and reign in rising debt levels, especially in the real estate sector. The housing market has seen strong price appreciation this year, raising fears of a property bubble. Regulators have tightened limits on mortgages and restricted financing to property developers in an effort to cool the market.  

While a slowdown in deposit growth could curb lending and support these efforts, a widening gap between loan and deposit growth risks fueling inflation and financial instability. Banks have to offer higher interest rates to attract more deposits, which they then pass on to borrowers through higher lending rates. This can drive up overall interest rates in the economy and squeeze corporate profit margins.  

"Should the divergence between credit and deposit growth widen further, it would translate to rising funding costs for banks and tighter liquidity conditions, even as risks of higher inflation and financial instability rise," said Wen Bin, an analyst at China Minsheng Bank.

Regulators face a difficult balancing act, trying to slow the property market and control debt levels without overly restricting access to credit and damaging economic growth. The economy expanded 4.9% in the third quarter, slowing from 7.9% growth last year. Most analysts expect growth will continue to moderate into next year. While pockets of risk remain, the overall slowdown in deposit growth last month suggests China's macro leverage may have started to stabilize, according to some economistsâ€”a positive sign for the country's ongoing deleveraging effort. But inflation risks continue to lurk as long as China's insatiable demand for loans outpaces the growth of deposits.
