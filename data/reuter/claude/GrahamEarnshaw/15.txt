China Launches First Major Shipping Exchange in Shanghai 

China opened its first major shipping exchange in Shanghai this week, aiming to gain more control over global shipping prices and challenge established hubs in London and Singapore.

The Shanghai Shipping Exchange commenced trading on Monday with two dry bulk commodity contracts - BFIX, tracking the Baltic Exchange's main sea freight index, and SCFI, Shanghai's containerized freight index. Additional contracts for tankers and liquefied natural gas carriers are expected to launch in the coming months.

China is the world's largest exporter and a massive consumer of raw materials, so it has long wanted to exert more influence on freight rates for the ships carrying its goods. Chinese policymakers believe that launching an exchange in Shanghai, the world's largest port, will help shift trading activity away from what it sees as dollar-centric exchanges in London and Singapore.

“We will strengthen price discovery and risk management functions in the maritime sector, support the Belt and Road initiative, and help build Shanghai into an international shipping hub,” said Li Shaohua, president of the Shanghai Shipping Exchange. The Belt and Road initiative refers to Beijing's policy of building infrastructure connecting China by land and sea to Europe, Africa, and beyond.

Trading volumes on the first day reached nearly 3 million tons, a "great start," according to exchange officials. Major Chinese shipping companies and international traders participated, including state giants COSCO Shipping, Sinotrans & CSC, and Bright Shipping. The exchange currently has 58 members.

The launch of the Shanghai Shipping Exchange underscores China's ambition to exert control and gain pricing power over the global shipping trade networks that its massive export economy depends on. However, some analysts are skeptical that China can quickly displace established exchanges that have built up liquidity and trust over decades of trading.
