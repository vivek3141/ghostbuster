Shanghai Film Studio fights back against movie distributor Yongle in cinema chain war 

Shanghai Film Studio, one of China's leading film production companies, announced today that it will restrict the release of its upcoming summer blockbusters to rival cinema chain Wanda Cinemas. The move is seen as a retaliation against Yongle Group, China's second-largest cinema chain operator, in an ongoing dispute over revenue sharing.

Yongle Group, which controls nearly 5,000 screens across China, had demanded an increase in the share of ticket revenues that go to the cinema chain, a practice known as "box office split." Most cinemas in China operate on a 50-50 split of ticket revenue with film studios and distributors. Yongle is asking Shanghai Film Studio for a 60-40 split in Yongle's favor for the studio's upcoming slate of films. 

Shanghai Film Studio rejected the demand and broke off negotiations with Yongle last month. In response, Yongle imposed limits on the number of screens and showtimes it would give to Shanghai Film Studio's current releases. The actions caused ticket sales and box office revenues to drop significantly for those films.

The studio’s decision to grant Wanda Cinemas exclusive access to its new films this summer aims to hit back at Yongle in the wallet. Two highly-anticipated blockbusters—action thriller "Fire Storm" and romance "My Heart Will Go On"—will premiere exclusively on Wanda's nearly 10,000 screens next month. Wanda Cinemas operates on a traditional 50-50 revenue split, making it an attractive partner for the studio.

Industry analysts say Shanghai Film Studio's move is risky but necessary to curb the growing power of Yongle Group. "If the studio continued to bend to Yongle's demands, it may have set a precedent for other cinema chains to follow," said Wang Tao, a media analyst at Beijing Normal University. "Their blockbuster films are a crucial bargaining chip, so releasing them exclusively with a cooperative partner like Wanda sends an important message."

However, some worry that limiting films to a single cinema chain will inconvenience audiences and reduce potential ticket sales and profits overall. There are also concerns of possible state intervention if the dispute begins to seriously impact China's booming movie industry.

Shanghai Film Studio and Yongle Group did not respond to requests for comment. The studio's "Fire Storm" and "My Heart Will Go On" are scheduled for release nationally in China on July 15 exclusively on Wanda Cinemas screens.
