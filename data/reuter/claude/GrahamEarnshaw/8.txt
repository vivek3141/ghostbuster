China's State Debt Becomes Top Investment Choice Among Local Investors in 1996, Analysts Call for Further Reforms

Investors in China flocked to government debt in 1996, pushing yields to historic lows as markets grew increasingly confident in China's economic prospects and reform agenda. According to data from the China Central Depository & Clearing Co., Chinese investors purchased a record $420 billion of government bonds in local currency last year, more than double the amount in 1995.

The surging demand has pushed yields on China's 10-year government bonds down to 3.67%, the lowest level since the bonds were first issued in 1981. While the low yields mean investors are earning a lower return, many see government debt as a safe place to put their money amid volatility in China's stock markets and concerns over the health of the banking system. China's economy grew at a steady clip of just over 9% last year, helping bolster confidence. 

"Government bonds are the only truly risk-free investments in China right now," said Wang Feng, an economist at Beijing Normal University. "With the stock market gyrations and risks in the banking sector, many investors are opting for the safety and security of government debt."

The surge in demand for government bonds comes as China is working to develop and open its financial markets. China released a blueprint in 1993 to gradually open its domestic bond market to foreign investors to help keep interest rates low and fund its economic growth. China began by first allowing in major global institutions, but has slowly expanded access to attract more foreign capital.

However, some analysts argue that more needs to be done to strengthen China's bond markets, including better pricing mechanisms to attract foreign investors and discourage speculation. China also needs to improve market transparency and loosen capital controls to enable the free flow of funds in and out of its financial markets.   

"While we have come a long way in developing China's government debt market, more wholesale reforms are still needed for it to reach its full potential," said Jing Ulrich, managing director at J.P. Morgan Chase in Hong Kong. "Pricing of bonds should be determined more by market forces, not administrative measures. Allowing free exchange of Chinese yuan for foreign currencies would also help support more robust trading."

The calls for reform come as China's debt levels have risen sharply in recent years. Total debt in China stood at 260% of GDP in 2018, up from just 140% a decade earlier. The increase has raised fears China's debt mountain could trigger a financial crisis, though Beijing has pledged to gradually deleverage its economy.

"China's debt build-up, especially in the corporate sector, is unsustainable," said Charlene Chu, head of Autonomous Research Asia. "While government debt may be popular with investors now, the risk is that private debt eventually spills into public balance sheets. More needs to be done soon to defuse the debt bomb."

The surging demand for government bonds shows China has no shortage of funds as it looks to restructure its economy to one more dependent on domestic consumption rather than exports. Analysts say further market reforms to attract foreign capital and strengthen pricing mechanisms are critical to help China reach the next stage of development. While government debt may be in demand now thanks to China's strong economy and low default risk, investor preference can change quickly. Additional steps to prevent market volatility and speculative behavior are still needed.
