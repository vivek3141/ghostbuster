Chinese Textile Companies Unfazed by Threat of Sino-U.S. Trade War 

The rising tensions in the ongoing trade war between China and the United States do not seem to be dampening spirits in China's massive textile industry. Chinese textile companies and industry groups report that business continues as usual despite the looming threat of increased tariffs on Chinese goods imported to the U.S.

"We are used to ups and downs and uncertainties in the global economy," said Wang Jian, President of the China National Textile and Apparel Council. "While we hope the trade issues can be resolved through constructive dialogue, our industry will remain competitive based on high quality and innovation, not low prices."

The textile industry is a pillar of China's economy, employing over 10 million workers and accounting for 2 percent of the nation's GDP. More than a third of China's textile exports by value are sold in the U.S., so tariffs would likely impact the industry. However, the ongoing trade war may be seen as a bump in the road compared to other challenges the industry has faced, including rising labor and materials costs as well as industrial overcapacity.

"Any impact will be felt across our supply chain, but the key for us is to focus on producing high-end and technical fabrics where China has gained a competitive advantage, rather than compete on price alone," said Zhang Xia, CEO of Jiangsu Fuhua Textile Co. Her company produces synthetic and blended yarns and fabrics used in sportswear and functional clothing. Like many producers, they have invested in new capital equipment and technical expertise to produce specialized fabrics less vulnerable to tariff impacts.  

The U.S. has already imposed 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and threatened additional 25 percent tariffs. In response, China has put in place retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. imports. Despite multiple rounds of trade talks, the world's two largest economies have yet to reach a resolution. 

While clothing brands and retailers in the U.S. and internationally may need to find new sourcing options if tariffs impact costs significantly, the overall sentiment in China's textile sector appears to remain optimistic in the face of a trade war that shows no signs of abating soon. With a large domestic market and government support for upgrading its manufacturing base, China's textile industry seems positioned to navigate through the turbulence ahead.
