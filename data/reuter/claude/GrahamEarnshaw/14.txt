China Set to Allow Foreign Banks Shortlisted for Local Renminbi Currency Business  

China's central bank announced today that it will soon allow foreign banks operating in China to provide renminbi currency services to local companies and individuals. The People's Bank of China released a list of 10 foreign banks that have been shortlisted to conduct renminbi business, including HSBC, Standard Chartered, Citibank, and Deutsche Bank.  

The move is seen as an important step in China's efforts to open up its financial sector and make the renminbi a global currency. By allowing major foreign banks to offer renminbi services like deposits, loans, and remittances, China can increase the circulation and use of its currency outside the country. At present, the vast majority of renminbi transactions occur only within China.  

According to a statement by the central bank, the foreign banks were selected based on several criteria, including their business scale and experience in China, financial strength, and commitment to the Chinese market. The shortlisted banks have been operating in China for many years and already handle foreign currency transactions. They will now be able to provide renminbi services to Chinese companies involved in international trade as well as retail customers.  

Analysts say China is strategically and gradually opening its financial markets to foreign players to gain more clout on the global stage. The renminbi was added to the International Monetary Fund's basket of reserve currencies in 2016, demonstrating its rising prominence as a global currency. But its international usage is still very limited compared to stalwarts like the U.S. dollar. By leveraging the global networks of major foreign banks, China can accelerate renminbi adoption worldwide.  

The announcement is the latest in a string of measures taken by China to open its banking and financial sectors, which have long been dominated by state-owned companies. However, foreign banks will face various challenges in capturing market share from entrenched local competitors. Some argue that China needs to further relax restrictions on foreign ownership and ease limits on renminbi flows across its borders to truly internationalize its currency. Overall though, the move is a step forward in China's financial liberalization and renminbi ambitions.
