Chinese authorities turn a blind eye to booming illegal trade in foreign currency B shares

By Your Assistant 

China's strict capital controls have created a booming black market for foreigners to speculate in Chinese stocks. The trade in so-called "foreign currency B shares" has exploded in recent years, even as regulators turn a blind eye to the illegal activity.

The B share market allows foreign investors to buy and trade stocks of Chinese companies listed on mainland exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen. However, foreigners are only allowed to trade B shares using approved foreign currencies like US dollars. It is illegal for Chinese citizens to buy or sell B shares.

However, a thriving underground market has emerged where Chinese investors buy and sell foreign access to B share accounts. Estimates indicate tens of billions of dollars in illegal trades are conducted each year. The trades often happen in chat groups on Chinese messaging apps like WeChat, where Chinese investors can connect with foreigners and take control of their B share trading accounts. The Chinese investors front the capital and assume the risks, hoping to profit from price differences between Chinese A shares and the B share market.

Regulators appear to tolerate the underground B share market, even as they tighten other controls. "There is a tacit understanding that as long as the activity does not threaten financial stability or enable large-scale capital flight, it will be permitted,‚Äù said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research. The illegal B share trading also provides extra liquidity to the market and pricing information to investors, regulators, and companies. 

Amid a broader economic slowdown, the underground B share market has become an important channel for Chinese investors to speculate and diversify their portfolios. The activity highlights the inconsistent regulation of China's financial system, where controls are tight in some areas but lax in others. As long as that remains the case, the booming shadow market for B shares will likely continue to thrive.
