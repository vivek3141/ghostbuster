Shanghai to Rent Out Historic Hongkong & Shanghai Bank Building on the Bund to Unnamed Bank

The Shanghai municipal government announced today that it will rent out the historic Hongkong & Shanghai Bank building on the city's famous Bund riverfront area to an unspecified foreign bank. The neoclassical building, with its iconic domed clocktower, has long been a symbol of Shanghai's colonial history as a major international port in the 19th and 20th centuries. 

The building was constructed in 1923 to serve as the headquarters of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, one of the most prominent British banks of that era. Designed by renowned British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, the building features Italian marble floors, vaulted ceilings, and a spectacular central atrium. For decades, it stood as a monument to the economic power and global reach of British corporations in China.

In the 1950s, after the Communist takeover of Shanghai, the building was used for a variety of municipal government offices and cultural organizations. More recently, the bottom two floors have housed restaurants, bars, and boutiques, while the top floors remained empty. The municipal government took full control of the building in the 1990s.

According to Shanghai city officials, a long-term lease for the majority of the building has now been awarded to an undisclosed foreign bank. The officials declined to reveal the identity of the bank or the terms of the deal, though sources with knowledge of the negotiations suggested it would be a multi-year lease for most of the office space in the building. The restaurants and shops on the bottom floors will reportedly remain in place.

Some historic preservationists have expressed concern about potential renovations to the building that could compromise its architectural integrity. However, Shanghai city officials promised that they would require any changes to respect and maintain the building's historic design and character. Still, the transition of this landmark from public to private hands marks another step in Shanghai's modern evolution as a global financial center. For longtime Shanghainese, it is the end of an era for a building that was once a symbol of the city's British imperial heritage. For newcomers, it could be just the beginning of a new chapter.
