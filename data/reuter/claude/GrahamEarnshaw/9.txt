China to Allow Convertible Bonds to Help Companies Raise Funds  

The China Securities Regulatory Commission announced today that China will allow domestic companies to issue convertible bonds as a way to raise additional funding. Convertible bonds are bonds that can be converted into stock, allowing investors to participate in the company's equity.

The move is aimed at helping Chinese companies access more financing channels at a time when economic growth is slowing. The convertible bond market could provide hundreds of billions of dollars of new funding for companies.

"Allowing convertible bonds will enrich the multi-level capital market system in China and meet the financing needs of innovative companies," the regulator said in a statement. 

China's economy has faced challenges in recent years from rising debt levels, trade tensions with the United States, and most recently the global coronavirus pandemic. The economy contracted by 6.8% in the first quarter of 2020 compared with a year earlier, the first decline since 1992.

To help boost growth, China has stepped up support for private companies and eased regulations in some sectors. Allowing convertible bonds is the latest in a series of measures aimed at channeling more money to industries such as technology that China sees as a driver of future growth.

Convertible bonds allow companies to raise funds from investors with the option for investors to convert the bonds into stock, typically at a fixed price. That gives investors the opportunity to benefit if the company's share price rises. However, investors can also hold onto the bonds and earn interest payments.

For companies, convertible bonds provide a cheaper source of funding than issuing stocks. They also avoid the dilution of existing shareholders that would come from issuing a large amount of new stock. The bonds often appeal more to overseas investors and can diversify a company's investor base.

Regulators will review and approve convertible bond offerings to ensure companies meet financial requirements. The bonds will trade on China's over-the-counter New Third Board for small and medium-sized companies. China launched the board in 2013 to provide funding for emerging firms that weren't yet ready or eager to list on the country's main stock exchanges.
