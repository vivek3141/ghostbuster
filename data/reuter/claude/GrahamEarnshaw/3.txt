China's Efforts to Push Domestic Investors Out of B Share Markets Fail, but Volumes Decrease Significantly  

China's attempts to eliminate domestic investors from its dollar-denominated China B share markets have largely failed, but trading volumes on the exchanges have plummeted nevertheless. 

Earlier this year, Chinese regulators announced new rules barring domestic investors from opening new B share accounts and restricting existing domestic B share investors to selling their holdings. The goal was to transform the B share markets into exclusive enclaves for foreign investors in China. 

However, many domestic investors have managed to continue trading on the B share markets by opening accounts in the names of relatives and friends or using existing accounts, according to interviews with more than a dozen domestic fund managers and individual investors. Regulators have found it difficult to enforce the new rules rigorously given the large number of existing accounts and opaque ownership of some accounts.

Still, trading volumes on the Shanghai and Shenzhen B share markets have dropped precipitously, by as much as 50-70% from peaks, as some domestic investors have pulled out and foreign interest remains limited. The Shanghai B share index is down 15% year to date. 

"The regulators have failed to achieve their goal of fully excluding domestic investors, but they have succeeded in seriously damaging the B share markets," said Zhu Jianfang, an economist at Beijing Normal University. "It's a clumsy solution that helps no one."

Some analysts argue that China would do better to scrap its B share program altogether. The separate share classes are a relic of an era when authorities believed domestic and foreign investors should be segregated. Most major economies today have unified share structures giving all investors equal access. 

Unifying the A share and B share markets could boost volumes, increase foreign access in a controlled way, and simplify China's convoluted share system, which includes multiple separate boards for technology companies, small companies and other sectors. However, complete unification remains a long-term goal, if it happens at all, given political sensitivities.

In the meantime, foreign interest in B shares remains muted despite regulators' efforts to lure more foreign capital. Overseas investors own less than 10% of China's B shares by market value, preferring the larger A share markets and offshore listings like Hong Kong's H-share market. The dull performance of B share indexes has also discouraged some foreign funds.  

Until China takes more meaningful steps to fully open its capital markets and consolidate its share structures, the B share markets are likely to continue struggling with low interest and volumes. For now, Chinese domestic speculators remain a reluctant backbone of two markets the regulators had hoped to do without.
