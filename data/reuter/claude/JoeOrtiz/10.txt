Serious Fraud Office Yet to Contact Securities Houses in Eurotunnel Share Investigation

The Serious Fraud Office in the UK has yet to contact any of the major securities houses involved in the underwriting of Eurotunnel shares ahead of the company’s flotation in 1995. Sources close to the SFO investigation into alleged irregularities around the initial public offering have confirmed that investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Barclays Capital have not received any requests for information or documentation related to their roles in the IPO. 

The SFO launched an investigation into Eurotunnel last October to examine whether there were any fraudulent activities involved in the company’s shares being overvalued at the time of its market listing in 1995. Eurotunnel raised £5.6 billion in its IPO but within a few months the company’s shares had plunged as it became clear that revenue forecasts were overoptimistic. The SFO is looking into whether share prices were artificially inflated.

However, despite the investigation ongoing for five months now, none of the investment banks involved in underwriting Eurotunnel shares or advising the company have received contact from the SFO. Sources at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley confirmed that they have had “no request for any details” regarding their role in the IPO. Barclays Capital, the UK bank involved in the offering, also said they have had “no communication whatsoever” from the SFO.

Lawyers acting for some shareholders involved in a long-running lawsuit against Eurotunnel expressed surprise at the lack of contact with underwriters. A partner at a leading London law firm said, “It’s strange that the SFO have not yet asked questions of the banks. They were intimately involved at the time and likely have access to documents and records that could shed light on share pricing and valuation methods.” The SFO has not commented on its lines of inquiry in the ongoing investigation.

The lack of engagement with investment banks has raised questions over how vigorously the SFO is pursuing the Eurotunnel case. However, the agency has secured convictions in a number of high-profile cases in recent years, including the convictions of former executives at outsourcer G4S and industrial giant Rolls-Royce. The SFO may be adopting a “softly, softly” approach to the Eurotunnel case before approaching the underwriters. For now though, the securities houses at the heart of the IPO remain outside the scope of the fraud investigation that they themselves were so central to 24 years ago.
