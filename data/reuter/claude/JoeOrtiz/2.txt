Eurotunnel announces debt restructuring deal giving creditor banks 45.5% ownership  

Eurotunnel, the operator of the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France, announced on Tuesday an agreement with its creditor banks to restructure its debt and give the banks ownership of 45.5% of the company. The deal, worth over £1 billion, will eliminate billions in debt and interest payments, stabilizing Eurotunnel's finances after years of losses and providing a platform for future growth.

Under the agreement, eighteen banks including Barclays, BNP Paribas, and Deutsche Bank, will swap much of the money owed to them by Eurotunnel for shares in the company. The restructuring will reduce Eurotunnel's debt by two thirds, from £3.2 billion to £1.2 billion. The banks will now own 45.5% of Eurotunnel shares. Existing shareholders, including chief executive Jacques Gounon, will see their stakes diluted but will maintain a majority 54.5% ownership in the company.  

Eurotunnel has faced significant financial difficulties since it opened the Channel Tunnel in 1994. The ambitious project cost 80% more than forecast and took six years longer to build. Despite increasing traffic and revenues, Eurotunnel continued to lose money due to huge interest payments on its debts. The restructuring agreement provides relief from these interest charges and gives Eurotunnel an opportunity to finally turn a profit.

"We are delighted to have reached this agreement which provides a sustainable capital structure for Eurotunnel and will enable the company to achieve its full operational and commercial potential," said Jacques Gounon. The company expects the restructuring to be complete within four months, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.

Eurotunnel operates the Channel Tunnel high-speed rail link between Britain and France. The 50 kilometer tunnel, the longest undersea tunnel in the world, allows for passenger and freight rail travel between the UK and continental Europe. With over 21 million passengers and 1.6 million trucks transported since opening, the Channel Tunnel has become a crucial transportation link, but financial troubles have threatened its stability in recent years. The debt restructuring agreement announced today provides Eurotunnel with a lifeline to continue operating this vital connection between Britain and France.
