Building Society Plans for Stock Market Flotations Thrown into Jeopardy by Draft Legislation on Takeover Protection 

Several leading UK building societies have put their plans for stock market flotations on hold due to draft legislation that would make it more difficult for them to be taken over. The legislation, currently under consultation, aims to strengthen takeover protections for building societies to ensure they retain their mutual status. However, the building societies argue this reduces their appeal to public investors and flexibility to consider future M&A options.

Nationwide, the UK's largest building society, and Leeds Building Society have been exploring initial public offerings to raise funds to invest in technology and growth. However, they have paused their IPO preparations until the implications of the draft legislation become clearer. The legislation would require a minimum of 75% of building society members to approve a takeover bid before it could proceed, up from the current 50% threshold. It would also give regulators more power to block demutualization and takeovers that are not in members' interests.  

While welcomed by building society members and consumer groups, the draft law sends a "confusing message to markets," according to Nationwide's CEO. He argues it reduces building societies' flexibility to consider future strategic options and could lower their value, making it harder to raise equity capital. Leeds Building Society's CEO said the society will assess the new rules carefully but expects them to affect its IPO plans. "There is little point pursuing a flotation if we will be left with one hand tied behind our back," she said.

However, supporters counter that the new rules simply reinforce building societies' mutual model and purpose. "Demutualization should always be an absolute last resort, not a fast track to raising capital or executive windfalls," said the head of the Building Societies Members Association. He argued that societies have other options to raise funds, such as issuing bonds or securitizing mortgage assets. 

Consumer advocates also back the legislation, citing cases where building societies have been demutualized to the detriment of members. "It is important that societies cannot be picked off easily by venture capitalists looking to make a quick profit," said the chief of Toynbee Hall, a consumer advocacy group.

The consultation on the draft law closes next month. If passed, the new rules will present another hurdle for any building society still aspiring to raise public funds through a stock market listing. For most, the mutual model continues to be the most compatible with their purpose and values. But strengthened protections may come at the cost of flexibility, and societies will have to balance their membersâ€™ interests with their future strategic and investment needs.
