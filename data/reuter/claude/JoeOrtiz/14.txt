NatWest Markets Appoints Peter Hall as COO Amid Questions Over Bank's Strategy  

NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of Royal Bank of Scotland, has appointed Peter Hall as its new chief operating officer. Hall joins NatWest Markets from Deutsche Bank, where he has served as the COO for corporate and investment banking since 2016. The appointment comes at a crucial time as NatWest Markets attempts to turn around its struggling operations and define a coherent strategy.

NatWest Markets has had a tumultuous few years, posting significant losses in some quarters and undergoing restructuring. It sold off parts of its equities business and cut jobs in an attempt to streamline operations. However, the division still lacks direction, according to some analysts. “There are still big questions about what exactly the strategy is for NatWest Markets,” said Julian Chillingworth, chief investment officer at Rathbone Investment Management. “It’s a work in progress and there’s still uncertainty about what businesses they want to focus on.”  

The appointment of Hall is aimed at providing operational expertise and leadership to help turn the division around. As COO of Deutsche Bank’s corporate and investment bank, Hall oversaw technology, change management and cost-cutting initiatives. He has a track record of driving efficiency gains and helping define business strategy. “Peter's experience of improving business performance and optimising operations will be invaluable as we continue to strengthen NatWest Markets,” said NatWest Markets CEO Robert Begbie.

However, some analysts argue that an operational leader is not enough and that NatWest Markets needs strategic direction and a clear vision from the top. “The COO role will help ensure the trains run on time but doesn’t solve the bigger question of where those trains are headed,” said John Cronin, head of UK financials at Goodbody Stockbrokers. “There are still doubts about the long-term future and viability of NatWest Markets that need to be addressed by CEO Begbie and [RBS CEO] Alison Rose.”  

NatWest Markets will report its full-year 2019 results next week, which will provide an update on its turnaround progress so far and potentially add more details on its forward strategy. The division will be hoping Hall’s appointment, along with other recent top hires, will provide momentum to its transformation efforts. But until a coherent vision for NatWest Markets emerges, questions will remain over its future direction and prospects.
