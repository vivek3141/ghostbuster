Major Banks Jockey for Position in Emerging Private Banking Super-League 

The world's largest banks are engaged in an intense competition to establish leadership in the fast-growing market for private banking services for the ultra-wealthy, according to sources in the banking industry. Private banking provides specialized wealth management services including investment advice, tax planning, and lending to wealthy individuals.  

Global wealth is growing rapidly, especially in Asia and other emerging markets. There are over 200,000 ultra-high net worth individuals in the world today with over $30 million in assets, and their numbers are climbing by about 6-7% per year according to an analysis by Boston Consulting Group. The total wealth held by this group now exceeds $30 trillion and is expected to grow to over $50 trillion by 2022.

Seeing the opportunity, major banks like UBS, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, HSBC, and BNP Paribas have been investing heavily in recruiting top private bankers, developing exclusive products and services for high net worth clients, and enhancing their digital private banking platforms. “The competition for private banking supremacy has never been as intense as today,” said George Kyriacou, a partner with management consultancy Oliver Wyman. “The winners in this race will be the banks that can attract and retain the best talent, build the deepest relationships with their clients, and hone a cutting edge in digital and client experience.”

UBS, the world’s largest wealth manager, recently lured a top executive from HSBC to lead its key private banking arm in Asia and combined its private bank and asset management divisions under one executive, Suni Hartford. Not to be outdone, Credit Suisse just hired a senior private banker from Deutsche Bank to head its ultra-high net worth division in Hong Kong. JP Morgan is combining its private bank, asset management, and corporate and investment bank into one unit led by Mary Erdoes to provide “holistic” wealth management to its richest clients.  

While this battle for supremacy is most intense in Asia and other fast-growing regions, the European private banking market remains crucial given the large concentration of wealth. Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse currently dominate the sector, but are facing major challenges from French and other European banks aiming for increased market share in their backyard. 

Wealthy individuals today have more options than ever, from independent financial advisors to online robo-advisors to family offices. But for banks that can provide highly personalized, sophisticated advice and solutions, the potential rewards of leadership in this new private banking super-league are substantial. The banks that emerge dominant will gain greater scale, deeper relationships with the world’s wealthiest families, and the expertise and earnings power to compete in the coming era of digital, AI-enhanced private banking. The race is on.
