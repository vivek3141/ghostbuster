Former Barings Executive Ron Baker Denies Lawsuit by ING Barings Over Alleged Loan Repayment

Former Barings investment banking executive Ron Baker denied allegations yesterday that he defaulted on a £1.5 million loan issued by Barings Bank in 1991. ING Barings, the successor to Barings Bank, filed a lawsuit against Baker in London's High Court on Monday claiming that he failed to repay the 30-year loan they issued to him during his time as an executive at the venerable British financial institution. 

Baker left Barings in 1992 and the loan came due for full repayment in 2021. According to court filings, ING Barings alleges that Baker missed the deadline to repay the loan in full and they are now seeking the principal amount owed plus interest, which amounts to £3.2 million.

In a written statement, a spokesperson for Baker said "Mr. Baker vehemently denies ING's claim that he defaulted on the loan or failed to communicate with them regarding repayment terms." Baker maintains that he negotiated a repayment extension with Barings that pushed the loan term to 2031. The spokesperson said Baker has correspondence and other documentation proving the extended term.

ING Barings acknowledged that there were discussions around potentially extending the loan but that no formal modification agreement was ever executed. "While we aim to work constructively with all clients, the fact remains that Mr. Baker failed to honor the terms of the original loan contract despite multiple reminders," an ING Barings spokesperson said.

The case is poised to become a contentious legal battle between the former star banker and the bank that originally bet on his success. Baker worked at Barings from 1986 to 1992, helping to build its Hong Kong and Singapore investment banking operations. He resigned from the bank in 1992 following a reorganization of its Asia Pacific business. 

Baker went on to found Greencrest Capital, a Hong Kong-based investment fund, and built a reputation as a savvy investor in Asian markets. ING Barings took control of Barings Bank following its collapse in 1995 due to unauthorized trading losses in Singapore. The Dutch financial firm purchased Barings Bank for a nominal fee of £1 and has since absorbed it into its ING banking division.

The High Court trial is scheduled to proceed in April 2021. Both sides have pledged to vigorously argue their positions in court. Regardless of the outcome, the case promises to dredge up memories of an era when flashy young financiers like Baker dominated the high-flying worlds of investment banking and private equity. The court's decision is sure to be closely watched in London's banking circles.
