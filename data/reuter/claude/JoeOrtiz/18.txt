Chancellor of the Exchequer Phases Out Tax Relief on Profit Related Pay Schemes  

The Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced today in his annual budget speech to Parliament that the tax relief on profit related pay schemes will be phased out over the next three years. The move is expected to save the Treasury over £2 billion per year when fully implemented.

Profit related pay schemes, where employees receive bonuses based on company performance, have benefited from income tax relief when contributions are made by employers. The tax relief meant that employees could receive bonuses tax-free up to £3,600 per year. The Chancellor argued that in a time of fiscal constraint, the cost to the public of these tax reliefs could no longer be justified. However, business groups have criticized the move, saying it will hamper companies’ ability to incentivize and reward high performing staff.  

The changes will be phased in over the next three tax years. In the first year, the tax-free limit will be reduced to £2,000, then £1,000 the following year, before being abolished completely by 2020. All profit related pay over these limits will be subject to standard income tax rates. The Treasury estimates that around 3 million employees in the UK benefit from these tax relief schemes through bonus payments and share option plans. While the changes will not affect basic salary or wages, it may prompt some companies to reconsider their bonus structures to compensate for the increased tax burden.

The head of the Confederation of British Industry said the changes were a "kick in the teeth" for companies trying to grow in a difficult economic climate. However, the Chancellor said that profit related pay schemes disproportionately benefited higher earners, and the money saved would be better spent on public services and business tax cuts for small firms. The changes to tax relief on bonuses are set to come into effect at the start of the 2018 tax year. All eyes will now be on how companies and employees adapt to the impending changes over the next several years.
