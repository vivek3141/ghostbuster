Royal Bank of Scotland Reports Higher Pre-Tax Profits, But Not As Much As Expected 

The Royal Bank of Scotland announced higher pre-tax profits today, but the numbers fell short of analyst expectations. In the first half of 2019, the bank reported pre-tax profits of £2.7 billion, up from £2.4 billion during the same period last year. However, analysts had forecast pre-tax profits of £3.1 billion for the first half of the year.

RBS, which is still 62% owned by the UK government after being bailed out during the financial crisis, attributed the profit growth to improving economic conditions in the UK. Loan impairments declined by nearly £1 billion compared to last year, reflecting the stronger economy and higher employment. Net income rose 3% to £8.6 billion. 

However, ongoing economic and political uncertainty related to Brexit weighed on the bank's performance and outlook. RBS set aside an additional £1.2 billion in the quarter to account for potential losses from bad loans if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal. The Brexit contingencies reduced RBS's profits for the quarter.

The bank's core businesses remained stable but lacked momentum. Personal and business banking profits edged up 2%, while commercial banking profits declined 2% from higher costs. The bank's investment arm, NatWest Markets, returned to profitability with pre-tax profits of £126 million. But that figure missed estimates of £211 million, and the unit continues to struggle with lackluster trading volumes and income.

CEO Ross McEwan described the results as “solid” given the challenging environment. However, he warned that the outlook for the economy and interest rates had weakened since the start of the year. “The Brexit process is creating economic uncertainty which is dampening growth,” McEwan said. The CEO called for a clear Brexit resolution to support business confidence and the bank's performance.

With Brexit uncertainty likely to persist in the coming months, analysts don't expect RBS's results to improve much in the latter part of 2019. However, if the UK can finalize a smooth exit from the EU, the bank would be well positioned to benefit from any post-Brexit economic recovery with its strong balance sheet and market position. For now though, challenging market conditions and unresolved Brexit risks are hampering the government's plans to reinstate dividend payments and sell off more of its remaining stake in RBS.
