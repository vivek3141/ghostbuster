British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke considers cutting tax credits on dividends in budget speech 

The British Chancellor Kenneth Clarke signaled that he may cut tax credits given to shareholders on dividend income in his budget speech next month. In an interview with the Financial Times, Clarke said the generous tax treatment of dividends, where shareholders receive a tax credit of 10% of the dividend that reduces their income tax bill, is “indefensible” and costs the government over £6 billion per year.

Clarke argued that the tax credit primarily benefits higher rate taxpayers, with nearly two-thirds of the total tax relief going to the top 10% of income earners. “It's very difficult to find a moral justification for people earning over £150,000 per year receiving dividend tax relief from the government,” Clarke said. He proposed either cutting the tax credit in half to 5% or eliminating it altogether for higher rate taxpayers. The move could raise between £3 to 6 billion annually that Clarke said would be used to fund a small cut in capital gains tax to spur business investment.

The potential cut in dividend tax relief is proving controversial and divisive. Many small business groups argue that it will hit entrepreneurship by reducing the returns for business owners and investors. However, critics argue the current system disproportionately favors wealthy individuals and the funds would be better spent on targeted tax cuts for small businesses. The opposition Labour party broadly supports reforming dividend tax relief but argues the funds should instead be used to reverse cuts to welfare benefits.

Clarke will announce the final budget measures on March 11. He aims to raise government revenue and cut the deficit but faces pressure from Conservative backbenchers to avoid tax increases. Changing dividend tax credits allows Clarke to raise substantial revenue from a single measure that he believes is hard to defend, providing more flexibility to meet deficit targets and fund new tax cuts before the next general election. However, he faces opposition both within his own party and from business groups that will argue any rise in taxes on investment and business ownership will damage economic growth in the UK.
