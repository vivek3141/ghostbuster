Land Securities sees signs of rental growth in UK property market 

Land Securities, the UK’s largest listed commercial property company, said it is seeing signs of rental growth in some parts of the market as demand for office space picks up.

The company said office rents rose 2.2% in central London in the six months to September, compared with a year earlier, driven by a rebound in demand for high-quality space. Rents for retail units also increased 1.9% on average over the same period.

Robert Noel, chief executive of Land Securities, said: “It’s encouraging to see rents recovering in parts of our portfolio, demonstrating the appeal of prime space where we have invested significantly over recent years.”

The update from Land Securities provides further evidence the UK commercial property market is stabilizing after being hit hard by the pandemic. However, the recovery remains uneven, with parts of central London and retail destinations outside the capital continuing to struggle with excess supply.

Land Securities said the value of its central London office portfolio declined 2% in the six months to September compared with a decline of 4.2% reported in March. A 4% drop in retail asset values over the period partly offset the improvement in London offices.

The company said 99% of rent due for the September quarter had been collected, up from 95% three months earlier, showing most tenants are able to keep up with payments as business conditions improve. However, around a quarter of retail and leisure tenants still have some form of rental concessions in place.

Mr Noel said the priority was leasing up vacant space, as void rates across the portfolio remain slightly above their historic average. He added the company would consider smaller acquisitions in London and regional cities where Landsec sees the opportunity for rental growth.  

Land Securities’ shares gained 1.2% following the update, the first since the company reported its full-year results in May. The shares have risen 25% from their pandemic lows in March 2020 but remain 27% below their pre-Covid peak.
