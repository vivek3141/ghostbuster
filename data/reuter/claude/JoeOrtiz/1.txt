Eurotunnel announces deal with banks to wipe out one billion pounds of debt 

Eurotunnel, the operator of the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France, announced today that it has reached an agreement with its lenders to wipe out over 1 billion pounds of debt. The restructuring deal will see Eurotunnel's debt reduced from over 9 billion pounds to around 8 billion pounds.

The agreement comes after months of negotiations between Eurotunnel and its major creditors, which include Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and other large investment banks. The debt restructuring is a major step forward for the troubled company, which has struggled with high interest payments and operational challenges since the Channel Tunnel first opened in 1994.

"This agreement represents a new beginning for Eurotunnel," said Jacques Gounon, Chairman and CEO of Eurotunnel. "With a sustainable level of debt and a strong operating performance, we will be in a position to continue to invest in our infrastructure while improving returns to shareholders.”

The deal will convert one third of Eurotunnel’s bank debt into equity, essentially wiping it from its books. Another third of the debt will have its interest rates slashed by 50-75% and maturity extended to 2022. The remaining third will see a 50% reduction in interest rates and maturity pushed out to 2028.

The agreement still needs approval from some of Eurotunnel’s bondholders, but the company expects the terms to be finalized and take effect later this year. If approved, Eurotunnel says its annual interest payments will fall by at least 50 million pounds per year, giving the company more financial flexibility.

While the restructuring agreement provides much-needed relief to Eurotunnel, the company continues to face long-term challenges, including increased competition from budget airlines and higher speed rail options between London and Paris. However, with its debt burden eased, Eurotunnel will be in a better position to invest in upgrades, maintenance and new services that can help boost revenues and passenger numbers going forward. Overall, the deal is a victory for Eurotunnel as it works to place its finances on a sustainable footing for years to come.
