Mercury Asset Management Predicts Rise in Pre-Tax Profits Due to Buoyant Exchanges  

Mercury Asset Management, one of the UK’s leading wealth and investment managers, announced today that it expects pre-tax profits for the current fiscal year to increase nearly 25% due to buoyant conditions on global stock exchanges. The company cited strong performances across most of its portfolio holdings as well as increased trading volumes and fees during the year. 

“We have benefited from supportive equity market conditions over the past six months, especially in the technology and healthcare sectors where we have significant investment exposure,” said Simon Thompson, Chief Executive of Mercury Asset Management. “Our performance fees are tightly linked to the growth of our clients’ portfolios, so when markets are performing well, we share in that success. We are optimistic that equity markets will continue to strengthen through the end of our fiscal year.”

The firm reported that assets under management increased 18% to £420 billion in the first half of the fiscal year. Growth was driven primarily by market gains as well as new client wins, especially among high-net-worth individuals and retirement plans in the UK and Asia. With interest rates still at historic lows, many investors have turned to the equity markets in search of higher returns. This shift, along with a rotation to riskier assets, has benefitted Mercury Asset Management’s focus on active investment strategies.

However, the firm warned that future profits and asset growth could be impacted by several external risks on the horizon. Chief among these risks are the ongoing US-China trade war, geopolitical tensions with Iran, and the uncertain impact of Brexit on financial services. Any escalation of international trade disputes could weaken economic growth and investor sentiment.

Mercury Asset Management is scheduled to report final audited results for the fiscal year in September. Though the firm expects reduced growth in the second half, full year pre-tax profits are still projected to increase approximately 23-27% year over year, signaling another strong result for one of the best-performing names in investment management.
