Barclays' investment banking arm restructures Global Markets division in bid to compete with rivals 

Barclays is overhauling its investment bank division that deals with trading and managing risks in a bid to turn around fortunes and better compete with rival banks. The UK lender announced a restructuring of its Global Markets business, which will see it shift focus to electronic trading and cut some jobs in its macro markets unit.

The restructuring announced by Barclays comes as investment banks globally face increasing pressure from tighter regulations, declining trading revenues and the rise of passive and algorithmic trading. Barclays' Global Markets division reported a loss in the first half of this year, highlighting the challenges. The changes at the investment bank are aimed at reducing costs, boosting returns and positioning the business for future growth.

Tim Throsby, head of Barclaysâ€™ corporate and international division that houses the investment bank, said the restructuring would make Global Markets "leaner, balanced and well-equipped" to serve clients. As part of the overhaul, Barclays will scale back parts of its macro markets business that deals with currency, interest rates and bonds trading. It will also strengthen its electronic trading capabilities to focus on high-growth areas. 

The job cuts resulting from the restructuring are still to be determined but expected to be in the hundreds, according to people familiar with the matter. Most of the reductions are likely to occur through natural attrition over the next 18 months but Barclays could also make some targeted cuts, the people said. The investment bank had about 5,300 staff at the end of June.

A spokesman for Barclays declined to comment on potential job losses but said any reductions would be "minimal" relative to the total size of the division. He said the bank was "re-balancing our Global Markets business to ensure we are best positioned to serve our clients, with a focus on electronic and high-growth areas."

The overhaul underlines the pressure on Barclays' investment bank, which has struggled in recent years amid a slump in fixed-income trading. The unit's pretax profits declined last year and it suffered a loss in the first half of 2019. Barclays faces stiff competition from US rivals including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, as well as European competitors such as Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas, in fixed-income trading.

Some analysts argue Barclays should cut costs further and faster in its investment bank. "We continue to think the unit needs radical restructuring," analysts at KBW said in a note last month. However, others said the latest changes showed Barclays was ready to make bold moves to turn around the business, which contributes about a third of the group's overall revenue. The outcome of the restructuring will be closely watched by investors as a gauge for the future direction of Barclays under chief executive Jes Staley.
