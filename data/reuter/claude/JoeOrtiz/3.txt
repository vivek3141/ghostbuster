Barclays in talks with Morgan Stanley for its global custody business

Barclays, the UK-based multinational investment bank, is in advanced discussions with Morgan Stanley to sell its global custody business, according to people familiar with the matter. 

The talks are ongoing and no final decision has been made, but Barclays is keen to exit the custody sector as part of a broad restructuring under CEO Jes Staley. The unit could fetch around $500 million in a sale, the sources said.

Global custody banks safeguard assets for clients and assist in trade settlements and reporting. Barclays is the fourth largest player in the sector, holding around $2.7 trillion in client assets, according to data provider Global Custodian.

If a deal is struck, it would expand Morgan Stanley’s reach in the custody sector. The Wall Street firm has around $3 trillion in client assets and has expanded in areas like institutional securities, wealth management and M&A advisory under CEO James Gorman.

Barclays has been evaluating options for its custody business, including a possible joint venture with another bank, as it looks to streamline operations under Staley. But an outright sale has become a more attractive option as potential partners drag their feet, two of the people said.

The custody unit’s clients include large pension and wealth funds, for whom it settles trades, provides record-keeping for holdings and handles reporting. The clients could provide Morgan Stanley’s wealth and institutional businesses with opportunities to win more advisory mandates.

The talks come as Staley tries to overhaul Barclays after a tumultuous period capped by a $2 billion penalty in 2018 for defrauding investors in residential mortgage-backed securities. The CEO has cut more than 10,000 jobs, doubled down on Barclays’ investment bank and sold non-core businesses, including its stake in African arm Absa.

Offloading the custody unit would mark another milestone in Staley's turnaround. But a deal is not guaranteed, and Morgan Stanley or another willing buyer must still hammer out an agreement with Barclays. If talks with Morgan Stanley collapse, Barclays would need to look elsewhere for a willing partner.
