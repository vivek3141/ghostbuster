Sir Chippendale Keswick Takes Over as Chairman and CEO of Hambros, Breaking Historic Family Dominance

The storied British merchant bank Hambros today announced a changing of the guard at the top, appointing Sir Chippendale Keswick as the new Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. Sir Keswick is the first non-family executive to hold both posts in Hambrosâ€™ 228-year history. He replaces Walter Hambro, who has stepped down after more than 30 years as head of the institution that has been in his family since its founding in 1790.

"Today is a new chapter in the remarkable history of Hambros as Sir Keswick brings with him a fresh perspective that will uphold the traditions of excellence and integrity that Hambros stands for," said Hambro. The flamboyant Sir Keswick, an Old Etonian known for his love of bespoke suits, polo matches, and fast cars, has been a director at Hambros since 2012 and previously held senior roles at HSBC, Barclays, and Kleinwort Benson. Still, this appointment represents a bold change in leadership for a firm that has had only six chief executives, all from the Hambro family, since its founding. 

While Hambros has navigated global upheavals from the Napoleonic Wars to World Wars and financial crises, the current environment poses unprecedented challenges. Brexit clouds the economic outlook, interest rates are at historic lows squeezing margins, regulations are mounting, and technology is reshaping client expectations and ways of doing business. In appointing Sir Keswick, 62, and signaling more openness to outside talent, Hambros is positioning itself for the next decade and beyond. 

"Hambros has a robust foundation, and by preserving its core values while leveraging new expertise, it can thrive for another two centuries," said Sir Keswick. He pledged to maintain Hambros' focus on client service and discretion while exploring opportunities in areas like sustainable finance. For a firm that has financed wars, traded gold and advised royalty, the coming years promise more change, but also more continuity in a journey that started before the steam engine. As Walter Hambro said in a statement, "The future remains bright as Hambros' purpose and spirit endure."
