Mercury Asset Management eyes acquisitions to enhance shareholder value as profits and cash pile soar 

Mercury Asset Management, the London-based investment firm, is looking to make strategic acquisitions to boost shareholder returns after reporting a 32% rise in annual profits and a surge in its cash balance.

The company, which manages £450 billion of assets for institutional and retail investors, saw pre-tax profits climb to £482 million in the year to March 31, up from £365 million the previous year. Net inflows from clients rose to a record £43 billion, helping boost assets under management by 10%.

Flush with cash after the strong performance, Mercury said it would consider takeover opportunities to accelerate its growth, particularly in the US and Asia. The group ended the year with £1.8 billion of surplus capital, up 59% from a year earlier.

“We see significant potential for value-enhancing acquisitions that can strengthen our franchise and better position us for future growth, said Jon Thompson, chief executive. “Our robust balance sheet means we are very well placed to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.”

The results highlight the revival in fortunes of Mercury, which has sought to move past turmoil including the abrupt departure of its former chief executive in 2018 and the loss of two big mandate clients. The group has repositioned itself around higher-margin asset classes like equities and private markets and away from lower-margin bond and multi-asset strategies.

Analysts welcomed news that Mercury was primed for deals, with its shares up 3.6% in morning trading. The company is still dwarfed by larger US rivals like BlackRock, which manages $7.4 trillion of assets, but a deal spree could narrow the gap.

“Mercury has patiently got itself into a position of strength and now looks ready to potentially turbocharge growth through M&A. There are many possible targets, in our view the US wealth management space is particularly appealing given the long-term growth dynamics,” said George English, analyst at Barclays.
