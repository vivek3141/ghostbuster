Royal Bank of Scotland Reports 15% Rise in Full Year Profits, Considers Expansion Options

The Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS), one of the UK's largest financial institutions, announced today that its annual pre-tax profits rose 15% in 2019 to £2.8 billion, its first full year of profit since the global financial crisis. The bank said it was helped by reduced costs and a drop in bad loan charges as it continues its recovery. 

RBS reported improvements across all business areas, with income rising 3% to £14.2 billion. The bank's loans and advances to customers also increased 1% to £196.6 billion. RBS has made significant progress in cost cutting and simplification since receiving a government bailout in 2008 during the financial crisis. The bank said it aims to further reduce costs by removing duplications and streamlining its business in 2020.

RBS CEO Alison Rose expressed cautious optimism about the results. "Overall this was a solid performance demonstrating good progress against our strategic objectives, however the economic outlook remains uncertain," she said. The bank expects only "limited" growth for the British economy this year as the latest data "point to a modest recovery at best" in 2020.

With its turnaround gaining momentum, RBS said it is considering options to return capital to shareholders starting next year after meeting certain capital targets. RBS also hopes to resume paying dividends for the first time since the crisis and is exploring tentative expansion plans through limited acquisitions or partnerships in the UK and Western Europe. 

However, analysts warned that substantial economic risks like the UK's withdrawal from the European Union could impact the bank's recovery. Brexit uncertainty has deterred borrowing by small businesses in Britain and depressed house prices. RBS is majority-owned by the British government after it received a £45 billion bailout. The government still owns 62% of RBS shares but intends to sell its remaining stake as the bank's share price recovers.

Overall, RBS delivered improved and better-than-expected results for 2019. If it maintains this positive momentum, RBS appears poised to build on its turnaround and explore new growth chapters in its more than 300 year history. But considerable economic and political risks in its home market are likely to make any future progress slow and uneven.
