Mercury Asset Management sees 29% rise in first half profits, may use cash pile for US expansion  

Mercury Asset Management, one of the UK's largest fund managers, reported a 29% increase in pre-tax profits for the first half of the year today. Buoyed by rising global stock markets and strong inflows into its funds, Mercury's profits rose to £362 million in the six months ending June 30, up from £281 million in the same period last year. 

The robust results highlight the continued strength of Mercury's diversified range of fund products, which span equity, fixed income, multi-asset and alternative strategies. Total assets under management rose 6% in the first half to £460 billion. Much of this growth came from international markets, with Mercury's overseas assets increasing 12% to represent 57% of the total—reflecting the company's expansion in the US, Europe and Asia Pacific.

While UK economic growth remains sluggish due to ongoing Brexit uncertainty, Mercury has pivoted increasingly towards overseas investors and markets. Last year, the company opened new offices in New York, Singapore and Tokyo to complement its longstanding presence in London and Hong Kong. CEO Mark Davies said the international growth strategy was paying off and would continue: "Our global diversification has proven invaluable in generating consistent returns despite market turbulence. We see substantial room for growth in the US, Asia and Europe in the coming years."

Mercury also signaled it may use some of its sizeable cash pile, which stands at £1.2 billion, for acquisitions to drive further expansion, especially in the US. Davies said the company was evaluating some small to mid-sized fund managers that could broaden Mercury's product range and client base, especially in North America. "We have the financial firepower to undertake meaningful yet digestible acquisitions, and will be looking closely at opportunities that arise," Davies said during an investor call. 

The strong results were well received by investors, with Mercury's shares climbing 4.2% in London trading. Analysts said the company continues to benefit from several long-term trends, including the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution pensions, the growing adoption of low-cost index funds, and increasing demand for specialized alternative and multi-asset strategies. If global markets remain buoyant and Mercury achieves further success in penetrating new regions and client segments, its ascent looks set to continue for the foreseeable future. Overall, few large-scale, broad-based fund managers appear as well positioned as Mercury to capitalize on the ongoing shifts reshaping asset management.
