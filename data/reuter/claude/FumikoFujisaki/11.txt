Asian Investors Turn to Tokyo's Property Market Despite Previous High Prices, Says Kennedy-Wilson Managing Director 

Tokyo's commercial property market is attracting significant interest from Asian investors despite its reputation for high prices, according to a managing director at Los Angeles-based real estate investment firm Kennedy Wilson.

James Ritchie, who oversees Kennedy Wilson's operations in Japan, said at a press briefing that Asian investors make up an increasingly large proportion of buyers in Tokyo's office market. "We are seeing more capital coming from places like Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea. These investors view Tokyo as a safe haven and source of stable returns despite the city's high property prices relative to other Asian cities," he said.

Ritchie pointed out that Tokyo's status as a global business hub, combined with its limited developable land, have supported steady rent growth and high occupancy rates for office properties. "Vacancy rates have been below 5 percent for the last few years. And office rents have been growing at around 3 to 5 percent annually. These supply-demand dynamics continue to make Tokyo an attractive market for investors, especially those focused on stable income-producing assets," he noted.

The increased interest comes even as some experts warn that Tokyo's commercial property market is peaking after nearly a decade of recovery from the global financial crisis. Prices and rents for Tokyo office space have surpassed their pre-crisis highs, raising concerns about affordability and risks of a downturn.

Ritchie acknowledged the risks but argued that Tokyo's market fundamentals remain sound. "We monitor affordability closely but so far haven't seen a major impact on demand. And we still see limited new supply in the development pipeline, which should help support the market."
