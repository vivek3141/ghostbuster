Nomura Posts Half-Year Loss While Other Major Brokers Report Profits Thanks to Improving Stock Market

Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan's largest brokerage and investment bank, reported a net loss of 18.8 billion yen ($174 million) in the six months ending September as a weak stock market hurt performance. The loss contrasts with profits reported by other major brokers during the same period thanks to an improving equity market. 

Nomura's revenue from stock brokerage commissions and asset management fees declined in the period as the Japanese stock market fell around 6% through September amid global economic uncertainty and trade tensions. Nomura also posted losses from its investment banking operations. The company's fixed-income trading division performed better, but it wasn't enough to offset the other weak areas.

â€œEquity market conditions were challenging, and investor sentiment was weak," said Nomura CEO Koji Nagai in a statement. He said the environment is showing signs of improvement in some areas but remains "difficult."

The loss for the first half comes even as Nomura has been cutting costs, including slashing $1 billion in expenses over the next three years and reducing headcount. The company has been struggling to overhaul its business amid long-running challenges in the Japanese financial industry like low interest rates, weak economic growth and changing consumer preferences.

In contrast, many of Nomura's global competitors reported positive results for the same period thanks to better equity market performance outside of Japan. Wall Street giants like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase posted double-digit profit increases in their most recent quarter on higher revenues from stock trading and underwriting deals. Hong Kong brokers and asset managers such as Citic Securities and Noah Holdings also reported earnings growth.  

The diverging fortunes highlight the growing divide between Japan's financial sector and overseas markets. Years of economic stagnation and a static stock market have weighed on brokers in Japan, while continuing global growth and record highs for many equity indexes abroad have boosted foreign firms.  

Nomura executives said they are looking for signs of improving market sentiment and investor confidence in Japan. Stronger global growth could also provide opportunities for Nomura's overseas operations and support its push into new markets like private equity funds. Cost cuts will continue in an effort to make the company leaner and better able to generate profits even in a lackluster environment.

The bank maintained its annual dividend at 12 yen per share, though the payout will depend on full-year results. Nomura's stock price was little changed following the earnings announcement, reflecting the ongoing challenges the company faces in restructuring its business model. Investors will be watching closely to see if market conditions improve enough in the coming months for Nomura to return to profitability.
