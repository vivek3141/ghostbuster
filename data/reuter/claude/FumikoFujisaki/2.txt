Japan sets up panel to tackle problem loans and increase liquidity in real estate market 

The Japanese government announced today that it is establishing an expert panel to address the long-running issue of  non-performing loans in the real estate sector and find ways to improve liquidity in the country's real estate market. The panel will be comprised of members from the public and private sectors with expertise in finance, banking, and real estate.

The panel is being set up in response to calls from the real estate industry to take more aggressive action on the problem loan issue. Japanese banks have long been burdened with non-performing loans, many tied to the collapse of the real estate bubble in the early 1990s. Despite some progress, Japanese banks still have a high volume of bad loans on their books, with official government estimates putting the total at over $230 billion USD.

The high level of non-performing loans has weakened the balance sheets of Japanese banks and made them reluctant to extend new loans, especially in the real estate sector. This has reduced liquidity in the real estate market and made it difficult for developers and investors to finance new projects. Key groups like the Japan Association of Real Estate Agents have called on the government to take strong action to resolve non-performing real estate loans so that Japanese banks can become more active lenders again.  

In announcing the new panel, the Ministry of Finance said its aims are two-fold: resolve the longstanding problem of non-performing real estate loans held by Japanese banks and also explore ways to enhance financing options for real estate companies and investors. The panel will review the situation and discuss possible solutions to accelerate the disposal of bad loans, such as more aggressive write-offs by banks, the creation of special purpose companies to buy bad loans, and the introduction of a market for trading non-performing loans. The panel will also look at steps to increase liquidity like the securitization of real estate assets and the introduction of new investment vehicles to channel capital into the property sector.

The moves comes amid signs the Japanese real estate market is recovering following years of weakness. Property prices in Tokyo and other major cities have been rising over the past few years, supported by a strong economy, tourism boom, and preparations for the 2020 Olympics. However, a shortage of available financing and lingering bad debts continue to hamper more robust growth in the sector. The new government panel aims to tackle this challenge head-on and unlock the flow of new capital into Japan's property markets. Its proposals are eagerly awaited by industry groups hoping for a new phase of expansion in Japanese real estate.
