Yasuda Fire & Marine to Take Majority Stake in CIGNA's Japanese Unit

Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co., one of Japan's largest non-life insurers, announced today that it will acquire a majority stake in the Japanese subsidiary of U.S. health insurance provider CIGNA Corp. Yasuda Fire & Marine will purchase 65% of CIGNA's operations in Japan for an undisclosed amount. 

The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, pending regulatory approval. For CIGNA, the sale is part of the company's strategy to exit certain international markets and focus on core geographies. CIGNA has struggled to gain significant market share since entering Japan in 2008. Japan's health insurance market is dominated by large domestic players like Yasuda Fire & Marine, Sompo, and Tokio Marine.

For Yasuda, the acquisition provides an opportunity to expand into the growing health and medical insurance sector. While Yasuda Fire & Marine is a leader in property and casualty insurance, its health insurance business has remained relatively small. The aging population in Japan and increasing demand for private health plans have made health insurance an attractive market for insurers. CIGNA has built a portfolio of corporate and individual health plan clients that Yasuda aims to retain and grow under its new ownership.

"We are excited to enter into this partnership with a major multinational insurance company like CIGNA," said Takashi Hara, CEO of Yasuda Fire & Marine. "By combining CIGNA's expertise and provider networks with our knowledge of the Japanese market and distribution channels, we believe we can develop innovative new products for companies and households in Japan."

CIGNA's Japan unit has approximately 250 employees and generates annual premium revenue of nearly $500 million. Yasuda will maintain the CIGNA brand in Japan and keep the unit's operations intact for at least a year following the close of the deal. Over time, Yasuda plans to adopt best practices from CIGNA to strengthen its own health insurance business.  

The sale is the latest in a series of transactions that have consolidated Japan's insurance industry. Demographic shifts and stagnant economic growth have spurred insurance companies in Japan to boost efficiencies through partnerships, acquisitions, and cost-cutting measures. CIGNA's divestiture is consistent with the trend of global insurers scaling back or withdrawing from the competitive Japanese market.
