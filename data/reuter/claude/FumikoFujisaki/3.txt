Japan Reform Panel Urges Full Deregulation of Markets to Prevent Falling Behind Globally  

A government-appointed panel of experts in Japan has recommended sweeping deregulation of the country's markets to boost economic growth and global competitiveness. In its latest report, the Regulatory Reform Promotion Council called for the deregulation of a wide range of industries, including aviation, agriculture, healthcare, and retail. The panel warned that Japan risked falling further behind other economies globally if substantial deregulation is not pursued.

The panel cited overly restrictive regulations as a major factor inhibiting innovation and new business activity in Japan. It pointed out that heavily regulated sectors had the slowest growth and investment in the economy. By contrast, less regulated industries like automotive and electronics continue to lead Japan's economy and compete effectively on the global stage. The panel said more deregulation could unleash the potential of Japanese companies and stimulate new areas of economic activity.

Specifically, the panel recommended deregulating air travel to allow more direct flights across Japan and lower airfares. It called for reforming healthcare regulations to allow non-physicians more flexibility in opening and operating clinics. It also urged deregulating retail and agriculture by lifting caps on store hours and production quotas for certain crops. The panel argued that deregulating these and other sectors would increase competition, reduce consumer costs, and boost exports.  

Reactions to the report in Japan were mixed. While many economists and business leaders welcomed the recommendations, some industry groups and politicians warned about potential downsides like job losses or declining service quality. Consumer advocates also cautioned that deregulation may reduce consumer protections. But proponents argued deregulation would benefit consumers through lower costs and more choice.

The panel's recommendations align with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's agenda to reduce bureaucratic red tape and revitalize Japan's economy. However, substantive deregulation faces significant obstacles, including opposition within the government and among regulated industries. Previous administrations have pursued limited deregulation but failed to achieve comprehensive reforms due to such resistance.

This latest report highlights both the potential benefits of, and challenges to, deregulating Japan's economy. With competitive pressures rising from China and other economies, experts argue major deregulation is critical for Japan to sustain its global standing and unlock new growth opportunities. But deregulating in a way that balances economic dynamism and consumer welfare may prove complicated in the country's consensus-driven policymaking system. The path to deregulation in Japan remains uncertain, but the reform panel believes it is an effort that can no longer be delayed if Japan hopes to thrive in the global 21st century economy.
