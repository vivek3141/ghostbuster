Asian Investors Turn to Tokyo's Property Market as Prices Hit Attractive Levels  

Tokyo's property market is seeing a surge of interest from Asian investors attracted by lower prices and a stable yen. According to new data from real estate services firm CBRE, property investment in Tokyo from Asian investors reached nearly $5 billion in the first half of 2019, up over 50% from the same period last year.

The increased investment comes as property prices in Tokyo have declined over the past few years while the yen has stabilized relative to other Asian currencies, making the city's real estate appear attractively priced. "We are seeing more capital inflows into Japan, especially from neighboring Asian countries with strong currencies,” said Spike Kitajima, head of investment properties at CBRE Japan. “Investors are seeing opportunities in Tokyo's relatively stable market and growth potential.”

Much of the new investment is coming from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Chinese investors put over $2 billion into Tokyo properties in the first six months of this year as the yuan has strengthened against the yen. Taiwanese investors also invested heavily, spending $1.3 billion on offices and retail properties, the most since 2007. Hong Kong investors have turned to Tokyo as an alternative to domestic markets that have become overheated after years of low interest rates and speculative buying by mainland Chinese investors.  

The influx of Asian capital has buoyed prices for some properties, especially large office buildings and retail complexes in central Tokyo locations. However, the broader Tokyo property market remains relatively flat. Residential property prices in the Greater Tokyo area are still nearly 20% below their peak in the early 1990s, according to government data. 

Some analysts expect Asian investment in Tokyo real estate to continue to increase over the next year given unstable property markets in other parts of the region and the build-up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. However, a weakening global economy could weigh on property markets worldwide, possibly limiting price growth in Tokyo. Overall, the pickup in investment from Asian neighbors points to the growing integration of property markets across the region, as investors expand beyond their domestic borders in the search for stable and secure returns.
