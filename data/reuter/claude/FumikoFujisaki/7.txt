Nomura Securities Posts Half-Year Loss While Other "Big Four" Brokers See Profits Rise  

Nomura Holdings, Japan’s largest brokerage firm, reported a shocking net loss of 57.9 billion yen ($540 million) for the first half of its fiscal year. The sizable loss came as Nomura’s main competitors among Japan’s "Big Four" brokerages posted rising profits over the same period. 

Nomura blamed weaker revenues from trading stocks and bonds along with a decline in investment banking fees. The brokerage’s retail and asset management divisions also struggled, contributing to the poor result. In contrast, rivals Daiwa Securities, Mizuho Securities and SMBC Nikko reported higher half-year profits, buoyed by stronger trading volumes and increased customer assets.

The loss represents a major setback for Nomura CEO Koji Nagai, who took the helm in 2012 with a mandate to turn around the company following an insider trading scandal. Nagai has pushed to make Nomura a more globally competitive firm, acquiring assets from Lehman Brothers in 2008 and expanding internationally. However, the firm has continued to lag its peers and routinely posts lower returns on equity.

Nomura now forecasts a full-year net loss of 50 billion yen, its first annual loss in seven years. The warning shook analysts and investors, sending Nomura shares down over 7% in Tokyo trading. “Nomura’s weak results were shocking and suggest management still has a long way to go to achieve a sustainable turnaround,” said Jiro Nakano, a Tokyo-based analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities.

In response, CEO Nagai has pledged another round of costs cuts, including reducing headcount and scaling back some overseas operations. The firm will also restructure divisions focused on retail, asset management and capital markets to boost efficiency. Some analysts argue more radical steps are needed like exiting unprofitable businesses. “Nomura needs to make tough decisions to shift its business model rather than relying only on incremental changes,” said Nakano.

Nomura faces significant challenges in the coming year amid weak investor sentiment and continuing ultra-low interest rates in Japan. Daiwa Securities warned this month that brokerages could see a 20-30% drop in profits over the next fiscal year. However, Nomura’s heavy first-half loss and bleak outlook make its position particularly precarious. Without a quick and sustained turnaround under CEO Nagai, Nomura risks falling further behind its competitors and jeopardizing its status as an icon of Japan's financial industry.
