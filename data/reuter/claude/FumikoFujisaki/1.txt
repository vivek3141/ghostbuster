Foreign investors show confidence in Japan's finance industry, flock to share offering by Sakura Bank  

Sakura Bank, one of Japan's largest regional banks, saw strong demand from foreign investors for its recent share offering, demonstrating overseas confidence in the country's finance sector. Sakura Bank sold 280 million new shares at 460 yen per share, raising 128.8 billion yen ($1.2 billion) in fresh capital. The offer was significantly oversubscribed, attracting orders from foreign investors for five times more shares than were allocated to them.

Foreign interest in the Sakura Bank offering reflects optimism about reforms underway in Japan's finance industry and economy. Government and corporate governance reforms have made the sector more transparent and attractive to international investors in recent years. Banks have strengthened their balance sheets, non-performing loan ratios have declined, and return on equity has improved.  

Sakura Bank has undertaken its own reforms to improve profitability and corporate governance. It aims to boost ROE to 8% by the fiscal year ending March 2023, up from 6% currently. It appointed its first female and first foreign directors last year, as part of efforts to diversify its board. The bank also aims to boost loans to small and midsized firms as the Japanese economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The response to Sakura Bank's share sale "demonstrates overseas investors' confidence in Japanese regional banks and their growth potential," said Tokai Tokyo Research Center analyst Naoshi Takahashi. Foreigners were allocated 49% of the new Sakura Bank shares. U.S. and European investors were particularly active, accounting for 65% of the foreign demand. 

Sakura Bank plans to use the proceeds from the share sale to strengthen its capital base and fund strategic investments in areas like digital banking. It aims to maintain a stable dividend while balancing shareholder returns with growth investments.

Continued interest from foreign investors could help push Japanese bank shares higher and accelerate the pace of reforms. But uncertainties remain, including the economic fallout from the pandemic and tensions with China. "Foreign investors will be closely watching how Sakura Bank leverages this fresh capital to accelerate growth," said Keiichi Takagawa, banking analyst at Credit Suisse Securities. With interest rates in Japan expected to remain ultra-low for the foreseeable future, regional banks face a challenging environment. Strong capital levels and leadership on reforms will be key to success. Overall though, the strong response to Sakura Bank's offering is an optimistic sign for Japan's finance sector.
