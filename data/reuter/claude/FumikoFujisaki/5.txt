Nippon Life Insurance to set up joint venture in Philippines, becomes first Japanese insurer to sell life policies abroad 

Nippon Life Insurance Co., Japan’s largest life insurer, is entering the Philippine market through a joint venture with Century Group, a local financial services firm. The new company, Nippon Century Life Insurance, will start selling life insurance policies in the Philippines as early as next year, making Nippon Life the first Japanese insurance company to sell life insurance overseas.

Nippon Life will own 60% of the joint venture while Century Group will hold the remaining 40% stake. The companies are planning to invest 8 billion yen or around $73 million in capital over the next three years. They aim to start selling life insurance policies by April 2021 and are targeting to sell over 10,000 policies in the first year.

The Philippines has a fast-growing life insurance market and remains underpenetrated, with less than 2% of the population holding life insurance policies. The country’s working-age population and growing middle class have fueled increased demand for financial services like life insurance. Nippon Life is looking to tap into this opportunity to generate growth as the life insurance market in Japan stagnates due to an aging population.

“Southeast Asia, and the Philippines in particular, is a very important market for our overseas business expansion,” said Yoshinobu Tsutsui, president of Nippon Life. “By combining Nippon Life’s product and service expertise with Century Group’s deep knowledge of the local market, we aim to provide high-quality life insurance products tailored to the needs of Filipino customers.”

The new joint venture marks an important milestone for Nippon Life as it accelerates its global expansion. The company aims to generate over 10% of its total premium income from overseas by 2025. It has life insurance operations in Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Myanmar but the Philippine venture would be its first in selling life policies outside Japan. 

Nippon Life’s move could also encourage other Japanese life insurers to follow suit. The company’s success in selling life policies in the Philippines may pave the way for opening up Japan’s life insurance market, still largely dominated by domestic players. The venture highlights the ongoing globalization in Japan’s financial services industry, spurred by slow growth at home.
