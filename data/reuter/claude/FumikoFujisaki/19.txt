Japan's "Big Bang" plan includes lifting controls on stock-based derivatives, but doubts remain over market viability 

The Japanese government unveiled details of its ambitious "Big Bang" deregulation of the country's financial markets, including plans to lift restrictions on stock-based derivatives trading as soon as next year. The reforms are aimed at stimulating Japan's lackluster economy by making its capital markets more competitive globally. 

However, critics argue that Japan's markets may not be ready for the rapid changes, especially given the expected influx of short-term speculators. They point to the small scale of Japan's capital markets relative to major global players and the risk of volatility from speculative trading. Supporters counter that deregulation is necessary for Japan to catch up to global standards and to increase liquidity and investment opportunities.

The proposals announced include ending a ban on short-selling of stocks, expanding trading hours for equities, and lifting curbs on stock options and futures. The plans would allow sophisticated derivatives linked to individual stocks for the first time in Japan. Similar financial "big bang" overhauls in London and New York in the 1980s are credited with turning those cities into global financial hubs.

"We aim to carry out bold regulatory reforms to achieve free, fair, and disruptive financial markets," said Finance Minister Taro Aso. The proposals will be debated in parliament next year and implemented incrementally from 2022. The government hopes to attract more foreign investors and encourage risk-taking by giving investors more freedom.

However, Japan's financial markets remain relatively small, with equities markets valued at $5.8 trillion, compared to $30 trillion for U.S. markets. Critics argue that with lower liquidity, Japan's markets are vulnerable to speculation and manipulation. Past reforms in the 2000s that deregulated certain derivatives were followed by incidents of market abuse.

"Japan's markets lack the scale and institutional infrastructure to properly monitor and regulate sophisticated derivatives trading," said Jesper Koll, CEO of Monex Group Japan. "There is a risk of 'empty calories' where lots of trading generates fees but little real investment."

Supporters counter that regulations can be carefully calibrated and a phased introduction of reforms will prevent market shocks. They argue that new products and trading approaches will develop over time with the changes. The reforms may significantly impact Japan's $9 trillion household savings, as more options emerge to invest for growth.

The "Big Bang" plan is a key part of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's agenda to revitalize Japan's economy through deregulation and market forces. The success or failure of the financial reforms may shape Suga's political future and Japan's economic trajectory in the years to come.
