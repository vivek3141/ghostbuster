Nomura Securities' Overseas Subsidiaries See Profits Surge, With Europe Leading The Way  

Nomura Holdings, Japan's largest brokerage and investment bank, reported strong profits in its overseas subsidiaries in the first half of the fiscal year, led by its operations in Europe. Nomura's European operations swung from a loss last year to post an 82 percent increase in pretax profits.  

Nomura's overall pretax profit rose 21 percent in the first half as its retail and asset management operations in Japan as well its investment banking business overseas performed well. However, profits in Nomura's domestic institutional investor segment were flat. The company cited difficult market conditions in Japan, including negative interest rates, for the flat performance of its home institutional business.

In contrast, Nomura's international operations posted robust growth, highlighting the success of Nomura's diversification strategy to tap into overseas markets. Nomura now generates nearly half its total pretax profits from outside of Japan.  

Nomura's operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa led the gains with a surge in both investment banking and asset management fees. Nomura participated in several large mergers and acquisitions deals in Europe as M&A activity in the region rose strongly in recent quarters. Nomura also attracted new assets under management from European clients.  

Nomura's pretax profit in Europe jumped to 42.2 billion yen ($375 million) while its net revenue rose 39 percent to 75.8 billion yen. Europe now accounts for over 20 percent of Nomura's total pretax profits, up from just 11 percent a year ago. 

In the Americas, Nomura's pretax profit increased 17 percent, driven by fixed-income trading and investment banking. Revenues in the Americas grew 13 percent. Nomura is focused on expanding its U.S. wealth and asset management business, along with M&A advisory and debt and equity underwriting for North American clients.  

Overall, Nomura is well positioned to benefit from stronger markets across Europe and the Americas. With its solid first-half performance across these key regions, Nomura remains on track to achieve its target of generating over 50 percent of pretax profits from international operations. Strong and diversified overseas profits will support Nomura's growth even as it faces ongoing challenges in its core domestic market.
