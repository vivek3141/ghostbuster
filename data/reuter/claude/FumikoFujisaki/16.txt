Analysts say collapse of real estate company borrowing from "jusen" mortgage firms has limited impact on financial industry  

The collapse this week of a major Japanese real estate company that relied heavily on loans from the now-defunct "jusen" mortgage lenders is unlikely to have a significant impact on Japan's financial system, analysts said today. While the failure of Tama Corporation marks one of the largest bankruptcies in Japan this year, the company had reduced its borrowing from the jusen companies in recent years, they said.

Tama Corp. filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday with the Tokyo District Court, citing debts of over ¥500 billion ($4.5 billion). The regional shopping mall developer borrowed heavily from the jusen in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the property boom but has struggled in recent years with a drop in consumer spending and increased competition from larger mall operators. 

The jusen were private mortgage lenders that collapsed in the 1990s and were taken over by the government, which still holds hundreds of billions of dollars of bad debts from the companies. Tama Corp. owed about ¥120 billion to the nationalized jusen companies at the end of March but had paid down much of its jusen debt over the last decade, said Nomura Securities analyst Takaki Sakaguchi.

"While the Tama bankruptcy is sizable, its impact should be limited given how much the jusen risk has declined overall in the system," Sakaguchi said. Other analysts noted that the jusen have already provisioned for substantial losses from Tama Corp., which has seen its credit rating downgraded repeatedly in recent years due to its weakening financial position.

Tama Corp.'s failure will likely hurt regional banks in Japan that lent to the company, though major banks are seen as having limited exposure. The bankruptcy may also affect smaller subcontractors and the value of commercial property in areas where Tama Corp. operated malls. But analysts said Japan’s overall economic and financial implications would be modest.

"This is really a story of past excesses coming back to haunt, but for the broader system the risks are contained," said economist Jesper Koll at Merrill Lynch Japan Securities. While the Tama Corp. collapse is a reminder of the lingering "zombie company" problem in Japan, Koll said Japanese banks have become healthier and the jusen cleanup has progressed.
