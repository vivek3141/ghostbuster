Analysts Predict Two out of Japan's "Big Four" Brokers to Regain Financial Health in Current Business Year 

Tokyo, Japan - Industry analysts are optimistic that two of Japan's "Big Four" securities brokers, Nomura Holdings and Daiwa Securities Group, will post profits and strengthen their balance sheets in the current fiscal year ending March 2021. The brokers have struggled in recent years due to low interest rates, weak trading volumes, and losses from overseas operations. However, analysts point to several factors that could help Nomura and Daiwa return to health this year.

Nomura, Japan's largest broker, is projected to post net income of over 100 billion yen ($930 million) for the full year, its first annual profit since 2018. Nomura has cut costs through layoffs and restructuring unprofitable overseas units. It has also expanded into new business lines like private equity and invested in new technologies to boost trading. Daiwa Securities, the second largest broker, could generate net income of 70 billion yen ($650 million), the first profit in three years. Like Nomura, Daiwa has restructured to reduce costs and risks while diversifying into asset management, private banking, and fintech.  

The improved outlook stands in contrast to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group's and Mizuho Financial Group's securities units, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities and Mizuho Securities. Analysts expect these brokers to remain unprofitable this year due to their weaker cost-cutting efforts and larger unprofitable overseas operations. The four brokers were hit hard by the 2008 global financial crisis but had been recovering until recent years. They now face a long road to restore their pre-crisis stature.

Industry experts point to several signs of progress at Nomura and Daiwa. Nomura's cost-to-income ratio dropped below 70 percent in Q2, suggesting tighter cost control. Daiwa attracted net inflows of over 200,000 retail accounts in the same quarter, reflecting stronger customer engagement. The brokers' trading income has also stabilized after sharp drops, indicating their shift to more stable revenue sources such as advisory and private banking is gaining traction.  

However, significant challenges remain. Japan's brokerage industry still faces structural issues like declining retail trading volumes, rock-bottom interest rates, and a shrinking population. While private banking and wealth management show promise, the brokers must continue diversifying into new areas to offset weak core businesses. They also need to further streamline their operations and exit or fix loss-making overseas units that have long weighed on performance.  

Analysts will closely watch Nomura's and Daiwa's full-year earnings for signs of sustainable recovery and progress in overhauling their business models. Investors remain to be convinced the brokers have truly turned a corner after years of disappointing results and periodic restructurings that failed to gain lasting traction. Nomura and Daiwa still have much to prove, but their recent results suggest they may finally be on the right path after a long struggle.
