Japanese Bank Faces Up to $26 Million Loss Due to Suspected Employee Misuse of Funds 

Marubeni Trust & Banking, a mid-size Japanese regional bank, announced today that it may report losses of up to $26 million (3 billion yen) due to suspected unauthorized transactions by a former employee. The unnamed employee, who worked in the bank’s Tokyo headquarters, is believed to have misused client funds for personal investments over the last 3 years.

The bank discovered irregularities in a handful of corporate client accounts during an internal audit last month. A subsequent investigation found that the employee had transferred funds from these client accounts into personal investment accounts without the knowledge or consent of the clients. The former employee had already left the bank in April of this year, though the reason for their departure is still unclear. 

The misuse of funds is a blow to the reputation of the 72-year-old bank, though investors reacted calmly to the news. “While any loss of funds due to illicit activity is regrettable, the amounts in question constitute less than 0.2% of total assets, so the broader implications seem limited,” said Kiyotaka Nakashima, an analyst at Credit Suisse covering Japan's banking sector. Marubeni Trust's shares closed down just 0.4% following the announcement.

Still, questions remain about how the long-running fraud was able to escape scrutiny by the bank's internal controls. Marubeni Trust has pledged a "full review" of compliance practices, according to CEO Ichiro Suzuki. "The trust of our customers is the foundation of our business, and we sincerely apologize for this incident," Mr. Suzuki said in a statement. The bank has assured clients that their remaining funds and accounts remain secure and undisturbed.

Law enforcement authorities have launched an investigation to determine the full details and scale of the unauthorized transactions. If found guilty of financial fraud, the former employee could face up to 10 years of imprisonment in Japan. The bank has not ruled out related legal action to recover lost funds.
