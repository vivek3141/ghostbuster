Colombia Denies Army's Link to Paramilitary Death Squads, Blames Leftist Guerrillas and Drug Traffickers  

The Colombian government denied allegations that the nation's military had links to right-wing paramilitary death squads that carried out massacres and human rights abuses over decades of conflict in the South American country. In a 300-page report, the Ministry of Defense instead blamed leftist guerrilla groups and drug trafficking organizations for the creation and actions of the paramilitary groups.

Human rights groups have long accused paramilitary groups of committing atrocities such as mass killings, forced displacement, and kidnapping, often with the complicity of the Colombian armed forces. The groups claimed their actions were part of a campaign against leftist rebels and their suspected supporters. At their height, the paramilitaries had over 30,000 members, according to human rights organizations.

In the government report, the Ministry of Defense acknowledged that some members of the armed forces had colluded with paramilitaries in isolated incidents. However, it rejected claims that there were systematic alliances between military leaders, government officials, and paramilitary commanders to carry out human rights violations. 

The report argued that paramilitary groups emerged in the 1980s as private armies funded by wealthy landowners, drug cartels, and leftist guerrillas like the FARC and ELN to advance their political and economic interests. "The violence generated by these groups was not part of any state policy," the report concluded. The government of President Ivan Duque has been criticized by human rights groups and victims' organizations for what they see as attempts to whitewash state complicity in paramilitary crimes.

A spokeswoman for Amnesty International said the report was "an attempt to twist the historical truth of what happened in the Colombian conflict." She added, "There is irrefutable evidence that paramilitary groups acted with the complicity and under the orders of state agents to carry out grave human rights violations against the civilian population within the framework of the conflict."

The findings are unlikely to sway the views of rights groups and victims. But by blaming guerrillas and criminal groups, the report provides political cover for the government and military to deny state responsibility for dark chapters of Colombia's history. For the victims of paramilitary violence seeking truth and justice, the report deals another painful blow.
