Former German Secret Agent and Wife Charged with Abduction in Failed Kidnap Rescue Mission in Colombia

A former German intelligence agent and his wife have been charged by Colombian authorities for the botched kidnapping of a wealthy businessman in Bogota earlier this month. Identified as Hans Fischer, 57, the ex agent and his wife Natalia, 52, were extradited to Colombia from Venezuela where they were captured last week. 

According to Columbian prosecutors, the Fischers planned the armed kidnapping of prominent textile manufacturing magnate Jorge Luis Gutierrez on February 3rd. Posing as police officers conducting a drug raid, the couple gained entry into Gutierrez’s mansion where they proceeded to kidnap him at gunpoint. However, their elaborate scheme quickly unraveled when the real police responded to calls from Gutierrez’s staff.

In the ensuing confrontation, Jorge Luis Gutierrez suffered a bullet wound to his left arm before being rescued by the authorities. The Fischers fled the scene but were pursued by police across the border into Venezuela. Acting on a request by the Colombian government, Venezuelan authorities were able to locate and detain the couple in the city of Maracaibo.

While the motive behind the kidnapping remains unclear, prosecutors believe it was financially motivated. The Gutierrez family is considered one of the wealthiest in Colombia with interests and holdings across various industries. Speaking from his hospital bed, Jorge Luis Gutierrez claimed no knowledge of an explicit threat against him prior to the events of February 3rd.

For Hans Fischer, his recent actions mark a dramatic fall from grace. He formerly served as an intelligence operative for Germany’s Federal Intelligence Service or BND for over 30 years. Sources from within the BND have expressed shock at Fischer’s involvement, describing his record and reputation as beyond reproach during his time in service. If found guilty, the Fischers face up to 35 years imprisonment under Colombian law. The kidnapping and events surrounding it highlight the threats still posed by criminal organizations in the region, despite efforts made over decades to curb violence and extremism in Colombia and neighboring countries.
