23 Brutally Murdered in Attacks Across Central and Northern Colombia 

A series of brutal attacks across central and northern Colombia over the weekend left 23 people dead and a dozen more injured. The attacks targeted civilians and security forces in what officials are calling acts of terror by dissident FARC guerrillas and other illegal armed groups.

On Saturday evening, gunmen opened fire in a pool hall in the town of Neiva, killing 8 people including 3 underage teenagers. Witnesses reported the gunmen fired indiscriminately into the crowded hall before fleeing the scene. Neiva's mayor called the attack an "act of barbarism" that will not deter the town's residents from living peacefully.

The violence continued early Sunday morning when a roadside bomb struck a military convoy in Huila, killing 5 soldiers. The convoy was traveling between rural outposts when the improvised explosive device detonated under the lead vehicle, according to military officials. Another soldier died from injuries in the hospital. Authorities believe the bomb was planted by FARC dissidents who reject the 2016 peace accord with the government.  

Two more attacks targeted civilians on Sunday afternoon. Motorcycle gunmen shot and killed 4 construction workers in Cundinamarca, then fled into the countryside. Nearly simultaneously, a family traveling by car in Antioquia came under fire from another group of gunmen, leaving 2 adults and 3 children dead. The vehicle and bodies were discovered hours later by local farmers who alerted police.

Officials have not determined connections between the attacks but believe dissident FARC groups and competing criminal organizations are responsible for the violence. Colombia's president condemned the acts and vowed to use all resources "to track down the cowards who carried out these atrocities and bring them to justice." The attacks highlight ongoing security challenges in Colombia's rural areas where criminal groups continue to operate despite the government's peace agreement with FARC rebels two years ago.
