Thousands march in Bogota demanding end to kidnapping epidemic in Colombia 

Thousands of Colombians took to the streets of the capital Bogota on Saturday demanding an end to the kidnapping epidemic that has plagued the country for decades. Protesters marched through the city center carrying signs saying "No More Kidnappings" and "Peace and Freedom."

Colombia has one of the highest kidnapping rates in the world, with human rights groups estimating there are between 3,000 to 5,000 kidnappings each year. Victims include politicians, human rights activists, journalists, and businesspeople. Kidnappers are typically members of criminal gangs, guerrilla groups, or paramilitary organizations aiming to extract ransom payments or instill terror.

"We are tired of living in fear. We want our children to be able to walk to school without worrying they will be abducted," said Maria Suarez, a mother of three who joined the march.  

The protesters directed their anger at the government, demanding stronger action against armed groups responsible for abductions. "The state does not guarantee our rights or protect us," read one sign at the march. Critics argue authorities turn a blind eye to kidnapping hotspots and have failed to bring most kidnappers to justice.

In a speech to the crowds, Senator Pilar Montenegro acknowledged the government's shortcomings in tackling kidnapping. "The road ahead is long, but this march is a step in the right direction. It sends a strong message that civil society will not remain silent in the face of these atrocious crimes."

President Duarte later met with a delegation of protest leaders and pledged to make the fight against kidnapping a priority. He promised additional resources for anti-kidnapping police units and a new task force to coordinate action against armed groups involved in the kidnapping trade. The protest leaders said they will monitor the government's progress and organize more demonstrations if authorities do not take concrete action against kidnapping in the country.

The day's events were an emotional display of hope, grief, and determination in a country longing for an end to decades of violence. The crowds have dispersed, but their calls for freedom from fear still echo through the streets of Bogota.
