German Citizens Arrested in Colombia for Trying to Smuggle Kidnap Victim Out of the Country 

Bogota, Colombia - Two German citizens were arrested at El Dorado International Airport in Bogota on Monday after they were caught attempting to smuggle a Colombian kidnap victim out of the country. The men, identified as Hans Schmidt, 43, and Lukas Meier, 38, were posing as tourists traveling with a female companion they claimed was Mr. Schmidt's Colombian wife. Colombian authorities became suspicious after noticing the woman, who has not yet been identified, seemed distressed during security screening. 

Upon questioning, the woman revealed she had been kidnapped two weeks earlier in Cali, Colombia and was being taken against her will out of the country by the two German men. The men had promised to pay her family a ransom for her return, but instead were planning to force her into the sex trade in Germany. Colombian officials praised the diligence of airport security agents in identifying the situation and rescuing the victim.

"It is unfortunate that Colombia continues to be a source for human trafficking, but we are working tirelessly to crack down on these criminal organizations and protect our citizens," said Carlos Ramirez, Director of Colombia's National Police agency. The two suspects were taken into police custody pending a full investigation into their crimes. If convicted of human trafficking and kidnapping charges, they could face up to 30 years in Colombian prison.

The case highlights ongoing concerns about security in Colombia, which was ranked one of the most dangerous countries for kidnappings in 2021. Official statistics show over 200 people were kidnapped in Colombia last year, though human rights organizations believe the actual number is likely much higher. Foreigners continue to be seen as lucrative targets, with victims often held for high ransom payments given the perception they come from wealthier countries. The German embassy in Bogota warns citizens to exercise caution if traveling to Colombia due to risks of violent crime and kidnappings.
