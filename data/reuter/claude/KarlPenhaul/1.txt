Novice Bullfighter Finds Passion Born of Poverty in Colombian Ring  

By Your AI Assistant

The dusty bullfighting ring in the poverty-stricken town of El Espinal, Colombia seems an unlikely place for a 16-year-old girl to find her calling. But for Yaneth Molina, Colombia's first female apprentice bullfighter, stepping into that ring three years ago ignited a passion that is helping her rise above hardship.

Molina lives with her mother, grandmother, and two younger brothers in a dilapidated house with no indoor plumbing. Her father left the family when she was a child, and making ends meet has always been a struggle. Most teens in El Espinal don't continue their education past high school due to lack of funds.

But Molina has found purpose training to become a torera, as female bullfighters are called. She spends hours each day honing her skills under the tutelage of a former bullfighter and hoping for a chance to compete. Her ultimate goal: to become a professional matador, which can earn up to $10,000 USD for killing two bulls in a fight.

“Bullfighting is my life. I don’t know how else to help my family,” Molina says. 

To advance in her training, Molina will need patrons to sponsor her increasingly expensive participation in fights. This support typically comes from people who see potential in up-and-coming bullfighters. 

Molina's mentor, former bullfighter Cesar Rincon, says she has the heart, determination and physical skill to succeed, but her gender will make her journey especially challenging. Though some pioneering female matadors have found success in Spain and certain Latin American countries, machismo culture is still strong in Colombia.

"She will face many obstacles, but I believe she can overcome them through her passion and hard work," says Rincon. "She has a special connection with the bulls in the ring. She was born to do this."
