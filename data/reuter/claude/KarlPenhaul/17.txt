Thousands March in Bogota to End Kidnapping Wave in Colombia

Thousands of Colombians marched in Bogota today to protest a recent wave of kidnappings and call on the government to do more to curb the crime. According to organizers, over 5,000 people participated in the march from Plaza Bolivar to Congress to raise awareness about kidnapping, which has been on the rise over the past year. 

Kidnappings in Colombia increased by over 50% in the past year, according to statistics from the Interior Ministry. Nearly 800 kidnappings were reported in 2020, though activists say the true number is likely much higher as most go unreported. Victims come from all walks of life but indigenous leaders, human rights defenders, and those with relatives in other countries are frequent targets.

"We are marching today to say 'enough is enough' to this cruel crime," said Maria Suarez, who helped organize the march. "Kidnapping causes tremendous psychological and economic harm but it often goes unpunished. We call on the authorities to make this a priority and take urgent action."

Protestors called for increased security, harsher penalties for kidnappers, and a special police anti-kidnapping unit. Some carried photos of loved ones who were kidnapped, hoping to raise awareness of their cases. A small group of farmers spoke about how frequent kidnappings have made many rural regions nearly uninhabitable.  

In a speech to protestors outside Congress, Senator Alicia Campos pledged to propose a new anti-kidnapping bill with tougher sentences for the crime. "Kidnapping shatters lives but right now the penalties are too weak. We need stronger laws and must provide more resources to law enforcement to tackle this problem," she said.

The wave of kidnappings has been particularly troubling as Colombia emerges from decades of conflict with the FARC rebel group. Though the 2016 peace agreement ended much of the political violence, new criminal groups have moved into abandoned FARC territories and turned to activities like kidnapping, extortion, and drug trafficking. Activists argue the government must act quickly to avoid backsliding into further instability and violence. Overall, today's march signals that Colombians want peace, justice and safer communitiesâ€”and they will not remain silent until they get them.
