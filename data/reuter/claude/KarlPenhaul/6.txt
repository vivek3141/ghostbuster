Colombia Takes First Step to Lift Ban on Extradition, But Anti-Drug Prosecutor Dismisses Move as Virtually Meaningless

The Colombian government took an initial step this week towards lifting a 37-year ban on extraditing its citizens to face prosecution in the United States. The move was seen as an effort to persuade the Trump administration to keep Colombia's preferential trade status. However, anti-drug officials in both countries dismissed the action as largely symbolic, given the many obstacles still remaining.

On Tuesday, the Colombian senate approved the first reading of a bill to revoke the constitutional prohibition on extraditing Colombian nationals. The bill still needs a second approval in the senate and must pass the lower house before going to voters in a referendum. Most analysts expect the measure will eventually pass but warn the process could take years.

The extradition ban was put in place in 1991 to shield Colombians from facing trial in the U.S. for drug trafficking offenses. Successive Colombian governments have refused U.S. requests to lift the ban, fearing a political backlash. However, Colombia's president Ivan Duque promised the Trump administration he would push for ending the prohibition in exchange for maintaining Colombia's trade privileges under the Generalized System of Preferences or GSP. 

U.S. and Colombian officials involved in anti-drug efforts welcomed the senate's vote but said extradition of major traffickers was still unlikely given the time required to implement legislative changes and the traffickers’ ability to delay cases. "This is an important gesture but the reality is extradition of significant figures is still quite distant,” said Jay Bergman, director of the DEA's Andean division. 

Colombia's chief anti-drug prosecutor agreed, telling reporters, "We have hundreds of drug traffickers we have requested for extradition to the U.S. but this will change nothing in the immediate term." He noted Colombia's high courts have set an extremely high bar for approving extraditions, saying they must not threaten the sovereignty or security of Colombia. "This essentially gives the traffickers limitless ways of avoiding extradition for many years to come," he said.

In the end, most experts viewed the senate's vote as an effort by Duque to gain leverage with the Trump administration to preserve GSP rather than the start of an aggressive new phase of cooperation. While an eventual end of the extradition ban would be hailed as a policy victory in Washington, its real-world impact may continue to depend on the pace of Colombia's legal processes and the ingenuity of its drug traffickers.
