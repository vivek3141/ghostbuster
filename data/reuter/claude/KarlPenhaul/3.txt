24 Dead in Weekend Clashes Between Colombian Soldiers and Rebels 

Violent clashes between Colombian soldiers and left-wing rebels over the weekend resulted in 24 deaths, the Colombian Ministry of Defense announced on Monday. Fierce fighting broke out in a remote jungle area of southern Colombia on Saturday morning and continued through Sunday afternoon. 

The clashes were between units of the Colombian army and members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the largest rebel group still active in Colombia's decades-long internal conflict. The FARC has been at war with the Colombian government for over 50 years in a conflict that has left over 220,000 people dead. While a peace agreement was reached in 2016 to end the war, splinter groups of FARC rebels have refused to lay down arms and fighting has continued in some parts of the country.

The mountainous region where the clashes took place this weekend has long been used by FARC rebels as a base of operations. According to military reports, soldiers were on a routine patrol in the area when they were ambushed by a group of around 60 rebels. Fighting lasted for several hours on Saturday before resuming again early Sunday morning in the same area. Aircraft and artillery support were called in to assist the embattled soldiers. 

By Sunday afternoon, military units gained control over the area after rebels retreated further into the surrounding mountains. In total, 14 soldiers and 10 rebels were killed in the fighting, the heaviest loss of life in a single weekend this year. An additional 23 soldiers were injured along with an unknown number of rebel casualties.

The weekend's events are a reminder of the tenuous peace that exists in Colombia and the risks still faced by its military in some parts of the country. While large-scale rebel activity has declined since the peace deal, smaller FARC units continue to clash periodically with soldiers, especially in remote areas where the government's control is limited. Overall, though, violence in Colombia has dropped sharply from its peak decades ago, offering hopes that further progress can be made in ending the long conflict completely.
