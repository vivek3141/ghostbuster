Colombia Moves Closer to Overturning Extradition Ban, Faces Backlash from Drug Traffickers  

The Colombian Senate approved legislation last week to permit the extradition of Colombian citizens for trial overseas for the first time in 30 years. The bill aims to make it easier for Colombia to extradite drug traffickers to the U.S. to face charges, part of an effort to boost security cooperation between the two countries. The bill faces further debate but is expected to pass Congress and be signed into law by President Ivan Duque, a close ally of the Trump administration.  

The extradition bill marks a major policy shift for Colombia which banned the extradition of nationals in 1991. The ban was put in place under threat from Pablo Escobar's Medellin Cartel, which conducted a bombing campaign to force the policy change. However, analysts say the new bill is a sign of the weakened state of Colombia's drug trafficking organizations today and the growing political will to take on these groups.

The legislation has faced opposition from some left-wing politicians who argue it undermines Colombia's sovereignty. However, public support for extradition has grown in recent years as Colombia's drug trade has fueled higher rates of violence. The bill puts restrictions on extradition including for political offenses and limits to one extradition request per person. The legislative debate has also been marred by threats from Colombia's two largest drug gangs, who have warned politicians there will be consequences if the bill passes.  

The U.S. strongly supports the extradition bill and has offered increased funding and training for Colombia's police and military in recent years. Ending the extradition ban would make it far easier for the U.S. to request the extradition of top drug traffickers captured in Colombia. The legislation may also disrupt the operations of drug gangs by making it more difficult for leaders to direct illicit activities from jail. However, some analysts argue extradition will not significantly impact Colombia’s drug trade as new traffickers will emerge to fill the void.

The extradition bill is expected to face further debate in Colombia's Congress over coming weeks before a final vote. If passed into law, it will mark a significant milestone in Colombia's long battle against drug trafficking—but also poses risks of increased violence as drug gangs push back against the policy change. The outcome will have major implications for security cooperation with the United States as the two countries work to curb the flow of drugs between South and North America.
