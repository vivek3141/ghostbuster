BP gives lukewarm reception to Colombian proposal for Piedemonte field  

Colombia's state-run oil firm Ecopetrol announced today a proposal to develop a strategic alliance with BP to explore and produce oil from the Piedemonte oil field and surrounding areas in eastern Colombia. The proposal would see Ecopetrol and BP form a joint venture, with Ecopetrol holding 60% and BP controlling the remaining 40%.

Ecopetrol executives hailed the offer as an opportunity for BP to expand its presence in Colombia's oil-rich eastern region and gain access to highly prospective oil blocks. However, BP's reception to the proposal seemed lukewarm, citing concerns over investment conditions and fiscal terms in Colombia. 

A BP spokesperson said the company would review the details of Ecopetrol's proposal but noted that its investments in any country depended on "competitive and stable regulatory, fiscal and contractual conditions that fairly equitably share risks and rewards between national oil companies and private partners." BP currently has offshore exploration rights in Colombia but has been frustrated with delays in licensing rounds for onshore blocks.

The Piedemonte field is located in the Llanos Basin, which produces over 550,000 barrels of oil per day, around 60% of Colombia’s total oil output. Ecopetrol estimates the field holds up to 2 billion barrels of proven and probable reserves. Accessing those reserves, however, requires intensive capital and technological capabilities that Ecopetrol believes it can gain through a partnership with an international oil major such as BP.

For its part, Ecopetrol insists the fiscal terms it is offering BP for the Piedemonte venture are highly competitive. The company's CEO Felipe Bayón said the proposal represents “a win-win opportunity for Ecopetrol and our strategic partner. It allows us to jointly unlock the enormous potential of this field, to the benefit of the country and our companies.”

The lukewarm reception from BP underscores the challenges Colombia faces in attracting foreign investment to boost its oil production and reserves. While the country's oil fields represent attractive opportunities, major international companies are pushing for more competitive conditions comparable to oil-producing countries such as Brazil, Mexico or Guyana. Ecopetrol and the Colombian government may need to go further to win over BP and deliver on the promise of the Piedemonte field.
