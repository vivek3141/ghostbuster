Colombian Labour Unions Refuse to Sign New Social Pact, Warn of Social Unrest in 1997  

Bogota, Colombia— The largest Colombian labour unions have refused to sign a new social pact proposed by the government of President Ernesto Samper, warning that Colombia may face social unrest in 1997 if economic policies do not change.

Leaders of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) and the Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CTC) rejected the social pact in meetings with government officials this week. The proposed pact aims to generate economic stability through wage controls and limits on strikes and protests. However, union leaders argue it fails to address rising unemployment, growing inequality, and declining living standards for most Colombians.

“This social pact is unacceptable and will only benefit large businesses and the economic elite,” said Carlos Rodríguez, president of the CGT, which represents over 500,000 workers. “It ignores the suffering of millions of Colombians who cannot find work or feed their families.” Colombia’s unemployment rate currently stands at 12%, the highest in Latin America.

The CTC, a long-time ally of Samper’s administration, also criticized the social pact for failing to include meaningful economic reforms. “We cannot tell workers to continue sacrificing their rights and living standards to support an economic model that has resulted in poverty and desperation,” said CTC leader Julio Roberto Gómez. The government’s economic policies have favoured privatization and free trade, which have weakened unions and left many workers behind. 

Government officials expressed regret at the unions’ refusal to sign the pact, arguing that it aims to benefit all Colombians by promoting stability and growth. However, many analysts interpret the unions’ rejection as a sign that the government has lost touch with poor and working-class citizens who are bearing the brunt of the country’s economic problems.
