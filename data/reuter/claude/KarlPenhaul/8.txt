Colombian Truckers End 11-Day Strike After Government Agrees to Partial Deal

Thousands of truck drivers in Colombia ended an 11-day nationwide strike on Tuesday after reaching a partial agreement with the government addressing demands for improved working conditions, lowered fuel costs, and reduced tolls.

The deal, negotiated late Monday, came after drivers caused major disruptions to the supply chain, leading to fuel and food shortages across the country. According to industry groups, the strike was costing Colombia more than $300 million per day amid halted trade and transport. 

As part of the agreement, the government agreed to eliminate an unpopular cargo tax and reduce tolls for truckers on national highways by 25 to 30 percent. However, talks on regulating freight prices and rates in Colombia stalled, prompting truckers to continue negotiating.

Javier Correa, president of the Colombian Association of Land Transporters, said the accord is an "important first step" but that truckers will continue pressing the government to address their broader concerns about the rising costs of operating heavy cargo vehicles in Colombia.

"This issue is not fully resolved," Correa said. "We will remain vigilant to ensure promises are kept and further talks yield solutions to the underlying problems."

The truckers' strike began on March 20 after an initial round of negotiations with the Ministry of Transport broke down. Drivers parked their rigs across highways and major roads throughout Colombia, disrupting businesses and exports.

Gas stations reported fuel shortages, and supermarkets struggled with lack of supplies during the work stoppage. Major port cities like Buenaventura and Barranquilla were hit hard by disruptions to shipping cargo. Production at oil refineries in Barrancabermeja also faced slowdowns due to lack of transport for their refined fuels.

In a bid to break the deadlock, Colombia's newly-elected President Iv√°n Duque met directly with trucking leaders over the weekend. Following the meeting, Duque announced a temporary reduction in tolls and the elimination of the controversial cargo tax on transport vehicles as a "gesture of goodwill" to end the crisis.

Most trucking groups responded positively and agreed to withdraw their rigs from roads and highways as negotiations continue. However, several hardliner associations said the government's offer was "insufficient" and vowed to push ahead with further disruptive actions until all their demands are met.

Duque praised the "openness and willingness to dialogue" from most trucking representatives following the partial deal. "We will continue working as a team to address their concerns, defend workers' rights and ensure the normal functioning of the economy," the President said in a televised statement.

The truckers' strike is the first major challenge for Duque, who took office last August promising to revive Colombia's economy and improve rural security. While the supply chain disruptions tested his administration's crisis response, resolving the work stoppage through negotiations and concessions is viewed as an early political win for the young President's negotiating tactics and leadership.
