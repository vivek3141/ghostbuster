Oil Workers' Union in Colombia Merges to Create Industry-Wide Front in Bid to Target Non-Unionized Workforce and Foreign Companies Operating in the Country  

Bogota, Colombiaâ€”The three largest oil workers' unions in Colombia announced a merger this week to create a single coordinating body representing over 30,000 workers across the country's oil and gas industry. The move is aimed at consolidating union power to target non-unionized sectors of the workforce as well as exert more pressure on foreign oil companies operating in Colombia.

The new organization will be called the Colombian Oil Workers Federation and will be helmed by leaders from the three legacy unions: the Petroleum Workers Union, the Union of Oil Industry Workers, and the Colombian Oil Workers Union. In a joint statement, the union leaders said the merger reflects the need for a "unified front" to advance workers' rights in Colombia's oil fields and refineries.   

Colombia has seen a boom in foreign investment in its oil industry over the last decade, especially in unconventional fields and fracking. The influx of overseas oil giants has brought more advanced technology and expertise but also introduced more temporary contract labor and non-unionized employment practices, union leaders argued. The new federation will push for more full-time, unionized jobs and seek to organize more temporary and contract workers.

The federation is also positioning itself to take a stronger stance against foreign companies like U.S.-based Occidental Petroleum and China's CNPC, which have growing operations in Colombia. Union leaders say foreign companies frequently pay lower wages and offer fewer benefits than the state-owned Ecopetrol. They are calling on the Colombian government to impose tougher regulations on overseas oil companies to ensure fair wages and good working conditions.

The newly merged union federation represents a formidable bloc that is likely to become a thornier issue for oil executives and policymakers in Colombia. However, some critics argue union demands may also raise costs for oil companies, potentially threatening new investment and job creation in the sector. The coming months will prove a key test as the new Colombian Oil Workers Federation rolls out its agenda.
