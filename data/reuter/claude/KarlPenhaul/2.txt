Colombia's Nationalistic Oil Workers' Union to Form Industry-Wide Super-Union with Smaller Labor Organizations  

Bogotá, Colombia - The National Oil Workers Union of Colombia (UNOC) announced today that it will be merging with three smaller labor unions to form a massive industry-wide federation representing over 50,000 oil and gas workers across the country. The new mega-union, to be called the Colombian Energy Workers Federation (CUTF), will consolidate UNOC along with the Colombian Petrochemical Workers Union, the National Union of Oil Transport Workers, and the Colombian Offshore Oil Workers Union.  

The creation of CUTF marks the largest labor organization in Colombia's hydrocarbons sector and represents nearly 85% of workers in the oil, gas, refining and petrochemical industries. UNOC Secretary General Pedro Velez hailed the merger as an "historic achievement that will give workers a unified voice and stronger power at the negotiating table." Critics argue, however, that the concentration of power within CUTF could enable labor disruption on a massive scale and may lead to more aggressive wage demands that could hurt Colombia's oil and gas companies.

UNOC has long advocated for greater state control of Colombia's oil and gas resources and believes that private foreign companies have exploited the nation's hydrocarbon wealth. The new super-union is expected to take an equally nationalistic stance and push for policy changes such as higher royalties and taxes on oil companies and limits to foreign ownership of strategic energy assets. 

The Santos administration welcomed the news of the mega-union as a sign of a maturing democratic process but warned against "extreme positions that could jeopardize Colombia's attractiveness for foreign investors." Private oil companies operating in Colombia, including Ecopetrol, ExxonMobil and Shell, declined to comment on CUTF's formation.

The new Colombian Energy Workers Federation will be headquartered in Bogotá and led by a 25-member executive board, with Pedro Velez serving as the union's first Secretary General. CUTF is expected to begin operating and representing workers in collective bargaining agreements by early next year.
