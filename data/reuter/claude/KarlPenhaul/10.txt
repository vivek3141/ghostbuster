International Coffee Organization Predicts Rise in Financial Risk Management as Just-in-Time Roasting and Inventory Cuts Sweep Consumer Countries

The International Coffee Organization (ICO) issued a report today predicting that coffee producers and traders will need to increase their use of financial risk management tools as the coffee industry adopts just-in-time roasting and lower inventory models. The ICO cautioned that these efficiencies, while reducing costs for roasters and improving freshness for consumers, also introduce more price volatility and supply chain risks that will require robust risk management and potentially futures and options contracts to hedge.

The report found that just-in-time coffee roasting, where green beans are roasted only after receiving a customer order instead of being pre-roasted and held in inventory, has become popular among small and specialty roasters. Larger commercial roasters have also cut inventory levels, in some cases up to 50% over the past decade. While reducing waste and storage costs, these practices mean there are fewer buffers in the supply chain to absorb price and supply shocks. “With lower inventories, the industry is more exposed to events like a frost or drought that damages a harvest,” said ICO Chief Economist Marco Aurelio.  

A good example of this increased exposure came in 2017 when Hurricane Maria devastated coffee farms in Puerto Rico, an important source of high-quality beans for specialty roasters in North America. Roasters who depended on just-in-time models and had little inventory on hand scrambled to source beans from elsewhere to fulfill orders and meet customer demand. The price of other specialty beans spiked briefly in response. According to the ICO report, in the era of just-in-time roasting, “such acute and unforeseen supply shortages could translate into price spikes as roasters bid up remaining supplies, even if the overall coffee market remains stable.”

To manage risks like this, the ICO recommends roasters and traders make greater use of tools like futures contracts, price collars, and long-term supplier agreements to secure supply and lock in prices when possible. Futures markets can allow industry actors to hedge price risks for up to two years in advance, protecting profit margins from market swings. When a hedge is not feasible, inventories should be built up during the lower-risk parts of the coffee season as a buffer.  

Consumer demand for ultra-fresh, specialty coffee is driving efficiency gains that introduce new challenges, the ICO noted. With prudent risk management and occasional acceptance of higher costs when hedge instruments cannot adequately protect from market events, the coffee industry can have the best of both worlds: high quality, specialty coffee delivered quickly to customers and stable, predictable costs for producers and roasters. Overall, the ICO predicted increased price stability and a sustainably profitably coffee industry if there is a broader adoption of risk management tools to match the spread of just-in-time roasting models.
