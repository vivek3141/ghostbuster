Colombia Faces Pressure to Reinstate Drug Lord Extradition Treaty with the US

The Colombian government is facing increasing pressure from the United States to reinstate an extradition treaty that allows the US to extradite accused Colombian drug lords to face charges in American courts. The treaty was suspended by Colombia's previous president Juan Manuel Santos in 2016 in order to secure a historic peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel group. 

With a new conservative president, Ivan Duque, now in power, the US sees an opportunity to revive the extradition pact. US Attorney General William Barr visited Bogota this week and urged Duque to reinstate the treaty, arguing that it is a vital tool for dismantling powerful drug cartels that continue to operate in Colombia. However, Duque faces a difficult balancing act. While he wants to appear tough on drug crime, extraditing kingpins may anger former FARC fighters who laid down their arms with the promise of more lenient treatment.

The extradition treaty between the two countries was signed in 1979 but has been hotly contested. Supporters argue it is necessary to bring major drug traffickers to justice, as powerful cartels have infiltrated Colombia's justice system and prisons. Opponents counter that it undermines Colombia's sovereignty and risks trials being politicized. When the treaty was suspended in 2016 as part of negotiations with FARC, the US criticized the move. Colombia extradited 62 suspected drug traffickers to the US last year, down from 115 in 2015 before the treaty was frozen.

A spokesperson for Duque said the government was "evaluating" the US request but had to consider the "complex situation" in Colombia. Duque will likely face pressure from within his own political party to take a harder line against drug crime. However, former FARC members are also demanding that the government honor its peace deal commitments. The future of the extradition treaty has once again thrust Colombia into the heart of the political debate over how to balance security, peace, and justice in the post-conflict era.
