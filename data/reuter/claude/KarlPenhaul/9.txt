Colombia Denies Investigation into BP Political Killing Accusations, But Inquiries Opened into Human Rights Abuses  

The Colombian government denied today that it is investigating allegations by human rights groups that BP was connected to paramilitary killings in Casanare, Colombia. However, the Colombian Attorney General’s office announced it is opening inquiries into alleged human rights abuses linked to the oil company’s operations in the region.  

BP has operated an oil pipeline in Casanare for over 20 years. Last month, two human rights organizations published reports alleging BP either knew about or directly supported violent actions by paramilitary groups against local residents who raised concerns about environmental damage and labor issues related to the pipeline. The groups claim up to 20 people were killed between 1996 to 2006 for opposing BP’s interests.

In a statement, the Colombian Ministry of Defense rejected the claims of any official investigation into BP's alleged role in the killings. "There is no evidence to support the irresponsible claims made against the company in these reports,” the statement said. However, the Attorney General’s office said today it is formally looking into “credible allegations of human rights violations related to BP’s operations” that warranted further investigation.

The inquiries will focus on three specific cases documented in the reports. One involves the killing of Hernando Ulrich Pérez, a journalist and community leader who spoke out about oil spills from the pipeline polluting local water supplies. Pérez was shot dead in 2001, with paramilitary groups later claiming responsibility. The other cases relate to two farmers and activists who protested against BP and were later killed by paramilitaries.

BP has denied any involvement with the killings and criticized the new inquiries. “We have repeatedly and categorically denied the false allegations made against BP, and have provided detailed evidence to the relevant authorities in Colombia demonstrating that we had no involvement,” said a BP spokesman. The company claims it has a strong human rights record in Colombia and has relied on government security forces to protect its operations.

Some analysts warn the new investigations could damage Colombia’s goal of increasing foreign investment in its oil sector. But human rights groups argue they are necessary to uncover the truth and gain justice for victims and their families. The findings of the Attorney General’s inquiries are expected within three to six months.
