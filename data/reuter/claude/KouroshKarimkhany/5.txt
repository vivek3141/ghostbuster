Apple Reports Surprise Profit in Fourth Quarter, Stock Price Jumps in After-Hours Trading   

Apple Inc. stunned Wall Street today by reporting a surprise $6 billion profit in the fourth quarter versus analysts' expectations of a loss. The unexpected positive earnings sent Apple's stock price soaring more than 7 percent in after-hours trading. 

The quarterly earnings report came as a shock to industry analysts who were bracing for Apple's first loss in over a decade. The technology giant had warned investors three months ago that delayed iPhone launches would significantly impact quarterly revenue and profits. However, brisk sales in China and strong performance in Apple's services category led to a profitable quarter.

Apple reported fourth quarter net income of $6 billion, or $1.24 per share, compared with $16.9 billion, or $3.24 per share, in the same period last year. Revenue fell to $97.3 billion from $111.4 billion. Analysts had forecast a loss of 15 cents per share on revenue of $86.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

"This quarter for Apple was largely about timing and recalibrating expectations. Despite strong headwinds from a delayed iPhone 12 lineup, Apple showed its underlying resilience and strength with strong performance in Greater China as well as in several other product categories,” said JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee.  

Apple's iPhone revenue declined more than 20 percent from a year earlier, but sales in China grew. The company's services division, which includes the App Store, iCloud and other businesses, generated $15.8 billion in revenue, up 16 percent from a year ago. That division is a growing part of Apple’s total sales and also enjoys higher profit margins.

On a call with analysts, Apple CEO Tim Cook said new iPhones were released in October and November this year, much later than in previous years. But he said early demand for new models like the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max was very strong.
