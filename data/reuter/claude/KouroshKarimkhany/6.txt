Apple Reports Unexpected Profit for Last Quarter of Fiscal Year

Apple Inc. reported quarterly earnings on Tuesday that exceeded Wall Street expectations and sent the company's stock soaring in after-hours trading. The results, which reflected continued strong demand for iPhones and other products, came as Apple heads into the crucial holiday shopping season.

The Cupertino, Calif., company on Tuesday posted revenue of $73.1 billion and profit of $2.86 a share in its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Sept. 28, easily topping forecasts and surpassing the year-earlier period. Revenue grew 2% from a year earlier, helped by new iPhone models launched in September, the first full quarter of sales for the iPhone 11 lineup. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated revenue of $72.2 billion and earnings of $2.76 a share.

The results fueled optimism among investors and analysts that a new lineup of iPhones can help put Apple back on an upward trajectory after years of slowing sales. The results indicate Apple has faced fewer of the trade tensions and budget-conscious consumer behavior that led the company to warn late last year of disappointing iPhone sales. Analysts expect iPhone sales for the year will remain flat, but Apple's array of other products, from the Apple Watch to its services business, are expected to keep boosting revenue.

Apple's shares, which rose 0.8% to close at $248.45 in 4 p.m. trading Tuesday, were up nearly 3% at $255 in after-hours trading following the earnings release.

Apple's revenue growth surprised Wall Street because it comes despite continuing decline in iPhone sales. Apple said it generated $11.2 billion in revenue from its flagship product in the quarter, an improvement from earlier in the year but down from $14.3 billion in the year-earlier period. The contrast suggests users continue flocking to services like Apple Music and the App Store, which generated $12.5 billion in quarterly revenue, up 18% from a year earlier.

The results show Apple continues to weather uncertain times, with trade and economic concerns tempering business investment. They also reflect signs the company's newest iPhones are resonating with customers. Apple launched new models in September, including the iPhone 11, priced at $700, $50 less than its predecessor.

Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said the results reflected excitement for new products and services as the company eyes future technologies like 5G and augmented reality. "We concluded a groundbreaking fiscal 2019 with our highest Q4 revenue ever, fueled by accelerating growth from services, wearables and Mac," Mr. Cook said.
