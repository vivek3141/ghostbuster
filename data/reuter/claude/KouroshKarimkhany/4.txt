Apple Computer Inc Expects Turnaround After Reporting Loss in Q4 

Apple Computer Inc reported a loss for the fourth quarter ended September 30, marking the second straight quarter in the red for the Cupertino-based tech giant. However, executives expressed optimism that new product launches will help the company return to profitability soon.

Apple posted a net loss of $17.1 million, or 12 cents a share, compared with a profit of $11.5 million, or 8 cents a share, in the same period last year. Revenues declined 8% to $6.22 billion. The results were slightly worse than analysts had expected. 

The disappointing numbers came amid a broader slowdown in the personal computer industry. However, Apple CEO Tim Cook noted that two of the company's main driver categories - the iPad and iPhone - continued to show strong growth. Unit sales of the iPad increased by over 40% compared to last year, while the new iPhone 12 models saw double-digit percentage gains in sales versus the previous version.

"While this quarter's results were still not where we want them to be, I'm optimistic going into the holiday season and 2021," Cook said on a conference call with analysts. "We have the strongest product lineup in Apple's history, from the all-new iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini, to the most advanced iPad Air ever, to powerful new Macs with our M1 chip."

Apple expects the delayed launch of the iPhone 12 models, which started shipping in October, to impact financial results for the current quarter. However, analysts are bullish on a rebound in the coming months due to pent-up demand for the 5G-enabled iPhones and optimism around an economic recovery in 2021 aided by COVID-19 vaccines. 

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said "Apple is poised to have a massive pent-up iPhone 12 supercycle over the next 6 to 9 months that will vault shares to new heights." He expects over 225 million iPhone upgrades over the next year, which would represent the largest upgrade cycle for Apple since 2015.

Shares of Apple stock rose 3.2% in after-hours trading following the earnings release, suggesting investors agreed with management's view that the company is well-positioned going forward with its product pipeline and anticipated 5G-driven iPhone refresh. With new Macs, iPads, and iPhones hitting the market before the end of 2020, Apple seems poised for a turnaround and return to growth in the new year.
