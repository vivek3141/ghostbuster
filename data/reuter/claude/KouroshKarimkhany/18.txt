Apple Reaffirms Commitment to Corporate Markets with New Business Products and Technologies 

Apple Inc. announced a slate of new hardware and software updates targeted at business and enterprise customers. The tech giant is looking to reestablish itself as a trusted partner for corporations and shed the perception that it primarily focuses on consumer technologies and devices.

At a press event today, Apple unveiled upgraded iPad Pro tablets with larger screen sizes, more powerful components, and improved connectivity for remote access. The new iPad Pros are designed to serve as both primary computing devices as well as complements to traditional laptops. They feature enhanced security and device management tools to appeal to IT departments.

Apple also previewed the next version of its macOS operating system, with additional security and productivity features for business users. macOS Mojave will allow iPhone apps to run on Mac computers, providing a more consistent experience across Apple devices. New tools will make it easier for developers to port iOS apps to the Mac.

On the services side, Apple announced expanded enterprise-focused mobile device management, identity management, and cloud storage options. The company is partnering with leading providers like Cisco, Accenture, and GE Digital to integrate Apple technologies into workplace solutions. Apple said customer data and privacy will remain top priorities in these business services.

The moves are part of Apple’s broader strategy to diversify revenue streams as the global smartphone market slows. While iPhones still generate the majority of Apple’s profits, sales growth has plateaued. Targeting business clients is a key element of Apple’s plan to fuel future growth and make its products indispensable for both personal and professional use.

Corporate leaders at the event praised Apple’s renewed focus on their needs. But some analysts noted Apple will face an uphill battle as companies have been slower to adopt Apple products and already have longstanding relationships with competitors such as Microsoft and Dell. Meeting the demanding requirements of enterprise IT will require Apple to step out of its comfort zone. If successful, though, Apple could unlock a lucrative new customer base.
