Novell to License Key Technology to Other Software Companies for Revenue Expansion 

Novell Inc., a technology company based in Provo, Utah, announced today that it will begin licensing some of its proprietary software technologies to other software companies. The move is part of Novell’s strategy to expand revenue streams beyond its traditional products like network operating systems and collaboration software.

Two key technologies that will be licensed to third parties are Novell’s identity and security management systems and its file and storage management solutions. Novell has developed advanced technologies in both of these areas over decades to support its flagship networking products. However, with the rise of cloud computing and a services-based technology industry, Novell sees an opportunity to monetize these technologies through licensing deals.

“We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of engineering hours building world-class technologies to support our core networking and collaboration products,” said Bob Flynn, Novell’s CEO. “We now have an opportunity to generate new revenue and expand these technologies through licensing partnerships with companies that are building the next generation of cloud services, security solutions, and storage systems.”  

Novell did not announce any specific licensing deals today but said it is in active discussions with multiple software companies. Novell’s technology licensing model will include upfront licensing fees as well as ongoing revenue sharing or royalty payments based on usage or sales volumes. Novell expects technology licensing to generate $50 to $100 million in new revenue over the next three years.  

The new licensing model is a shift for Novell, which has historically built all of its products and services on its own proprietary technologies. However, with the company’s revenue growth slowing in recent years, licensing represents an opportunity for new revenue streams that complement Novell’s existing business. The company expects its traditional networking and collaboration software and services to remain the bulk of its revenue for the foreseeable future.

Some industry analysts view Novell’s announcement as a smart strategic move that will help reinvigorate revenue growth. “Licensing unused but proven technologies is a great way for companies like Novell to get more value from their investments,” said Brian Moore, an analyst at Moor Insights & Consulting. “If executed well, Novell’s licensing deals could expand the company into new, fast-growing markets and potentially land major new customers for its services offerings over the long term.”

The market reaction to Novell’s announcement was positive, with the company’s stock price rising 3.4% on the news. Investors appear optimistic that new technology licensing revenue can strengthen Novell’s financial position as its legacy businesses face slowing growth. The success of Novell’s new model, though, will depend on how quickly the company can sign licensing partners and ramp up revenue—and whether software companies view Novell’s technologies as compelling enough to pay for.
