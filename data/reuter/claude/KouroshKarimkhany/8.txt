Apple Surprises Wall Street with $25 Million Profit for Q4   

In a surprise announcement Tuesday, Apple reported generating $25 million in profit for the fourth quarter ending September 30, 2017. Analysts had been expecting a decline in profit for the quarter due to sluggish iPhone X sales and production delays with Apple's new smartwatch. However, strong performances from other products and services made up for the shortfall.  

Apple's profit amounted to $4.75 per diluted share, compared with $9 billion, or $1.67 per diluted share, in the same quarter last year. Revenue rose 12 percent to $52.6 billion from $46.9 billion. International sales accounted for 62 percent of the quarterâ€™s revenue.

While iPhone sales were down 5 percent from a year earlier due to production problems, revenue from Apple's services division jumped 34 percent as the company's base of device owners continued to grow. The company also saw strong demand for other products like the iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch which brought in a combined $12.5 billion in revenue, up 22 percent year over year.

"We're very optimistic about this quarter and what we're seeing out there with consumer appetites for our products and services," said CEO Tim Cook in an interview. "While the challenges around the iPhone X were frustrating, we had already planned to diversity our product line, and the success of Apple Watch Series 3, AirPods, and the new iPad demonstrates we made the right moves."

The quarter capped another record-breaking year for the world's most valuable publicly traded company. Annual revenue rose 6 percent to $229.2 billion, and profit increased 2 percent to $48.4 billion. For the year, iPhone sales were about flat while revenue from services jumped 34 percent. About 610 million people now subscribe to at least one Apple service.

Shares of Apple jumped over 4 percent in after-hours trading following the earnings release. The company's stock price has gained about 50 percent in the past year, making Apple the first American company to surpass $900 billion in market capitalization. With momentum in China and India as well other emerging markets, Apple looks poised to continue its growth into 2019, although the company will also face competitive pressures from rivals like Samsung and upstart tech firms. Overall, Wall Street appeared relieved that Apple ended the year on a high note despite some challenges, signaling the company's ability to pivot and find new sources of growth.
