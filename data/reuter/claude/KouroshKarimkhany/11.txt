Apple Unveils New Affordable Portable Computer for Students

At a special event today at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California, Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled an all-new entry-level laptop computer, called the MacBook Student. The new MacBook Student, which starts at just $699, is aimed at students and educators with its lower price point and features designed specifically for the education market. 

"For many students across the country, having access to technology is critical to learning and achieving great things," said Cook. "The MacBook Student will help tear down barriers that stand in the way of student creativity and potential. It's an affordable, lightweight, and powerful laptop made just for students."

The MacBook Student has a 13.3-inch high-resolution Retina display, up to 10 hours of battery life, and the latest Intel processors, enabling high performance for everyday tasks like web browsing, document editing, and streaming music or video. Unlike the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, the MacBook Student does not have a TouchBar or Touch ID fingerprint sensor, lowering the component cost. The laptop comes in space gray and weighs just 2.7 pounds.

With education pricing, the MacBook Student starts at $699 for a model with 8 gigabytes of memory and 128 gigabytes of storage. For $899, students and educators can purchase a model with 16 gigabytes of memory and 256 gigabytes of storage, a 25% discount from the regular consumer pricing of $1,199. Additional discounts are available for bulk purchases by schools.

"The new MacBook Student is incredibly capable, with outstanding performance, battery life, display, and moreâ€”all at an affordable price," said Katie Cotton, Apple's vice president of worldwide corporate communications. "We think it's going to make a huge difference for students who want a lightweight, powerful, and beautiful laptop at an affordable cost."

School administrators attending the event welcomed the announcement of the new more affordable Mac laptop. "Issuing an Apple laptop to every student has been cost-prohibitive for our district, even with education discounts," said Mark Steinmetz, superintendent of schools for Clarkstown Central School District in New York. "The lower-cost MacBook Student now makes that goal achievable."

The MacBook Student is available for pre-order starting today on Apple.com and in the Apple Store app. The laptop will begin shipping to customers and be in retail stores next week. For education customers, Apple is also including a free pair of Beats Studio3 Wireless headphones with the purchase of any MacBook Student.
