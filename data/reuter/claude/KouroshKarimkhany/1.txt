Yahoo! Reports Better-Than-Expected Q3 Results Due to Surge in Internet Ad Revenue 

Yahoo! Inc. reported adjusted Q3 earnings per share of $0.20, beating analysts' estimates by $0.02. The better-than-expected results were driven by a surge in internet advertising revenue tied to Yahoo's core advertising business as well as its investment in the Alibaba Group.

Yahoo's total revenue for the quarter rose 5% year over year to $1.12 billion, beating the average forecast of $1.11 billion. The strong revenue growth was attributed primarily to the company's core advertising revenue, which grew 10% compared to the same quarter last year. Advertising revenue from Yahoo's mobile platforms grew over 100% from last year. Revenue from search advertising partners, like Microsoft's Bing, also delivered double-digit growth.

On the earnings call, CEO Marissa Mayer credited Yahoo's push into mobile and video advertising for the strong growth in the quarter. "Yahoo has reinvented the company and built products that delight and attract users, creating growth in mobile, social, and video," Mayer said. Mayer also highlighted Yahoo Finance as a top performer, citing 25% year-over-year growth in the finance vertical.

The results handily beat the rather gloomy expectations for Yahoo's quarterly performance. There were concerns about slowing internet advertising growth across the industry as well as competition from digital ad giants like Google and Facebook. Yahoo has struggled in recent years to keep up with shifts to mobile internet usage and competition from rival tech companies.  

Yahoo still faces significant challenges ahead to achieve Mayer's goal of turning the company into a "growth company" again. However, the Q3 results point to Yahoo's advertising business stabilizing and key initiatives like the focus on mobile, video, and Yahoo Finance starting to pay off. Yahoo shareholders reacted positively to the earnings beat, sending shares up over 6% in after-hours trading. The stock has already gained over 50% so far this year.

The better-than-expected results and bullish share price reaction provided a rare earnings win that Yahoo badly needed. If the company can build on this momentum, Mayer may have a shot at turning around the internet pioneer. But sustainable long-term growth remains uncertain for the company in an increasingly competitive digital advertising market. Overall, Yahoo's Q3 provides a glimmer of hope after years of strugglesâ€”but more progress is still needed.
