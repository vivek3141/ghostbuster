Tandem Computer Inc to Introduce Line of Servers Based on Personal Computer Technology for Internet-based Business Applications 

Tandem Computer Inc, a subsidiary of Compaq Computer Corp, announced today that it will introduce a new line of servers based on personal computer technology to target the growing market for Internet-based business applications. The new servers will run Windows NT, a Microsoft operating system, on Intel's Pentium II processors, the same chips used in many PCs.

This move marks a major strategic shift for Tandem, which has traditionally specialized in proprietary minicomputers for "mission-critical" corporate data processing where even a short downtime can be very costly. While Tandem's systems are renowned for their reliability and robustness, their specialized technology has made them more expensive than typical PC-based servers. 

By using more standard PC components, Tandem hopes to cut prices by up to 50% and significantly expand its potential customer base to include more small and mid-sized businesses. "This is really about Tandem participating fully in one of the fastest growing segments of the computer market," said Jill Peters, Tandem's Chief Marketing Officer. She estimates the market for Intel-based servers running Windows NT will grow by 50% this year alone.

Some analysts remain skeptical, however, that Tandem can compete effectively against established PC server makers like Dell and Compaq itself. "Moving to a new architecture is challenging and Tandem faces a risky transition," said Todd Nelson of Gartner Group. "Success will depend on aggressively boosting sales volumes to drive down costs while maintaining the reliability and service quality that Tandem is known for." Tandem believes its expertise in highly scaleable, redundant systems and worldwide service organizations will continue to differentiate it even as it adopts more standard components.

The new servers, called the Tandem 3000 line, will be available in 1- to 8-processor configurations scaling from 2GB to 16TB of storage. Prices will start at approximately $25,000. The first models will begin shipping in early August, in time for the company's annual users conference. At the conference, Tandem also plans to announce expanded offerings of industry-specific solutions for banking, telecommunications, and retail sectors built on top of the Windows NT based servers.
