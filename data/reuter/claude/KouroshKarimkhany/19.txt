American Express Co. Expected to Buy Struggling Financial Management Software Company Intuit Inc. 

American Express Co. is in advanced talks to acquire Intuit Inc., maker of the popular TurboTax tax preparation software and QuickBooks accounting software, according to people familiar with the matter. A deal would combine two major players in the financial technology sector that have partnered for years. Intuit's shares rose more than 15% on the news.

Intuit has been struggling in recent years as its key small business customers have faced economic headwinds. The company's stock price has declined nearly 30% from its peak in 2018. Meanwhile, American Express has been looking for new ways to expand beyond its traditional credit and charge card businesses. Acquiring Intuit would give American Express access to Intuit's large customer base of individuals and small businesses and open up opportunities to market more products to them.

The two companies already have an existing partnership. Since 2000, Intuit's TurboTax has offered American Express credit cards as a payment method and provided cardholder discounts and bonuses. American Express representatives have also frequently appeared at Intuit's large small business customer conferences.

According to sources, American Express would pay a premium of at least 30% over Intuit's current stock price, valuing the company at over $60 billion. The deal would likely be a mix of cash and American Express shares. Buying Intuit would be American Express's largest acquisition by far in over two decades. American Express last made a sizable acquisition in 2001 when it bought debt recovery firm Creditrust Corp. for $240 million.

The acquisition of Intuit still needs to be approved by government regulators. There may be some concern about reduced competition, since Intuit and American Express operate in adjacent financial sectors. However, early indications are regulators may approve the deal with only minor conditions, sources said.

Both American Express and Intuit declined to comment on "market rumors and speculation." However, in response to the news, American Express shares dropped 3% in morning trading as investors absorbed the costs of a potential massive acquisition, while Intuit shares surged on the prospect of a buyout at a substantial premium. The markets will be closely watching for further developments on a deal that could reshape the financial technology landscape.
