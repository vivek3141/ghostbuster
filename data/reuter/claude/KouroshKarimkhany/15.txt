Apple Slashes Prices on Power Macintosh Computers by Up to 30 Percent to Compete with Rivals 

In an effort to boost flagging computer sales and better compete with lower-priced rivals, Apple Computer Inc. today announced major price cuts of up to 30 percent on its Power Macintosh personal computer line. The price reductions are some of the deepest ever offered by Apple on its powerful desktop computers that run the Macintosh operating system.

The steepest cuts are on Apple's midrange and high-end Power Macintosh models, with the Power Macintosh 7500 model dropping $1,000 to $2,999. The Power Macintosh 8500 will fall $1,500 to $3,999. The top-of-the-line Power Macintosh 9500 model will be reduced $2,000 to $4,999. The price cuts represent reductions of 25 to 30 percent. 

"We needed to make a bold move to increase demand and spur new sales of our Power Macintosh line," said Gilbert F. Amelio, Apple's chairman and chief executive, in a statement. "These price reductions put our Power Mac desktops within reach of more customers and will make us more competitive with Windows-based PCs."

The price cuts are the latest in a series of reductions that Apple has made this year as part of its comeback effort under Amelio. Earlier this year, Apple slashed prices on its entry-level desktop computers by up to 38 percent and reduced prices on its PowerBook notebook models by up to 16 percent. 

However, the price cuts today highlight how Apple continues to struggle against the dominance of competitors like Dell Computer and Gateway 2000, which can undercut Apple's prices because they use the ubiquitous Microsoft Windows operating system and Intel microprocessors. Power Macintosh computers are based on the PowerPC chip developed by Motorola and IBM and utilize Apple's proprietary Mac operating system, which accounts for only about 5 percent of the overall PC market.
