Vantive Corp. Plunges 24% on Forecasts of Slowing Revenue Growth Due to Staff Shortage 

Shares of Vantive Corp., a software consulting firm based in San Jose, California, fell 24% on Tuesday after the company lowered its revenue forecasts for the current quarter and full year, citing difficulties in hiring enough engineers and consultants to meet customer demand.

Vantive said in a statement it now expects revenue for the fourth quarter ending December 31 to be between $520 million and $540 million, down from its previous guidance of $580 million to $600 million. For the full year, the company reduced its revenue target to a range of $2.12 billion to $2.14 billion from $2.2 billion to $2.24 billion previously.  

The lowered forecasts reflect constraints in hiring and onboarding technical staff, according to Vantive CEO Brian Smith. “While demand for our services remains robust, we have not been able to scale our workforce as quickly as needed due to a tight labor market,” Smith said. He added it now takes 60-90 days to hire experienced software engineers and consultants, about 50% longer than a year ago.   

The slowdown in hiring is putting pressure on Vantive’s ability to take on new projects and is forcing the company to delay starting some existing contracts, Chief Financial Officer Rebecca Jones said on a conference call with analysts. She noted revenue growth has slowed to about 15-20% currently from over 30% a year earlier.   

In response, Vantive said it plans to boost hiring incentives, expand university recruiting, and open two new satellite offices in lower-cost locations. The company also will cut costs by delaying or cancelling some non-essential projects. But analysts warned the effects of these actions may take several quarters to translate into improved revenue momentum.

“Vantive faces some near-term headwinds that will be difficult to overcome quickly,” said James Smith of JPMorgan in a note to clients. He downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “overweight” and cut his price target to $42 from $52. Vantive shares tumbled $11.81 to close at $37.49, their biggest one-day drop since 2015. Nearly 50 million shares changed hands, more than four times the average daily volume over the past month.
