Cisco Reports Strong Sales and 77% Surge in Fiscal Q1 Profit from Operations 

Networking giant Cisco Systems Inc. reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Wednesday, fueled by strength in its security business and solid demand for its networking gear and services.

Cisco said profit from operations jumped 77% in the fiscal first quarter ended Oct. 28, driven by its growing focus on software and subscription-based offerings. Revenue rose 7% to $13.1 billion, above analysts' estimates of $12.86 billion.

"We delivered a strong start to fiscal 2020, executing well with solid revenue and profit growth," Cisco Chief Executive Chuck Robbins said in a statement.

Cisco's shares rose 4.8% in extended trading. They have gained 23% so far this year, outperforming the broader S&P 500 Index.

The San Jose, California-based company has been transforming itself from a hardware-focused equipment provider to one that offers more software and subscription services to clients to boost profit margins and make revenue more predictable.

Software subscriptions, which provide recurring revenue, rose 10% in the quarter. Revenue from software and services, which Cisco sees as indicators of future network equipment demand, contributed $5.94 billion, or 45% of its total revenue.  

Cisco's security business, which offers firewall protection and breach detection systems, posted sales of $749 million, up 21% from a year earlier. Revenue growth from its infrastructure platforms business, which includes networking equipment, was 3%.

In a call with analysts, Cisco executives said sales growth was broad-based across regions in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer said recent U.S.-China trade tensions did not significantly impact the quarter. But Cisco is continuing to monitor potential supply chain issues, she added.

Cisco forecast revenue in the current quarter to grow in the 4% to 6% range, and profit to increase 9% to 15%. Analysts were expecting a revenue increase of 4.3% and profit rise of 7.8%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
