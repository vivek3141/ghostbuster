Barrick Gold Boosts Toronto Market to Record High With Negotiations for Indonesian Gold Deposit 

Shares in Barrick Gold Corp jumped nearly 15% today, propelling the Toronto Stock Exchange to an all-time high. The surge came as Barrick announced it is in advanced negotiations with Indonesian officials to acquire a major gold and copper deposit in the country. If finalized, the deal would give Barrick access to an estimated 28 million ounces of gold and 18 billion pounds of copper in the Grasberg mine.

Barrick has been looking to boost declining gold reserves in recent years through mergers and acquisitions. The Grasberg mine is seen as an ideal target, with huge untapped reserves and the potential for decades of mining activity. “This would be a transformative acquisition for Barrick and position us as the world’s largest gold and copper mining company,” said Barrick CEO Mark Bristow in a statement.

Barrick’s stock price jumped $3.14 to $24.32, the highest level since mid-2015. The rally helped push the overall Toronto market up 342 points to 17,925, surpassing the previous record close of 17,559 set in October 2019. “The Barrick news has lifted the materials sector and is fuelling momentum in the broader market,” said CIBC analyst Ian Ramcharan. “Investors have been hungry for a big deal, and this delivers in spades if it goes through.”

Not everyone welcomed the announcement, however. Environmental and indigenous groups in Indonesia have long protested against the Grasberg mine, citing pollution concerns and the displacement of local communities. The Indonesian government currently owns a 51% stake in the mine, with the remaining 49% held by Phoenix-based Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Under the deal being discussed, Barrick would acquire Freeport’s share of the mine. Final approval from the Indonesian government is still needed before any transfer of ownership could proceed. 

While nothing is certain yet, investors reacted enthusiastically to the prospect of Barrick securing such a prized asset. If negotiations conclude successfully, the deal may cement Barrick’s status as the world’s most valuable gold miner and open up a new growth pipeline for years to come. For now, shareholders and the wider market seem happy to celebrate the potential for this mining mega-merger.
