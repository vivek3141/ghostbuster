Investors Continue to Show Confidence in Canadian Stocks with 50th Record Close This Year  

Canadian stocks reached their 50th record closing high for 2019 today as investor confidence in the country's economy and corporate earnings continues to push markets to new heights. The S&P/TSX Composite Index rose 0.3% to finish at 17,345, surpassing the previous record close from just yesterday. The 50 record finishes so far this year is the most since 2008 and reflects the optimism investors have in the prospects for Canadian public companies.

The financial, energy, and technology sectors led the gains today. Top performers included Royal Bank, up 1.2%, Enbridge Inc., gaining 0.7%, and Shopify Inc., rising 4.3%. The positive momentum continues a trend over the last several months of steady gains across sectors as trade tensions with China and the U.S have eased and economic data has suggested continued stable growth.  

"It's been an impressive year for Canadian stocks with broad-based strength," said Craig Featherstone, Portfolio Manager at TD Wealth Management. "Earnings have largely beat expectations, inflation and interest rates remain low, and consumers continue to drive activity. Barring any unforeseen shocks, we think the overall trend of gains will continue through to year end."

The 50 record highs come despite some ongoing global risks, including Brexit, tensions with Iran, and trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. However, investors have remained confident in the relative stability of the Canadian economy. The unemployment rate remains near record low levels, inflation is tracking at a healthy 2% target, and the Bank of Canada has indicated interest rates will remain on hold for the foreseeable future. Canadian companies have also delivered solid earnings for the most recent quarter, beating analysts' expectations.  

"The investment case for Canadian equities remains attractive," said Jennifer Lee, Senior Economist at BMO Capital Markets. "Valuations are reasonable, yields are competitive, and companies are producing good results. All signs point to another year of decent returns in 2020 if volatility remains contained."

Barring substantial new threats to the global economic outlook or trade relationships, most analysts expect the positive momentum in Canadian stocks to continue through the end of the year and into 2020. While records may not be broken at the current pace, investor optimism stemming from a stable economy and positive earnings should help support more gains to come.
