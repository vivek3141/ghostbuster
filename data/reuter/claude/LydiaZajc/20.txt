Toronto Stock Exchange closes mixed, key index stays above 6000 mark 

The Toronto Stock Exchange closed mixed today with the benchmark Canadian Composite Index staying above the psychologically important 6000 level, closing at 6013.92 points. The index was up 3.13 points or 0.05% on moderate trading volume. 

Many observers see the 6000 level as an important threshold, and the index has flirted with that level over the past few weeks as markets remain volatile in the face of ongoing global trade tensions and political uncertainty. The fact that the index closed slightly higher today and held above that level was seen as a modestly positive signal by market participants.

The Canadian technology sector saw the largest gains, with the TSE Technology Index up 0.8%. Major movers included BlackBerry which rose 3.7% and Shopify which gained 2.6%. The health care and financials sectors also saw solid gains. In contrast, the materials sector dropped 1.1% on weakness in mining and forestry shares.

The Canadian dollar slid 0.3 cents to 74.12 cents US as the U.S. dollar broadly strengthened against major currencies. The plunge in oil prices also weighed on the loonie. Crude oil futures dropped over 2% to just over $51 US per barrel for January delivery, the lowest level in over a year. Energy stocks on the TSX fell 1.2% on the oil price decline.

South of the border, U.S. markets were mixed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 0.2% while the S&P 500 inched up 0.1% to a new record high close. Markets remain focused on trade talks with China which are expected to yield either a limited deal or delay more tariff action. However, a comprehensive trade deal still seems elusive at this point.

Market participants are also keeping an eye on the U.S. Federal Reserve which is expected to leave interest rates unchanged after its meeting wraps up tomorrow. The Fed has cut rates three times this year in a so-called ‘mid-cycle adjustment’ but signaled it will likely pause to assess the impact. Economists will be focused on the tone of the Fed statement for clues on the future path of rates.

The mixed close today suggests some uncertainty remains, but as long markets hold above the 6000 level, the longer-term uptrend appears intact for the TSX. The technology and healthcare sectors remain bright spots, though oil price weakness and trade risks continue to pose challenges. Overall, markets seem to be in a holding pattern waiting for more clarity on trade or other issues.
