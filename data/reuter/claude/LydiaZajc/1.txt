Lower profits from base metals producers weigh down Canadian corporate earnings  

Major Canadian companies are reporting slower profit growth in the latest quarter, dragged down by weaker results from base metals producers and energy companies. Profits were up just 0.6% in the fourth quarter from the same period a year earlier, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That's the slowest pace since 2016 and below the 5-year average of 7.4%.  

Base metals producers like Teck Resources, First Quantum Minerals and Hudbay Minerals have been hit hard by declining prices for copper, zinc and other metals in recent months. Teck, Canada's largest diversified miner, said profit fell 60% in the fourth quarter. First Quantum reported a 29% drop in earnings. Lower production at some operations also weighed on results.

The energy sector continues to struggle with low oil prices and lack of pipeline capacity. Suncor Energy's net earnings declined by 55%, while Cenovus Energy swung to a loss. However, pipeline bottlenecks showed some signs of easing, enabling more production to come online. Natural gas producers benefited from a colder-than-expected winter, which boosted heating demand.

In contrast, Canada's big banks delivered strong results, lifted by higher interest rates and growth in residential mortgages. Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Montreal all posted profit gains of at least 6% from a year ago. The banks also benefited from tax cuts in the U.S., where some of them have operations.

Economists expect profit growth to pick up for Canadian companies this year but remain relatively modest. While low unemployment and solid economic growth are supportive, trade tensions with China and the U.S. as well as slowing global growth pose risks. The Bank of Canada noted recently that weaker commodity prices and a slowdown in housing activity are starting to weigh on business sentiment. Still, corporate tax cuts in Canada could boost bottom lines, as could stabilizing commodity prices if global growth stabilizes.  

In summary, weaker base metals prices and a slow recovery in energy weighed on Canadian corporate profits in the latest quarter. Banks and some other sectors fared better, but overall profit growth was anemic. The outlook is for a modest pickup this year, but risks like trade tensions and slowing growth remain. Tax cuts and stabilizing commodity prices could help, but Canada's economy remains dependent on global conditions.
