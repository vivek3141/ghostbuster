Toronto Stocks Soften on Sell-Off in Financial Services Amid Record-High Trading Volume 

The Toronto Stock Exchange saw a pullback Wednesday as a drop in financial services stocks amid heightened volatility led Canada's main equity index lower. The S&P/TSX Composite fell 0.3% or 50 points to close at 16,525.

The decline came as trading volume on the exchange reached a new record. More than 472 million shares changed hands, fueled by sell-offs in major bank stocks. The heavyweight financials group, which makes up about a third of the TSX, declined 1.2%. Bank of Nova Scotia and Royal Bank of Canada fell 2.3% and 1.8% respectively. Some analysts attributed the drop to investors taking profits from the sector's strong run this year.

Healthcare, energy and materials stocks also weakened, overshadowing gains in technology, consumer staples and telecom groups. The tech sector added 1.9%, with CGI Inc. and Shopify Inc. posting 5.5% and 3.9% increases.  

The negative sentiment spilled over from U.S. markets, where stocks fell the most in a month as coronavirus fears and election uncertainty rattled investors. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both dropped 3.5%. The declines raised doubts that the record-setting rally seen in recent weeks can continue.

"The markets have come quite a long way without much of a breather," said Elvis Picardo, portfolio manager at Luft Financial. "Even the most ardent bull will acknowledge the vulnerability to a pullback given how far and how fast we've risen."

Gold continued its recent surge, gaining 1.2% to $1,946 per ounce. The precious metal is seen as a hedge against volatility and inflation. The Canadian dollar weakened 0.7 cents to 74.94 cents US amid the risk-off sentiment.

All in all, the day's trading highlighted the fragile and precarious nature of the equity market rebound, even as more progress is made in reopening economies. With the U.S. election coming into focus and rising geopolitical tensions, analysts expect stocks to remain volatile and sensitive to any news that may derail the rally.
