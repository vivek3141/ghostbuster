Bank Stocks Push Toronto Stock Exchange to Stronger Territory Despite More Declining Issues Than Climbing Ones  

The Toronto Stock Exchange moved into the positive territory today, lifted by strong gains in the heavyweight financial sector, despite a majority of declining stocks over advancing ones. The S&P/TSX composite index gained 38.77 points to 15,262.22, with nearly three stocks losing ground for every two that rose.  

The financial sector, which accounts for about a third of the TSX's weight, climbed nearly 1 percent as shares of Canada's biggest banks rallied following better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings results last week. Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Nova Scotia, two of the country's largest lenders, gained 1.3 percent and 1.8 percent respectively. The overall financial sector contributed over 10 points to the market.

However, other sectors mostly declined, dragging the broader market. Energy shares fell 0.8 percent as crude oil prices dropped amid ongoing concerns over rising COVID-19 cases in some parts of the world and tight supply. Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 61 cents to $58.37 a barrel, while Brent crude declined 46 cents to $61.84.

Materials and technology sectors also lost ground. Gold miners weighed on materials with a 1.2 percent drop as the price of the precious metal moved lower. The information technology sector declined 0.7 percent.  

Overall market breadth was weak with only 571 gainers versus 1,640 decliners. Still, the strong performance of large-cap financial and bank stocks was enough to lift the main index into positive territory.

“The banks are lifting the market today for sure,” said Allan Small, senior investment adviser at Allan Small Financial Group. “The earnings from the big banks last week were better than expected, so we're seeing some catch-up move and relief rally in those names. But otherwise, it's a bit of a mixed, quiet day.”

The Canadian market has stagnated so far this year, gaining just about 2 percent amid concerns over extended COVID-related restrictions and a slow vaccine rollout. Investors are looking for progress on the economic reopening and a boost in business activity to drive further gains.
