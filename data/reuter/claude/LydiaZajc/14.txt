Toronto Stock Exchange Gains 60 Points Led by Investor Frenzy  

The Toronto Stock Exchange rallied today, gaining 60.45 points to close at 15,835, led by a buying spree in the technology and financial sectors. Investors reacted to positive earnings news from major companies in those sectors, spurring a frenzy of buying that drove the market higher overall.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq stock exchange surged 1.6%, fueled by a jump in shares of social media giant Facebook, which soared 9.3% to a new record high. Facebook reported second-quarter results after markets closed yesterday that handily beat analysts’ estimates and raised its revenue forecast. The positive report drove Facebook shares up nearly 10% today and pushed other tech stocks higher as well. Shares of local firms Shopify and Lightspeed POS both gained over 5% on the day following Facebook’s results.

In the financial sector, shares of Canada’s largest bank RBC rose 2.6% after it reported earnings per share ahead of expectations. The strong results gave a boost to other bank stocks, with TD, BMO and CIBC all up more than 1% in trading today. The rise in bank stocks helped lift the broader financial sector and contributed to the overall gain in the S&P/TSX Composite Index.  

“Investors are piling into high-growth tech and financial stocks today on the back of solid earnings numbers,” said David Molson, Senior Equity Strategist at National Bank Financial. “These sectors are leading the market higher even as other sectors lag. The buying is concentrated but frenzied, showing how much positive sentiment and momentum are driving the market right now.”

Other major sectors of the index declined slightly or remained flat on the day. Energy stocks dipped 0.5% as the price of oil fell, and industrials were flat overall. However, the large gains in technology and financials were more than enough to offset small declines in a couple sectors and power the Toronto market to a 0.4% gain overall. Barring any major shakeups, investor enthusiasm and momentum in growth sectors seem poised to continue driving stocks higher in the coming days and weeks.
