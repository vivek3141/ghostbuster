Toronto Stock Exchange Soars to Another Record High with Interest-Sensitive Issues and Conglomerates Driving the Market 

The Toronto Stock Exchange reached another record high today, propelled by gains in interest-sensitive sectors such as financials and telecoms as well as a few major conglomerates. The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 138.75 points at 16,552.80, topping its previous record set just yesterday.

Shares of Canada's big banks were up, with Royal Bank rising 1.1%, Toronto-Dominion Bank climbing 1.3%, and Bank of Nova Scotia up 0.7%. The major telecommunication companies also saw gains, with BCE Inc. and Telus Corp. increasing 0.9% and 0.8% respectively.

A handful of large conglomerates had a strong showing and contributed significantly to the record index level. Onex Corp advanced 2.2%, while Brookfield Asset Management added 1.3% and Power Corp of Canada was up 1.0%. These companies have a wide range of holdings across many sectors of the economy.  

The rise in interest-sensitive stocks suggests investors expect the Bank of Canada to hold off on further interest rate hikes after increasing rates three times since last summer. The central bank's benchmark rate sits at 1.75% and is not expected to rise again until 2019 at the earliest. Stable or declining interest rates are a positive for sectors like financials, telecoms and real estate.

Not all sectors participated in today's rally, however. The health care group fell 1.3%, with cannabis producer Aphria Inc. plunging 8.1% and Aurora Cannabis down 2.6%. The overall decline came despite Health Canada announcing new regulations to improve access to legal cannabis. The materials sector also had a weak day, dropping 0.5% with lower gold prices pressuring gold producers.

In all, eight of the 11 major sectors on the TSX were up on the record-setting day. Strong corporate earnings, solid economic data, and an accommodative central bank have supported the Toronto stock market's rise to start 2019. Barring an unexpected shock, analysts expect the rally to continue in the coming months.
