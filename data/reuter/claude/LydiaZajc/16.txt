Canadian Shoppers Turning to the Internet for Holiday Gifts, survey finds 

A new survey from Canada Post shows that the majority of Canadians plan to do at least some of their holiday shopping online this year. The survey found that 63% of Canadians will shop for gifts on retailers' websites or mobile apps, up from 58% last year. Close to one quarter of shoppers, 23%, said they will do over half their gift buying online.

The shift to e-commerce comes as online retailers like Amazon continue to expand their selection and offer free delivery options for the holidays. "Canadians clearly appreciate the convenience and value of shopping online," said Doug Ettinger, President and CEO of Canada Post. "Our findings show that the Internet is becoming an increasingly important channel for Canadians looking to check off their gift lists efficiently."

The survey also found that Canadians will spend an average of $574 on gifts this holiday season, up slightly from $564 last year. Clothing, gift cards, toys, and books were cited as some of the most popular gift options this year. Nearly two-thirds of Canadians start their holiday shopping in December, but many are also getting an early start - 32% said they started in November or earlier.

While e-commerce is surging, physical stores still have an important role to play during the holidays. The survey found that 78% of Canadians plan to visit stores in person to shop for gifts this year. "Bricks and mortar retail is still alive and well in Canada, even with the rise in online shopping," said Ettinger. "Many Canadians enjoy the festive atmosphere in stores during the holidays and the opportunity to see, touch and compare products in person."

However, shoppers are increasingly "webrooming" - browsing products online before going to stores to make their purchases. Over half, 55%, of Canadians said they will webroom this holiday season, up from 47% in 2018. The trend highlights the importance for retailers to have a seamless e-commerce and in-store experience. 

The survey results suggest retailers in Canada should continue enhancing their mobile and online shopping platforms while also driving foot traffic to physical store locations. An omnichannel strategy that provides convenience, value and a great customer experience both online and in-store will be key to success this holiday season. Overall, with more Canadians flocking to the web for gift buying than ever before, retailers need to meet shoppers wherever and however they choose to shop.
