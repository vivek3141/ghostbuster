Investors Remain Bullish on Canadian Stocks as Economic Fundamentals Improve  

Investors are optimistic about the prospects for Canadian stocks going into 2020 thanks to improving economic fundamentals and a robust business environment north of the border. Canada's economy posted an annualized GDP growth rate of 1.4% in the third quarter, exceeding economist expectations. The economic expansion was broad-based, with growth seen in 11 sectors across the economy.

Retail sales, a key measure of consumer health, rose 0.5% in October signaling that consumer spending remains solid. The unemployment rate fell to a 40-year low of 5.6% in November as the labor market added 61,000 jobs during the month. Wage growth has also accelerated, with average hourly wages up 2.5% over the same period last year.  

The improving macroeconomic conditions have fueled bullish sentiment for equities, especially stocks in cyclical and financial sectors. The S&P/TSX Composite index has gained over 20% this year, on pace to post its best annual performance since 2009. The index is trading near record high levels, lifted by sharp gains in the energy, materials, and financial sectors.  

“We have a positive fundamental backdrop for Canadian equities with solid economic growth, strong labor markets, and wage gains,” said Jennifer Bisceglio, Equity Analyst at TD Securities. “Valuations remain attractive relative to historical levels and interest rates are supportive. We believe the bull market in Canadian stocks has further room to run in 2020.”

Investors are watching for signals the Bank of Canada may raise interest rates in 2020 to curb inflationary pressures as economic activity picks up. After three rate hikes in 2018, the central bank has kept borrowing costs on hold this year at 1.75%. Higher interest rates, if not implemented judiciously, pose risks to the economic expansion but at this point, investors do not expect aggressive tightening.  

Overall, Canadian stocks remain an appealing investment opportunity given the constructive economic and policy environment. While global trade tensions and geopolitical risks persist, fundamentals suggest more upside potential for equities in the year ahead. Investor bullishness towards Canadian stocks looks poised to continue into 2020.
