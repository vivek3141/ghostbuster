Toronto Stock Exchange Hits Record High on Strong Financial and Conglomerate Stocks  

The Toronto Stock Exchange reached an all-time high on Tuesday, powered by strong performance in financial and conglomerate stock sectors. The S&P/TSX Composite Index closed up 206 points or 1.2% at 17,396, surpassing the previous record set on March 21st.   

Gains were broad-based across sectors, with 9 of the 10 subgroups advancing. The heavyweight financials sector, which accounts for about a third of the index, rallied 1.5% as investors bet on higher interest rates. Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank, two of the country's biggest lenders, rose over 2% each.  

Conglomerates were also strong, boosted by Onex Corporation which jumped 4.7% after reporting a 47% increase in first-quarter earnings. Onex owns and manages $36 billion of capital across various sectors and its improving profits signal a rebound in corporate deal-making and mergers and acquisitions activity.   

"We have a combination of strong commodity prices, a robust financial sector thanks to optimism about interest rates, and a relatively stable currencyâ€”all of that is supporting the market at these levels," said Craig Fehr, an investment strategist at Edward Jones.

The rally came despite lingering concerns over trade and economic tensions with the U.S. Investors appeared to shrug off worries that the renegotiation of NAFTA could be on the brink of collapse. U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said that a vote to approve a new deal may not happen until 2019.

Technology stocks gained even as BlackBerry declined 3.2%. The company reported better-than-expected quarterly results and revenue in its technology and licensing businesses but posted a loss due to restructuring costs. Energy stocks advanced alongside oil prices with Suncor Energy up 1.8% and Enbridge rising 1.9%.  

The Canadian dollar traded at a six-day high as the U.S. dollar fell against major currencies. The loonie strengthened 0.5% to C$1.2877 per U.S. dollar. A rise in the currency could weigh on shares of exporters and companies with significant operations outside Canada.

Overall, Canadian stocks are outperforming the U.S. market this year thanks to strength in commodities and expectations the Bank of Canada will increase interest rates at a gradual pace. The central bank has hiked rates three times since mid-2017, citing employment gains, high consumer confidence and growth. The economy expanded at an annual rate of 3% in 2017, the fastest pace in six years.

Barring an unexpected turn, analysts say the bull market that began in early 2016 can continue its steady climb through 2018. As long as the economic recovery remains on track, the stock market should be heading higher over the next 12 months. Strong company earnings and fundamentals suggest any dips or pullbacks are likely to be shallow and short-lived.
