Toronto stocks take a tumble from profit-taking and gold sell-off 

The Toronto stock exchange declined sharply today as investors engaged in profit-taking after several days of gains and gold producers were hit by a drop in gold prices. 

The S&P/TSX Composite Index fell 238 points, or 1.5%, to 15,860. The market had risen for three straight days this week, gaining more than 400 points, so some selling to lock in profits was not unexpected. Declines were broad-based across sectors, with eight of the ten subgroups in the red.

The biggest drag came from the materials sector, which dropped 2.8%. Major gold producers were slammed as gold futures declined $15.40, or 0.8%, to $1,890.10 an ounce. Barrick Gold Corp. fell 4.1%, Newmont slid 3.8%, and Franco-Nevada decreased 2.4%.

The energy sector, which accounts for about 18% of the Toronto market, also weighed heavily as oil prices pulled back. The July crude contract dropped $1.11 to $63.58 a barrel. Suncor Energy declined 2.8% and Cenovus Energy fell 2.4%.

Other sectors with notable losses included health care, down 2.5%, consumer staples, falling 2.2%, and financials, slipping 1.7%. In contrast, the technology sector gained 0.8%, lifted by a 7.6% surge in e-commerce platform Shopify. 

Among individual stocks, Air Canada's shares plunged 8.9% after the airline reported a wider than expected loss in the first quarter as COVID-19 restrictions have shuttered much of its operations. The carrier lost $1.3 billion, compared with a loss of $633 million a year earlier. Revenue fell nearly 90% from the first quarter of 2020.

Overall, declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by a margin of about six to one on the TSX. Trading volume was an above- average 282 million shares.

The Canadian dollar was little changed, slipping a tenth of a cent to 81.16 cents U.S.
