Canadian Consumers Set to Be Scrooge Again This Holiday Season, Survey Shows

A new survey by Leger found that Canadians are planning to scale back spending once more this holiday season. 46% of respondents said they will be spending less on gifts this year compared to last year's holidays. This Scrooge-like sentiment has been building for years, indicating Canadians continue to tighten their belts during the holidays. 

The annual Leger holiday spending survey interviewed over 1500 Canadians online between November 15th to 20th. It found the number of Canadians reducing gift budgets has been climbing steadily. 38% planned to cut back in 2018, up from 34% in 2017 and 28% in 2016. At the same time, the number setting a higher budget has declined to just 12% from 18% two years ago.

"The trends are clear that Canadians are being more frugal during the holidays," said Dave Scholz, Executive Vice President at Leger. "While the economy is strong, people seem to be focused on saving money and being more selective with their spending at this time of year."

The cutbacks span all age groups but are most significant among younger Canadians. Over half (53%) of 18 to 34-year-olds say they will spend less on gifts this season versus 42% of those 35 to 54 and 39% of those 55 and older.  All regions of the country are tightening their belts as well, with Ontario and the Prairies most likely to spend less at 50% and 48% respectively.

The survey found holiday travel and dining out are also being reduced. Only 31% of respondents plan to travel over the holidays, down from 37% a year ago. Dining at restaurants during the season also declined to 56% from 61% last year.

It appears Canadians may need to find ways to spark their holiday spirit without breaking the bank this year. But with tightened spending plans taking hold for years now, a more frugal festive season may be the new normal for Canadian consumers. At least until economic anxiety starts to fade and spirits become brighter once more.
