Toronto Stock Exchange to Change Rules Governing Control Blocks, Affecting Large-Cap Canadian Stocks 

The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) announced today that it will revise its rules around control blocks of publicly listed companies. The new rules will require shareholder approval for transfers of control blocks, defined as 20 percent or more of the shares of a TSX-listed company. The policy change aims to provide greater transparency and oversight in the trading of large blocks of shares in major Canadian corporations.

Under the current rules, control blocks can be transferred freely without requiring shareholder approval or additional disclosures. The TSX has expressed concern that this could allow influential control blocks to change hands without scrutiny or input from other investors. The new rules, which will take effect on January 1, require a shareholder vote to approve any transfer of shares that would result in a new owner gaining control of 20 percent or more of a company’s shares. 

The change will impact large-cap companies on the TSX, especially in sectors like mining and energy where control blocks are common. By mandating shareholder votes, the new policy allows minority investors to have a say in who obtains a controlling stake in the companies they invest in. However, some critics argue that requiring shareholder approval for control block transfers could discourage some transactions and reduce liquidity for large investors.

The TSX announcement follows a recent consultation with listed companies and investors. According to TSX CEO Loui Anastasopoulos, “We believe the new rules strike an appropriate balance between facilitating capital markets activity and upholding high standards of shareholder protection and governance.” The new control block policy brings the TSX in line with some major exchanges in the U.S. and Europe that have more stringent requirements around changes in corporate control.

With the changes coming into effect at the start of 2020, the TSX will require all listed companies to comply with the new rules on control block transfers. Companies and investors with questions about how the new policy may impact them can contact the TSX to discuss options for ensuring a smooth transition to the revised rules.
