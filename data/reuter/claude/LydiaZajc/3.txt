Chief Financial Officer Resigns from Debt-Ridden Rogers Communications Inc.

Tony Staffieri, chief financial officer of Rogers Communications Inc., resigned suddenly from his role on Monday morning. Staffieri had served as CFO of Rogers for the past three years but has come under increasing scrutiny as the telecom giant has taken on significant levels of debt in recent quarters.  

In a brief statement, Rogers CEO Joe Natale thanked Staffieri for his contributions over the years but did not give a reason for the abrupt departure. Staffieri also did not issue a public statement about the resignation. The company said Paul Carpino, the current vice president of finance, will take over as interim chief financial officer while Rogers conducts a search for a permanent replacement.

Rogers took on $15 billion of long-term debt in 2019 to fund the purchase of wireless carrier Freedom Mobile from Shaw Communications. The additional debt burden caused concern among analysts and investors, especially as competition has intensified in the Canadian telecom market. Rogers also spent $26 billion to acquire media properties from Shaw, including cable channels, radio stations, and production facilities. The company’s total debt now stands at over $29 billion, straining its balance sheet.

In Rogers’ most recent quarterly results, released last month, the company reported a 20% drop in net income along with a slight decline in revenue. The results were below analysts’ expectations, putting more pressure on the company’s leadership. Staffieri came under fire for not providing reassuring guidance about Rogers’ debt levels and future earnings trajectories. His resignation is a sign of the heat that Natale and other senior executives are facing.

With new CEOs at its main competitors Bell and Telus, Rogers is looking to reassert itself in the competitive Canadian landscape. But reducing its substantial debt burden while investing in new infrastructure and technology will pose significant challenges for whoever takes over as the company’s next CFO. For now, investors seem unmoved by the departure—Rogers’ stock was up slightly in early trading as the broader market also rose. But the company will need to provide clearer signals about its financial health to avoid further doubts about its direction. Overall, it’s a turbulent time for Canada’s oldest and largest telecommunications company.
