Toronto Stock Exchange hits new high, breaking psychological barrier of 5500 points  

The Toronto Stock Exchange reached a new record high on Monday, surpassing 5500 points for the first time in its history. The S&P/TSX composite index rose 56.46 points to close at 5,521.72, topping the previous all-time record set in August 2018. 

The latest milestone comes amid a broader rally in global stock markets fueled by optimism over economic recoveries and an easing of U.S.-China trade tensions. Gains were broad-based across sectors, led by the energy, financial and materials groups which climbed between 0.6% and 1.8%. Eight of the 11 sub-indexes gained ground, with only healthcare, real estate, and consumer staples slipping.

"Breaking through 5,500 is a psychological barrier and reinforces the bull market is still intact," said Greg Taylor, a portfolio manager at Purpose Investments. The TSX has climbed more than 20% since the start of the year despite the economic fallout from COVID-19. Strong commodity prices, government stimulus, and emergency interest rate cuts by the Bank of Canada have propelled Canadian stocks higher.

The energy sector rose 1.8% as oil prices moved higher on Monday, with hopes of tightening supplies overshadowing worries that new coronavirus cases may slow the pace of fuel demand recovery. The materials group, which includes gold and base metal miners, added 1.2%. Gold rallied to an all-time high, topping $1,555 an ounce for the first time, as worries over rising COVID-19 infections and U.S.-China tensions burnished the metal's safe-haven appeal.

Financials, the index's largest group, increased 0.9%. Canada's major banks face their biggest test so far of provisions taken against loan losses from the pandemic. Four of the Big Six banks report results this week, and analysts say they have set aside at least $11 billion combined.

"The market seems optimistic the worst may be behind for the banks. If guidance is supportive, the financial sector should continue trending higher," said Philip Petursson, chief investment strategist at Manulife Investment Management.

Investor attention will remain focused on quarterly results, with nearly 200 TSX-listed companies scheduled to report earnings this week. Many see a seasonally strong third quarter as an opportunity for companies to surprise to the upside and extend the market rally into year-end. However, the ongoing threat from the coronavirus and uncertainty around the U.S. election could inject additional volatility, analysts warned.
