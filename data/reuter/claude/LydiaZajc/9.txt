Toronto Stocks Rise Nearly 1% on Bank Stocks and Strong Bond and Currency Markets

The Toronto Stock Exchange's benchmark index rose nearly 1% on Tuesday, lifted by heavyweight financial stocks and strong fixed income and currency markets. 

The S&P/TSX Composite index closed up 156.77 points, or 0.95%, at 16,731.13. Half of the index's 10 main industry groups ended higher.

Shares of Canada's biggest banks gained as bond yields rose, with Royal Bank of Canada climbing 2.1% to $103.22 and Bank of Nova Scotia up 1.6% at $71.94. Higher bond yields can boost bank profits from lending.

The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1.3% as gold futures fell.

The Canadian dollar strengthened against the greenback, with the loonie trading 0.4% higher at 1.2578 to the U.S. dollar.

A rise in oil prices also supported the market. U.S. crude oil futures settled 1% higher at $42.67 a barrel amid hopes that OPEC and its allies may delay a planned production increase.

The energy group gained 0.3% even as shares of oil producer Crescent Point Energy Corp fell 5.4% after it scrapped its quarterly dividend.

Strong economic data, progress in U.S. fiscal stimulus talks and upbeat results from JPMorgan boosted optimism in equity markets globally.

“The market seems to be in a bit of a holding pattern,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. "We had a strong rally coming out of the (U.S.) election. ... There's optimism about possible economic stimulus, optimism around the vaccine. But at the same time, we know there's a lot of challenges ahead."

Canada's annual inflation rate held steady at 0.5% in October while core prices posted their smallest gain in four months, data showed. The muted inflation supported the view that the Bank of Canada will not tighten monetary policy anytime soon.

On the TSX, 178 issues rose, while 50 fell and 22 were flat. Volume was nearly 272 million shares, in line with the daily average for this year.

The materials sector shed 1.3%, with gold producer Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd falling 3% to C$54.61 and Barrick Gold Corp down 2.1% at C$34.27.

The TSX posted six new 52-week highs and one new low.
