Toronto Stocks Reach 51st Record Close of 1996 Amid Rally in Interest-Sensitive Issues and Expected Bank of Canada Cut  

The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index rallied to another record close on Tuesday, marking its 51st record finish of 1996. The index rose 53.33 points, or 0.66%, to 8,144.51. Gains were led by interest-sensitive sectors ahead of an expected interest rate cut by the Bank of Canada on Wednesday.  

The interest rate-sensitive utilities sector led advancers, up 2.3% as investors anticipated the quarter-point rate cut forecast by economists. Major gainers included companies like Ontario Hydro, up 1.9%, and B.C. Gas, up 4.3%. The financial sector also rose, with banks like Royal Bank up 1.3% and CIBC up 1.1% ahead of the expected easing of interest rates which could spur economic growth.

“The market is rallying in anticipation of lower interest rates tomorrow which could give the economy a boost going into 1997,” said John Smith, investment advisor with ABC Investments. “Rate-sensitive sectors like utilities, pipelines, and banks are leading the market higher today.”

The market has had a strong rally this year, helped by falling interest rates and bond yields. The Bank of Canada has cut rates three times this year in an effort to spur economic activity. The rally has been fueled by strong economic fundamentals and earnings as well as declining interest rates.

“The market momentum remains very strong heading into year-end,” said Jane Doe, equity analyst at XYZ Securities. “We’ve seen improving economic data, solid earnings, and expectations that interest rates have further room to decline which is a perfect environment for equities.” 

Not all sectors participated in today’s rally, with gold stocks down sharply as gold prices fell over 2% on the day. Materials and energy stocks also declined. But the strength of the interest-rate sensitive groups was enough to power the broader index to its latest milestone. Barring any major surprises, analysts expect the market’s rally to continue through year-end boosted by expectations of economic gains in 1997.
