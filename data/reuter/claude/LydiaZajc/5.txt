Mixed Results for Toronto Stocks as Pipeline and Gold Issues Fall

Toronto stocks ended the day mixed after a volatile session. The S&P/TSX Composite Index rose 0.2% to 16,553. The index experienced a wide range during the day, dipping into negative territory before recovering by market close. 

The energy sector was the worst performer, falling 1.3% as oil prices declined. Pipeline companies were hit particularly hard. Enbridge Inc. fell 2.7% and TC Energy Corp. dropped 3.2% after the government of Michigan filed a lawsuit to shut down Enbridge's Line 5 pipeline. The pipeline transports 540,000 barrels per day of oil and natural gas liquids between Wisconsin and Ontario. The lawsuit raises further uncertainty over the future of the pipeline.

Gold stocks also weighed on the market as gold futures fell 1.3% to $1,756 per ounce. Barrick Gold Corp. declined 1.6% and Kinross Gold Corp. retreated 2.9%. The losses came despite ongoing economic uncertainty that often boosts gold prices. However, gold has faltered recently as longer-term Treasury yields have risen, reducing the appeal of gold.

Technology stocks provided the biggest boost. Shopify Inc. advanced 3.9% to make another record high. Lightspeed POS Inc. gained 2.3% and BlackBerry Ltd. added 1.8%. The tech sector overall rose 1%.

Industrial stocks were also strong, climbing 0.7%. Canadian National Railway Co. rose 1.9% and Air Canada increased 3.8% as the company reached a deal with the federal government for bridge financing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Canadian dollar fell 0.3% to 78.12 cents US as the U.S. dollar broadly strengthened against most other currencies. The loonie has declined 1.3% so far this week, on track for its worst week since October. 

Despite the market fluctuations, investors remain optimistic about an economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis. The major indexes remain within a few percentage points of record highs, though risks remain around the spread of virus variants and a bumpy rollout of vaccines. Further fiscal stimulus from governments could also boost the economy and stock markets.
