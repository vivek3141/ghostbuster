Prominent Chinese dissident and former student leader sentenced to 11 years in prison 

Beijing, Chinaâ€”Xiao Tian, a prominent Chinese human rights activist and former student leader, was sentenced to 11 years in prison today on charges of "subversion of state power." The harsh sentence is seen by many as an attempt by the Chinese government to intimidate other pro-democracy advocates and silence dissent.

Xiao, 40, played a key role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests as a student leader. He has continued to advocate for political reform and greater civil liberties in China over the past three decades, in defiance of frequent harassment and detention by government authorities. He was detained in December 2018 and held for over a year before being formally charged. His closed-door trial in Beijing this week lasted just a few hours before the sentence was announced.

"This outrageous sentence demonstrates the Chinese Communist Party's fear of political dissent and free speech," said Jane Smith, China Program Director at Human Rights Watch. "Xiao Tian has dedicated his life to promoting fundamental rights and freedoms in China. He should be celebrated, not imprisoned."

The Chinese government has long considered Xiao a threat to its rule. He has called for free elections, an independent judiciary, and an end to censorship. Xiao continues to have a strong following, especially among young people and liberal intellectuals in China, though his activism has been pushed underground amid the government's repressive control.   

Xiao's 11-year sentence is one of the heaviest handed down to a dissident in years and reflects Xi Jinping's authoritarian turn as General Secretary of the Communist Party. Hundreds of lawyers, activists, and others have been rounded up since Xi took power. The harsh treatment of Xiao is meant to instill fear in other activists and further shrink the space for political dissent in China. But despite the risks, some have spoken out against his sentence.

"Xiao Tian's only 'crime' was to envision a freer and more just China," said Zhao Wang, a university student in Beijing. "He has inspired so many of us to stand up for what we believe in. No prison sentence can lock up the ideas and dreams he has sown in our hearts." Barring a successful appeal, Xiao will serve his 11-year sentence at Yanqing Prison, just outside of Beijing. His supporters say they will campaign persistently for his early release.
