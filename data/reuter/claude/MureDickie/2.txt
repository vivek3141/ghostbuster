China Offers Cooperation to Maintain Peace on Korean Peninsula Amid Tensions and Infiltrator Hunt 

Beijing has offered to work with all parties involved to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, as South Korea continues to hunt for an alleged North Korean infiltrator in its border area.

South Korea's military has boosted security after reports of a suspected infiltration by a North Korean soldier, a move that risks raising tensions between the two Koreas. In a regular press briefing today, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said China hopes all parties will exercise restraint, avoid escalating tensions, and resolve issues through dialogue. 

"Maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula is in the common interests of all sides," Wang said. "China is willing to work with all parties to this end."

The offer of cooperation comes as South Korea dispatched hundreds of troops and police officers to search for the alleged infiltrator in the border county of Cheorwon. The South Korean military has warned residents to be on alert, and local schools have restricted outdoor activities for students.

North and South Korea remain technically at war, and any incursion across their heavily fortified border is a serious offense. However, false alarms and encounters with wildlife are not uncommon, leading to occasional crackdowns that often prove fruitless.  

China, North Korea's main ally, has encouraged greater contact between Pyongyang and Seoul in the past and backed North-South reconciliation efforts. However, Beijing dislikes actions that could threaten stability in the region and raise the prospect of conflict on its border.

Wang urged all sides to avoid rhetoric and behavior that could inflame tensions, echoing previous calls by China for Pyongyang and Seoul to build trust. "The situation on the Korean Peninsula remains complex and sensitive. ... Relevant parties should exercise calm and restraint, show goodwill to each other, and avoid rhetoric and actions that might increase tensions," he said.
