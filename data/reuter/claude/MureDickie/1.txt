Senior US Official in Beijing Praises China's Approach to Arms Control, But Raises Concerns Over Proliferation

BEIJINGâ€”In a speech at Peking University on Wednesday, a senior State Department official praised China's efforts to build a responsible strategic arms control regime but expressed concern about the proliferation of ballistic missile technology and cyber warfare capabilities from China to other countries. 

Robert Greenway, the Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, said China's minimalist approach to nuclear weapons and policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons served as a "model for restraint and responsibility." However, he warned that as China expands its conventional missile forces and space-based capabilities, it needs to be more transparent to avoid regional tensions. 

"There are concerns that hypersonic missiles, anti-satellite and cyber weapons developed by China could be obtained by other nations to threaten regional stability," Mr. Greenway said. He called on China to join the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international organization that aims to limit the spread of ballistic missiles that can carry conventional warheads.

China has long argued that its strategic arms are purely for defensive purposes and that it maintains a minimum deterrent capability. It has refused to join arms control regimes like the MTCR on the grounds that they represent de facto containment by Western nations.

Mr. Greenway's speech was the first comprehensive review of China's arms control policies by a senior U.S. official since the Trump administration took office. Coming at a time of increasing competition between the two powers, the speech aimed to strike a cooperative tone and lay out areas for engagement on shared interests, even as it delivered criticism of China's continuing proliferation of weapons technologies to countries like North Korea and Iran.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman responded that "all countries have the right to self-defense" and that "China has always exercised restraint on the development of strategic weapons." While avoiding direct criticism of Mr. Greenway's call for China to join groups like the MTCR, the spokesman said "we do not see the necessity" for China to join such regimes given its defensive nuclear doctrine and tight export controls.   

The mixed messages from the speech and the response highlight the complex dynamics of great power rivalry and cooperation when it comes to weapons controls and nonproliferation. The two sides see mutual benefit in controlling the spread of especially dangerous weapons but differ in their approaches and levels of transparency. While the need for cooperation is evident, distrust and competition continue to complicate the bilateral relationship. Achieving further progress will require addressing this challenge through open channels of communication and good faith.
