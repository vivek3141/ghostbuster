Family of Detained Chinese Dissident Wang Dan Finds Lawyer to Defend Him at Imminent Trial

The family of Wang Dan, a prominent Chinese dissident detained for over a year by authorities, announced today that they have retained human rights lawyer Li Xiaorong to defend Wang at his trial, expected to begin within days. Li is a renowned civil rights attorney who has defended other activists and dissidents. 

Wang Dan, 47, was one of the student leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and has already served two previous prison sentences for his pro-democracy activism. He was taken into police custody in December 2018 and formally arrested four months ago on charges of "inciting subversion of state power." The vague charge is commonly used to suppress political dissent and criticism of the Communist government.

According to his younger brother Wang Peng, the police informed the family this week that Wang Dan's trial would start "soon" but did not provide an exact date. Authorities have severely limited Wang's access to his lawyers and family for the past year. The abrupt notice has raised concerns that the trial may be a perfunctory process with the outcome predetermined.

"We know my brother is innocent, but we have little hope of fair treatment or due process," Wang Peng said. "At least now with lawyer Li on the case, there is someone to monitor the proceedings and object to violations."
 
Li Xiaorong told reporters she visited Wang Dan for the first time this week but was refused permission to bring writing materials into the detention center, so she could not fully discuss the details of his case and defense strategy. "The obstacles and restrictions we face show this will not be a just trial," Li said. "But we will do our utmost to defend Wang Dan's rights within a flawed system."

Wang served two terms in prison for a total of 10 years for his role in the 1989 student movement and subsequent protests. His most recent detention came amid a broader crackdown on civil society under President Xi Jinping. Wang was an outspoken critic on social media of Xi's authoritarian policies before his accounts were shut down.

Rights groups say Wang Dan's case is a disturbing example of the deterioration of human rights in China. "Wang Dan is a prisoner of conscience and should be immediately released," said Yaqiu Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch. "The Chinese government needs to stop using the criminal law to punish people peacefully expressing their views." 

The trial is expected to last just a few hours before Wang is convicted and given a preordained prison sentence, his supporters say. But the presence of a rights lawyer and greater visibility for the case may impose some restraints and embarrassment on the court, even if it does not change the end result. For Wang Dan's family, any sense of justice remains elusive, but they remain hopeful he will be freed again one day to continue his calls for democratic reform.
