China's Rising Foreign Debt Not a Cause for Concern Despite Booming Economy, Say Financial Analysts  

China's foreign debt levels have been rising steadily in recent years as the country continues to experience strong economic growth and invests in ambitious infrastructure projects around the world. However, many financial analysts are not concerned about the rising debt levels and do not foresee any substantial risks to China's economy.

According to statistics from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, China's foreign debt reached $1.9 trillion in 2018, nearly double the level from five years ago. The increase is largely driven by China's Belt and Road Initiative, a massive transcontinental infrastructure project aimed at expanding China's influence and trade routes. Loans from the initiative now make up about 40% of China's foreign debt.  

While the debt levels appear high relative to China's economy, analysts point out that most of the debt is denominated in US dollars, and China holds about $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves. "China's debt levels are still at a safe and stable level," said Wang Tao, Head of Asia Economics at UBS Investment Bank. "There is no need to worry too much about systemic financial risks." According to UBS, China's foreign debt equals only about 13% of the country's total GDP, a low level relative to other major economies.

The vast majority of China's foreign debt is also owed by state-owned enterprises and the central government, rather than private companies. This means the government has direct control over the debt and strong capacity to pay it off. Some analysts argue China's rising debt reflects the country's increasing global economic prominence and is a natural byproduct of its development. 

"China is now the second largest economy in the world, so it's quite normal and reasonable for the country to be integrated into the global market with both funds and debts flowing in and out," said Zhu Ning, Deputy Dean of the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance. As long as China's economy remains robust and fiscal policies responsible, higher debt levels are unlikely to pose major problems. Overall, most experts remain confident in China's economic fundamentals and believe its foreign debt is under control and sustainable for the foreseeable future.
