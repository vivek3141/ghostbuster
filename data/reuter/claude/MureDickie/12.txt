China Internet Corp Launches China Wide Web to Provide Online Services and Economic Information to Chinese Businesses and Overseas Subscribers   

Beijing, China - China Internet Corporation, the leading Internet services company in China, today announced the launch of China Wide Web, a comprehensive online platform providing business services, economic data, and financial information to companies operating in China as well as international subscribers interested in the Chinese economy.   

"China Wide Web is the go-to source for any organization looking to tap into the promise of the Chinese market," said Wang Lee, CEO of China Internet Corp. "Whether you are a Chinese tech startup looking for tools to manage your business or an investor in New York tracking economic policy changes, China Wide Web provides everything you need in one place."

China Wide Web offers a suite of business tools including payment processing, employee management systems, and cloud services tailored for the Chinese market. It also provides up-to-date information on regulations, economic indicators, and news to help companies stay on top of trends in China. A large portion of the Web portal contains reports and data from China's central and regional governments to give an official view of the country's economic health.

"For too long, overseas businesses and observers had limited access to information in China," said Wang. "China Wide Web aims to remedy that by making official data more transparent and providing the in-depth market research that companies need." 

China Wide Web launches with over 100 million subscribers to China Internet Corp's various Internet services. The company hopes to leverage its large local user base to turn China Wide Web into the top source for Chinese economic insights and business tools. China Internet Corp is also offering subscription options for foreign companies and financial institutions looking for data and news on the Chinese economy.

"Whether in China or globally, the thirst for knowledge about this economy and how to access it is huge," said Wang. "China Wide Web taps into that demand by becoming the platform for understanding China's business world."

The launch of China Wide Web represents China Internet Corp's push to become a world leader in business information and services. With its unparalleled access to official data and position in the Chinese technology industry, China Wide Web seems poised to become the premier platform for navigating China's complex economic landscape.
