U.S. Businessman Urges China to Make Real Changes to Economy to Join WTO 

Shanghai - In a speech to Chinese business leaders today, prominent American businessman and investor Warren Buffett urged China to make substantial reforms to its economy and trade policies if it hopes to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) and further open up global trade. Buffett, often called the “Oracle of Omaha” for his investing success, said China must make “real, significant changes, not surface-level tweaks” in order to convince the United States and other western nations that it is ready to join the WTO.

Buffett specifically called on China to strengthen intellectual property protections, open up its financial markets to foreign competition, and reduce subsidies and advantages given to state-owned enterprises. “For China to reach its full economic potential and gain entry to the global trading system, it needs to show it is playing by the same rules as other nations,” Buffett said, according to prepared remarks. 

China has sought for many years to join the WTO, which aims to lower trade barriers and open up global commerce between its 164 member nations. However, the United States and other western nations have hesitated in agreeing to China's entry due to concerns over unfair economic practices like intellectual property theft, restrictions on foreign companies, and heavy government subsidies for Chinese companies. The Trump administration has taken a hard line in trade negotiations with China, raising tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods last year and demanding a wide range of economic reforms. 

In his speech, Buffett said he remains optimistic about China's economic potential if reforms are made but warned that "half measures will not unlock the door to the global trading system." Buffett still voiced support for China's entry into the WTO and encouraged more open trade between the U.S. and China, which he called "the world's two leading economic powers." However, he said China must show "in concrete and meaningful ways" that it is prepared to engage in fair and mutually beneficial trade. 

Buffett has made several trips to China over the years to explore investment opportunities and meet with Chinese business and government leaders. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, has invested billions of dollars in Chinese companies like carmaker BYD. However, Buffett said China's aspirations of becoming a global economic superpower can only be fulfilled if its government embraces openness and reforms. "China has a choice between two paths," Buffett concluded, according to the prepared remarks. "One leads to greater prosperity and influence on the global stage. The other leads to stagnation, lost opportunity, and renewed distrust from nations like my own."
