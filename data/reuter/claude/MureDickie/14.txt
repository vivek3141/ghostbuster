China's Economy Grows by 9.6 Percent, but Urban Family Incomes Lag Behind, says State Statistical Bureau 

Beijing, China - China's economy grew by 9.6% in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year, according to figures released today by the National Bureau of Statistics. The robust growth was fueled by strong exports and continued government spending on infrastructure. However, average family incomes in China's cities grew at a slower pace, raising concerns about the uneven distribution of China's economic gains.

China's GDP growth in the first quarter beat most economists' expectations and indicates the economy's resilience despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States and other challenges. The growth was driven in large part by a 14.8% surge in exports as companies rushed to ship goods to the US before new tariffs took effect. Fixed asset investment by the government and state-owned enterprises also contributed to the strong growth. 

"China's economy is off to a good start in 2019 thanks to strong trade and investment, especially public spending," said Ethan Jin, an economist at Fudan University in Shanghai. "But domestic consumer demand remains weak relative to the overall growth, and people's incomes and spending power are not keeping up with the pace of expansion."

According to the statistics bureau, disposable income per capita for urban households grew 6.1% in the first quarter, slower than the overall GDP growth and the increase in per capita GDP. Rural household incomes grew even slower, at 5.7%. The lackluster income growth suggests China's economic gains are disproportionately benefitting large companies and higher-income groups, rather than trickling down to average workers.  

The income figures were especially disappointing given policymakers' stated goal of boosting domestic consumption to make the economy less reliant on exports and investment. Raising incomes and consumption has become more urgent as trade disputes threaten exports. But experts say more policy support is needed, through measures like tax cuts, wage increases, and social spending.

"Income growth is the foundation for consumption growth," said Christine Wong, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank. "Policymakers will likely step up income support measures to stabilize growth."

With solid growth in the first quarter, China remains on track to meet its full-year GDP growth target of between 6 to 6.5% in 2019. However, economists expect growth to moderate over the rest of the year as exports likely weaken and government spending slows. Supporting income and consumption growth will be key to sustaining a healthy pace of expansion, even as external factors pose challenges to China's growth outlook.
