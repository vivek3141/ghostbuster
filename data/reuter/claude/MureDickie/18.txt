European Parliament Awards Sakharov Prize to Chinese Dissident Wei Jingsheng, Beijing Protests 

The European Parliament awarded the prestigious Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng today, angering Beijing which called it "rude interference" in China's internal affairs.

Wei, 69, is a longtime activist who spent more than 18 years in Chinese prisons due to his pro-democracy activism and outspoken criticism of the communist government. He was an early leader of the 1978 Democracy Wall movement, posting essays calling for political reform. Arrested in 1979, he was released briefly then imprisoned again from 1983 to 1993. He was released into exile in 1997 and now lives in the United States.

In awarding Wei the Sakharov Prize, worth â‚¬50,000, European Parliament President David Sassoli praised him as "one of the most prominent human rights defenders in China." Sassoli said Wei's "exceptional contribution to freedom of thought, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms deserves the highest recognition."

The Chinese Foreign Ministry objected strongly to the award, saying the European Parliament should not interfere in China's affairs. "By giving a prize to someone who was once sentenced to jail for speech crimes in China, the parliament is rudely interfering in China's internal affairs and judicial sovereignty," the ministry spokesperson said.

Wei said from Washington, DC that he was "very honored" to receive the Sakharov Prize, named after Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov. But Wei said the greater honor would be for China's government "to grant democratic constitutional reforms so all Chinese citizens can enjoy freedom of speech and religion, and the right to choose their leaders."

Human rights groups around the world applauded the decision to give Wei the Sakharov Prize. "Wei Jingsheng is a true hero and role model for all Chinese activists who continue the fight for democracy today," said UN Watch director Hillel Neuer.
