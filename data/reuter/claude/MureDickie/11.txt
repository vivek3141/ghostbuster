China Successfully Launches Research Satellite Into Orbit from Remote Gansu Base  

China's space program reached a new milestone today with the successful launch of a new scientific research satellite from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi desert. The satellite, named Chongqing Liangjiang Star, was launched aboard a Long March 2D rocket at 12:17 PM local time. According to official sources, the satellite entered its intended orbit about 15 minutes after liftoff.

The 600-kilogram satellite will primarily conduct space environment experiments and verify new technologies like flexible solar panels. It will complement China's growing fleet of space science satellites and help advance technologies needed for future crewed space missions. The satellite was developed by the China Academy of Space Technology and Chongqing University.

The launch site at Jiuquan is China's primary launch center for scientific missions and crewed space flights. All 11 of China's astronauts have launched into space from Jiuquan aboard the Shenzhou spacecraft. Jiuquan is in a remote, desert location which limits the possibility of casualties in the event of a launch failure or accident. The center has three launch pads to support China's busy space launch manifest.

Today's launch marks the fifth successful orbital launch for China this year with more missions planned in the coming months. China aims to launch over 50 space missions in 2020 to expand capabilities in Earth observation, telecommunications, and space exploration. The country's space program has advanced rapidly in recent decades with landmark achievements like landing rovers on the far side of the moon and the launch of the core module for China's permanent space station.

The successful launch of the Chongqing Liangjiang Star satellite adds to a series of accomplishments for China's space program this year despite challenges from the global coronavirus pandemic. With the Jiuquan launch site now validated for the year, China will proceed with additional satellite missions and the launch of cargo and crew missions to its new space station. China is on track to achieve its goal of becoming a space powerhouse by 2030.
