China's Economy Growing at 9.6 Percent, but Urban Family Incomes Lagging Behind  

The Chinese economy grew at 9.6% in the first half of this year, putting it on track to surpass the government's target of 8% growth for the full year. However, average family incomes in China's urban centers are growing at a much slower pace, increasing concerns about inequality in the country. 

China's economy has rebounded strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic, fueled by government investment in infrastructure and real estate as well as strong export growth. The country's industrial production rose 12.9% in August compared to a year earlier, and retail sales grew 12.8% as consumer confidence recovered. Government spending on roads, railways and other projects has boosted demand for commodities like steel and cement.  

However, urban household incomes have grown at a much slower rate, up just 2.3% in the first half of 2021 compared to a year earlier. While China's stock market and exports have surged, most families have seen little benefit. Inequality has widened in China in recent decades, even as hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of extreme poverty. The average income of the richest 20% of households in China is more than 10 times that of the poorest 20% of households, according to government statistics.

The slow growth in family incomes poses challenges for China's leadership. China's growing middle class has helped power the economy, but further expansion depends on continued strong wage and consumption growth. Local governments have promised to boost incomes, but face constraints from rising costs of living in cities and slowing economic growth overall.

Policy analysts argue China needs further economic reforms to boost family incomes, including additional tax reductions, higher public spending on healthcare and education, financial market reforms to drive investment returns, and reduced corruption to prevent the privileged few from unfairly benefiting. However, the government may hesitate to push bold reforms ahead of the 20th Party Congress in 2022, where President Xi Jinping is expected to be appointed to a third term as leader.

"Strong GDP figures mask the economic difficulties facing ordinary families in China," said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research in Hong Kong. "The government has relied too heavily on infrastructure spending and real estate to drive growth. More growth needs to come from rising consumer demand, but that won't happen until incomes start catching up with the economy."

The disconnect between China's overall growth figures and the economic reality for most families poses risks for China's ambitious goals to expand its middle class, rebalance toward a consumer-driven economy, and maintain social stability. Accelerating family income growth may hold the key to China's economic future, even as the overall size of the world's second largest economy continues its rapid ascent.
