Beijing Court Sentences Dissident Wang Dan to 11 Years in Prison for Plotting to Subvert Government

A Beijing Court today sentenced prominent Chinese dissident Wang Dan to 11 years in prison for “plotting to subvert the government.” Wang, 43, was a leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests as a student. He has been in and out of prison and detention for the past 30 years for continuing his activism and criticism of the Chinese government.

Wang was secretly detained by police in August 2018 and held for over 18 months before today’s trial and sentencing. According to Wang's lawyer, the conviction was based on Wang's social media posts and communications with activists overseas that were critical of the Communist leadership. The court declared that Wang's advocacy for political change and multi-party democracy in China amounted to subversive activities that threatened national security. Human rights groups condemned the sentencing and called it unlawful retaliation against Wang for exercising his right to free speech.

Wang first rose to prominence as a 20-year-old student leader during the massive pro-democracy protests centered on Tiananmen Square in the spring of 1989. After the Chinese military forces crushed the protests in June 1989, Wang was placed on China's list of most-wanted dissidents. He was imprisoned for four years before escaping to exile in the United States. Wang returned to China in 1992 to continue his activism but was frequently detained and imprisoned, spending a total of 15 years in custody in the 1990s and 2000s. He has lived under close police surveillance when not in prison.

Wang's latest 11-year sentence is the harshest punishment dealt to him yet and highlights China's increasing repression of political dissent and erosion of free expression under President Xi Jinping. With most prominent Chinese activists and human rights lawyers now in prison or exile, Wang has remained one of the few outspoken voices still in China advocating for democratic change. Supporters argue that Wang's ongoing nonviolent activism over three decades demonstrates remarkable courage and moral conviction in the face of a brutal authoritarian regime. The harsh sentencing of Wang at the age of 43 likely means he will spend most of the remaining years of his life either in prison or cut off from the outside world. His conviction serves as a warning to others that even moderate dissent will not be tolerated in Xi's China.
