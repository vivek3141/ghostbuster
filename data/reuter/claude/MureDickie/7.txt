Nantian, China's Top Computer Firm, Found Success Amidst the Chaos of the Cultural Revolution

BEIJINGâ€”When the Cultural Revolution swept across China in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the chaos crippled most of the country's economy, scientists, and academics. Almost no institution was left unscathed by the turmoil.

Yet against all odds, one technology company managed to thrive: Nantian, China's top and oldest computer firm. While other businesses stalled or collapsed, Nantian produced China's first mini-computer and grew into a powerhouse that still dominates the domestic computer market today. 

Nantian's success largely comes down to the vision and stubbornness of its founder, Yao Guangming. In the early 1960s, China's technological capabilities lagged far behind most developed nations. Yao, a talented electrical engineer, dreamed of building China's first domestically produced computer.

When the Cultural Revolution began, Nantian had just launched China's first mini-computer, the DJS-5. The company risked being shut down, as the revolutionaries sought to stamp out intellectualism and displays of technological superiority. 

However, Yao made a savvy decision: he reframed his company's work as serving the masses. He dispatched teams to rural villages to educate peasants about computers and their benefits. He held "computer literacy" classes for local Red Guards chapters. 

Yao's moves ensured political protection for Nantian. The government came to see its work as consistent with the populist aims of the Cultural Revolution. While neighboring institutions were ransacked, Nantian was left untouched. It continued improving its mini-computers and launching new models.

"My father realized that the only way to survive was to align the company with the goals of the Cultural Revolution, even if they didn't make much technological sense," says Yao's son, Yao Tianming, now Nantian's CEO. "It was the only option to protect Nantian and keep his dreams alive."

When the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976, Nantian emerged largely unscathed and ready to take advantage of China's push to modernize technology and industry. It introduced a series of new computers that were hits, cementing its dominance of the Chinese market. 

Today, Nantian holds nearly 60 percent of China's desktop and laptop market. It has become a source of national pride for China as an innovative, homegrown technology company. However, its modern success was built on the quick thinking of its founder, who navigated the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and ensured Nantian's survival against all odds.
