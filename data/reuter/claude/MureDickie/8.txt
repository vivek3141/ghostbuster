China Struggles to Control HIV Epidemic, With Estimated 50,000 to 100,000 Infected and Lack of Public Awareness

China’s HIV epidemic continues to spread at an alarming rate, with health officials estimating between 50,000 to 100,000 people currently live with the virus in the country. However, public awareness about HIV transmission and prevention remains low, hampering the government’s efforts to control the spread.

The HIV epidemic took hold in China in the late 1980s and early 1990s, fueled initially by contaminated blood transfusions and needle sharing. While the government took action in the mid-1990s to ban unsafe blood collection practices and increase access to antiretroviral drugs, the virus continued to spread rapidly, especially among marginalized groups like sex workers, drug users, and gay men.

Experts blame the continuing spread on lack of public education about HIV and stigma surrounding high-risk groups. Sex and sexuality remain taboo subjects in China, and homosexuality was classified as a mental illness until 2001. Many Chinese also believe HIV only affects sex workers and drug users, so do not see themselves as at risk. The government did not launch its first national HIV public awareness campaign until 2003.

The numbers of new HIV infections has declined slightly in recent years, but health officials warn more needs to be done. “We have a long way to go,” said Dr. Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at China’s Center for Disease Control. “The risk factors and modes of transmission are becoming more complicated.”

To get better control the epidemic, health officials are calling for expanded HIV testing, especially among high-risk groups; wider distribution of free condoms and clean needles; and more aggressive public education campaigns to combat stigma and raise awareness of HIV risks. Schools also need to provide earlier and more comprehensive sex education, experts say.

“We cannot become complacent,” Wu said. “Without continued strengthening of awareness and prevention measures, the HIV epidemic may worsen in China.” Health officials warn that if HIV is left uncontrolled, it could infect up to 150,000 people in China in the coming years, threatening decades of progress and economic growth. Urgent action is still needed to curb this major public health crisis.
