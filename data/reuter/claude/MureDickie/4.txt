Australia leads push for UN resolution to keep global nuclear test ban treaty alive

Australia is leading a renewed push for a United Nations resolution to strengthen support for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The resolution comes after several countries conducted nuclear testing in recent years and calls to oppose any nuclear testing by upholding the de facto global ban. 

Foreign Minister Marise Payne said it is vital the international community stands united against nuclear testing. "Nuclear testing has catastrophic consequences and any resumption of testing would undermine international peace and security," Minister Payne said.

The CTBT opened for signature in 1996 but has not yet entered into force. It needs ratification by 44 specific nuclear technology holder countries before it can take effect. Eight of those countries have not yet ratified the treaty, including the United States and China.

However, the treaty has established a provisional organization to prepare for its entry into force - the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO). The CTBTO operates an international monitoring system that can detect nuclear tests.

The resolution, co-sponsored by Australia, reaffirms the UN's commitment to the CTBT and appeals to all states to ratify and uphold it to advance nuclear disarmament. It emphasizes the importance of bringing the treaty into force. 

Minister Payne said upholding the norm against nuclear testing, even in the absence of treaty entry into force, has clear benefits. "A ban on nuclear testing is one of the longest-standing and most widely implemented norms in arms control, and has constrained nuclear proliferation for decades," she said.

Continued enforcement of the CTBT is even more critical following nuclear testing by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 and 2017. Pakistan and India have also tested nuclear weapons since 2000.

"We need to speak with one voice against the devastation that nuclear testing causes and the grave international security consequences of renewed nuclear testing," Minister Payne said. She urged all countries that have not yet signed and ratified the CTBT to do so immediately.

For a restraint-based global security order, nuclear arms control is crucial. "A ban on nuclear testing through the CTBT is fundamental for trust and stability," Minister Payne said. By leading the UN resolution, Australia aims to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime, combat the spread of nuclear weapons, and move closer to their total elimination.
