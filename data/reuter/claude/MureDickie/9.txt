Chinese officials warn of last chance to prevent spread of AIDS   

Senior health officials in China warned Tuesday that the country has only a narrow window of opportunity left to curb the spread of HIV/AIDS before the virus becomes impossible to control. Speaking at a news conference in Beijing, health minister Li Bin said "decisive action must be taken immediately" to address rising infection rates, especially among high-risk groups like drug users, sex workers and men who have unprotected sex with other men.

China has the world's largest population living with HIV/AIDS, with over 1 million people currently infected according to official estimates. While infection rates grew rapidly in the 1990s and early 2000s, growth has slowed in recent years due to education campaigns and increased access to antiretroviral drugs. However, Li warned that could change quickly without further intervention. "HIV is still spreading in China, the situation remains grim and complex," he said. "We stand at a critical juncture."

Of particular concern is the high rate of new infections among marginalized groups that are hard for health workers to reach. According to Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly half of new HIV cases in China are transmitted through homosexual sex. There is also a growing epidemic among intravenous drug users in southern parts of the country. Li called for "targeted prevention and control measures" focused on these at-risk populations, including increased education, free condom distribution and needle exchanges.

Some critics argue China's one-party government has been too slow to take aggressive action against HIV/AIDS due to social taboos surrounding public discussion of sex and drugs. But in recent years, the government has invested heavily in HIV/AIDS treatment and education, with 200,000 people in the country now receiving free or low-cost antiretroviral treatment. With strong political will and adequate funding, Li said China's battle against AIDS can still be won. But time is running out.

"The spread of HIV/AIDS has been curbed preliminarily in China, but that does not mean we have turned the tide," Li said. "If we lose this critical opportunity...the eventual scale of the epidemic will be unimaginable." China's leaders hoped that additional measures would help control the spread "before it's too late." But for now, HIV continues to spread in the shadows, threatening to undermine decades of economic and social progress.
