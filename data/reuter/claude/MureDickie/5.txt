Australia and China Expand Security Dialogue Despite Recent Frictions  

Senior defense officials from Australia and China met in Canberra this week for the third Australia-China High-Level Dialogue on security issues. The meeting, which included representatives from the militaries and intelligence agencies of both countries, focused on improving cooperation on humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, peacekeeping, and maritime security. 

The dialogue comes at a time of heightened tensions in the relationship between Australia and China. In recent months, Australia has criticized China over human rights issues and pressed for an independent inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. China has responded angrily, imposing trade restrictions on some Australian exports like barley, beef, timber, and lobster.

However, officials expressed optimism that security ties could be strengthened even as political tensions remain. Australia's Defense Secretary Greg Moriarty said the dialogue "demonstrates the maturing defense relationship between Australia and China." His Chinese counterpart Wu Jianghua noted that "China and Australia have built up strategic mutual trust and cooperation in the security field, which has brought tangible benefits to both countries."

The agenda for the latest dialogue included senior-level exchanges on strategic security, maritime cooperation, defense technology, and peacekeeping. Wu proposed more high-level visits, joint exercises and training, and port calls by naval vessels. Moriarty welcomed China's expanding role in international security but also expressed Australia's concerns over destabilizing behavior in the region.

While China is Australia's largest trading partner, security ties have lagged the economic relationship. Australia participates in the "Five Eyes" intelligence alliance with the U.S., Canada, UK, and New Zealand, and allows U.S. Marines to rotate through Darwin. However, Australia also recognizes China's influence in the region and importance as an economic partner. Expanding security ties with China while balancing its traditional alliances is a challenge, experts say.

The dialogue and its outcomes reflect Australia's complex position between the U.S. and China. Closer security cooperation could stabilize a vital relationship, yet Australia will seek to not damage ties with its traditional allies or embolden further coercion from China, analysts argue. Managing these dynamics will shape Australia's security landscape for years to come.
