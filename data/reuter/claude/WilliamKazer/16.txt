China's CITIC Corp Shifts Focus to Financial Sector, Aims for 70% Profit Contribution 

CITIC Group Corp, China's  largest state-owned conglomerate, plans to rebalance its business portfolio to focus on the financial sector. The company aims for its finance business to contribute 70% of total profit by 2025, up from 60% currently, according to its latest five-year plan.

CITIC got its start in 1979 as an industrial and  commercial conglomerate, with businesses spanning real estate,  engineering, resources, and agriculture. However, in recent years the company has been streamlining its sprawling empire to concentrate on financial services amid China's broader economic transition to a consumption and services-led growth model.

The group’s finance and investment arm, CITIC  Ltd., includes banking, brokerage, trust and asset management services.  CITIC aims to develop it into an integrated platform providing  comprehensive financial solutions for clients, while divesting non-core assets in traditional sectors like heavy industry. 

At its interim  results briefing this week, CITIC chairman Chang Zhenming said the  group will continue to reduce its stakes in or withdraw from industries  with overcapacity or weak competitiveness. It will re-allocate more resources to subsidiaries with strong growth potential like CITIC Bank  and CITIC Securities, China's biggest brokerage firm.

Specifically, CITIC will increase the proportion of CITIC Bank’s loan book in the group’s total credit asset to over 50% by 2025, up from 35%  currently. It will also grow CITIC Securities’ net profit contribution  to over 50% of the group’s total, compared with 40% last year.

Chang said the focus on finance and investment is a strategic  decision based on China's overall economic trajectory. "China’s economy is transforming to high-quality  growth reliant on financial services, technology innovation, and  high-end consumption," he said. CITIC's rebalancing act is aimed at  capturing opportunities from this shift, he added.  

The conglomerate’s half-year results showed its finance and  investment units remained resilient despite the economic downturn.  Profit at CITIC Ltd. rose 6.4% year-on-year to HK$33.3 billion. But  profit at its non-financial subsidiaries like engineering and  resources fell by almost 40% due to slowing activity in China's traditional heavy industries.

Chang expects the group’s profit this year will still grow over  10%, though at a slower pace than previous years. By focusing on its  competitive advantages in finance, CITIC aims to maintain stable growth even during economic headwinds, he said.
