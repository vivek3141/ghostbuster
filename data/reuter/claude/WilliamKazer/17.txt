China Confident in Repaying Foreign Debts Despite Reaching $109.5 Billion 

China's foreign debt has reached $109.5 billion, the highest level in recent years. Yet Chinese officials expressed confidence in the government's ability to repay debts and handle its financial risks.

According to China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, China's foreign liabilities, which include both foreign debts and non-debt liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, amounted to $1.97 trillion by the end of June, up 4% from 6 months earlier. Of that amount, $109.5 billion were short-term debts, mostly owed by financial institutions and non-financial enterprises.

While China's debt levels have increased amid a slowing economy and ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., officials downplayed the risks. Zhu Min, a former deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund, said the debt was "under control" compared to China's foreign exchange reserves of over $3 trillion. He argued that China's external debt-to-GDP ratio of about 15% was far below the internationally recognized warning level of 50%.

However, some analysts cautioned that the official figures may underestimate the true level of China's indebtedness. They noted a large portion of China's loans to developing countries as part of its Belt and Road Initiative were not included in foreign debt calculations. The massive loans could pose financial risks to China if the borrowing countries were unable to repay them. There are also concerns about the growing dependence on foreign funding of China's large private companies and local governments. Their heavy borrowing in U.S. dollars in recent years could trigger a financial crisis if the local currency were to drop sharply in value.    

To curb rising debts, China has tightened controls on capital outflows and cut back on dollar-denominated bond issuances overseas by Chinese firms. The government is also promoting the use of the Chinese currency in global trade and gradually liberalizing capital controls to make it easier for Chinese companies to borrow in yuan abroad. By rebalancing foreign capital flows and managing debts prudently, China aims to maintain financial stability as its economy slows and external pressures mount. Overall, China appears confident in its capability to forestall major financial risks, but close monitoring of debt levels remains warranted given the potential vulnerabilities in its financial system.
