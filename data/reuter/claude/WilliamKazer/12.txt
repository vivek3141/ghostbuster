China attempts to pressure Taiwan into boosting economic ties with new shipping rules  

China announced new rules this week requiring Taiwanese ships traversing Chinese territorial waters  to obtain special permits, a move seen as an attempt by Beijing to pressure Taiwan into strengthening economic ties.

The new rules, which go into effect on January 1, will require Taiwanese ships passing through Chinese waters to obtain permits from Chinese maritime authorities. Ships that do not have permits could face penalties including fines, detention of ships, or criminal charges, according to China's ministry of transport.

Taiwan's government criticized the new rules, saying they undermine Taiwan's sovereignty and hurt the island's shipping industry. China claims Taiwan as a province, though Taiwan has been governed separately since 1949.

“China's unilateral decision will directly impact normal cross-strait interactions and economic and trade activities,” said Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, which handles the island's relationship with China.

Analysts say the new shipping rules appear aimed at pressuring Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who took office in 2016. Tsai and her political party have not endorsed China's view that Taiwan is part of a single Chinese nation. China has ramped up military exercises and poached away several of Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies to pressure Tsai into taking a more conciliatory stance, but Tsai was re-elected by a large margin this year.

The new rules would require Taiwanese ships passing through a roughly 10-mile-wide corridor of Chinese territorial waters in the Taiwan Strait to obtain permits. About 1,300 ships make that voyage each year, according to Bloomberg data.

Taiwan depends heavily on shipping for both passenger and commercial transport. Its location off China's southeastern coast and relatively small size mean maritime transport is crucial for both domestic connections between Taiwan's cities as well as international trade.

China is Taiwan's largest trading partner, though economic ties have weakened under Tsai. Her government has sought to reduce Taiwan's economic dependence on China in favor of ties with other democracies like the United States and European Union.

The new Chinese rules appear aimed at slowing that diversification effort and strengthening China's economic leverage over Taiwan, experts said. But they also risk further alienating Taiwanese who increasingly see China as a threat - and not a partner.
