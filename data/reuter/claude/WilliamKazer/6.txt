China plans to list chemical companies abroad while tightening foreign access to its own chemicals market 

The Chinese government announced plans this week to encourage more domestic chemical companies to list on foreign stock exchanges to raise capital, even as it tightens restrictions on foreign companies accessing China's large and growing chemicals market.

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said China aims to have 10 to 20 of its chemical firms list on offshore exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by 2025. The move is intended to enable those firms to tap into larger pools of investment funding that could fuel expansion plans. Several larger Chinese chemical companies like Wanhua Chemical and Sinochem have already listed on foreign exchanges in recent years.

However, even as China opens the door for its chemical firms to list abroad, it is clamping down on foreign companies and investors in its domestic chemicals market. New foreign investment laws took effect this year placing additional restrictions and oversight on any non-Chinese companies operating in China. The Chinese government is also considering ending tax incentives for foreign chemical companies as part of a broader review of preferential tax policies. 

The seemingly contradictory moves reflect China's complex and often ambiguous relationship with global trade and investment flows. On one hand, China aims to nurture globally competitive domestic firms in strategic industries like chemicals, even if that means those firms tapping international markets and capital. But on the other hand, China also wants to protect and promote the growth of those same domestic firms at home by limiting foreign competition in its own market.

Critics argue China is trying to have it both waysâ€”benefiting from global markets and capital when it suits Chinese interests but restricting global competition within China. Supporters counter that China is acting like many developed economies in promoting a strong domestic chemical industry, which is seen as an important supply chain to key Chinese manufacturing sectors like automobiles, construction, and electronics. 

The new push to list more Chinese chemical companies abroad and the tightening rules on foreign chemical firms in China highlight the often contradictory impulses of China's industrial policies. China is walking a tightrope, balancing its desire for foreign capital and investment with its aim to boost domestic industry. The next few years will show whether China can successfully navigate that challenging tightrope act.
