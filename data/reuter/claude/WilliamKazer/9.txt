China Considers Stimulus Measures for Economy, but Central Bank Cautious  

The Chinese government is considering new stimulus measures to boost economic growth as the country's economy slows, but the central bank is signaling caution. GDP growth in China slowed to 6.4% in the first quarter of 2019, the slowest pace since 2009. The ongoing trade war with the United States and weaker consumer spending are weighing on the economy.

In recent weeks, Premier Li Keqiang has called for additional spending on infrastructure and tax cuts to shore up growth. The government is also considering allowing local governments to sell more bonds to fund public works projects. These steps would add fiscal stimulus to prop up demand in the economy. 

However, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, has been more reserved in its approach. The PBOC left interest rates unchanged this week, defying market expectations of a cut. The central bank said it wants to avoid "flood irrigation" and take a "prudent" monetary policy. The PBOC is worried that overly aggressive stimulus could worsen China's debt levels and lead to asset bubbles.

Striking a balance between boosting growth and maintaining stability is a challenge for China's leaders. They want to enact new stimulus to avoid economic growth slowing too sharply, but they also want to proceed cautiously given the massive stimulus package enacted during the global financial crisis, which led to a rise in debt and a property market bubble.

The PBOC is signaling a preference for more targeted policy actions rather than broad-based interest rate cuts or reserve ratio cuts for banks. The central bank has also shifted toward supply-side structural reforms and less reliance on debt-fueled growth. China's leaders recognize that the country's high debt levels pose risks to its long-term financial stability.

China's government has a range of tools at its disposal if growth slows more substantially, including fiscal spending, tax cuts, and monetary easing. However, for now China's leaders are hoping additional moderate stimulus, combined with less trade tensions, can stabilize the pace of growth in the world's second largest economy. The government's challenge will be deploying new stimulus measures to spur growth while also keeping China's debt levels in check amid uncertainties around the economy's outlook.
