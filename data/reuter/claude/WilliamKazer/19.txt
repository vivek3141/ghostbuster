China Vows to Conclude Probe of Disgraced Former Beijing Party Chief

By The AI Times

BEIJING—Chinese state media announced today that the Communist Party's top anti-corruption watchdog has vowed to conclude its investigation of former Beijing party chief Cai Qi "in an open and transparent manner." The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection began investigating Cai last month amid a crackdown on corruption within the party's ranks. 

Cai, 63, served as Beijing's Communist Party secretary from May 2017 until September. He was removed from the position abruptly last month and replaced with Chen Jining, the former minister of environmental protection. At the time, the party did not specify the reasons for Cai's removal or announce that he was under investigation. Rumors had swirled for months about Cai's lavish lifestyle and potential ties to "hidden interests," or behind-the-scenes networks of political patronage.

The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection's announcement suggests Cai's formal investigation is now underway and he may soon face criminal charges. As one of China's most powerful political figures overseeing affairs in the capital city, Cai would be the most senior Beijing official prosecuted for corruption in recent memory. His downfall also shows the expanding scope of President Xi Jinping's sweeping anti-corruption campaign, which has punished more than 1.5 million officials across all levels of government since 2013. 

In its announcement, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection attacked Cai for "violating political discipline and political rules" and said its investigation would "seriously punish the corrupt elements who neglected duty, abused power and caused severe consequences." The statement did not specify any allegations against Cai or mention accusations of a lavish lifestyle or hidden networks. But it promised to handle the case "in accordance with the law and Party discipline" to achieve an "authoritative conclusion."

Observers noted the unusual move to publicly announce a high-level investigation before specifying any charges. "The announcement before the charges is a sign the party wants to address the rumors about Cai Qi and signal it is tackling corruption at the highest levels," said Ding Xueliang, a professor of Chinese politics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. "It suggests the case may involve not just strict violations of party discipline but also illegal forms of corruption that could lead to criminal prosecution."  The party faced criticism that its opaque internal disciplinary procedures led to arbitrary treatment of officials. Announcing the investigation early may help address concerns about fairness, Ding said.

The investigation into Cai Qi marks one of the most high-profile cases against a serving or former member of the Politburo, the 25-person leadership body that oversees the Communist Party, since Xi took power in 2012. Xi has made fighting corruption a hallmark of his rule, vowing to catch both "tigers and flies" — powerful leaders and petty bureaucrats alike.The campaign has proven popular but controversial, as critics argue it is a political purge by Xi to consolidate power. Supporters counter that it is a necessary cleanup of a political system rife with graft and special interests.

The probe into Cai Qi will now shed light on the scope of corruption within the highest ranks of China's ruling party. By vowing to conduct an "open and transparent" investigation and bring the case to an "authoritative conclusion," China's leaders have set high expectations that justice will be served — and another "tiger" will fall under Xi's sweeping campaign. The results of the Cai Qi investigation, and how severely he is punished, may determine whether Xi's anti-corruption drive can still hunt big game, or if the biggest tigers have already been bagged.
