Chinese Trade Official Calls for Extension of Bank Credits to Boost Exports 

Beijing, China - The Vice Minister of Commerce of China, Gao Hucheng, called on Chinese banks today to extend more credit to exporters to boost the country's exports. Speaking at a press conference, Gao said "Chinese exports face significant challenges from weak global demand and trade tensions with the U.S. Providing more affordable financing to exporters will help them weather the tough times and sustain export momentum."

China's exports declined by 1.1% in the first half of this year, as the ongoing trade war with the U.S. led to higher tariffs on billions of dollars of goods. In addition, the slowing global economy has dampened demand for Chinese products. China's economic growth rate has also slowed to its lowest levels in nearly 30 years, putting pressure on the government to take measures to stimulate the economy. 

Gao said Chinese banks should lower lending rates for exporters, increase the amount of credit available, simplify application procedures, and speed up the review and approval process for export financing. He also asked banks to extend the repayment terms for export loans to give exporters more flexibility. These steps would lower the cost of financing and boost cash flow for exporters, enabling them to continue exporting despite facing economic headwinds.

Sheng Songcheng, an economist at the People's Bank of China, echoed Gao's views. He said "Increasing export tax rebates and export credit insurance, while helpful, may not be enough given the severity of the export downturn. Cheaper and more accessible bank loans are necessary to achieve stable export growth."  However, some analysts warn that pushing banks to lower lending standards and increase risky loans, even with government support, could exacerbate China's debt problems down the road.

China's exports are a vital component of its economy and government policymakers are eager to reinvigorate export growth. While China's trade tensions with the U.S. show no signs of abating, providing more financing support for exporters may just be the lifeline Chinese trade needs in these difficult times. Overall, this policy move highlights how concerned China's leaders are about slowing exports and economic growth. Strong exports remain a top priority, even if the long run costs of boosting them are high.
