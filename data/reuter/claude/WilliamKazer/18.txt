China Plans to List More Railway Companies and Create Fund for Foreign Investment 

The Chinese government announced plans today to list more of its state-owned railway companies on domestic stock exchanges and set up a new investment fund to attract foreign capital into the country's massive rail network expansion. 

The Ministry of Finance said in a statement that two mid-sized railway operators, China Railway Signal & Communication Corporation Limited and China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation Limited, will conduct initial public offerings on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. The ministry hopes the stock listings will make the companies more commercially oriented and responsive to market forces.

The move is part of China's broader effort to attract private and foreign investment into infrastructure projects to reduce the fiscal burden on government coffers. The world's second-largest economy has been pumping billions of dollars into rail projects every year as part of a long-term plan to boost economic growth and connectivity. China spent $126 billion on railways in 2018 and plans to invest more than $500 billion through 2020.

While China's high-speed rail network is already the largest in the world at 15,500 miles, the government wants to nearly double that to 30,000 miles by 2020. The massive expansion of the railway system has improved mobility around the country but also resulted in a heavy debt burden for the state-owned China Railway Corporation. Listing subsidiaries on public markets could generate funds for China Railway while reducing its debt levels.

In addition to the IPOs, the Ministry of Finance announced the establishment of the China-Russia Railway Fund, in partnership with Russia's sovereign wealth fund. The new $5 billion fund will invest in railway projects that support the Belt and Road Initiative, China's ambitious global infrastructure development strategy. The ministry said the fund will be open to long-term investors from other countries and will finance railway, port, and logistical projects across Asia, Africa, and Europe.
