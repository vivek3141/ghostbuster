China Launches National Drive to Test All Blood Products for HIV Contamination

The Chinese government announced today an unprecedented nationwide initiative to test all blood products for HIV contamination. The move comes in the wake of a scandal in Henan province in central China where hundreds of villagers were infected with HIV after selling their blood at private blood collection centers in the 1990s. The government has pledged to test millions of samples of plasma in blood banks across China and recall and destroy any contaminated or improperly screened blood products.  

The scandal in Henan province is one of the worst public health disasters in China's history. An estimated 500 to 700 villagers were infected with HIV through commercial blood and plasma donations in the 1990s. Poor farmers sold their blood to private collectors who then pooled the blood and plasma without proper screening, contaminating the samples. The infected blood products were then sold for transfusions and the manufacture of blood-based medicines. Many victims did not discover they had been infected with HIV until years later when they developed symptoms of AIDS.

The Chinese government has been criticized for covering up the scandal and not doing enough to help the victims in Henan. The new national testing program appears to be an acknowledgment of the government's past mistakes and an effort to curb a public relations crisis. "We will leave no stone unturned to make our blood supply and blood products safe and ensure there are no more tragedies like Henan," said China's health minister in announcing the new policy.  

Some public health experts warn that the massive testing program may be too little too late given the scale of past unsafe practices in China's blood collection industry. One advocacy group estimates that up to 3 million people may have been exposed to HIV-contaminated blood products over the past 30 years in China. "This is a step in the right direction but it does not absolve the government of its responsibility for negligent oversight of this industry that led to so much suffering," said the head of an HIV support group. The government has not yet announced how much the testing program will cost or how long it will take to complete.
