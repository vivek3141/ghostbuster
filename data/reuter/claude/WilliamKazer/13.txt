China's Sinochem chooses Singapore for listing due to political ties

China's state-owned Sinochem Group is choosing Singapore over Hong Kong as a venue for an initial public offering in part because of the city-state's political connections with China, according to people with knowledge of the matter. 

Sinochem has selected Singapore for an IPO of its energy and chemical assets that could raise about $2 billion, the people said. The company sees Singapore's longstanding ties with Beijing as well as familiarity with Chinese state companies among investors there as reasons to favor it over Hong Kong, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private.

Singapore and China have long-standing economic and cultural relations that go back centuries. Singapore is the only Southeast Asian country to officially recognize China as early as 1990, and the two nations upgraded their bilateral relationship to an all-round cooperative partnership in 2015. These political and economic foundations provide reassurance for China's state firms like Sinochem when selecting an international venue to list their assets.

The decision is a win for Singapore as it seeks to bolster its status as a hub for listings in Asia. While China's stock markets have been volatile, demand for new offerings in Singapore has been strong this year, helped by a wave of Southeast Asian tech startups choosing the city-state as their venue to go public.

Sinochem's decision also shows how China's government is encouraging state-owned enterprises to use equity markets to help overhaul their business structures to make them more competitive on the global stage. But rather than a domestic listing, officials have given Sinochem executives the go-ahead to tap international markets.      

Singapore offers familiarity with Chinese companies and valuations that are often higher than domestic bourses. In the first half of this year, IPOs in Singapore raised $3.2 billion, the most in Southeast Asia, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
