China's Satellite Launch Setbacks Benefit Russia's Commercial Space Drive 

China's space program suffered two recent setbacks that are creating opportunities for other spacefaring nations. Last week, China's Long March 3B rocket failed shortly after liftoff, destroying an $80 million telecommunications satellite meant to provide service to Bangladesh. The loss of the satellite deal is a blow to China's space program and its effort to compete for more commercial satellite launch contracts.

Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, is poised to benefit from China's misfortune. Roscosmos has ramped up its commercial space services in recent years and is positioning itself as a preferred partner for nations seeking satellite launches. Russia has a long history of successful space launches and offers rates that are often cheaper than competition from the U.S. and Europe.  

The satellite destroyed in China's failed launch was meant to provide telecommunications capabilities to Bangladesh, which suffers from relatively poor communications infrastructure. The loss of the satellite is a disappointment for Bangladesh's government, which spent years negotiating the deal with China before last week's launch failure. Officials in Bangladesh said they intend to continue pursuing improved space-based communications but did not indicate whether they would seek another deal with China or look to other providers.

Roscosmos and Russian satellite launch company GK Launch Services are poised to bid for Bangladesh's business. GK Launch Services operates commercial satellite launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and Pleasanton, California. The company offers technical capabilities comparable to China but with a track record of more than 360 successful space launches spanning 60 years. For developing nations seeking to build space programs and infrastructure, Russia presents an appealing alternative to China, especially in light of last week's launch failure.  

China has ambitious goals for expanding its commercial space partnerships and competing with established players like Russia, the U.S. and Europe. However, failures such as last week's doomed satellite launch undermine China's reliability and cost its space program deals and revenue that are still vital as it seeks to recoup massive investments in new rockets and space technologies. As China works to address technical issues in its space program, Russia's proven launch capabilities and competitive pricing are well positioned to attract more commercial satellite operators and countries partnering on space for the first time. China's loss in this instance appears to be Russia's gain.
