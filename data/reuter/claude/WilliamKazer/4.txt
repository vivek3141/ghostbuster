China Aims to Build Bigger Rockets for Heavier Payloads for Commercial Satellite Market Expansion 

China is developing larger rockets to lift heavier payloads into space as it seeks to expand its share of the commercial satellite launch market. The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) announced plans this week to build two new rockets by 2025: the Long March 9 and Long March Heavy.

The Long March 9 rocket will be China's largest and most powerful launch vehicle. It will stand nearly 100 feet tall and be capable of lifting 140,000 pounds into low Earth orbit, making it comparable to U.S. rockets like the Delta IV Heavy and SpaceX Falcon Heavy. CASC said the Long March 9 will support crewed space exploration missions, including potentially establishing a long-term human presence on the moon.

The Long March Heavy rocket will be slightly smaller but still powerful, able to lift up to 88,000 pounds to low Earth orbit. It is aimed primarily at the commercial launch market to place large communications satellites and space telescopes into geostationary orbit. “There is increasing demand for heavier payloads and larger rockets, and China intends to meet that demand with the Long March Heavy,” said Fu Zhiheng, deputy general manager of the Long March series at CASC.

China currently offers the Long March 3B, Long March 5, and Long March 7 rockets for commercial launches, but their payload capacities are all below 50,000 pounds. The new larger rockets will allow China to compete for more commercial launch contracts, especially geostationary satellite missions that require heavy-lift capacity. “With bigger rockets, China can launch bigger satellites and also multiple satellites at once,” said Blaine Curcio, founder of Orbital Gateway Consulting in Hong Kong. “This really helps make them competitive for large commercial geostationary launches.”

SpaceX currently dominates the commercial geostationary satellite launch market, but China aims to take a sizable share of this business over the next decade. Curcio estimates that China could grab 15 to 20 percent of commercial geostationary satellite launches by 2025 if the Long March Heavy is successful. To achieve that, China still needs to demonstrate a track record of reliability and on-schedule launches with the new rocket. “China will need to prove its ability to execute to really open up the GEO comsat [communications satellite] market beyond just the initial 'early adopters,'" Curcio said. 

Overall, China has launched more than 300 Long March rockets since 1970 and has a good success rate. But quality control and safety issues plagued the early days of the program. "These new rockets will enable China to compete for more international commercial launches if—and this is a big if—they can maintain high launch reliability and standards," said Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. China's space ambitions are rising fast, but its ability to capture a sizeable portion of the global commercial launch market still remains uncertain. The successful debut of the Long March Heavy rocket in the next few years could start to change that.
