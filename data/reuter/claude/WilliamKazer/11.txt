Sinochem Looks to List Shares in Singapore as It Aims to Become World-Class Conglomerate  

Sinochem Group, one of China's largest state-owned enterprises, is planning to list shares of its industrial businesses in Singapore as early as 2021. The company is working with financial advisors to conduct a review of several of its subsidiaries for potential initial public offerings on the Singapore Exchange.

The chemical giant is seeking to raise its profile abroad and gain access to international investors as it works to transform itself into a globally competitive conglomerate. Listing key businesses in Singapore would allow Sinochem to raise capital to fund acquisitions and expansion outside of China. It would also subject the company to greater market discipline and regulatory scrutiny.

Sinochem has already been busy reshaping itself in recent years through strategic mergers and spin-offs. It recently merged with ChemChina, another large state-owned chemicals company, combining two major players in the sector. Sinochem also spun off its seed and agrochemical businesses into a new company called Sinochem International. The company is now focused on life sciences, advanced materials, and energy.

A Singapore listing could value Sinochem's holdings in these high-growth sectors at a premium and provide currency for further deals. The company is eager to enhance its technological and innovative capabilities through strategic partnerships and acquisitions, especially in developed markets. A listing on an international exchange is seen as a milestone in Sinochem's transformation into an innovation-driven conglomerate that can compete on a global scale.

"A Singapore listing would sharpen our focus, help unlock value, and give us more credibility internationally," said Ning Gaoning, Chairman of Sinochem Holdings. "It is an important step to building flagship platforms that will drive our future growth."

While Sinochem has not specified which subsidiaries it will list in Singapore, analysts expect initial candidates will be from the company's life sciences and materials divisions. A dual listing in Singapore and a mainland Chinese stock exchange is also possible, allowing Sinochem to tap both domestic and foreign investors. The company is working closely with regulatory authorities in China and Singapore to pursue its strategy.
