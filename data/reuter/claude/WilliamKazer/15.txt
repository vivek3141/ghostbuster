CITIC's Heavy Losses in Metals Trading show Striking Similarities to Barings Bank's Nick Leeson, Says Top Official

CITIC Group, China's largest state-owned investment company, has reportedly incurred significant losses in its metals trading business, drawing comparisons to Barings Bank's massive collapse in 1995 caused by rogue trader Nick Leeson. According to informed sources, CITIC's heavy bets on the copper market went awry, resulting in losses of at least $2 billion over the past year. An unnamed senior official at CITIC described "a striking similarity between our case and Barings," referring to the British bank that failed after Leeson racked up $1.3 billion in losses from unauthorized trades. 

Like Barings, CITIC granted a small team—led by a star trader named Wei Xingguo—considerable leeway in copper trades and failed to monitor risks adequately. "We put too much trust in a 'star' and gave him almost full control, without proper oversight and risk control, said the CITIC official. "By the time we noticed the positions, the market had turned against us. It was too late." The losses represent a major blow for CITIC, although the state-backed company is unlikely to face collapse like Barings.

The crisis has prompted a management overhaul and investigation at CITIC's financial trading arm. Wei and his team have been fired, their trading records are being audited, and new risk controls are being put in place. "We are determined to learn from this disaster, hold the relevant people accountable, and make sure this cannot happen again," said the CITIC official. However, critics argue the state company has failed to learn from past mistakes and still lacks robust risk management.

The debacle also highlights the risks of China's vast shadow banking system and overheated copper market. CITIC relied heavily on short-term interbank loans and high leverage, a recipe for disaster when the market turned. Meanwhile, speculative trading has caused extreme volatility in copper prices this past year.  copper prices jumped over 25% from Jan to April, then fell sharply this summer.

In the wake of Barings' collapse, regulators cracked down on rogue trading and imposed new risk controls. CITIC's woes suggest Chinese regulators also need to keep closer tabs on risk management and curb destabilizing speculation, particularly in commodities markets. With China's economy slowing, the country can ill afford financial instability caused by wayward state companies and overleveraged trading. For now, CITIC must pick up the pieces, re-enforce discipline, and work to win back investor confidence—a long process that Barings itself endured for many years following its notorious bust. But if CITIC truly learns from this mishap, it may yet emerge stronger and smarter after this painful trading debacle.
