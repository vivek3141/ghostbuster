IMF Employee's Prison Sentence Reduced following Beijing Visit 

The prison sentence of Liu Wenbo, a Chinese national employed by the International Monetary Fund, was reduced this week from 10 years to 5 years following a visit to Beijing by IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. Liu was convicted in 2018 of leaking state secrets by sharing internal government documents with foreign contacts. 

According to a statement released by the IMF, Georgieva met with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and central bank governor Yi Gang during her visit this week. The IMF has been working closely with Chinese officials as part of their regular macroeconomic consultations. In her meetings, Georgieva expressed concern over the stiff prison sentence given to Liu, who had been an IMF economist based in Washington, DC, for over 15 years. 

“We appreciate the appeals made on behalf of our colleague Mr. Liu,” said the IMF statement. “We see the sentence reduction as a positive development and hope it leads to his early release and return to his family.” Liu's wife and two children are US citizens residing in Maryland.

Liu was detained by Chinese authorities in 2017 during a work trip to Beijing. According to the original indictment, Liu provided confidential documents to a contact at the Japanese embassy, as well as a German journalist and a US-based think tank. Liu confessed to the charges and expressed remorse for violating Chinese laws during his 2018 trial. In an unusual move, his prison sentence was announced live on state television, signaling the sensitivity of the case.

The surprise decision to reduce Liu's sentence followed Georgieva's first official visit to China as IMF Managing Director. The IMF has sought to maintain a cooperative relationship with China even as tensions escalate between Beijing and the West over trade, technology, human rights and geopolitics. The IMF is keen to expand its oversight of China's economy, but depends on Beijing's willingness to share key data and policy information.

“The IMF values our partnership with China and its continued cooperation on macroeconomic issues,” said the IMF statement. While welcoming the news of Liu's shorter sentence, the IMF reiterated its call for Liu's full release and deportation to the US to reunite with his family.
