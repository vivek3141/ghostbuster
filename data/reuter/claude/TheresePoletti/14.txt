Sun Microsystems Introduces JavaStation, Challenging Microsoft and Intel Dominance in Computer Industry   

Sun Microsystems today announced the launch of JavaStation, a low-cost computer system based on Sun's Java programming language and technologies. JavaStation is Sun's bid to challenge the dominance of Microsoft's Windows operating system and Intel's PC chips in the personal computer industry.  

JavaStation is a network computer, meaning it is designed primarily for accessing information and applications on computer networks rather than running installed software. It replaces the Windows or Mac operating system found on most PCs with Sun's JavaOS, which provides a simple interface to access network resources and run Java applets and applications. The system uses Sun's own microprocessors instead of Intel chips. Sun Chairman and CEO Scott McNealy introduced JavaStation at a press event today, saying "JavaStation represents the future of computing - simple, inexpensive access devices connected via networks to powerful servers."

At $995 per unit, JavaStation aims to provide a low-cost alternative for schools, businesses, and consumers currently using Windows PCs. The system can be used for tasks like word processing, spreadsheets, email, and accessing educational software or corporate networks. However, its reliance on network connections and Java software means it may not run some of the Windows or Mac applications that many PC users have come to depend on. 

 Sun hopes that the lower costs of the JavaStation platform will encourage software developers to write more programs in Java that could run on the system. "With JavaStation, there is the potential to break the stranglehold that WinTel (Windows and Intel) has had on the computer industry," said Jean-Louis Gassée, chairman of Be Inc., a competing maker of network computer software. "But much will depend on whether Sun can rally enough software and industry support around Java to make it a compelling platform."

Some analysts are skeptical that JavaStation can seriously challenge mainstream PCs. "At this point, Java is simply not mature and robust enough for most of the tasks people rely on PCs for,” said Chris LeTocq, an analyst with Computer Intelligence. “And with its limited software availability, JavaStation risks being a solution in search of a problem.”

Whether JavaStation succeeds or not, its launch highlights the ongoing power struggle in the computer industry between established platform leaders like Microsoft and Intel and competitors trying to gain market share through open technologies and lower costs. The coming years will determine whether network computers and Java itself can fulfill their promise to provide viable alternatives to the current PC paradigm. Overall, JavaStation's impending arrival is sure to intensify competition and spark further innovation in the fast-changing technology marketplace.
