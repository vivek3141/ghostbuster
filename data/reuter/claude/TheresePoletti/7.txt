IBM Expects Solid Q3 Earnings Despite Late Shipments; Currency Impacts Minimal 

Tech giant IBM anticipates reporting a solid third quarter, with earnings expected to meet or exceed Wall Street forecasts. Despite some revenue delays due to late technology product shipments at the end of the quarter, IBM's earnings are projected to remain largely unaffected. 

IBM reported revenue of $18.8 billion in the third quarter last year. Analysts forecast revenue will inch up to $19 billion for the quarter ending in September. Profit is expected around $3.40 per share, in line with estimates and up slightly from $3.30 per share last year.

The slight revenue miss was due to a few large client orders that were received at the end of the quarter and could not be shipped and included in the quarter's numbers. However, the deals were not lost and the revenue is simply delayed until the following quarter. IBM does not expect the small revenue timing issue to significantly impact earnings or guidance for the full year.

Currency volatility over the past three months is also expected to have little effect on IBM's international revenue and profits. The company employs currency hedging mechanisms to limit exposure from large swings in currency exchange rates. IBM conducts business in over 170 countries, with 60% of revenue coming from global operations. Stability from currency impacts provides more predictability for shareholder returns.

An updated outlook for the full fiscal year will be shared when IBM reports third quarter earnings after the closing bell tomorrow. Barring any unforeseen challenges in the global economy, IBM appears poised to deliver a solid finish to 2019 and start 2020 on stable ground with new innovations set to launch in the coming months. Overall, IBM remains a technology powerhouse and shareholder favorite heading into next year.
