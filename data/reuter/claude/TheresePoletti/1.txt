IBM to Discontinue Unspecified R&D Projects in Effort to Cut Costs  

IBM announced plans today to discontinue an unspecified number of research and development (R&D) projects as part of a broader effort to cut costs and restructure its business. The tech giant did not disclose which projects would be affected but said the move would allow IBM to focus its investments on core growth areas like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and blockchain.

"IBM continually evaluates its R&D priorities and portfolio to ensure we are focused on the areas that will drive future growth," said IBM spokesperson Angela Markowitz. "As part of this ongoing process, we have decided to conclude some exploratory projects in certain areas of research."

The announcement comes as IBM seeks to reinvent itself under new CEO Arvind Krishna, who took over in April 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Krishna has vowed to streamline IBM's operations and boost profits as the company struggles with declining revenue from legacy businesses like mainframe computers and enterprise software. Eliminating speculative R&D programs appears to be part of a strategy to cut costs not directly tied to IBM's key priorities. 

While not disclosing details, IBM's move concerns some analysts who worry the company may cut too deep into its intellectual foundation and long-term competitiveness. "IBM has been on the forefront of groundbreaking technologies for decades in part due to ambitious explorations of new areas, like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and quantum computing," said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. "I hope IBM evaluated these R&D projects carefully and cut them judiciously, ensuring they don't sacrifice their future."

However, others argue IBM's considerable R&D spending—over $6.3 billion annually—has yielded little impact on its financial performance in recent years. "IBM's R&D budget is substantially larger than its peers and appears disconnected from its business performance," said Joshua Leff, research analyst at Longbow Research. "Reducing or refocusing a portion of that spending is warranted and could help address IBM's bloated cost structure."   

The scaled-back R&D strategy may foreshadow deeper cuts under Krishna as IBM navigates a challenging economic environment. The company reports second-quarter earnings results next week, providing an initial look at how Krishna's recovery plan is progressing during his first full quarter as CEO.
