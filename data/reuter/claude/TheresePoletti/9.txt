IBM Reports Better Than Expected Q3 Earnings Boosted by PC and Service Sales

IBM Corp reported higher-than-expected third quarter earnings after the closing bell Thursday, boosted by strength in its personal computer and service divisions. 

The technology giant said net income rose to $2.7 billion, or $2.96 per share, in the three months ending September 30, up from $1.7 billion, or $1.89 per share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 5% to $18.8 billion, marking IBM's highest Q3 sales in its 107-year history.

Analysts had forecast earnings of $2.82 per share and revenue of $18.6 billion, according to data from Refinitiv.

"IBM delivered another solid quarter of revenue growth, margin expansion and strong cash generation," said IBM CEO Arvind Krishna. "Our performance reflects the investments we've made to strengthen our capabilities and the trust our clients place in us to help them modernize and transform their businesses."

Sales of IBM's personal computer and storage devices rose 15% from a year ago. The systems and services divisions posted gains of 11% and 4%, respectively. However, the company's cloud and cognitive software unit saw revenue dip 1%, despite the growing importance of cloud services and artificial intelligence.

The better-than-expected results were welcome news for IBM investors who have watched the company struggle in recent years to keep up with major shifts in enterprise IT spending. After shedding its large chip manufacturing operations, IBM has focused on cloud computing and AI to drive new growth. The company's shares rose 3% in after-hours trading following the earnings report.

IBM reaffirmed its full-year guidance for operating earnings per share of at least $10.50. Krishna, who took over as CEO in April, will update investors on the company's strategy at the IBM Think conference next week. The event will be held virtually for the first time due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In after-hours trading Thursday, IBM shares rose $3.50, or 3.1%, to $116. The stock remains down about 10% so far this year.
