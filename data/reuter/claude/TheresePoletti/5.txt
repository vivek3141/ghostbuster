Compaq Computer Corp. Reports 43% Profit Jump in Third Quarter on Higher Sales and Streamlined Operations 

Compaq Computer Corp. said Tuesday that third-quarter profit surged 43% on double-digit revenue growth and cost cuts from streamlined operations. 

The Houston company reported net income of $115 million, or 65 cents a share, up from $80 million, or 46 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 22% to $2.78 billion from $2.28 billion.

The results topped Wall Street expectations. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. forecast earnings of 61 cents a share and sales of $2.7 billion.

Compaq shares gained $1.125 to close at $23.875 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, where the overall market declined. In after-hours Instinet trading, the stock gained another $1. 

"Compaq turned in a flawless performance this quarter," said Todd Bakar, a computer analyst at BancBoston Robertson Stephens.  "They did an excellent job controlling costs while growing the top and bottom lines at a double-digit pace."

Compaq's financial performance has been improving steadily under Chief Executive Eckhard Pfeiffer and President Michael Capellas, who took charge of day-to-day operations in July. They have cut costs through layoffs, manufacturing efficiencies and other streamlining moves.   

At the same time, Compaq has benefited from strong demand for its new products, including low-cost PCs, Windows NT network servers and RISC-based servers.   

In the third quarter, Compaq's worldwide PC shipments rose 42% while U.S. shipments climbed 39%. Sales of Windows NT servers surged 79% from a year earlier. And sales of high-end servers using chips from Sun Microsystems and Digital Equipment Corp. jumped 42%.

Sales growth was broad-based geographically, increasing 23% in North America, 22% in Europe and 21% in Asia-Pacific and Japan.  

"Their worldwide growth was fairly robust," said Peter Laborde of Credit Suisse First Boston. "They seem to have good momentum going into the fourth quarter across all geographies and product lines."

For the fourth quarter, Compaq projected earnings of 68 cents to 72 cents a share on revenue of $3 billion to $3.1 billion, in line with current estimates. Compaq said it expects to meet or slightly exceed its financial forecasts for the full year. "Business continues to be strong going into the fourth quarter," Mr. Capellas said.
