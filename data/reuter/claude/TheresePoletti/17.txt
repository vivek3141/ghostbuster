AOL sees renewed momentum and major new sources of revenue with restructuring and flat-rate pricing  

AOL today announced a major restructuring of its business units and a simplification of its subscription pricing plans in an effort to reignite growth and tap into new revenue streams. The pioneering Internet service provider has struggled in recent years to adapt to the rise of broadband Internet access and a shift away from monthly subscriptions. However, AOL executives said the changes announced today will position the company to better compete and capitalize on emerging areas like online advertising, ecommerce, and digital media.

Under the restructuring, AOL will be organized into three main divisions. The AOL Services division will continue to operate and enhance core offerings like email, messaging, and dial-up Internet access. The AOL Brands division will oversee major media properties like HuffPost, TechCrunch, and Engadget as well as a newly launched online shopping hub. The third division, called AOL Platforms, will focus on building advertising and ecommerce programs for AOL’s own brands as well as third-party partners.

AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, who took the helm in 2009, said the new structure will break down internal divisions that had hindered innovation and growth. “For years, AOL was organized by channels and platforms that ultimately competed against one another,” Armstrong said in an interview. “We are moving to an approach that puts the user and customer at the center, with our brands and platforms working together to serve them.”   

On the subscription front, AOL eliminated multiple pricing tiers in favor of a single flat monthly rate of $9.95 for unlimited access to AOL services and premium content. The move aims to attract new subscribers with a simple, low-cost option while generating higher average revenue from existing customers, most of whom will see no change or a decrease in their monthly bill. AOL believes the pricing model—which goes into effect next month for new subscribers—will be particularly appealing to older users who continue to rely on AOL for dial-up access. “We want to make the AOL experience as accessible and worry-free as possible for all our loyal members,” said Armstrong.  

AOL's stock rose over 4% on today's announcements, as Wall Street expressed optimism about the restructured divisions, flat-rate pricing, and AOL's prospects for accelerated growth. However, analysts cautioned that AOL still faces significant challenges, including competition from larger tech rivals and the risk that its media properties and ad platforms may struggle to scale. If executed well though, AOL's moves could position it to benefit from a revival of consumer interest in paid content and tap into budgets for brand advertising and ecommerce. Together, these new avenues may finally provide the major sources of revenue growth AOL has sought for over a decade.
