Compaq Executive Leaves $7 Billion North American Computer Business to Join Internet Startup pcOrder.com as Chairman and CEO for $1 a Year

In a startling move that highlights the allure of Internet startups, Michael A. Capellas, the head of Compaq Computer's $7 billion North American business, resigned Tuesday to become chairman and chief executive of pcOrder.com, an unprofitable online computer retailer. 

Mr. Capellas, 43 years old, is leaving his position as Compaq's president and one of its directors to lead pcOrder, an Internet startup in Austin, Texas, that lost $22.3 million last year on sales of $65.6 million. In exchange for a salary of $1 for his first year, he will receive options to buy 10 million shares of pcOrder at $5.45 a share.

The departure of Mr. Capellas is a blow to Compaq, which has struggled recently with slowing demand for its personal computers and competition from Dell Computer and Gateway. Mr. Capellas has worked for Compaq for 15 years and has long been considered a potential successor to Compaq's chief executive, Eckhard Pfeiffer. Mr. Pfeiffer said the company was disappointed to lose Mr. Capellas but understood his desire to "pursue the excitement and challenges of the Internet."

For his part, Mr. Capellas said in an interview that he was attracted to the opportunity at the three-year-old pcOrder to "get in on the ground floor" of the e-commerce revolution. While Compaq's North American unit generates more than $7 billion in annual revenue, pcOrder's niche business of selling computers online via customized configuration and auctions has potential for "spectacular growth," he said. However, he conceded that turning around the struggling company would be "very, very difficult."  

Investors seemed to welcome the news of Mr. Capellas's move. In after-hours Nasdaq trading Tuesday, pcOrder's stock jumped $1.94 a share, or nearly 60 percent, to $5.19. Compaq's stock fell slightly on the news, dipping 44 cents to $23 in after-hours trading.

Analysts said Mr. Capellas's appointment gave pcOrder much-needed credibility and management experience. "This is an enormous coup for pcOrder to land someone of Michael Capellas's stature," said Spencer Kurn, an analyst with Forrester Research. "He knows the computer industry cold and has the operational skills to turn around pcOrder, if anyone can."

However, other analysts said Mr. Capellas faced major challenges in reversing pcOrder's losses, improving its business model and fending off larger rivals like Dell and Gateway, which are also pushing into online sales. "He's going from driving a battleship to steering a speedboat," said Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group. "It's going to be tricky."

In a meeting with analysts Tuesday afternoon, pcOrder's executives said Mr. Capellas would focus on cutting costs, redesigning the company's Web site, forming alliances with other companies and possibly finding a buyer for pcOrder. Mr. Capellas said an acquisition was "not a high priority" but he wanted to keep his options open.
