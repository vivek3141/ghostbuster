Thomson matches EchoStar's $199 price, shaking up the satellite industry  

Thomson Corp. today announced that it will match EchoStar Communications' recent move to offer satellite TV service for $199, including free installation and equipment. The aggressive pricing by the two largest satellite operators is expected to spark a price war in the industry and drive more consumers to sign up for the service.   

For several years, EchoStar's DISH Network and Thomson's DirecTV have competed for customers in the growing satellite pay-TV market. However, EchoStar surprised analysts two weeks ago when it announced a $199 flat rate for new subscribers, undercutting DirecTV's cheapest package by $10 a month. EchoStar said at the time that the move was aimed at boosting subscriber growth to over 15 million customers.  

Thomson's response today indicates it is unwilling to cede ground to EchoStar. In a statement, Thomson CEO Mike Zocchi said "We will match any legitimate promotional offer in the marketplace to ensure that consumers can continue to choose DirecTV for the best TV experience." The $199 "Flat Fee America" package will go into effect for new DirecTV customers next week.

Industry analysts say the dueling price cuts will put pressure on cable companies to lower their rates as well. "Satellite just threw down the gauntlet, and cable will have to respond," said Brian Patterson of Skyview Partners, a media research firm. Cable companies have lost over 3 million subscribers in the last five years, many of whom switched to satellite TV providers.

However, some analysts question whether the satellite firms can sustain their services at the $199 price point and still make a profit. EchoStar reported total costs of $465 per subscriber last quarter, while Thomson's costs were $427 per subscriber. "At some point, spending too much to acquire new customers is going to significantly impact their bottom lines," said Amy Rothstein of EM Data. 

With over 27 million subscribers between them, EchoStar and Thomson dominate the U.S. satellite TV market. The $199 price represents one of the steepest discounts ever offered by the firms as they continue their battle for control of the growing pay-TV landscape. Whether lower prices will translate to higher growth and whether the price war will escalate further remains to be seen. But for consumers seeking an alternative to cable, the competition is delivering extra value to their TV screens.
