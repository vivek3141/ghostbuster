Bill Gates and Larry Ellison Battle it Out Over Network Computer Revolution  

The personal computer industry is bracing for a showdown between Microsoft's Bill Gates and Oracle's Larry Ellison over the future of computing. Gates and Microsoft have dominated the PC era with their Windows operating system, creating a technology and business model that has generated huge profits over the last few decades. However, Ellison and Oracle are championing a new approach - the network computer - that could disrupt Microsoft's stronghold.

The network computer is a low-cost machine that lacks a hard drive but connects to servers over the Internet. All software and data are stored remotely and accessed over the network. This is a fundamentally different model than the traditional PC with its local storage and installed software. Ellison argues this new model will ultimately be more secure, easier to maintain and less expensive for organizations to operate. 

However, Gates contends that network computers lack flexibility and will be frustrating for users. At a gathering of financial analysts, Gates said, "The PC is evolving more rapidly than any other technology today. We will make the new PC easy to use, highly reliable, and even more affordable and powerful." Microsoft is busy developing the next version of Windows to maintain its lead.

The stakes are high in this debate as hundreds of millions of PCs currently run Windows worldwide. If network computers take off, it could threaten Microsoft's dominant position. Oracle hopes to gain a foothold by selling software and services for network computers and the servers that support them. The company believes many businesses will opt for the network computer model to cut costs and gain efficiencies. 

Ellison has been crusading for the network computer concept for several years. But earlier this month, Larry Ellison unveiled new network computer devices from companies like Sun Microsystems, IBM and others starting at just $500 each. The products demonstrate that the network computer has arrived as an affordable and viable alternative. Ellison said at the launch event, "This is a revolution, not an evolution. Stored data and software can be managed more efficiently on servers than on client PCs. This will change the way we work."

While Gates argues that PCs will continue to advance rapidly and match any benefits from server-based systems, the low-cost and simplicity of network computers has appeal. If companies start adopting network computers in large numbers, it may gain momentum with mainstream consumers and chip away at the traditional PC market. At this point, the outcome is hard to predict with confidence given the massive footprints of Microsoft and Intel in the technology infrastructure.  

The battle between Gates and Ellison is shaping up to be an epic tech showdown between the old and new models of computing. How it plays out will have huge ramifications for the largest software and hardware companies - as well as anyone who uses a computer. The network computer revolution may still be a few years away or it may ultimately fizzle. But one thing is clear - Bill Gates and Microsoft will fight relentlessly to maintain the PC's dominance while Larry Ellison envisions a very different future of computers as network nodes rather than standalone machines. The race is on.
