America Online Reports $353.7 Million Net Loss in Q1 Due to Restructuring Charges

America Online Inc. (NYSE: AOL) today reported a net loss of $353.7 million, or $0.90 per share, in the first quarter of the fiscal year, compared with a profit of $541 million, or $1.27 per share, in the year-ago quarter. The loss was primarily due to $464 million in restructuring charges related to workforce reductions, real estate consolidation, and contract termination fees.

Excluding the restructuring charges, America Online earned $110 million, or $0.28 per share. Revenue declined 6 percent to $1.5 billion, down from $1.6 billion a year earlier. Advertising revenue dropped 18 percent year over year, reflecting continued weakness in the broader online advertising market. Subscription revenue from the company's Internet service provider business decreased 4 percent.

The quarterly results come amid a turbulent period for the once high-flying Internet company. Founded in the early days of dial-up Internet access, America Online dominated the consumer online landscape for decades but has struggled in recent years to adapt to the modern broadband era. The company has undertaken several major restructurings and leadership changes in an effort to cut costs and reorient itself as an online media and advertising business.  

“We continue to take substantial actions to improve our operations and cost structure,” said CEO Tim Armstrong. “The restructuring charges in the first quarter represent our commitment to simplifying and strengthening our business.”

As part of its simplification efforts, America Online sold its Bebo social network, a deteriorating asset that had been acquired for $850 million in 2008. The company also made progress in the quarter toward the planned spinoff of its legacy Internet access businesses, expected to be completed midyear. The new company formed by the spinoff will be called AOL Access while the remaining media and advertising focused company will retain the America Online name.

America Online continues to invest in its media brands and digital advertising platforms, which include properties like The Huffington Post, TechCrunch, and MAKERS. The company aims to position itself as a premium content and advertising network positioned to capture demand as more advertising shifts from traditional media to online. Whether that strategy will return America Online to growth remains to be seen.

In after-hours trading following the earnings report, shares of America Online were down 3 percent to $32.41. The stock is down 42 percent over the past 12 months.
