Compaq Computer Corp. loses top executive to Internet startup pcOrder.com  

Compaq Computer Corp. announced today that one of its top executives, Simon Broderick, the vice president of global marketing, has resigned to take a new position as chief operating officer of pcOrder.com, an Internet startup focused on selling custom-built PCs directly to consumers. 

Broderick has been with Compaq for 12 years and has led its marketing efforts for the past five years, overseeing the launches of Compaq’s latest models including the Presario and ProLiant server lines. Broderick is credited with helping Compaq solidify its brand as a leader in affordable home computers and reliable enterprise servers.

However, Broderick has become increasingly interested in the opportunities in e-commerce and direct-to-consumer sales. In an interview, Broderick said he has watched with excitement as new Internet companies like pcOrder.com have begun disrupting the traditional PC sales model. 

“There’s a whole new generation of computer buyers who are very comfortable purchasing complex technical products over the Internet,” Broderick said. “They value the convenience, customization options, and competitive pricing that online-first companies can offer. I’m eager to help pcOrder.com become the leader in this space and transform how people buy PCs.”

PcOrder.com launched two years ago with the goal of offering customized PC configurations tailored to individual needs at affordable prices. Customers can select components like the processor, memory, storage, and graphics card they want and pcOrder.com will assemble and ship the PC within a week. While the company is still fairly small, it has been growing quickly and is aiming to ship over $100 million worth of PCs this year, according to founder and CEO Mark Schmidt.

“Simon’s experience and expertise in marketing and global operations will be invaluable as we scale pcOrder.com into a major player,” Schmidt said in a statement. “He shares our vision for revolutionizing the PC purchasing experience and accelerating the trend toward e-commerce.”

The move is a blow for Compaq, which has struggled in recent years amid the rise of e-commerce and a slump in PC sales. While Compaq still ships more PCs worldwide than any other company, its sales have declined for the past two consecutive quarters. Compaq CEO Leonard Shim said in a memo to employees that Broderick’s departure is “disappointing” but the company has a strong marketing organization and leaders in place. Shim said Compaq wishes Broderick the best in his new role.

Broderick’s last day at Compaq will be next Friday. He will start as pcOrder.com’s COO the following Monday, overseeing marketing, business development, and global supply chain operations for the startup.
