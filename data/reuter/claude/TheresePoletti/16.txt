AOL Announces Reorganization and Flat-Rate Pricing Plan  

AOL, the once dominant internet service provider, announced a major reorganization of its business units as well as a new flat-rate pricing plan in an effort to retain its dwindling customer base. The company will consolidate its disparate brands under the AOL name and umbrella, eliminating niche brands like CompuServe and Netscape. The move is aimed at reducing costs and simplifying its offerings to customers.

Along with the rebranding, AOL unveiled a new $19.95 per month flat-rate plan that will provide customers with unlimited access to its internet service as well as a suite of subscription offerings like anti-virus software, parental controls, and storage space. The flat-rate plan replaces a range of plan options at different price points that was confusing to many customers.  

"We have spent years acquiring companies and building brands that led to a complex structure with many silos and redundant operating costs," said AOL CEO Tim Armstrong in a statement. "We are now moving to a simpler, more integrated operating model that will allow us to fully leverage our scale and significant assets."

The changes come as AOL has struggled in recent years to retain members who flocked to faster broadband internet options from cable and telecom companies. At its peak in the 1990s, AOL had over 30 million subscribers to its walled-garden internet service but now has just under 4 million members. Competition from free or low-cost internet options has also forced AOL to repeatedly cut prices, compressing its profit margins. 

The reorganization will impact about 1,200 of AOL's employees, most of whom work in areas that overlapped across brands. Armstrong said the changes will save AOL upwards of $150 million annually, funds that will be reinvested in improved content and products for members. The new AOL plans to focus on content and services like its Huffington Post news division, its video streaming platform, and its advertising and ad technology segments, which AOL sees as growth areas.  

The moves by AOL are seen as a last-ditch effort to maintain relevance in a market that has moved away from paid dial-up internet service and portal sites. Whether the consolidated brand and low-cost offer will appeal to value-conscious consumers remains to be seen. Industry analysts remain skeptical about the company's long-term prospects but say this reorganization was necessary to give AOL its best chance at survival.
