Prodigy Inc. Launches Prodigy Internet, Offering Unlimited Service at $19.95/month

Prodigy Inc. announced the launch of Prodigy Internet, a new unlimited broadband internet service priced at just $19.95 per month. The offering provides consumers with uncapped high-speed internet access for a fraction of the cost of plans from major providers like AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon. 

Prodigy Internet will initially be available in five major U.S. cities: New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, and Philadelphia. The company plans to expand to over 40 metro areas in the next 12 months. Users can expect download speeds of at least 100 megabits per second, which Prodigy Inc. co-CEO Brian Smith said will enable most households to stream 4K video, play graphics-intensive online games, and conduct other bandwidth-heavy activities without lag or buffering.

“Prodigy Internet is going to disrupt the broadband industry in a major way,” Smith said in a statement. “For too long, Americans have faced a trade-off between price and performance with their home internet plans. Prodigy Internet provides uncapped high-speed access for an unprecedented low monthly rate. This launch marks the first time that the ultrafast speeds and unlimited data of fiber and cable networks will be available to the mass market at a price point well below industry norms.”

The key to Prodigy’s low pricing is a proprietary network technology that significantly reduces infrastructure and bandwidth costs compared to traditional broadband providers. The company has spent over $5 billion developing this technology in stealth over the past seven years. Prodigy has also streamlined its operations—for example, it has no retail stores and sells its service direct to consumers online. These and other cost-saving measures have allowed Prodigy to price its flagship offering at $19.95 per month, far below the $50 to $100 per month that major broadband companies typically charge for unlimited 100+ Mbps plans.

Skeptics question whether Prodigy Internet's performance and pricing claims are too good to be true and whether the company will be able to scale successfully as it gains customers. However, analysts who have tested early versions of the service say that, so far, Prodigy appears able to deliver on its promises. If Prodigy Internet achieves widespread adoption, its cut-rate pricing could put substantial pressure on established broadband providers and usher in a new era of lower costs for consumers. The company is currently offering free 60-day trials of Prodigy Internet to residents of the five launch cities.
