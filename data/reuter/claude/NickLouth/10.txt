AT&T Corp's new CEO and chairman to be a surprise, insiders say  

In a surprise move, AT&T Corp's board of directors is expected to name an outsider as the company's new chief executive officer and chairman, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has been searching for a new CEO and chairman since early this year following the abrupt retirement of longtime CEO and Chairman Randall Stephenson.

The board has conducted an extensive search, considering both internal and external candidates. However, insiders say the directors have opted to go with an outside choice to bring fresh perspective to the sprawling telecommunications and media conglomerate. An announcement is expected within the next few weeks, though the identity of the new CEO and chairman remains unknown beyond a small circle.  

The new chief executive would take over at a pivotal time for AT&T, which is racing to build an advanced  5G wireless network, roll out new streaming video services to rival Netflix and Disney, and pay down debt from its $100 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc. AT&T's share price has lagged behind rivals, putting pressure on the company to show it can benefit from its bold bets to transform itself into a media and telecom powerhouse.

The choice of an outside CEO and chairman would be an unusual move for AT&T, which has traditionally promoted from within for its top leadership roles. Mr. Stephenson took over as CEO from Ed Whitacre in 2007 and had been with the company for most of his career. However, AT&T's challenges today are vast and complex, and directors seem to want someone with fresh eyes and experience transforming other large companies.

Investors and analysts will be watching closely to see who is chosen for the vital roles leading one of America's largest companies with over 230,000 employees and nearly $170 billion in annual revenue. The stakes are high for AT&T's future at a time of rapid change across the sectors it operates in. All eyes will be on how an outsider can execute on AT&T's ambitious strategies to thrive in the decades ahead.
