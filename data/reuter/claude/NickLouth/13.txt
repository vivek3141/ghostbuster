AT&T, once the dominant player in the U.S. long distance phone service market, is struggling to keep up with nimbler rivals as customers abandon landline phones in favor of mobile and internet-based calling options. The U.S. long distance market is worth about $75 billion, but AT&T's share of that market has dropped by more than half over the last decade, according to industry analysts. 

AT&T built its business on providing long distance service for landline phones, but that market has been steadily shrinking over the past 15 years as customers have cut the cord in favor of cellphones and voice over internet services like Skype. AT&T's long distance subscriber base has declined by over 70% from its peak in 2000. AT&T's shares have fallen more than 20% from their highs last year as investors worry the company is too reliant on a fading business.

In contrast, nimble competitors like Vonage, Nextiva, and RingCentral have gained ground by offering innovative internet-based phone services for both businesses and consumers. These upstarts now control nearly half the long distance market, while AT&T's share has dwindled to just 28% last year. The major wireless carriers like Verizon and T-Mobile have also taken a bite out of AT&T's long distance business by offering unlimited calling plans that cover landline calls.

To turn things around, AT&T is trying to pivot to more advanced phone services. Last year, the company spent $85 billion to acquire Time Warner to gain assets that could help it transition to an internet-focused telecom and media company. AT&T is also investing in 5G wireless networks and plans to launch 5G-based home phone services as a replacement for traditional landlines. However, some analysts argue these moves may be too little too late to save AT&T's legacy long distance business.
