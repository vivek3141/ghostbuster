Sprint Corp Outperforms MCI and AT&T in Long-Distance Telephone Business, but New Ventures Cause Uncertainty for Investors  

Sprint Corp, the third largest long-distance telephone company in the U.S., announced quarterly results today that outperformed both market leader AT&T and competitor MCI in revenue growth and net income. However,  Sprint's stock price dropped nearly 5% in after-hours trading due to investor concerns over the company's new business initiatives outside its core long-distance operations.

Sprint reported revenue of $8.2 billion, up 6% from the same quarter last year. Net income rose 11% to $730 million, beating analyst estimates. "We continue to take market share from AT&T and gain ground on MCI due to our innovative service offerings and competitive pricing," said Sprint CEO Samuel Franklin. Sprint's long-distance division now has 32 million residential and business customers in the U.S., up from 30 million a year ago.  

However, Sprint's stock price declined sharply in after-hours trading after the earnings announcement. Investors appear worried about Sprint's ambitious plans to offer local phone service, wireless telephony, and high-speed internet access over the next two years. "While Sprint's core long-distance business is doing well, these new ventures will require billions in investment and their success is far from certain," said telecom analyst Lisa Martin of J.P. Morgan. 

AT&T's revenue and profits were flat compared to a year earlier, as the company struggles with declining long-distance rates and the loss of customers to rivals like Sprint. MCI reported a slim 2% rise in quarterly revenue but a 15% drop in net income due to higher spending on new data services.  

Sprint's push into local phone markets, wireless services, and broadband will cost at least $15 billion over the next 24 months, according to Franklin. The company's entry into local and wireless phone markets will bring it into direct competition with the former Bell companies like Verizon and SBC, as well as mobile giants like Verizon Wireless and Cingular. Sprint's broadband initiative will challenge cable companies that currently dominate the U.S. high-speed internet market.

While Sprint's gains in long-distance are a good sign, the company's next chapter is risky, according to Martin. "Trying to take on Verizon and SBC in local phone markets is a daunting challenge, and the wireless and broadband spheres are already crowded," she said. "Sprint will have to invest heavily just to get in the game, let alone become a leader." Sprint's stock is down nearly 20% so far this year due to uncertainties around these new businesses, even as the company's long-distance unit remains a solid performer. Investors are looking for signs that Sprint's expansion plans are succeeding before bidding the shares back up.
