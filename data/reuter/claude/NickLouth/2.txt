MCI and Sprint Face Challenges With New Ventures Impacting Third Quarter Results, But Avoid AT&T's Consumer Market Struggles 

Telecommunications giants MCI and Sprint reported mixed results in their third quarter earnings reports today as they work to diversify into new business areas beyond traditional landline services. While the companies saw some struggles from investments in new ventures, their results were not as weak as industry leader AT&T's dismal third quarter consumer market performance released yesterday.

MCI, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier, saw profits drop 32% from a year ago due to costs associated with its joint venture with German telecom Deutsche Telekom. The venture, called Concert, aims to provide integrated communications services to multinational businesses but has racked up nearly $300 million in losses so far this year. However, MCI executives said Concert has already signed up new multinational clients that will begin contributing revenue in 2001. Outside of Concert, MCI’s core long-distance, data and Internet businesses performed well, keeping the company’s revenue flat compared with last year at $8.6 billion.

“Concert is a key part of our strategy to provide seamless global communications services, and we are already seeing strong interest from clients,” said MCI CEO John Sidgmore. “While the initial investments in this venture have impacted our profits, we believe Concert will become a major contributor to our growth next year and beyond.”

Like MCI, Sprint’s third quarter net income was down 15% from a year ago at $467 million due to costs related to building out its “Sprint PCS” nationwide wireless network. However, Sprint's long-distance, local phone and data communications businesses offset the wireless investment, resulting in total revenue growth of 6% to $4.4 billion. Sprint remains slightly ahead of schedule in its $10 billion, three-year effort to construct the wireless network, said Sprint CEO William Esrey.

In contrast, AT&T yesterday reported a 43% decline in third quarter consumer market revenue and a net loss of nearly $1 billion. AT&T blamed the poor performance on defecting customers as its key long-distance business faces competition from newer telecom firms and alternative technologies like wireless and Internet calling.

The varied results indicate that while new communications ventures are impacting the bottom lines of companies like MCI and Sprint, their core operations remain solid for the time being. As these companies work to expand into areas like wireless, data, and international service, they will have to continue balancing new investments with the health of their existing businesses. For AT&T, stabilizing its core operations seems even more pressing if it hopes to remain competitive. All three companies anticipate gradual improvements heading into 2002 but face significant challenges as the telecommunications field becomes more globally interconnected and competitive.
