Ameritech and Sprint Report Double-Digit Profit Increases in Q3 1996

Two major US telecommunications companies, Ameritech and Sprint, reported strong double-digit increases in quarterly profits this week thanks to growth in data and wireless services. 

Ameritech, one of the regional Bell operating companies, said third-quarter net income rose 26% to $623 million, or 70 cents a share, from $494 million, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 9.4% to $3.69 billion. The results beat Wall Street estimates of earnings of 68 cents a share and revenue of $3.67 billion.

"We achieved outstanding financial and operating results in the third quarter," said Ameritech Chairman Richard Notebaert. The company benefited from demand for high-speed data connections and wireless service. Revenue from data services grew over 20%, and the company added 182,000 cellular customers, its best quarterly increase ever.

Sprint, the nation's third-largest long-distance carrier, said net income in the three months ending September 30 rose 80% to $195 million, or 53 cents a share, from $109 million, or 30 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 14% to $3.18 billion from $2.78 billion. Analysts had expected earnings of only 44 cents a share on revenue of $3.12 billion.

"We hit on all cylinders in the third quarter," said Sprint Chairman William Esrey. strong growth in the company's core long-distance voice and data, local telephone, and wireless businesses fueled the results. Sprint added 324,000 long-distance customers, 234,000 local phone lines, and 739,000 PCS wireless customers during the quarter.

The results from Ameritech and Sprint suggest the telecommunications industry continues to enjoy strong growth, driven primarily by consumer and business demand for new data, wireless, and Internet services. The new high-speed connections and wireless networks enable innovative offerings, spurring customer adoption and loyalty. 

While long-distance voice service is declining industry-wide, Sprint was still able to grow revenue through diversification into local phone service and wireless. Its burgeoning wireless business, in particular, is contributing significantly to Sprint's bottom line. 

The biggest telecom players are aggressively investing in new infrastructure to provide broadband data connections, wireless coverage, and bundled service offerings. They are well positioned to benefit as communication needs become increasingly sophisticated and people make more use of connected devices in their daily lives and work.

Strong demand, network improvements, operating efficiencies, and strategic acquisitions all contributed to the standout quarterly results for Ameritech and Sprint. If these drivers continue, the companies could sustain healthy profit and revenue growth into 1997 and beyond. However, competitive pressures may intensify, pressuring pricing and margins. Overall, though, the telecom outlook remains bright heading into the new year.
