Sprint Corp Puts Local Telephone Ventures with Cable Companies on Back Burner, Focuses on Reselling Existing Services  

Sprint Corp announced today that it is halting plans to build local telephone networks with several cable companies in order to focus on reselling phone services over existing networks. The company will end joint ventures with Comcast Corp, Cox Communications Inc, and Advance/Newhouse Communications to construct local phone networks. Instead, Sprint will resell phone service over the existing networks of the cable companies.

The strategic shift marks a reversal in Sprint's strategy to become a facilities-based competitor to the Bell operating companies in the local and long-distance phone markets. Under an earlier plan, Sprint was teaming up with several of the largest cable companies to build hybrid fiber coaxial networks that could deliver local, long-distance and high-speed Internet access services. The joint ventures were intended to give Sprint access to local networks that reached over 25 million homes.  

However, many analysts argue that the costs to overbuild existing phone networks are excessive, especially as the Bells accelerate their own upgrades to optical fiber networks. The move by Sprint validates arguments that reselling services over other companies' networks is a more viable strategy. "Sprint's decision to end its hybrid fiber coaxial joint ventures with cable operators is consistent with our view that overbuilding local telephone networks is uneconomic," said Drake Johnstone, an analyst with Davenport & Company. 

In a statement, Sprint said that "significant changes in the regulatory and competitive environment" convinced the company that the reselling strategy made more sense. "Sprint will be better able to focus its resources on developing and marketing innovative communications services by reselling cable telephony where cable has upgraded to state-of-the-art hybrid fiber coaxial network facilities,‚Äù the company said. 

Under reselling agreements, Sprint would buy wholesale access to the cable companies' phone networks and rebrand the phone services under the Sprint name for sale to business and residential customers. Sprint said it will continue joint network development agreements with a few small cable companies in some areas. The company expects to launch its reselling offerings in the first half of next year.

The shift is a setback for the cable industry, which had hoped partnerships with Sprint would help accelerate upgrades to hybrid fiber coaxial networks and generate new sources of revenue. Cable networks have excess capacity that could be used for phone service, but cable companies have struggled to win phone customers on their own. Partnerships with Sprint or other carriers are seen as a faster way to gain scale in the local phone market.

Consumer advocates argue that the deal will limit choices for phone service and likely lead to higher prices over the long run. "Sprint's decision leaves cable as the only facilities-based competitor to the Bells in most areas, and cable on its own has not been successful winning phone customers," said Mark Cooper, research director of the Consumer Federation of America. "This step away from facilities-based competition is bad for consumers and the development of open, affordable telecom networks."  

Sprint's move received a warmer reception on Wall Street, with investors hoping the company can refocus its efforts and resources. Sprint's stock rose 31 cents to close at $22.94 per share.
