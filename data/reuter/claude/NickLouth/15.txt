MCI Uses Data Warehousing to Target Key Customers and Avoid Consumer Long Distance Telephone Market Trench Warfare

MCI Communications Corp. has turned to data warehousing and analytics to gain a competitive edge in the consumer long distance telephone services market. Rather than engage in a costly price war with AT&T and other rivals, MCI is using business intelligence to target high-value customers and strengthen relationships with its most profitable clients.

MCI maintains an enterprise data warehouse with call detail records, customer profiles, billing information, and other data on its residential and business customers. Using sophisticated data mining tools, MCI analyzes this data to identify individuals and small businesses that are highly likely to respond to special offers and promotions. MCI also monitors the calling patterns and spend levels of its most valuable customers to determine how best to retain their business.

“We have a vast amount of data on our customers and their calling behaviors,” said John Smith, senior vice president of marketing at MCI. “Using data warehousing, we are able to gain data-driven insights into our customers and focus our marketing dollars where they will have the biggest impact.”

Rather than cut prices across the board for all residential long distance customers, MCI uses predictive models to determine which customers are most at risk of switching to a competitor based on their calling patterns, service plan, and billing amounts. MCI then targets these high-risk, high-value customers with special retention offers and incentives tailored to their needs. This targeted approach allows MCI to limit the number of promotional offers sent out while still retaining its most profitable customers.

On the business side, MCI monitors the calling volumes and service usage of its largest accounts to gauge their satisfaction and loyalty. MCI proactively contacts these customers and provides tailored solutions to address their telecommunications needs before they consider switching providers. MCI can also determine which types of businesses have the highest customer lifetime value so it can focus sales efforts on attracting more of these highly profitable clients.

MCI’s data warehousing strategy is paying dividends, allowing the company to avoid broad price cuts, limit customer churn, and strengthen ties with high-value residential and business customers. While competitors wage a price war to gain market share, MCI is leveraging business intelligence to achieve profitable growth and build lasting customer relationships. With its sophisticated data analysis capabilities, MCI is able to gain a 360-degree view of its customers and deploy targeted marketing for competitive advantage in the consumer long distance market.
