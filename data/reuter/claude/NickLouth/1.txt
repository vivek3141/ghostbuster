DirecTV Slashes Price of Entry-Level Receiver to Fend Off Cable Competitors

Satellite TV giant DirecTV announced today that it is cutting the price of its most basic receiver model in half, from $199 to just $99, in an effort to compete more aggressively with cable TV providers. The price cut comes as cable companies have been aggressively bundling TV, internet and phone service, putting pressure on satellite providers like DirecTV and Dish Network. 

“We want to make access to DirecTV as affordable as possible for customers across the country,” said DirecTV CEO Bill Morrow in a statement. “Slashing the upfront cost for our most popular receiver is the latest move to ensure we have options for every budget.”

The receiver model affected is the DirecTV Choice package, which provides access to over 155 channels including major broadcast networks as well as cable staples like TNT, TBS, USA and ESPN. While the upfront cost for the hardware is now $99, customers still need to sign up for a DirecTV programming package which starts at $50 per month for the first 12 months, going up to $85 per month after an introductory discount expires.

In contrast, major cable companies like Comcast and Charter Communications have been offering TV, internet and home phone service for as little as $30 per month when bundled together, putting significant pricing pressure on satellite TV companies that can’t offer broadband or landline phone service. As a result, satellite TV subscriptions have declined over 5% over the past year, according to research firm SNL Kagan.

DirecTV likely hopes that cutting entry-level prices in half will lure more budget-conscious customers into the fold, even if they have to pay higher monthly programming fees over the long run. The new $99 upfront cost matches Dish Network’s lowest-cost receiver option, so the move may be aimed at preventing more subscribers from defecting to its satellite TV rival.

The price cut announcement comes just weeks after DirecTV raised programming fees across all of its main packages, citing increased costs to license content from broadcast and cable networks. While the cable bundle remains a formidable competitor, aggressive promotions and now lower upfront hardware costs could help stabilize DirecTV’s customer base in the coming year. Overall, customers looking for an inexpensive live TV option may find DirecTV’s newly discounted offer appealing despite monthly costs that are often higher than cable.
