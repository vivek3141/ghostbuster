GTE Corp. Reports 9% Earnings Rise in Q3 Boosted by Strong Demand for Phone Lines

GTE Corp, one of the largest telecommunications companies in the U.S., reported third quarter earnings today that were up 9% from the same period a year ago, boosted by demand for basic phone services. Profit rose to $1.2 billion, or $2 per share, up from $1.1 billion or $1.50 per share. Revenue rose 5% to $9.2 billion. Investors cheered the results, sending GTE shares up 5% in morning trading.

The company's growth was fueled primarily by a 5% increase in demand for local phone services, which represent nearly 60% of GTE's business. Many customers are upgrading to premium digital and data services, which drove revenue from subscribers up 6% compared to last year. GTE has aggressively rolled out bundles of local and long-distance calling with additional features like voicemail and call forwarding in an effort to lock in customers and raise their monthly bills. 

Demand for GTE's wireless services was also strong, with subscribers for the quarter up 12% from last year. Citing increasing smartphone adoption and migration to unlimited data plans, GTE raised revenue guidance for its wireless division. However, long distance call volume continued its decline, dropping 8% from the previous year. In response, GTE has begun redirecting investment to growth areas like broadband internet and home automation. 

“This was an outstanding quarter for GTE. Our core telecom businesses are producing solid results and our strategic growth initiatives are gaining traction,” said CEO Jane Stevens. “By offering integrated communications solutions for homes and businesses, we are positioning GTE for sustainable long term success."

GTE reaffirmed its full-year earnings forecast and expects continued customer growth, especially among residential and small business segments. Barring any major economic disruptions, GTE appears poised to end the year on a high note with strong demand across its suite of phone, wireless, and data services fueling growth for years to come. Overall, this quarter’s results suggest GTE’s investments in technology upgrades and service bundles are paying off, cementing its status as an industry leader enabling seamless connectivity across platforms.
