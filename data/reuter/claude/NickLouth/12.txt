Regional Bells Fulfill Promise to Build More Telephone Lines and Increase Services, Reaping Strong 3Q Results 

The major regional telephone carriers in the U.S. delivered strong third-quarter financial results this week, buoyed by their investments in building out high-speed fiber networks and new service offerings. Verizon Communications, AT&T Inc., and CenturyLink Inc. all beat Wall Street's estimates for revenue and profit.

Verizon, the largest cellphone carrier in the U.S., added a net 295,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, showing that customers continue to flock to its faster 4G LTE network and unlimited data plans. The company also saw healthy demand for Fios, its fiber-optic TV and internet service. Revenue from its telecom business rose 3% from a year earlier.

AT&T gained a net 595,000 subscribers, including prepaid customers, as it launched several new unlimited plans and a bundle with HBO. The company has also been expanding its fiber network to more markets, enabling higher internet speeds and a better video experience. AT&T's third-quarter profit rose 19% from a year earlier, although revenue remained flat due to declines in its legacy landline phone and DSL internet businesses.

CenturyLink, a regional telecom company focused on rural areas and small cities, posted revenue growth for the first time in nearly two years, gaining business data and cloud services customers. The company's $34 billion purchase of Level 3 Communications earlier this year expanded its nationwide fiber network and internet backbone, allowing it to provide faster, more reliable connections to business customers. 

The investments in new technology and networks by the regional carriers are starting to pay off through higher revenue and more connected devices in consumers' and businesses' hands. While the telecom landscape is fast-changing, with cable competitors and wireless substitutes vying for customers, the baby bells are showing they can keep up by delivering the faster speeds and innovative new services their subscribers now demand. Overall, the strong third-quarter results suggest the regional telecom giants have turned the corner after years of cord-cutting and legacy service declines, moving strongly into a new era of growth.
