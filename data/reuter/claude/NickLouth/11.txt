AT&T Corp. to Name Surprise Successor as Chairman and CEO, Source Say  

AT&T Corp., one of the largest telecommunications companies in the U.S., will name a surprise successor to take over as chairman and CEO, according to a source familiar with the matter. The source said AT&T's current chairman and CEO, John Donovan, will step down from his roles and retire within the next six months. His potential successors were thought to be a roster of longtime AT&T executives, but the source said the company will instead tap an outsider to take the helm for the first time in its history.

The source declined to name the successor due to the sensitivity of the matter but said the candidate is a veteran technology executive with experience leading a telecommunications or media company. The source added that Donovan, 65, has been planning his retirement for over a year and wants to ensure a smooth transition to new leadership before stepping away from his posts. 

Donovan has served as AT&T's chairman and CEO since 2007. He led the company through a pivotal transformation, acquiring Time Warner in an $85 billion deal that helped AT&T expand beyond wireless and broadband services into entertainment and media. The 2018 acquisition was one of the largest in AT&T's history and sought to turn the company into a telecom and media conglomerate to rival the likes of Comcast.

However, the Time Warner deal also saddled AT&T with substantial debt that has worried some investors and analysts. That concern intensified last month when AT&T reported its slowest quarterly subscriber growth in more than four years during the third quarter. Though sales of the new iPhone helped boost AT&T’s profit margins, the company added just 101,000 monthly bill-paying phone subscribers—far below Wall Street’s expectations.

The upcoming leadership change suggests AT&T’s board may want an outside perspective to help address the company’s challenges and deliver a fresh vision for growth. It would also mark the end of a era at a company that has traditionally promoted executives through the ranks. Whoever takes the helm will inherit the monumental task of reducing AT&T’s $151 billion debt burden while investing in 5G wireless technology and new streaming services to compete with the likes of Netflix and Disney.

With annual revenue of nearly $170 billion, AT&T's next CEO will lead one of America's most storied companies. The successor has not yet been finalized and the timing of a formal announcement is unclear. But when the company does name its new chairman and CEO, it will likely send a signal about the strategic direction AT&T seeks to take in the years ahead.
