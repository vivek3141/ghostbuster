AT&T's New Chief Operating Officer Believes Execution is Key to Strategy Success  

AT&T named a new Chief Operating Officer this week, appointing Brian Lesser, the former CEO of GroupM North America. In his first comments since the announcement, Lesser said that executing on key strategic priorities will be essential to his role. 

"AT&T has a clear strategy and vision for the future, but strategies are meaningless without strong execution," Lesser said. "My role as COO will be to drive execution of the company's goals and ensure we deliver on the key priorities to grow our business and create value for customers and shareholders."

Lesser, 49, takes over as COO at a pivotal time for AT&T. The company is in the process of acquiring Time Warner, the owner of CNN, HBO, and Warner Bros. The $85.4 billion deal is still pending regulatory approval but is expected to close by the end of the year. Integrating Time Warner's assets and maximizing the benefits of the acquisition will likely be a top priority for Lesser.  

In addition, AT&T continues to roll out its 5G wireless network and launch its new streaming video service. The company also recently announced plans to launch a new streaming bundle called AT&T Watch TV that will compete with cable offerings. Executing on all these strategic fronts simultaneously will be a major challenge. 

Before joining GroupM in 2012, Lesser held various executive roles at Xerox, where he led sales, marketing and operations for different divisions. His diverse experience made him an appealing choice for the COO role, according to AT&T Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson.

“Brian has a proven track record of driving strong execution and business results,” Stephenson said. “He is a world-class operator who knows how to effectively lead large, complex organizations. I am confident his leadership and industry expertise will enable us to accelerate progress toward achieving our key operational and strategic priorities.”

Lesser earned an undergraduate degree from Tufts University and an MBA from Harvard Business School. He will officially start as AT&T's COO beginning June 1. With the new role, Lesser is well positioned to help AT&T achieve its strategic vision, but only if he and his team can successfully execute on the company's ambitious plans for growth. Strong execution, as Lesser noted, is the key to any strategy's success.
