AT&T Chairman and CEO to Step Down Early in Search for Successor 

Randall Stephenson, Chairman and CEO of AT&T, announced today that he will retire earlier than expected to make way for a new generation of leadership at the telecommunications giant. Stephenson, 59, has led AT&T since 2007 and was expected to remain in his role for at least another 3 years. However, in a surprise move, Stephenson said "the time is right to pass the baton to the next leader who will guide AT&T into the future."

Stephenson steered AT&T through a period of rapid change and consolidation in the telecom industry. Under his leadership, AT&T acquired DirecTV in 2015 and Time Warner in 2018, transforming the company into a media and entertainment powerhouse. The Time Warner acquisition, in particular, was Stephenson's signature deal and a risky move into uncharted territory for a telecommunications firm. The $85 billion purchase, which faced regulatory challenges, gave AT&T control of premium content from HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros. studio.

In recent years, AT&T's stock price and customer growth have lagged behind competitors like Verizon as cord-cutting and increased competition from cable companies created headwinds. Still, Stephenson expressed confidence in AT&T's trajectory and long-term strategy in a memo to employees. "We have a world-class collection of assets, nearly half a trillion dollars in revenue, industry-leading profit margins, and exciting new growth opportunities ahead. I am confident the team will continue executing our strategy and take AT&T to even greater heights."

AT&T's board of directors will now embark on a search for Stephenson's successor, reviewing both internal and external candidates. Two current division heads at AT&T are considered leading internal candidates to take over the top job. John Stankey heads the entertainment division that includes WarnerMedia properties and has been with AT&T for over 30 years. John Donovan leads AT&T Communications, the company's largest division with nearly 150 million subscribers. However, the board may opt for new leadership from outside with experience in media and entertainment.
