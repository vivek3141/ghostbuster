AT&T's Search for New CEO to Reverse Loss of Market Share and Expand into New Markets  

AT&T Inc. announced today that Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson will retire at the end of the year, triggering an internal and external search for a new CEO to lead the company's efforts to regain ground lost to competitors and push into new markets. 

Stephenson, 60, has served as CEO of AT&T for 13 years and Chairman for 12 years. He steered the company through several major acquisitions, including the purchase of WarnerMedia in 2018 and the failed attempt to buy T-Mobile USA in 2011. However, AT&T has struggled in recent years as rivals like Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile gained market share through more attractive wireless plans and mobile video offerings.

In a memo to employees, Stephenson said "the time is right" for a leadership transition and that he felt confident about the company's trajectory. "We have the assets, the footprint and the team to build on our global leadership in the years ahead," he wrote. But AT&T's board is under pressure from investors to revamp the company's strategy and reverse loss of ground to fast-growing competitors. The new CEO will need to quickly articulate a vision for how AT&T can return to growth, especially in its core wireless and pay-TV businesses.

One option would be for AT&T to double down on content and bundle attractive video offerings with its wireless and broadband services. AT&T spent $85 billion to acquire Time Warner Inc. in 2018 but has struggled to realize the benefits of marrying premium content and distribution. The new CEO could pursue more aggressive bundling of HBO, CNN and TBS with AT&T's communications products to better compete with cable rivals like Comcast.

The incoming CEO will also have to steer AT&T into promising new markets, including advertising and enterprise services. AT&T runs an advanced ad unit and controls valuable data about millions of subscribers that could fuel an advertising business. In the enterprise market, AT&T could leverage its networking infrastructure to supply businesses with 5G connectivity and IoT services. But the company has moved slowly in both areas while competitors made bigger inroads.

Internally, the new CEO may need to restructure operations and cut costs to free up funds for investments in key areas. AT&T continues to operate with an outdated siloed structure and layers of management left over from its legacy phone company days. simplifying the organization and streamlining operations could yield significant savings and a more nimble corporate culture.

The search for Stephenson's successor will consider both internal and external candidates, the company said. Two key internal candidates would be John Stankey, who runs WarnerMedia, and John Donovan, CEO of AT&T Communications. Externally, the company may look at leaders from major media, telecom or tech companies. Whoever gets the job will face significant challenges but also opportunities as AT&T seeks to start its next chapter. Overall, shareholders will be watching closely to see if new leadership can reignite AT&T's growth and competitiveness.
