WorldCom Acquires MFS Communications in $14 Billion Stock Swap

Telecommunications giant WorldCom announced today that it has agreed to acquire MFS Communications Company in an all-stock transaction valued at $14.4 billion. The deal will strengthen WorldCom's position as a major provider of Internet and data services to business customers, adding MFS Communications' network of more than 20,000 miles of fiber optic lines across 31 states. 

Under the terms of the agreement, WorldCom will exchange 0.925 shares of WorldCom common stock for each MFS Communications share. This represents a 35% premium over MFS Communications' closing stock price yesterday. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2000, subject to regulatory approvals and a vote by MFS Communications shareholders.

"This strategic acquisition will enable us to expand our high-capacity global network and enhance our ability to deliver integrated Internet, data and voice solutions to business customers of all sizes," said Bernard J. Ebbers, chairman and CEO of WorldCom. "By combining our networks, we will have over 3.5 million miles of fiber optic cables—the largest network infrastructure in the industry."

MFS Communications operates a nationwide fiber optic network focused primarily on mid-sized cities in the Eastern and Midwestern United States. More than 70% of MFS Communications' network passes within a half mile of the central business districts in these cities. MFS Communications provides Internet connectivity, data, voice and video transport services to over 4,800 business customers. 

“We are excited to join forces with WorldCom, an industry leader that shares our vision of providing advanced communication services to businesses,” said James Q. Crowe, chairman and CEO of MFS Communications. “This combination will accelerate our strategy of reaching more customers with a wider range of solutions.”

Following completion of the deal, MFS Communications will become a wholly owned subsidiary of WorldCom. James Q. Crowe will continue to lead the MFS Communications division, reporting directly to Bernard Ebbers. WorldCom expects to achieve substantial cost synergies from the merger, with annual cost savings estimated at $2.5 billion within three years. WorldCom said it will provide additional details on the financial impact of the deal on its first quarter earnings call next month.

The acquisition is the latest in a wave of mergers reshaping the competitive landscape of the telecommunications industry. Earlier this year, AT&T announced plans to acquire cable operator TCI, and SBC Communications completed its merger with Ameritech. If approved, the WorldCom-MFS Communications deal would be the largest telecommunications acquisition since SBC-Ameritech and reflect the increasing importance of network scale and scope in the Internet age.
