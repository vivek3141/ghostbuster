AT&T Chairman Robert Allen Likely to Step Down Early in Search for Successor

Robert Allen, the longtime chairman and chief executive of AT&T Corp., is expected to step down from his posts earlier than anticipated, according to people close to the company. Mr. Allen, 65, has led AT&T for 12 years as the company navigated the breakup of the Bell System, the rise of wireless communication, and the deregulation of the telecommunications industry. 

Mr. Allen had previously said he intended to remain AT&T's chairman through the end of 2002, but now plans to step down as early as the end of this year or early in 2000. The accelerated timetable is aimed at allowing AT&T's board of directors adequate time to find a successor from inside or outside the company, the sources said. Mr. Allen would remain on AT&T's board even after a new chairman is selected.

The news comes as AT&T faces increasing competition from rivals like MCI WorldCom Inc. and Sprint Corp. in its core long-distance business. AT&T's stock price has stagnated over the last year, though the company remains highly profitable. Mr. Allen has focused in recent years on wireless ventures and push into data and Internet services to counter weakening demand for regular residential phone service.

Potential internal candidates to succeed Mr. Allen include C. Michael Armstrong, the head of AT&T's wireless business, and Hossein Eslambolchi, chief technology officer and head of Internet services. However, the board may opt to bring in an outside leader to take the helm of the massive communications company as it charts a new strategic course. Executives from major technology, media, and telecom companies could be contenders for the AT&T chairmanship, sources said.

AT&T plans to keep the roles of chairman and chief executive separate, so Mr. Allen will be replaced in both positions. He will continue to provide guidance as a director on the board, where he has been a member since 1990. The timing of the leadership transition will depend on the board's ability to review internal and external candidates and reach a consensus on the best choice for leading AT&T into the new century, sources said. An official announcement on Mr. Allen's retirement plans and the process for finding a new leader is expected within the next several weeks.
