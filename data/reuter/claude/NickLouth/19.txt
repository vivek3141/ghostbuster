AT&T Corp Delays CEO Transition for Newly Appointed President John Walter to Learn About Business

AT&T Corp announced today that it is delaying the transition of CEO responsibilities to recently appointed President John Walter. The company had previously announced that current Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson would be stepping down from his role at the end of this year and transitioning responsibilities to Walter. However, AT&T's board of directors voted unanimously to delay the transition to provide Walter more time to learn about the company's key business units and strategic priorities. 

Walter, 58, was named President and COO of AT&T just six months ago, joining the company from a long career at Verizon Communications. While Walter has over 30 years of experience in the telecommunications industry, he is still new to AT&T's portfolio of businesses which include wireless operations, broadband internet service, and the WarnerMedia entertainment division. The delay will give Walter an opportunity to work closely with Stephenson and the rest of the senior leadership team over the next year before formally taking over as CEO.

In a statement, Stephenson said "John Walter is an exceptional leader and I have the upmost confidence in him as my successor. However, the scope and scale of AT&T's business is massive. After John came on board, it quickly became apparent that more time was needed to ensure an effective and seamless transition of leadership responsibilities." Walter added, "AT&T is an iconic company and I appreciate the board's guidance on preparing fully for the CEO role. This year will be invaluable for me to learn, listen, and ensure AT&T's long-term success."

The announcement comes at a crucial time for AT&T which is facing competitive and regulatory pressures across many of its key businesses. Its wireless unit is competing in a saturated US market and is pushing customers into new "5G" networks. The WarnerMedia entertainment arm is adjusting to growth in streaming media and direct-to-consumer channels. And the company's broadband internet service faces potential new rules on net neutrality and privacy from the Federal Communications Commission. With CEO transitions at major companies closely watched, the board clearly wants to ensure Walter and the rest of the leadership team have the opportunity to hit the ground running once he is formally named CEO next year. Investors, customers, employees, and regulators will be watching closely to see how AT&T navigates important strategic decisions over the coming months under this extended transition.
