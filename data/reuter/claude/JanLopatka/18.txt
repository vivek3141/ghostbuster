Czech President Criticizes Opposition Leader for Accusing Secret Service of Political Bias

Prague, Czech Republic—The President of the Czech Republic Miloš Zeman criticized the leader of the opposition Civic Democratic Party Petr Fiala today for accusing the country's security agency of political bias. Fiala had stated that the Czech Security Information Service (BIS) was acting with a political agenda to favor the ruling government coalition led by Prime Minister Andrej Babiš. 

In a speech to supporters, Zeman said Fiala's claims were "unproven and irresponsible" and aimed to undermine public trust in Czech institutions. Zeman argued that as the commander-in-chief of security forces, he had seen no evidence the BIS was acting in anything other than a professional and non-partisan manner. He warned opposition leaders not to attack institutions of power without cause.

The dispute centers around a recent BIS report warning of growing political and economic influence by Russian and Chinese agents in the Czech Republic. Fiala alleged the report was exaggerated and published to deflect attention from the Prime Minister's own legal troubles. Babiš is currently under investigation by Czech and EU authorities over potential conflicts of interest related to his business holdings while in public office.

Babiš also pushed back against Fiala, stating the opposition seeks to weaken the country's democratic institutions for its own political gain. He called on Fiala to provide concrete evidence to substantiate his claims of BIS overreach or else retract his statements. The BIS declined to comment on the matter, noting its work is non-partisan and focused only on fulfilling its mandate to counter threats to national security.

The war of words highlights growing political divisions in the Czech Republic. Zeman was re-elected last year but continues to face criticism over his populist views and perceived closeness to Russia and China. Fiala aims to unseat the government in 2021 parliamentary elections, but his party trails in the polls due in part to the country's economic success under Babiš's administration. With tensions escalating, the coming electoral campaign is shaping up to be a raucous clash over the direction and leadership of the country.
