Czech Prime Minister accuses opposition leader of lying and losing his nerve in increasingly bitter election campaign  

Prague, Czech Republic: The campaign for next month’s general election in the Czech Republic is heating up, with increasingly bitter exchanges between the two leading candidates. 

Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, the leader of the centrist ANO party, today accused opposition leader Ivan Bartoš of the Pirate Party of “constant lying” and losing his nerve under pressure. In a radio interview, Babiš said Bartoš was “making up attacks” against him and spreading misinformation among voters.

The war of words comes amid several recent gaffes by Bartoš, who had been gaining ground on Babiš in opinion polls. Bartoš falsely claimed that Babiš still formally controls an investment fund he placed in a trust before becoming prime minister. Bartoš also had to apologize after spreading a false claim on Twitter that Babiš had been disinvited from a meeting of European leaders.

Babiš said these stumbles showed that Bartoš was “unfit to lead the country.” However, Babiš himself continues to face criticism over conflicts of interest between his political role and his vast business empire. A subsidiary of his Agrofert conglomerate is one of the country’s biggest recipients of agricultural subsidies, while Babiš maintains control of two large newspapers.

The latest polls show Babiš’s ANO maintaining a lead of around 5 percentage points over the Pirate Party and its allies. Both sides need coalition partners to form a government. Babiš has slim hopes of teaming up again with the far-right Freedom and Direct Democracy party, but more likely options include the center-right Civic Democrats or the Social Democrats.

The first round of voting will be held on 8-9 October. A second round of voting between the two top candidates will take place two weeks later if no party wins a majority in the first round. All signs point to a close race where the outcome may ultimately depend on which candidate can persuade more voters that their opponent is unfit to lead.
