Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus Predicts Perpetual, Smaller Trade Gap Despite Temporary Investment Wave 

Prague, Czech Republic â€” In a speech to parliament today, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus predicted that the Czech Republic's trade deficit will stabilize at a lower level in coming years, despite a temporary increase in the deficit this year driven by higher investment.

Klaus said the Czech trade deficit will widen to about $3.5 billion this year, up from $2.7 billion last year, as increased foreign direct investment boosts imports of machinery and equipment. However, the prime minister forecast the deficit will then narrow to between $2 billion to $2.5 billion annually over the next several years.

"The trade balance will not be significantly improved in the short term due to increased investment, but it will stabilize in the medium and long term at a lower level," Klaus told lawmakers. He said net exports should make a positive contribution to economic growth in the Czech Republic as investment eases and domestic consumption remains moderate.

Klaus has made reducing the country's trade deficit a key economic priority. The Czech Republic has run a trade deficit every year since 1994, as strong domestic demand for foreign goods and weak competitiveness of Czech exports have outweighed the benefits of increased trade with the European Union, of which the Czech Republic is a member. The perpetually high trade deficit has been a drag on economic growth.

The prime minister argued the government's policies supporting research and development, education and infrastructure investment, along with a stable business environment and low taxes, will boost the competitiveness of Czech companies and enable them to capture a greater share of export markets in coming years. He said the government will also work to attract foreign investment in export-oriented sectors. 

"With the expected gradual diversification of the Czech economy toward more technologically-advanced and export-oriented sectors, the trade balance should gradually improve in the coming years without the need to limit domestic demand," Klaus said.

The speech comes as the Czech economy is showing signs of accelerating growth, driven in part by high levels of foreign direct investment. The economy expanded at an annual rate of nearly 3% in the first quarter, and the government expects full-year growth of between 3% to 4% this year. Analysts say solid economic growth should help narrow the Czech trade deficit over the medium term.
