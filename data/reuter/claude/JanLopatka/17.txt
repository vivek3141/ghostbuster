Czech National Bank Governor Advocates a Slow Approach to the Privatisation of Komercni Banka Shares

The Governor of the Czech National Bank, Jiri Rusnok, has advocated for a gradual and conservative approach to privatizing the government's stake in Komercni Banka, the country's third largest bank. Speaking at a conference in Prague, Rusnok said "We must proceed cautiously and gradually reduce the state's shareholding in Komercni Banka over time through transparent share offerings to private investors."
 
The Czech government currently owns 68% of Komercni Banka's shares, a legacy of the transition from communism in the early 1990s. The government has long intended to fully privatize the bank but has moved slowly due to concerns over reducing its control and influence over the banking sector. Komercni Banka is an important lender to small and medium-sized Czech businesses and any rapid privatization could disrupt its operations.

Rusnok argued for the government to pare back its ownership stake to a blocking minority of around 34% over the next several years. This would still allow it to prevent any unwanted changes at the bank while bringing in private capital and management expertise. The government could then further reduce its ownership in the years ahead based on market conditions and the bank's performance in private hands.

The approach advocated by Rusnok contrasts with earlier proposals to sell the government's entire 68% stake through an initial public offering on the Prague Stock Exchange. That option is seen as riskier by Rusnok and could involve "distress privatization" where the government gives up control of a large stake before properly preparing the company for private ownership. A more gradual process would achieve a better price for taxpayers and be less disruptive.  

The timing for reducing the state's influence at Komercni Banka and other large Czech companies remains controversial. While some see it as an important step towards boosting economic efficiency, others argue more needs to be done to strengthen the country's regulatory institutions first. Rusnok's speech appears aimed at addressing such concerns by showing privatization can proceed at a considered pace that balances all interests. The next Czech parliamentary elections are not until 2021, giving sufficient time to make progress at Komercni Banka in line with Rusnok's recommended approach.
