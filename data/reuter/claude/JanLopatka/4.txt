Czech National Bank Governor Vows to Keep Crown Strong Despite Calls to Devalue for Exports 

The governor of the Czech National Bank, Jiří Rusnok, said today that the central bank has no plans to weaken the Czech koruna to boost the country's export sector, despite calls from some businesses and economists to devalue the currency.

In a speech in Prague, Rusnok said the bank will continue to intervene in currency markets to maintain the koruna at around 27 to the euro. The central bank has spent billions of euros in recent years buying korunas to prevent the currency from strengthening against the euro and other major currencies.

Rusnok argued that devaluing the koruna would only lead to higher inflation, offsetting any gains for exporters. "While a weaker koruna may support exporters in the short run, it is not a sustainable long-term strategy and does not solve underlying competitiveness issues," he said.

The Czech economy has been one of the best performing in Europe over the past several years, with growth steady at over 2 percent. The country has a strong manufacturing base, especially in the automotive sector, and exports goods and services worth around 80 percent of GDP. Some analysts argue the economy would benefit from a cheaper currency to boost export demand.

However, Rusnok countered that the solution for businesses facing a stronger koruna is to improve productivity and move into more value-added production, rather than rely on a weaker currency. "Currency intervention cannot substitute the need for economic reforms and improved competitiveness," he said. 

The central bank's currency interventions have not been without controversy. Rusnok's predecessor, Miroslav Singer, was an advocate of a free floating koruna. The current policy risks distorting currency markets and raises concerns about wasted resources, as the central bank's foreign exchange reserves have surged.

However, there is little appetite in the Czech government or central bank to abandon the policy and allow the koruna to strengthen rapidly. While Rusnok signaled interventions may be gradually reduced as needed to keep inflation low, he emphasized the central bank's commitment to exchange rate stability and vowed to keep the koruna at its current levels for the foreseeable future. Overall, Rusnok's comments suggest little will change in the Czech National Bank's longstanding policy of restraining koruna strength to support the economy.
