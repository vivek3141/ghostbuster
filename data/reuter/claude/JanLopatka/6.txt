Infighting threatens Czech opposition party's chances in upcoming elections 

The center-left Czech Social Democratic Party is once again engulfed in internal divisions ahead of elections later this year, threatening its chances to unseat the ruling ANO party. The Social Democrats have struggled to find their footing after suffering a historic defeat in the 2017 elections that relegated them to the opposition for the first time since the early 1990s. 
 
The latest infighting erupted over the leadership of the party, with several members questioning current chairman Jan Hamáček's ability to turn the party's fortunes around. Hamáček took over as chairman in 2018, tasked with reviving the party after its disastrous showing in the 2017 elections when it won just 7% of the vote. But the Social Democrats have remained stuck in the polls, hovering between 5 to 8% support.
 
Last week, the turmoil intensified when former Foreign Minister Lubomír Zaorálek gave an interview suggesting the Social Democrats need a "fundamental personnel reboot". The comments were seen as a direct attack on Hamáček's leadership. In response, Hamáček accused Zaorálek of political "games" and undermining the party at a crucial time. The public spats threaten to further erode the Social Democrats' credibility in voters' eyes. 
 
The infighting comes at a perilous moment, with the Czech Republic holding Senate and regional elections in October that will test the parties' strength ahead of the general election next year. The Social Democrats are currently running third in polls behind Prime Minister Andrej Babiš's ANO party and the main opposition right-wing Civic Democrats. Some analysts warn the Social Democrats risk falling into political irrelevance if they fail to resonate with voters in the upcoming votes.
