Czech National Bank Governor Says No Hurry to Sell State's Stake in Komercni Banka, and Proposes Selling to Multiple Investors

The governor of the Czech National Bank, Jiri Rusnok, said today that the state is in no hurry to sell its stake in Komercni Banka, the largest Czech bank. The government currently controls nearly 70% of Komercni Banka, but there have been discussions about fully or partially privatizing the bank by selling the state's shares to private investors.

However, Rusnok argues there is no need to rush into such a sale. "There is no urgent need to privatize Komercni Banka at any cost," he said in an interview. "The state should take its time to find the right model and good price."

Rusnok proposes that rather than sell the entire stake to one buyer, it may be better to sell portions of shares to multiple strategic investors over time. This approach could increase competition and bring more dynamism to the Czech banking sector. A gradual sell-off to many investors could also help the state maximize the price it gets for the shares, he said.   

The center-left government has debated privatizing Komercni Banka, but there is no consensus yet on how or when to proceed with a sale. The government's term ends in 2021, so any final decision may depend on the results of elections this fall and the makeup of the next administration.

Some analysts argue that fully privatizing Komercni Banka could undermine financial stability in the Czech Republic. With nearly $50 billion in assets, it is an immensely influential player in the banking system. But proponents of privatization say it would make the bank more competitive and efficient.

Komercni Banka shares have increased 75% in the last five years, a sign of strong interest from investors. Its profits and lending have also grown steadily. Revenue rose 6% last year to $2.2 billion while profit climbed 12% to $630 million.

Rusnok concluded that "it is a strategic and complex decision" that should not be rushed. The government's goal, he said, should be "to get the best possible deal while maintaining financial stability." With prudent management, Komercni Banka can remain successful whether fully state-owned or partially privatized, Rusnok argued. But a measured, gradual approach is most prudent.
