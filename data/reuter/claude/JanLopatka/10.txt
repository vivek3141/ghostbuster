Komercni Banka a.s. Sees 10% Dip in Profits Due to Accounting Changes, Shares Rise on Analyst Praise  

Komercni Banka a.s., one of the largest banks in the Czech Republic, reported a 10% decline in net income for the first quarter of 2019 due to new accounting standards. However, shares rose more than 3% on the news as analysts praised the underlying performance of the bank.

The Prague-based bank said net income fell to 7.5 billion koruna ($330 million) from 8.3 billion koruna a year earlier. The drop was due solely to new accounting rules that require banks to estimate potential future losses on loans and set aside cash reserves. Excluding these charges, Komercni Banka's net income rose 6% from a year earlier, driven by higher interest rates and loan growth.

"The solid operating performance and core earnings growth in the first quarter demonstrate the fundamental strength of Komercni Banka,” said Jakub Lichnovsky, an analyst at Wood & Co. “The provisions required under the new IFRS 9 accounting standards masked what was actually a very good start to the year." The International Financial Reporting Standard No. 9 or IFRS 9 aims to provide more transparency on potential credit risks on banks’ balance sheets.

Analysts had expected the change in accounting rules to hurt Komercni Banka's profits, so the results matched their forecasts. The bank's shares were up 3.2% at 792 koruna in late morning trading in Prague, buoyed by the upbeat commentary about underlying performance.

Like other Czech banks, Komercni Banka has benefited from steady economic growth, low unemployment, and higher interest rates. The Czech central bank has raised rates five times since August 2017 to curb inflation and support the currency. The benchmark two-week repo rate now stands at 2.25%.

Net interest income, the difference between what the bank earns on loans and pays on deposits, rose 5.3% in the first quarter from a year earlier, driven by the higher rates. The net interest margin, a key measure of profitability, widened to 2.67% from 2.55% a year ago.
