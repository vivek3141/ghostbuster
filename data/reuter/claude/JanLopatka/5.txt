Czech National Bank unveils conditions for government scheme to buy smaller banks' doubtful debts 

The Czech National Bank (CNB) today announced the conditions under which it will allow smaller Czech banks to sell their non-performing loans to a government debt relief scheme. The CNB said banks that want to participate must meet certain capital and risk management criteria to ensure the stability of the financial system.

Under the plan announced last month, the Czech government will set up a special fund to buy up to CZK5 billion ($210 million) of bad debts from banks with assets under CZK100 billion. The CNB will determine which banks are eligible to participate based on their financial health and ability to deal with their bad loan books.

The CNB said participating banks must have a capital adequacy ratio, a measure of balance sheet strength, of at least 11.5% of risk-weighted assets at the time they sell the bad debts. They must also have prudent loan loss provisioning, internal risk management procedures, and be able to demonstrate previous experience resolving non-performing loan books. 

The CNB expects roughly 20-30 small Czech banks may qualify to participate in the scheme based on the requirements. The central bank will start accepting applications from interested banks immediately and run an open process to select participants on a first-come, first-serve basis until the CZK5 billion allocation is fulfilled.

"This program will provide targeted support to viable small banks facing difficulties from their bad loan portfolios," said CNB Governor Jiri Rusnok. "By relieving them of some doubtful debts, it will strengthen their balance sheets and ability to continue lending to support the real economy."

The initiative is part of broader efforts to bolster the Czech banking sector against economic troubles caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. While Czech banks remain well capitalized overall, small lenders with high amounts of bad loans on their books are particularly vulnerable to asset quality deterioration and losses. The government aims for the debt relief scheme to be in place before a moratorium on loan repayments expires at the end of October.
