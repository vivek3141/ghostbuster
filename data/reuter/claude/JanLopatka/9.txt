Komercni Banka Posts Lower Nine-Month Results Due to Accounting Changes, Shares Rise on Prague Stock Exchange  

Komercni Banka, the third-largest Czech lender, reported lower nine-month net profit attributable to shareholders due to changes in IFRS accounting standards. The figures are subject to an audit. 

Komercni Banka's net profit decreased by 15.9% year-on-year to CZK 11.8 billion in January-September of 2021. Operating profit decreased by only 0.6% as lower creation of provisions and recoveries compensated for a fall in other operating income. Net interest income grew by 2.3% and fees by 10.3% driven by lending, trade finance, and payment services. 

Net profit was also negatively impacted by compensation for overcharged interchange fees from merchants and consumers of CZK 1 billion. In 2020, the bank received a compensation from Visa and Mastercard of CZK 0.7 billion, which explained the sharp decline in reported income.

The bank revised its 2021 financial results to reflect changes in accounting standards related to fees charged to merchants and customers using payment cards, as well as costs related to long-term employee benefits. Due to these revisions, 2020 net profit was reduced by CZK 1.45 billion to CZK 14.05 billion.

New accounting rules also contributed to a 9.2% increase in total assets to CZK 1.267 trillion as of end-September 2021. In addition to the accounting factor, assets were up thanks to loan growth and higher amounts due from banks and central banks. The bank holds retained earnings, which could be used to neutralize negative effects of accounting changes in the upcoming periods. 

Shares of Komercni Banka rose by 0.8% on Wednesday, outperforming the sector in Prague. The higher shares reflected expectations that the one-off effects are temporary and the bank will return to higher profitability in the coming quarters. The decrease was already factored in by investors and the outlook remains positive given increasing economic activity in the Czech Republic. Loan growth and normalization of risk costs should support future net income.
