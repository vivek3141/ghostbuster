Czech Consumer Prices Rise Less Than Expected, But Government's Full-Year Target Uncertain 

Consumer prices in the Czech Republic rose less than expected in April, data from the Czech Statistics Office showed today. However, it remains uncertain if the government will meet its inflation target for the full year.

The Czech consumer price index rose 0.4% year-on-year in April, slowing from 0.7% in March. Economists had expected a 0.5% increase. The slower inflation was mainly driven by lower prices for clothing and footwear as the new spring collections entered shops. Prices of alcoholic beverages and tobacco also declined from a year earlier.   

On a monthly basis, consumer prices fell 0.2% in April. Economists had expected prices to remain flat. The monthly drop was due to lower prices for clothing, transport, and housing. 

The Czech National Bank (CNB) targets 2% inflation but said it would tolerate overshooting or undershooting that level. The CNB forecasts average inflation of 2.3% this year. However, the lower-than-expected April reading brings that full-year outlook into question.

"The cooler development in the consumer basket, especially the prices of industrial goods, indicates the target inflation of 2.3% for the year 2017 should be difficult to meet," said Radomir Jac, chief economist at Generali Investments CEE. He said inflation pressures are not strong enough and sees inflation ending this year at around 2%.

The lower inflation may take some pressure off the CNB to raise interest rates. The bank held its key policy rate at a record low 0.05% in April, and a hike is not expected soon. Governor Jiri Rusnok said the bank board still saw risks of higher inflation over the longer term but wanted to see firmer evidence of rising price pressures.

Some economists said the weak April inflation data suggest those risks have diminished. "April's CPI data clearly show that there is no major demand-pull inflation in the economy," said UniCredit Bank chief economist Zdenek Tuma. "Base effects and lower oil prices helped significantly."

Overall, while the lower-than-expected inflation in April provides some relief, the full-year outlook remains uncertain and depends on volatile items like oil prices and the impact of new indirect taxes. The central bank is likely to keep rates on hold in the coming months but may tighten policy going into next year if it sees inflation sustaining at around its target.
