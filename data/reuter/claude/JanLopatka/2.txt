Czech National Bank Governor Commits to Keeping Crown Strong Despite Calls for Depreciation to Boost Exports  

The governor of the Czech National Bank, Jiri Rusnok, today reiterated his commitment to maintaining a stable and strong Czech koruna despite increasing calls for currency depreciation to boost Czech exports. In a speech before the Confederation of Czech Industry, Rusnok stressed that exchange rate stability and low inflation are the bank's mandates under Czech law. "While a weaker currency could temporarily increase demand for Czech goods, it poses too much risk to price stability and hurts consumers' purchasing power," Rusnok said. 

Exporters have been clamoring for the central bank to weaken the koruna to gain a competitive advantage, especially with demand in key export markets like Germany slowing. But Rusnok argued that relying on a weaker currency is not a sustainable economic strategy and will not address underlying issues impacting Czech industry's competitiveness. "What our exporters need is higher investments in innovation, automation, and skilled workers to move up the value chain, not a quick fix from a weaker koruna," he said.

The Czech koruna is the strongest it has been against the euro since the Czech Republic joined the European Union in 2004. It has strengthened by over 30% in the past five years thanks to the Czech economy's rapid growth, strong fiscal position, and higher interest rates relative to the Eurozone. While the strong koruna has dampened export growth and contributed to tepid wage gains, it has also helped keep inflation low and made imports cheaper for consumers. 

Rusnok said the central bank will maintain its inflation target of 2% and stands ready to adjust monetary policy as needed to achieve that target. He warned, however, that relying solely on weakening the koruna to spur growth is "not a sustainable policy" and that structural economic reforms are still needed. The governor's comments suggest businesses and government officials calling for koruna depreciation may be disappointed unless the economic fundamentals or inflation outlook shift significantly. For now, the Czech National Bank remains focused on exchange rate stability and price stability above other concerns. Overall, Rusnok's speech is a signal of the central bank's determination to keep the Czech Republic's economy on a steady and stable path despite facing pressures to weaken its currency.
