Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus Announces 11.8% Overall Spending Increase in 1997 State Budget  

Prague, Czech Republic - Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus announced today that the 1997 state budget passed by the Czech parliament earlier this month will increase overall government spending by 11.8% over 1996 levels. The budget is the first since the Czech Republic gained independence from Slovakia at the start of this year. 

The spending increase is aimed at boosting public sector wages, funding increased health care costs, and financing ongoing infrastructure projects. The budget projects a deficit of 50 billion koruna, or about 2% of GDP, which Klaus said strikes a balance between fostering economic growth and maintaining fiscal discipline. The budget expects GDP growth of 4.5% next year, down from 5.9% growth in 1996.

"This budget helps set the direction for our country and economy as the Czech Republic charts its course as an independent nation," Klaus said in a televised address. "It invests in our citizens, in improving living standards, in building for the future, but does so in a prudent manner that will not saddle future generations with excessive debt."

The budget includes a 15% increase in public sector wages and a 13% increase in funds for health care. It also provides increased funds for transportation, telecommunications, and energy infrastructure, as the government aims to narrow the gap between Czech and Western European infrastructure. Funds were also allocated to continue restructuring and privatizing outstanding state-owned enterprises.

While the opposition Social Democrats argued the budget deficit should be lower, Klaus said a slightly looser fiscal stance is justified to boost living standards, stimulate economic growth, and fund key priorities during the early years of Czech independence. However, he pledged the government would work to gradually narrow deficits over the next few years to bring debt levels below GDP growth.

The budget is a pivotal statement of the direction Klaus and his center-right coalition want to lead the newly formed Czech Republic. By boosting social spending while maintaining solid economic growth and a path to fiscal balance, the government aims to set the country on a path towards western integration while avoiding economic shocks, all while establishing the Czech Republic's place as the most prosperous and stable nation to emerge from the former Czechoslovakia. Overall, the budget seeks to reinforce the optimistic hopes and aspirations of the Czech people after gaining their hard-fought independence.
