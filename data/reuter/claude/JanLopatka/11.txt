Czech Prime Minister and Economics Professor Klaus Predicts Small but Perpetual Trade Gap  

Prague, Czech Republic — In a speech to business leaders today, Czech Prime Minister Václav Klaus said that a small, permanent trade deficit is inevitable for the Czech economy. Klaus, who is also an economics professor, argued that Czech citizens' appetites for a wide variety of imported goods that are not produced domestically mean the country's imports will always outpace its exports by a modest amount. 

"We have a vibrant, export-oriented economy, but we also have citizens with sophisticated tastes who desire the best goods and services from around the world," Klaus said. "While we aim to boost domestic production and exports, we must recognize that there will always be certain imports that help enhance the lives of Czechs in ways that locally made goods cannot."

Klaus forecasted that the Czech Republic's trade deficit would settle in at 1 to 2 percent of gross domestic product indefinitely, as long as the economy remains open and competitive. By comparison, the trade deficit was 5 percent of GDP a decade ago. He characterized this level of trade imbalance as "optimal and realistic" given the advanced, globally integrated nature of the Czech economy today.

"An open economy means openness to both imports and exports," Klaus said. "Instead of fruitlessly trying to achieve some elusive perfect trade balance, we should embrace the free flow of goods and capital across our borders, while also striving to expand exports in key sectors where we can compete internationally."

The speech is the latest indication that Klaus, a staunch free-market advocate, will maintain the Czech Republic's openness to global trade and investment as the central plank of economic policy. Klaus, who holds a PhD in Economics, has long argued that restricting flows of goods, services or capital across borders only distorts economies and slows growth over the long run.

While the trade deficit has been a controversial political issue in the Czech Republic, Klaus said short-term fluctuations should not be a cause for concern, as long as the size of the deficit remains stable relative to GDP growth over time. He noted that many advanced economies, including the United States, have sustained modest trade deficits for prolonged periods while still enjoying economic expansion and job growth.  

The Czech economy has performed strongly in recent years, with GDP and export growth outpacing European averages. Klaus credited the country's openness to global trade and continued transition to a market economy as key drivers of this economic success. With political debate in the country shifting toward nationalist policies, Klaus used today's speech to reinforce his view that global integration, not isolation, is the path to shared prosperity.
