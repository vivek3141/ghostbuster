Czech government faces tough decision on diversifying gas supplies away from Russia  

The Czech government is grappling with how to reduce the country's dependence on Russian natural gas, a long-time geopolitical vulnerability of Czech foreign policy. Russia currently supplies over 96% of the natural gas consumed in the Czech Republic through pipelines that transit Ukraine and eastern Europe. 

With deteriorating relations between Russia and western nations in recent years, Czech leaders aim to diversify gas suppliers to ensure greater energy security and independence. However, achieving supply diversification is proving challenging given limited alternatives for acquiring natural gas at an affordable price.

The government's stated goal is to reduce Russian gas imports to under 50% of total consumption by 2025. But experts question whether this target is achievable based on current alternatives and time constraints. Neighboring countries face similar challenges in diversifying from Russian gas, making regional cooperation on new supply routes attractive yet complicated.

The Czech government continues to explore several options for new gas supplies, including accessing Poland's new Baltic Pipe pipeline, expanding capacity of gas interconnectors with Germany and Slovakia, and negotiating LNG contracts from global suppliers. However, expanding pipeline capacity and building LNG terminals requires massive investments that would raise energy prices for Czech households and businesses.  

Poland's Baltic Pipe Project presents an opportunity for the Czech Republic to tap into Norwegian gas supplies by 2022. But Baltic Pipe would still only provide about 30% of Czech annual gas demand, and at a higher cost than Russian gas. The Czech government recently approved 50 million euros to support interconnectors linking to the Baltic Pipe, signaling the importance of this option.

The Czech government also commissioned a feasibility study on building a new LNG terminal, possibly on the country's border with Slovakia or Austria. LNG imports from the U.S., Qatar or other suppliers could significantly diversify the country's gas mix. However, the cost of building LNG terminals and infrastructure is very high, and would require long-term LNG contracts to justify the investment. The economics are challenging given relatively low natural gas prices globally.
