BSkyB considers further investment in Germany, reports rise in profits and subscriber numbers

British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC (BSkyB) reported strong results for the first half of its fiscal year, driven by increased subscriber numbers and revenue in the UK and Ireland. The company also announced it is considering further investments in Germany to grow its satellite pay-TV business across Europe. 

BSkyB added 50,000 net new subscribers in the UK and Ireland in the first six months of the fiscal year, bringing its total subscriber base to 11.1 million. Revenue increased 5% to £3.7 billion, while operating profit rose 7% to £724 million. The company’s flagship Sky service now reaches nearly two-thirds of households in the UK and Ireland.

The company has recently focused on investing in exclusive content and technology innovations to attract new subscribers. This strategy appears to be paying off, with customers continuing to sign up for BSkyB’s premium sports, movies, and entertainment packages despite broader economic uncertainties.

BSkyB also confirmed it is analyzing potential acquisitions in Germany to complement its existing investment in Sky Deutschland, the country’s leading pay-TV provider. BSkyB currently owns a 59% controlling stake in Sky Deutschland, which has grown steadily since its launch in 1991 and now has more than 4 million subscribers.

“We made a good start to the year, growing sales, profits and customers across our businesses,” said Jeremy Darroch, Group Chief Executive of BSkyB. “In a tough consumer environment, our strategy of investing in content, innovation and service is proving resilient. We continue to explore ways to expand our European pay TV business, building on our success in the UK and
