ITC Invites Applications for Terrestrial Frequencies to Increase Number of Channels  Available to U.K. Viewers in Digital Age

The Independent Television Commission (ITC) today invited television broadcasters to apply for new terrestrial frequencies that will allow for the expansion of digital channels available to viewers in the United Kingdom. The move comes ahead of the mandatory switchover from analog to digital television signals by the end of 2012.

The ITC has opened a bidding process for broadcasters to apply for licenses to operate on spectrum in the 600 MHz and 800 MHz range. These airwaves were previously used by analog television channels but will be freed up as the analog signal is switched off over the next two years. The newly available spectrum could enable Freeview, the free digital terrestrial service, to add up to 60 new channels. 

Digital switchover is part of a long-planned initiative to move television in the U.K. to more efficient digital signals from outdated analog technology. By turning off the analog signal, the government will recover highly sought-after airwaves for new mobile broadband and other digital services. Nearly all households in the U.K. have access to digital TV through either digital cable, satellite, or Freeview.

“This is an exciting opportunity for broadcasters to reach new audiences with diverse and innovative content,” said ITC Chairman Derek Myers. “The expansion of the Freeview platform will offer more choice to the tens of millions of Britons who rely on digital terrestrial television.”

Broadcasters have until October 31 to submit their applications, which will then be evaluated by the ITC based on the applicant's commercial viability and programming plans. New channels are expected to launch beginning in 2013 on both Freeview and paid digital TV services like BT Vision, TalkTalk TV, and Virgin Media. The proliferation of new channels in 2013 and beyond will mark the realization of the long-promised benefits of digital television for the average U.K. viewer. With many more channels and on-demand options at their fingertips in the digital age, the era of a limited analog lineup will fade into history.
