Channel 4 CEO Urges Government to Reject Privatisation Plans

The CEO of Channel 4 has urged the government not to go ahead with controversial plans to privatise the broadcaster. In front of a Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee today, Alex Mahon called on the government to let Channel 4 continue operating as a publicly-owned public service broadcaster. "The Channel 4 model works perfectly well and there is no evidence it is broken," she said. 

Mahon spoke passionately about Channel 4's remit to deliver diverse and innovative programming that appeals to underserved audiences. She highlighted the broadcaster's commitment to diverse, edgy content that holds power to account. Recent examples include the investigations into Cambridge Analytica's misuse of Facebook data and an undercover investigation into the horse racing industry.

Mahon argued that privatisation could jeopardize Channel 4's ability to invest in riskier, more hard-hitting public service content. In pursuing viewers and advertising in a commercial market, a privatised Channel 4 may have to focus on more mainstream, commercially-driven content rather than programs aimed at minority groups. The CEO said Channel 4's remit was fundamentally about "serving unmet needs" which depended on continued public funding and ownership.

A number of prominent production companies have also voiced opposition to government plans to sell off Channel 4. They argue the current model gives invaluable opportunities to independent producers to have their programs commissioned and the freedom to take creative risks. The government previously said privatisation would allow Channel 4 to access private capital and compete with streaming giants like Netflix in the digital age.

However, Mahon countered that Channel 4 is performing strongly and adapting well to changes in viewing habits. Despite a challenging advertising market, Channel 4 remains in good financial health. She pointed out that privatisation may in fact cut the broadcaster off from public funding and restrict its remit to focus on underserved audiences. "We do not believe privatisation is necessary for Channel 4 to thrive," Mahon concluded.

The government is expected to consult on plans to privatise Channel 4 later this year. However, following Mahon's evidence today, there are growing calls for ministers to reconsider this approach and avoid dismantling a broadcasting model that is admired around the world.
