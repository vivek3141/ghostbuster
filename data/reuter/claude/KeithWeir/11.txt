BBC Director-General Calls for Increase in Television Licence Fee

The Director-General of the BBC, Tony Hall, has called for an increase in the television licence fee to help fund the BBC's portfolio of UK-focused services. In a speech at the National Press Club today, Lord Hall argued that the BBC's current funding levels are unsustainable if it is to maintain the quality and breadth of its programs and services. 

The television license fee is an annual charge of £154.50 ($205) that funds the BBC's operations. It is required of anyone who watches or records live television in the UK. Lord Hall proposed increasing the fee by inflation each year from 2020, which amounts to about 2% per year. This increase would generate an additional £300 million ($395 million) in funding for the BBC by 2027.

Lord Hall highlighted several reasons why a licence fee increase is necessary. First, the BBC's costs have been rising due to inflation while government funding has been frozen. The BBC has had to find savings of £800 million ($1.05 billion) over the past seven years as a result. Second, the BBC has taken on new costs to reinvent itself for the digital age and expand its online services. For example, the BBC recently launched its renewed iPlayer on-demand service and several digital-first productions on BBC Three. 

Third, UK law requires the BBC to increase spending on programs that highlight British arts and culture. The BBC must spend £500 million ($660 million) more on British-made productions over the next seven years. Finally, the BBC needs additional funds to continue to compete against the deep pockets of global streaming giants like Netflix, Amazon and Disney, especially for premium factual programs and dramas. 

However, a licence fee increase remains controversial and unpopular with many British households. Critics argue the BBC should reduce spending on salaries for executives and stars instead of charging more to licence fee payers. The issue is also tied up in broader debates about how to fund public media and whether the TV licence fee model remains effective or fair in today's media landscape. The British government would need to approve any changes to the licence fee, and it has yet to signal strong support for Lord Hall's proposal.
