BT and MCI Communications in $22 billion telecoms group deal

British Telecommunications (BT) has agreed to buy MCI Communications of the US for $21.8 billion in cash and stock. The deal combines the UK's dominant fixed-line operator with one of the largest carriers in the American long-distance market.

The deal highlights the increasing convergence of telecoms, computing, and media into a single digital industry. By combining BT's strength in networking technologies and traditional phone services with MCI's expertise in data and internet transmission, the new company expects to become a global leader in communications and compete more effectively against rivals such as AT&T and Vodafone.

BT will pay $9.6 billion in cash and the remainder in new BT shares for MCI.  The combined company, to be called BT MCI, will have its headquarters in London and a significant presence in the US. BT expects the deal to produce cost savings of at least $2 billion a year within three years. The deal is subject to approval by shareholders and regulators, but is expected to be finalized in three to four months.

Sir Iain Vallance, Chairman of BT, said: "This strategic merger secures BT's position as a world leader in the fast-growing data and internet market. It creates an exceptionally strong combination with a common vision to expand our customers' access to global communication networks."

Bert Roberts Jr., Chairman and CEO of MCI, said: "Joining with BT allows us to accelerate growth in data services with a premier global partner. This merger provides superior benefits to customers, shareholders and employees of both companies."

However, some analysts warn that mergers on this scale always carry risks and it could take many years for the full benefits of integration to show through. BT's shares fell on news of the deal amid concerns over the costs of expansion into the US market. There are also fears of a clash of corporate cultures between BT and MCI, the aggressive US upstart that forced open the US long-distance market. Regulators may also impose conditions to ensure that the new group does not dominate its market.

The deal continues a wave of megamergers in the telecoms industry as former state-run monopolies adapt to increasing competition. The new BT MCI group will have a market value of $75 billion, putting it among the top 30 companies in the world by value. BT forecasts that over a third of its turnover will come from outside the UK following the merger, compared with only a quarter today.
