United News & Media Acquires Blenheim, Creating World's Largest Trade Exhibition Group  

United News & Media (UNM), a leading international trade exhibitions and conference organizer, announced today its acquisition of Blenheim Group, a major exhibitions company focused on the automotive, transport, and manufacturing industries. The all-cash deal is valued at $3.4 billion and will create the world's largest trade exhibition group with over 500 events across 43 countries around the globe.  

The combination of UNM and Blenheim creates significant scale, allowing the new group to offer customers and partners a wider range of events, content, and marketing solutions across geographies and industry sectors. The merger brings together two highly complementary businesses with minimal overlap in events or customers. UNM has a strong presence in healthcare, technology, retail, and consumer goods, while Blenheim is a leader in the automotive, aerospace, and industrial sectors.

"This is a transformative deal for our company and a major milestone for the exhibitions industry," said John Micklethwait, Chief Executive of UNM. "Together, UNM and Blenheim will create an unparalleled platform for customers to connect, learn, and do business. We are excited to start working with the Blenheim team to drive further innovation, bring new events and services to market, and accelerate growth around the world."

Blenheim CEO Margaret Heffernan commented: "UNM is the ideal strategic partner for Blenheim as we embark on the next stage of our growth. Their entrepreneurial spirit, global scale, and digital capabilities will strengthen our offering and open up new opportunities for our customers and employees. We look forward to combining Blenheim's events and expertise in transport, automotive and manufacturing with UNM's market-leading platforms."

The deal is subject to regulatory approvals but is expected to close in the second quarter of this year. UNM has secured $4.5 billion in debt financing from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs to fund the acquisition. Following completion, Margaret Heffernan will join the UNM board as an executive director.
