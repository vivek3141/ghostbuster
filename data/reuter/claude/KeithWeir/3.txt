Manchester United share price soars over 10% on renewed bid speculation 

Shares in Manchester United surged over 10% today amid renewed speculation that the Glazer family, who own the majority stake in the club, are considering selling the Premier League giants. Reports surfaced this morning that private equity firms Apollo and BC Partners have entered preliminary discussions with the Glazers over a potential takeover bid for Manchester United. 

Manchester United is one of the most valuable sports franchises in the world, with recent estimates valuing the club at over $4.6 billion. The Glazer family took control of Manchester United in 2005 in a controversial leveraged buyout that saddled the club with huge amounts of debt. While the debt has been reduced in recent years, many fans have continued to protest the Glazers’ ownership and called for new investment in the team.

The news of potential new bids from Apollo and BC Partners was greeted with enthusiasm by Manchester United fans and investors alike. On the Manchester stock exchange, shares in the football club closed up over 10% at $18.42, the highest level since August 2018.  Investors appear to see significant upside potential in the valuation of Manchester United with new owners and fresh capital.

However, sources close to the club warned that the discussions with Apollo and BC Partners were preliminary and there was no certainty of a takeover deal being agreed. The Glazer family would demand a sizeable premium to sell control of such a prestige asset, meaning any successful bid would likely need to far surpass the club’s current market capitalization of $3.2 billion. The family recently took its Manchester United holding company public, making a sale of their shares even more complicated.

Football finance experts noted that more club takeovers are likely in the coming years, as private equity firms look to capitalize on the global popularity and growth potential of top Premier League clubs. Following its recent $5.2 billion takeover of Chelsea FC, Apollo appears eager to expand its sports portfolio, though a successful bid for Manchester United would dwarf its Chelsea acquisition and set a new record in sports franchise deals. All eyes will be on the continued discussions to gauge if an offer is tabled that finally prompts the Glazer family to sell its controversial stake in Manchester United.
