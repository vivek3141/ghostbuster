BT in talks for $22 billion takeover of MCI Communications Corp, marking a spectacular end to Sir Peter Bonfield's first year as CEO 

British Telecommunications PLC is in advanced talks to acquire MCI Communications Corp for $22 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal, if completed, would mark the largest acquisition in BT's history and a major win for CEO Sir Peter Bonfield, who took over the role just 12 months ago.

MCI, based in Washington, D.C., is the second-largest long-distance carrier in the U.S. behind AT&T Corp. The company has a market value of about $19 billion but a takeover premium would likely push the final price to around $22 billion, the sources said. BT has long harbored ambitions to expand its presence in the U.S. telecommunications market and buying MCI would achieve that in one bold stroke. 

For Sir Peter, pulling off such a sizable deal so early in his tenure would be a major coup and victory. When he was appointed CEO last year, Sir Peter vowed to make BT a more globally focused company that could compete on the world stage. Acquiring MCI, with its large U.S. customer base and network infrastructure, would dramatically accelerate that strategic goal.

However, significant challenges remain in getting a deal done. BT will have to convince MCI shareholders and potentially regulators that it can successfully integrate an acquisition of this scale, especially given its limited experience in the U.S. market. Financing such a large deal may also prove difficult if debt markets are not receptive. BT's stock fell 5% on news of the talks over concerns about the price.

People close to the negotiations said there is no guarantee a final deal will be reached, given the complexities involved. But if Sir Peter is able to successfully navigate the obstacles and seal an agreement, it would rank as one of the most ambitious deals in the telecom industry in recent years. For BT, it could transform the company into a global telecommunications powerhouse and usher in a new era of expansion outside the UK.

The move is a sign of intensifying competition in the telecommunications sector, which has seen increasing cross-border consolidation as companies seek to expand their reach globally. If consummated, a BT-MCI deal would be one of the first major forays by a European carrier into the U.S. market, pitting it against American telecom heavyweights on their home turf. 

Representatives for BT and MCI declined to comment. BT's shares closed down 3% in London trading. MCI's stock ended the day up 7% on the Nasdaq.
