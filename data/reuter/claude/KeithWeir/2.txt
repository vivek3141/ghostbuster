United News & Media rumored to be considering bid for Blenheim exhibitions group 

United News & Media, one of the world’s largest media conglomerates, is reportedly interested in acquiring Blenheim Exhibitions, a UK-based trade show and conference organizer. According to sources familiar with the matter, United News & Media has been evaluating a potential bid for Blenheim for several months and could make a formal offer in the coming weeks.

Blenheim Exhibitions owns and operates over 20 trade shows and conferences in industries such as technology, healthcare, and renewable energy. Their events draw hundreds of thousands of attendees each year from around the globe. Acquiring Blenheim would allow United News & Media to significantly expand their live events portfolio and tap into a new audience of business professionals and industry leaders.  

While neither United News & Media or Blenheim Exhibitions would comment on the rumors of a potential deal, industry analysts said that Blenheim would be a good strategic fit for United News & Media. “United News & Media has been looking for ways to diversify beyond their traditional media properties. Live events are a high-growth area and Blenheim is a leader in the space, so this would make a lot of sense as an acquisition target,” said Brian Marks, a media analyst at Darlington Research.

However, others questioned whether United News & Media would be willing to pay the high price likely required to acquire Blenheim. United News & Media’s share price has dropped nearly 30% over the past year as traditional media revenue sources have declined. “United News & Media may struggle to raise the capital needed for such a large deal, especially given the turmoil in their core business,” said Lucy Chen, a director at Manchester Partners, a mergers and acquisitions advisory firm. 

If a deal were to proceed, it would likely value Blenheim Exhibitions at between £800 million to £1 billion, according to estimates from analysts. United News & Media would use a combination of cash, loans, and possibly stock to finance the acquisition. The fate of Blenheim’s management team and employees under new ownership also remains unclear. However, with United News & Media under pressure to diversify and find new areas of growth, the opportunity to purchase one of the UK’s top exhibition organizers may prove too appealing to pass up.
