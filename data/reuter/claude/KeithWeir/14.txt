Pearson Plc to Streamline Media Empire, Potentially Selling off Madame Tussaud's and Lazard Brothers Stake  

Pearson Plc, the British media conglomerate, announced plans today to restructure its sprawling collection of assets in an effort to focus on its core education business. As part of the streamlining, Pearson said it may sell its stake in the iconic wax museum Madame Tussaud's as well as its 50% holding in the investment bank Lazard Brothers.

Pearson's Chief Executive John Fallon said the moves are designed to make Pearson a "simpler, more efficient and more integrated" company that can leverage its competitive advantage in digital education. The planned divestments of non-core businesses could generate proceeds of over $500 million that Pearson can reinvest in its education division.

"Pearson's education business has the strongest potential for growth as we transform from a traditional print publisher to a digital and services company," Mr. Fallon said. Madame Tussaud's and Lazard Brothers represent legacy assets from an earlier era that are no longer strategic priorities. 

Pearson first acquired its stake in Madame Tussaud's in 1973 but has struggled in recent years to boost visitor numbers at the wax museum's locations around the world. Pearson's holding in Lazard Brothers also dates back to the 1970s but equates to only a minority interest in the investment bank, limiting Pearson's ability to gain value from the stake.

The restructuring announcement comes as Pearson grapples with pressures facing much of the traditional publishing industry. Sales of Pearson's U.S. higher education course materials have declined as more students opt for digital options. At the same time, Pearson faces competition from low-cost rivals and a thriving market for used textbooks. However, Pearson's digital and virtual offerings are gaining traction. The company reported 4% growth in 2018 revenue from its online course enrollments and assessments.

Pearson expects the restructuring to take 12 to 18 months, subject to negotiations with potential buyers and regulatory reviews. The company will provide updates on divestment processes for Madame Tussaud's and Lazard Brothers during its half-year results in August. Any proceeds from the sales will be used to strengthen Pearson's balance sheet as well as invest further in educational technology infrastructure and skills training for the company's workforce.

"This is an important moment of renewed focus for Pearson," Mr. Fallon said. "We have a unique opportunity to shape the future of education for lifelong learners all around the world." The streamlining of operations and reallocation of resources will help Pearson pursue that mission in a sustainable fashion for years to come.
