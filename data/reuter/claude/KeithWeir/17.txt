Terrestrial television go digital: UK watchdog seeks applicants for new channels 

The UK broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, has opened up applications for new digital terrestrial television (DTT) channels to expand the Freeview platform. Ofcom is seeking applicants to operate new national and local TV channels on the DTT platform to increase the variety of content available to Freeview viewers.

Freeview currently offers over 70 free-to-air TV channels covering news, sports, entertainment, kids, education and more. However, broadcasting technology improvements now allow for additional capacity on the DTT platform. Ofcom aims to utilize this spare capacity to offer more choice for Freeview households.

Ofcom is offering capacity for up to 10 new national TV channels and over 20 additional local TV channels. The new national channels will be available to all Freeview viewers while the local channels will focus on news, events and stories in specific areas around the UK. Licenses will be offered for up to 12 years to provide stability for the new channel operators. 

The closing date for applications is March 2019. Ofcom will then evaluate the applications against several criteria, including the proposed content of the channel, experience of the applicants, and technical capability to launch the channel. New channels are expected to launch from 2020 onwards.

Consumer group Mediawatch welcomed the move by Ofcom to expand Freeview, saying, “Giving viewers more choice on the channels they can watch for free is excellent news. The Freeview platform already offers a diverse range of content but more options, especially local TV for communities, can help keep free-to-air relevant in an era of low-cost streaming services.”  

However, public broadcaster BBC voiced concerns on how additional channels may impact the wider TV ecosystem. A BBC spokesperson said, "New channels could impact the overall economics of commercial public service broadcasting in the UK which is already under pressure. Ofcom will need to evaluate applicants carefully to maximize public value.”

Ofcom stated that new channels would still need to meet strict content standards and licensing conditions. Applicants have until 27 March 2019 to submit their proposals to Ofcom. Licenses are expected to be awarded by spring 2020 with the first new channels launching on Freeview shortly after. Freeview viewers will need to retune their boxes to pick up the additional channels once they become available.
