United News & Media Acquires Blenheim to Form World's Largest Trade Exhibition Group 

United News & Media (UNM), a leading international media and events company, announced today that it has acquired Blenheim Group, the UK's largest privately-owned trade exhibition organiser, for £1.2 billion. The deal will combine UNM's strength in large consumer expos with Blenheim's focus on leading b2b events. The combined company will become the world's largest trade exhibition group with more than 5 million attendees each year at over 500 exhibitions and conferences across 30 countries.

UNM and Blenheim have had a successful partnership since 2017, co-organizing trade shows in industries like technology, medical, and manufacturing. The full acquisition of Blenheim will allow UNM to expand into new verticals and geographies more quickly. UNM has seen strong growth in large consumer-facing shows in Europe and Asia, but wanted deeper exposure to b2b events in those regions. Blenheim has strong positions in several key trades across Europe, while also expanding in high-growth markets like India, China, and Brazil.  

"This acquisition is a transformative step in our strategy to become the leading global exhibition group," said John Watson, UNM's CEO. "The combination of UNM and Blenheim is driven by compelling strategic and financial logic. Blenheim adds industry-leading positions, talented management, and geographic reach that will benefit all our customers and help accelerate growth."

The deal is expected to generate £50-£80 million in cost synergies within 3 years through operational efficiencies and cross-company collaboration. Despite the acquisition, UNM stated that both companies would continue to operate independently and there were no plans for major changes to staffing or organizational structures. The deal still needs to be approved by regulators, but is expected to close within 6-8 months. If approved, the combined company would have pro forma revenue of £7 billion and EBITDA of £1.2 billion.
