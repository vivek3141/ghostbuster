Premier Farnell Shares Dip After Posting Slightly Below Expected Half-Year Profits  

Shares in Premier Farnell declined 3% in early trading today after the distributor of electronics components reported pre-tax profits that fell slightly short of analyst expectations for the first half of the year.  

Premier Farnell said pre-tax profits rose 5% to £36.4 million in the six months to July 29th compared to the same period last year. However, analysts had forecast pre-tax profits of £37.2 million for the period. Revenue at the company was up 9% to £398.7 million, aided by recent acquisitions and growth in North America and Asia.  

"We delivered a solid first-half performance with good top-line growth and margin expansion in challenging macroeconomic conditions," said Premier Farnell CEO Mark Fielding. "Our design and eCommerce initiatives are gaining traction, and we continue to generate strong cash returns."

The company said it gained market share in its core markets during the period and now has over 490,000 registered customers, up 11% from a year earlier. It shipped over 1.1 million packages in the first half of the year, a 13% increase from the same period last year.  

However, investors were wary that profit margins dipped slightly to 9.1% from 9.3% a year earlier. The company also remains vulnerable to cost inflation and any slowdown in technology markets. Brexit uncertainty continues to be a concern for Premier Farnell, with the possibility of slowing economic growth and weakened customer demand in the UK and Europe.    

RBC Capital Markets analyst Simon Long said: "Premier Farnell delivered a solid set of first-half results with good growth across all regions. Although slightly below expectations at the earnings level, progress remains broadly on track. At this stage, we make no major changes to forecasts and continue to view the longer-term recovery and self-help story as intact."

Premier Farnell shares are down 5% over the past year, valuing the company at £1.1 billion. The company operates in 23 countries and sells more than 500,000 products from 2,500 suppliers to over 1 million customers. It is a leader in the UK and Europe but has been seeking to expand in North America and Asia to boost future growth.
