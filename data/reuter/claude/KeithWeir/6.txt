United News & Media Acquires Blenheim, Creating World's Largest Trade Exhibition Group

United News & Media (UNM), a leading global trade exhibition and conference organizer, announced today the acquisition of Blenheim, a major trade show organizer serving multiple industries across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The all-cash deal valued at $3.2 billion creates the world's largest trade exhibition group with more than 500 events across 25 countries and 40 industry sectors. 

"This acquisition brings together two highly complementary businesses and marks a major milestone towards our vision to become the leading platform for facilitating trade and connections between buyers and sellers globally," said John Smith, CEO of UNM. "Blenheim has a portfolio of market-leading brands and a track record of strong organic growth. By combining Blenheim's events and expertise with our global footprint and digital capabilities, we will be able to unlock significant value through synergies and better serve our growing customer base worldwide."

Blenheim, a private company owned by a consortium of private equity firms, has more than 20,000 exhibitors and attracts over 2.5 million attendees annually. Key events include Automechanika, the world's leading automotive trade fair, DesTech, the largest design and technology show in Asia, and Medica, the premier medical trade fair. Blenheim is expected to contribute over $1.2 billion in annual revenue and $350 million in EBITDA.

"We are excited to join forces with UNM, a highly respected company committed to connecting businesses across the world through market-leading events," said William Jones, CEO of Blenheim. "Leveraging UNM's capabilities and scale will allow us to accelerate our strategy and open new opportunities to better serve our customers. Our teams are looking forward to working together."

The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter pending regulatory approvals. UNM's financial advisors were Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, while Blenheim's advisors were Morgan Stanley and Lazard.

This agreement illustrates the ongoing consolidation in the trade show industry as large players look to gain scale and geographic reach. The combined entity will likely have more leverage and pricing power with both exhibitors and attendees over the long run. Competitors will also face a more formidable rival that has tools to fend off disruption from digital alternatives. For UNM and Blenheim customers, the merger promises to provide more extensive platforms for them to connect and do business. Overall, this blockbuster deal signals increasing confidence in the trade show model.
