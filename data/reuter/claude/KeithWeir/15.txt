Stakis Plc and Prince al-Waleed bin Talal to Purchase Metropole and Princess Hotel Chains from Lonrho Plc for over $1 Billion

London-based hotels and gambling conglomerate Stakis Plc, in partnership with Saudi billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, announced today that they have reached an agreement to purchase the Metropole and Princess hotel chains from Lonrho Plc for $1.05 billion in cash. The deal is expected to close within 90 days, pending regulatory approval.  

The Metropole and Princess brands operate nearly 200 hotels across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, with over 45,000 rooms. The chains are a strong strategic fit with Stakis’s existing hotel properties and will help expand the company’s reach, especially in emerging markets in the Middle East and Africa. 

“We are delighted to partner with HRH Prince al-Waleed to acquire these prestigious hotel brands which we have long admired,” said Sir Thomas Swan, Chief Executive of Stakis Plc. “Together with the management teams of Metropole and Princess, we look forward to investing further in the properties and enhancing the experience for all guests.”

Prince al-Waleed, who is Chairman of Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding Company, hailed the deal as an opportunity to expand the reach of his luxury hospitality interests. “Our partnership with Stakis to acquire Metropole and Princess hotels will be transformational, enabling us to become a truly global luxury hotel operator,” he said in a statement. “We plan to leverage our experience with premium hotel brands to elevate these properties to new heights of luxury and excellence.”

The acquisition is the latest move in an ongoing consolidation of the hotel industry. Large hospitality companies have been actively acquiring smaller brands to gain economies of scale, reduce costs, and expand into new markets. For Lonrho, the sale of Metropole and Princess is part of a strategic shift to exit the hotels business and focus on its core mining and agriculture operations in Africa. The $1.05 billion in proceeds from the sale will be used to pay down debt and invest in new opportunities aligned with Lonrho’s revised strategy.

The deal is expected to close on October 15, assuming customary regulatory approvals are obtained. Stakis and Prince al-Waleed plan to retain existing employees and management at Metropole and Princess hotels. Rebranding selected properties under Stakis and Kingdom luxury hotel brands will begin in 2020.
