Marjorie Scardino Vows Radical Change at Pearson as Incoming CEO

Newly appointed Pearson CEO Marjorie Scardino promised sweeping changes at the London-based publishing and education company as she takes the helm in January. Scardino, the first female CEO of a FTSE 100 company, pledged to steer Pearson into the digital age and expand its education and business information divisions. 

“Pearson has a storied history, but it needs to adapt to the massive changes transforming the publishing industry,” Scardino said at a press conference announcing her appointment. “My goal is to reshape Pearson into a truly digital-first organization that provides essential learning and professional education services globally.”

Scardino, 60, was CEO of the Economist Group for 15 years before joining Pearson. She gained a reputation as a disruptor who diversified the Economist's revenue streams, launched new digital products, and expanded its global reach. At Pearson, Scardino replaces John Fallon, who led the company for the past decade. Fallon struggled to transition Pearson from print to digital, as the industry faced steep declines in book sales and advertising revenue.

Scardino outlined three priorities in her new role. The first is accelerating Pearson's shift to digital delivery of its products and services. The company will invest heavily in its online higher education courses and tutoring sites, as well as the digital evolution of its K-12 school curricula and testing platforms. Pearson will also expand its professional certification and corporate training programs for online delivery.

Her second priority is to strengthen Pearson's position in the education market through strategic acquisitions and by developing new partnerships with schools, colleges, and commercial organizations worldwide. The goal is for Pearson to become a "lifelong learning" partner for individuals at every stage of their education and career.

Thirdly, Scardino aims to enhance Pearson's data and analytics capabilities to gain a deeper understanding of learners' needs and preferences. By leveraging data and metrics, Pearson can deliver more personalized learning experiences, better target its marketing efforts, and measure the impact of its education services.

Pearson executives and analysts greeted Scardino's appointment and strategy with optimism. Her experience leading digital transformations and developing new online products seems ideally suited for the challenges Pearson faces. However, Pearson's stock price has dropped nearly 25% this year due to disappointing revenue from its North American K-12 assessment and college textbook businesses. Scardino will have to act quickly to revive growth in these flagging divisions and realize the full potential of Pearson's move into virtual schools, training programs, and data-enabled education.

With Scardino in charge, Pearson appears poised for radical change. Whether or not that change will restore the company to growth and stability remains to be seen. Scardino's ambitious vision is set to unfold when she officially becomes CEO at the start of 2021. The coming months will reveal whether she can successfully transform a century-old publisher into a 21st century lifelong learning enterprise.
