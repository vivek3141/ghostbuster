Mother of Chinese Dissident Wang Dan Vows to Defend Son Against Capital Charge of Overthrowing Government  

Beijing, China - Yu Changgeng, the 80-year-old mother of prominent Chinese dissident Wang Dan, has vowed to defend her son against charges of subversion of state power, a capital offense in China. Wang Dan was arrested on August 7 and formally charged last week for allegedly conspiring to overthrow the Chinese government. 

Wang Dan, 50, came to prominence as one of the leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. He was imprisoned for several years before going into exile in the United States, where he earned a PhD in history from Harvard University. According to friends and supporters, Wang returned to China last year to conduct historical research and visit his ailing mother.

In a statement released by Wang's lawyer, Yu said the charges against her son were “preposterous and baseless.”  She said Wang “has always advocated for peaceful political reform and constitutional democracy” and believes he is being targeted for his outspoken pro-democracy views and historical scholarship. Yu pledged to advocate for her son's release “through legal and lawful means.”

The Chinese government has accused Wang of conspiring with “foreign anti-China forces” to stir unrest and destabilize the country. A statement from the Ministry of Public Security said Wang had assembled a group that was “spreading propaganda, vilifying China's socialist system, and deceiving and manipulating public opinion” in order to eventually overthrow the Communist Party leadership. 

Human rights groups say the charges against Wang appear to be politically motivated and a violation of his basic rights to free speech and expression. “China has a long history of trumping up subversion charges to silence peaceful dissent and criticism,” said Sophie Richardson, China director for Human Rights Watch.
