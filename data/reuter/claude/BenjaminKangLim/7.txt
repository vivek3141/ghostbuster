China's Second Richest Man, Mou Qizhong, Hounded by Creditors and Investigated for Irregularities

Mou Qizhong, the billionaire founder and chairman of Shenzhen-based Lei Sheng Industrial Holdings Co., is facing mounting pressures on multiple fronts. Creditors are seeking to recover hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid debts and Chinese authorities are investigating Mou and Lei Sheng for financial irregularities. Lei Sheng shares plunged over 20% yesterday on news of the probes, wiping out billions from Mou's net worth and pushing him down in rankings of China's richest business people.

Mou built Lei Sheng over three decades into a sprawling manufacturing conglomerate with interests in real estate, healthcare, retail, and finance. Lei Sheng employs over 200,000 people and reported over $200 billion in revenue last year, making it one of China's largest private companies. Mou's 70% stake in Lei Sheng has made him enormously wealthy, landing him at number two on Forbes' China Rich List last year with a net worth of $58 billion.   

However, Mou and Lei Sheng's financial troubles have been intensifying recently due to an unsustainable buildup of debt. Lei Sheng has accumulated over $150 billion in debt to fund its global expansion spree, much of it short-term loans and shadow banking products. The economic slowdown in China and US-China trade war has weakened Lei Sheng's profits and cash flows, making it increasingly difficult to service the massive debt pile.   

Creditors moved to seize Lei Sheng assets after the company defaulted on a number of short-term loans and wealth management products in recent months. Local courts have frozen more than $30 billion of Lei Sheng bank accounts, stock holdings, and real estate. Mou himself had to put up shares in Lei Sheng worth $2 billion as collateral for personal loans. The defaults and freezing of assets shook investor confidence in Lei Sheng and caused its stock price to plummet.  
 

Regulators are also scrutinizing Lei Sheng over violations of financial regulations. The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission is investigating Lei Sheng for illegal fundraising through its online finance platform that took in $50 billion in deposits from small investors. The China Securities Regulatory Commission is examining Mou and Lei Sheng executives for failing to properly disclose related-party transactions and pledge of company shares. There are now concerns about the accuracy and transparency of Lei Sheng's financial statements and disclosures.

 Mou, 67, started his career as a high school teacher before becoming a successful entrepreneur in the 1980s shipping industry. He founded Lei Sheng in 1992 to manufacture machine parts but soon diversified into new industries. Mou is known for his ambition to build a Chinese company that could rival global giants like Samsung, Toyota or Nestle. However, Mou's aggressive expansion of Lei Sheng through heavy borrowing and risky financial investments now threatens to undermine everything he has built over the past three decades. The troubles at Lei Sheng are a cautionary tale for other big Chinese companies loading up on debt to fuel growth.  
The future remains uncertain for Mou and Lei Sheng as they grapple with their creditors and regulators. Mou still holds majority control, but his reputation and net worth have taken a beating. For Lei Sheng, massive restructuring and asset sales may be required to stay afloat and regain market confidence. The company's meteoric rise and current woes reflect the fragile underpinnings of China's economic boom in the era of "too big to fail" companies and excessive financial leverage.
