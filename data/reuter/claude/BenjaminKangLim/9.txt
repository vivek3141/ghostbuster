China's Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping's Son-In-Law Resigns After Failed Promotion Bid

Beijing, China - He Peiguang, the influential son-in-law of China's former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, has resigned from his government positions after failing to secure a key promotion. The 62-year-old He, who is married to Deng's daughter, had been seeking to be elevated to the Communist Party's powerful politburo. However, party leaders passed him over for the promotion, signaling his political ambitions have stalled. 

He has served as the party secretary of Chongqing, a major city in central China, for the past five years. He had hoped his family ties and relatively youthful image would position him for higher office. His resignation and the politburo snub are signs that connections to the country's revolutionary era no longer carry as much political weight in China's communist system. "The days of relying on revolutionary bloodlines and pedigree alone to advance one's career are gone," said Chen Daoyin, a political scientist in Shanghai.

He's failed promotion bid also reflects the declining power of political patronage and the "princeling" class in China. Princelings are the sons and daughters of prominent Communist officials, who were able to leverage family connections to gain influential positions. But under China's current leader Xi Jinping, the value of those connections has waned. Xi has sought to make the Communist Party bureaucracy more meritocratic, focused on promoting officials based on performance rather than background.  

He's departure abruptly concludes what had appeared to be a promising political career. He became Chongqing's party chief in 2015 at just 57 years of age. Before that, he had served as party secretary of Qingdao, a major port city in Shandong province. His marriage to Deng's daughter Ling Ling had long fueled speculation he would eventually rise to the party's top leadership ranks. But his age and mixed record of achievements in Chongqing ultimately worked against him.

He's resignation is the latest sign of the party turning away from political dynasties and the revolutionary-era aristocracy. The party increasingly values younger, better-educated technocrats who have delivered concrete results. While family history may still provide opportunities, merit and skill now appear more significant for ascending to the highest ranks of China's government. For He Peiguang, that new reality proved the end of his political ambitions, at least for now. But at just 62, He may still have a chance at redemption and reclaim a key role on the national political stage.
