Prominent dissident Wang Dan faces trial in China on charge of plotting to overthrow government

Wang Dan, one of China's most prominent pro-democracy dissidents who played a key role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, went on trial today in Beijing on charges of plotting to overthrow the Chinese government. Wang, 47, was arrested in July and accused of working with organizations banned in China to promote political reforms. If convicted, Wang could face up to 15 years in prison.

Wang's trial is the latest in a series of crackdowns by the Chinese government on dissent and criticism. Despite economic reforms and increasing openness to the outside world, the Communist Party leadership remains deeply wary of any challenges to its control. Wang and other activists have continued to push for democratic reforms and campaigned for more political freedoms, though their voices are muffled in China's state-controlled media.

The one-day trial was held at the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court. Diplomats and journalists were barred from attending. The court said a verdict would be announced at a later date. Wang's lawyer said his client pleaded not guilty to the charges, arguing that he had only exercised his right to free speech which is guaranteed by China's constitution. But under Xi Jinping, China's top leader, the government has taken an increasingly hard line against dissent and clamped down on activists, human rights lawyers, and NGOs.

Wang first gained prominence as a student leader during the 1989 pro-democracy protests centered on Tiananmen Square. After the protests were crushed in a bloody military crackdown, Wang was No. 1 on the government's most-wanted list but evaded arrest by going into hiding for over a year. He served four years in prison before going into exile in the United States, where he earned a doctorate in history from Harvard University.

Wang returned to China in 2007 but was arrested again in 2008 for commemorating the anniversary of the Tiananmen protests. After being released in 2011, Wang continued to write essays advocating democratic reforms in China. He founded an independent think tank promoting political and legal changes but authorities shut it down last year, accusing it of threatening national security. 

Some analysts say targeting Wang is aimed at intimidating other activists and stifling the democracy movement in China. "They want to make an example of someone like Wang Dan to scare others into silence and submission," said Li Xiaobing, a China expert at Western Illinois University. But Wang's sister said the dissident community would not be cowed. "The pro-democracy activists have persisted through all these years of persecution," she said. "Wang Dan and others will continue to fight for freedom and democracy in China, no matter what happens."
