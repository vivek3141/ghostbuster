Father Protests Innocence of Chinese Dissident Son Ahead of Trial  

Beijing, China - Zhang Wei, 73, stood alone outside the Beijing Municipal courts this morning holding a handmade sign that read "My son is innocent." His son, Zhang Peng, 38, is scheduled to go on trial tomorrow for "inciting subversion of state power," a charge often leveled against political dissidents and activists in China.

Zhang Peng was arrested six months ago after publishing an online essay criticizing the Chinese Communist Party for widespread corruption and human rights abuses. According to his father, more than a dozen police officers came to their home in the middle of the night and took Zhang Peng away without any explanation. He has been in detention ever since.

"My son just wants to make China a better place, he wants our people to live freely and have a say in who governs them," said the elder Zhang in an interview.  "He has always spoken his mind, which I know worries the authorities, but he means no harm. He loves our country."

Zhang Peng's trial is expected to be a mere formality, with a guilty verdict all but assured. According to human rights groups, Chinese courts have a conviction rate of over 99% for cases the government chooses to prosecute. Zhang Wei said his son's lawyer warned him that the best they can hope for is a prison sentence of a few years. "They are making an example of him to silence others," Zhang Wei said. "This will encourage only more dissent, as the truth can never be silenced."

The case highlights the growing dissent against the authoritarian policies of President Xi Jinping, who has tightened controls on civil society since coming to power in 2012. All forms of political opposition are banned, censorship has been ramped up, and human rights activists and lawyers have been particular targets of oppression. Zhang Peng published his critical essay in a moment of hope, when censorship briefly loosened after Xi lifted term limits on his presidency, signaling his ambition to rule indefinitely. 

That brief window has long closed. As his father protests his innocence alone, Zhang Peng is expected to become the latest victim of China's crackdown on any form of political opposition or dissent as Xi moves to consolidate his power. While the elder Zhang calls for freedom, the Chinese government appears determined to exert only more control. Tomorrow's trial will show just how much dissent and criticism President Xi will tolerate.
