China Slams Taiwan for Failing to Crack Down on New Independence Party 

Beijing issued a harsh condemnation of Taiwan today for allowing a new political party advocating Taiwanese independence to officially register. The Taiwan Nation Party was founded last month by a coalition of pro-independence activists to push for formal independence from China.

In a statement, China's Taiwan Affairs Office said Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party "should stand up against and contain the pro-independence forces on the island instead of conniving and supporting them." The statement accused the DPP of undermining cross-strait relations and threatening regional stability by permitting the registration of the Taiwan Nation Party.

Tensions between China and Taiwan have been rising since Tsai Ing-wen and the DPP took power in 2016. The DPP has traditionally supported Taiwanese independence, while China considers Taiwan a province that will eventually be reunified with the mainland. China has cut off official communication with Taiwan and ramped up military exercises and aircraft patrols around the island to pressure Tsai.

The Taiwan Nation Party has called for holding a referendum on declaring formal independence from China. Party leaders argue that Taiwan, which officially calls itself the Republic of China, needs to establish a distinctly Taiwanese national identity separate from China. The party platform endorses removing references to China in Taiwan's constitution and symbols.

In response, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said that Taiwan is a democracy that respects freedom of speech and political participation. “We do not accept Beijing's attempts to intervene in or influence Taiwan's internal affairs or democratic processes,” the council said in a statement. The council called on China to respect Taiwan's democratic values and way of life.

The DPP also spoke out against Beijing's statement, saying that it would defend Taiwan's sovereignty and democratic system. However, the DPP has treaded carefully to avoid directly endorsing the Taiwan Nation Party, as it could further inflame tensions with China during a sensitive time. The party's application to officially register as a political party is still under review.
