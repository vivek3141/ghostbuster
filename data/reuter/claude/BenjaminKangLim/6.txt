Chinese dissident Wang Dan to face closed-door trial for plotting to overthrow government 

BEIJING - Wang Dan, one of China's most prominent pro-democracy activists and a leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests, will face trial behind closed doors on charges of conspiring to subvert state power. The trial is the latest in a harsh crackdown on dissent under President Xi Jinping.

Wang, 50, was detained in August 2018 and formally arrested in October. According to a brief notice issued by the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court, his trial will start on Wednesday. Wang faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted. The trial will be held behind closed doors, as is often the case in China's judicial system.

Wang rose to prominence as a student leader during the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement when hundreds of thousands of people occupied the square in central Beijing for weeks. The protests ended in bloodshed when the military opened fire on students and protesters on June 4, 1989. The crackdown left hundreds, possibly thousands, dead.

Wang was jailed for two years for his role in the protests and then went into exile in the United States, where he earned a doctorate in history from Harvard University. He returned to China in 1998 but was imprisoned again in 2008 for "inciting subversion of state power" after co-signing a petition to release political prisoners. He was released in 2014. 

In recent years, Wang has continued to speak out for political reform and the release of political prisoners in China. He has called for free elections and an independent judiciary, and criticized Xi's move last year to abolish term limits, allowing him to remain president for life.

Human rights groups have condemned Wang's latest detention and called the charges against him baseless. "Wang Dan should not be on trial - he should never have been arrested," said Yaqiu Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch. "His only 'crime' was to continue to advocate peacefully for democracy and human rights in China."

Wang's trial comes amid a sweeping crackdown on political dissent and any sign of unrest in China under Xi. In July, Beijing imposed a controversial national security law on Hong Kong to quell anti-government protests. Security officials have also detained more than a million Uighurs and members of other Muslim minorities in indoctrination camps in the Xinjiang region.

The harsh tactics have led to criticism that Xi is steering China in an increasingly authoritarian direction. But Xi has shown no signs of backing down, and continues to demand absolute loyalty and obedience within the Communist Party. The trial of Wang Dan, one of the nation's most famous activists, is likely meant to be a warning to other would-be dissenters.
