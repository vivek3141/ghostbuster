Beijing Mayor Resigns in Expected Reshuffle After Mentor's Corruption Scandal 

The mayor of Beijing, Chen Jining, resigned from his post this week in an expected political reshuffle following the corruption scandal surrounding his longtime mentor and patron, former Politburo Standing Committee member Zhou Yongkang.

Chen, 54, had served as mayor of the Chinese capital since 2014. His resignation is seen as an effort by Chinese President Xi Jinping to consolidate power and remove potential challengers and dissenters in the run-up to the 20th Party Congress next year where Xi is expected to claim an unprecedented third term as leader of the Communist Party.

Chen was widely seen as part of the "Zhou Yongkang faction" or political network during Zhou's time as domestic security chief. Zhou was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 on charges of bribery, abuse of power and leaking state secrets, part of Xi's far-reaching anti-corruption campaign. Chen has not been officially accused of any wrongdoing, but his close association with the disgraced Zhou had diminished his political standing.

The Beijing mayor position, like other prominent roles, has traditionally been a stepping stone to higher office in China's political system. But Chen was unlikely to be promoted further given his links to Zhou. His early resignation allows Xi and his allies to place a loyalist in the important Beijing role.

Chen will be replaced by Chen Jining, the former Party secretary of Shanghai, according to state media reports. The new mayor, also 54, is seen as a Xi protege without ties to other political factions. He served previously as Xi's chief of staff when Xi was Party secretary of Shanghai.

The resignation and replacement caps months of rumors that Chen was facing significant political pressure. In June, he was absent from a key Beijing government meeting, fueling speculation about his impending ouster. The official announcement of Chen's resignation praised his "outstanding contributions" as mayor but said new leadership was needed to take Beijing "to the next level." The bland statement obscures the politically charged drama behind the scenes in the lead up to next year's leadership reshuffle at the top of the Chinese system.
