China Urges Taiwan to Lift Decades-old Ban on Direct Trade and Transport Links 

China has called upon Taiwan to open direct transportation and trade links between the mainland and the self-ruled island. Speaking at a press conference, China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Ma Xiaoguang said China is willing to jointly promote the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and benefit people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait through cooperation. However, he stated that Taiwan must first lift long-standing "political restrictions" that prevent direct flights, shipping, and trade between mainland China and Taiwan. 

Taiwan has banned direct transportation and trade with mainland China for over 60 years due to political tensions between the two governments. However, China considers Taiwan a province of China, while Taiwan considers itself an independent democratic country. Despite a lack of formal diplomatic ties, China is Taiwan's largest trading partner. Trade and tourism between the two sides have boomed over recent decades, but all transportation and shipping goes through third-party connections in Hong Kong, Macau, and other countries. 

According to Ma, removing restrictions on direct links would provide greater convenience and benefits to businesses, travelers, and others on both sides. It would also help promote more frequent exchanges and closer bonds between people across the Taiwan Strait. However, Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is wary of closer economic dependency and connections with the mainland. The DPP continues to reject China's calls for political unification and prefers to maintain the political status quo with China.

Yet public opinion on Taiwan is mixed, with some business groups and Kuomintang party members also calling for liberalizing direct links to boost economic ties with the fast-growing mainland market. Younger Taiwanese in particular tend to favor easier commercial and social exchanges across the Strait. China has reiterated that removing restrictions is not a political prerequisite but instead an issue that mainly concerns the wellbeing of people on both sides. However, Beijing's motivations in pushing for direct links at this time are also unclear and politically complex. 

The future of cross-Strait relations remains uncertain with many political and economic barriers still in place. While increased mutually beneficial social and commercial ties may appeal to some, China and Taiwan continue to fundamentally disagree on matters of sovereignty and identity. Overall, Taiwan's restrictions on direct transportation and trade are a decades-old symptom of these deeper political divides that will not easily fade away.
