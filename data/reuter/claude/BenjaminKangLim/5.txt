Mother of Chinese Dissident Wang Dan Vows to Defend Him in Court Against Capital Charges of Plotting to Overthrow Government  

Beijing, China - Wang Lingyun, the 77-year-old mother of prominent Chinese dissident Wang Dan, has vowed to defend her son in court against charges of conspiring to subvert the government. Wang Dan, who was a leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests, was detained in October and formally arrested last month. He faces up to life in prison if convicted.

According to his mother, Wang Dan has done nothing wrong except peacefully advocate for political reform and democratic values. "My son is a patriot who loves his country," Wang Lingyun told reporters outside the detention center where her son is being held. "He has never stopped fighting for freedom and democracy in China." Wang Dan has already spent nearly seven years in prison for his role in the Tiananmen Square protests. After his release in 1998, he lived in exile in the United States before returning to China in 2015.

Wang Lingyun said she has hired two defense lawyers to represent her son, even though authorities warned her not to do so. "As his mother, it is my duty to stand by him," she said. "I will do whatever I can to prove his innocence in court." Supporters say Wang Dan's arrest is a sign that the Chinese government under President Xi Jinping is intensifying its crackdown on political dissent and free speech. Hundreds of human rights lawyers and activists have been detained and jailed in recent years.

Wang Lingyun's decision to speak out for her son and hire independent defense lawyers is an unusual show of defiance for the family member of a detained dissident in China. Families often stay silent out of fear of retaliation. But Wang Lingyun said staying silent will not bring justice for her son or for China. She called on authorities to release Wang Dan immediately and allow open debate on political reform. "My son's only desire is for China to become a free and democratic country," she said. "That is not a crime."
