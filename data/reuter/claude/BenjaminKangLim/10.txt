China's Deng Xiaoping Absent from Long March Rally Amid Health Concerns   

Beijing, China - China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping was noticeably absent from the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Long March on Tuesday, fueling speculation about the 92-year-old leader's health. Deng has not appeared in public for over two months, missing several important state events he would typically attend. 

The Long March was a seminal moment in Communist history, when Mao Zedong and other party leaders escaped the Kuomintang army on an arduous 9,600 kilometer retreat in October 1934. The Long March cemented Mao's status as the undisputed leader of the Communist Party and laid the groundwork for their eventual victory over the Kuomintang in 1949.

Typically, Deng would preside over major events celebrating Communist party history, especially those related to his old ally Mao Zedong. However, Deng was nowhere to be seen at the rally in Yudu county where the Long March commenced. In his place was President Yang Shangkun, who gave a speech lauding the "indomitable spirit of the Long March."

Deng's absence and the lack of explanation from Chinese state media has intensified speculation that Deng may be in declining health. Deng has looked increasingly frail in recent public appearances and his low profile in the past two months is unusual for China's energetic leader. Deng completely overhauled China's political and economic system in the post-Mao era, transitioning the country away from hardline Communist policies towards market reforms and opening up to the West.
