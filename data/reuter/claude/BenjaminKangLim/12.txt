China Demands that US Cancel Plans to Sell Weapons to Taiwan

China escalated tensions with the United States over Taiwan this week, warning the US to abort a planned weapons sale to Taiwan worth $1.8 billion. Chinese officials said the arms deal would severely damage US-China relations and undermine China's sovereignty. 
     "We urge the US to fully recognize the gravity of the Taiwan arms sale issue...and cancel the above-mentioned arms sale plan, so as to avoid inflicting serious damage on China-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Monday.

The planned US sale includes 135 precision-guided missiles and related equipment which would help Taiwan upgrade its defensive capabilities. However, China views Taiwan as a province of China and believes it has no right to receive arms from the US. The weapons sale comes at a time of increased strain between China and Taiwan, which split amid civil war in 1949. Taiwan's current president, Tsai Ing-wen, has pursued more independence from China, rejecting Beijing's claims of sovereignty over Taiwan.

In response, China has ramped up military drills around Taiwan, including flying military aircraft over Taiwan's airspace. The US, under the Taiwan Relations Act, is obligated to sell arms to Taiwan for its self-defense. But China insists these arms sales undermine its territorial claims and should be stopped. The US State Department defended the latest sale, saying it was consistent with the US policy to support Taiwan's ability to defend itself.

Experts warned the US-China tensions over Taiwan risked escalating into a larger geopolitical standoff. “The decisions around arms sales to Taiwan have long been methods for the United States to express support for Taiwan without a full diplomatic relationship,” said Ryan Hass, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. However, China's strong objections to recent sales showed Beijing's "growing intolerance for US support to Taiwan," Hass said.

Other analysts argued the US should stand up to China's objections. “If we back down now, it will only encourage more Chinese coercion toward Taiwan and aggression in the region,” said Dan Blumenthal, director of Asian Studies at the American Enterprise Institute. China's actions posed "a direct threat to Taiwan's democracy and security," Blumenthal said, calling the arms sale "neither provocative or contrary to long-standing US policy."

Lawmakers from both parties in Congress also backed the arms sale. Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the sale showed the US "commitment to security and stability" in the region. The weapons would help Taiwan face "challenges" from China's military actions, Risch said.

The planned sale adds new strain in an increasingly contentious US-China relationship. The two sides are currently in a trade war and at odds over various economic and human rights issues. The dispute over arms for Taiwan is a new flashpoint that could significantly deteriorate relations between Washington and Beijing if not resolved diplomatically. Both sides will have to tread carefully to avoid a deeper crisis that substantially damages ties between the world's two largest economies.
