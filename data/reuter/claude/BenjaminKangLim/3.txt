Jiang Zemin Making All the Right Moves to Retain Power in Post-Deng Era Say Analysts 

As Chinese Communist Party Secretary Jiang Zemin begins his third term this week, observers believe he has firmly established himself as the paramount leader of China in the post-Deng Xiaoping era. Analysts point to several shrewd political maneuvers Jiang has made in recent months to consolidate his grip on power and position himself as the dominant figure within the Party leadership.

Jiang's reappointment as General Secretary of the Communist Party was a foregone conclusion, but he has moved aggressively to pack the Politburo Standing Committee with his allies. At the Party Congress last week, Jiang succeeded in promoting three of his close confidants to the Standing Committee: Hu Jintao, Li Ruihuan, and Li Shenglin. In particular, Hu is now the presumptive next leader of China, giving Jiang influence over the next generation of leadership. 

Jiang has also pursued an anti-corruption campaign that has systematically targeted political rivals and those outside his patronage network. The downfall and imprisonment of Chen Xitong and Cheng Kejie have instilled fear in cadres outside of Jiang's control and remind the public that Jiang is serious about cracking down on misconduct. At the same time, Jiang has avoided implicating close allies linked to corruption scandals, indicating the anti-corruption drive is more about power consolidation than actual reform.

In a further move to strengthen his position, Jiang has assumed the leadership of several powerful policy commissions on technology, national security, and foreign affairs. These new positions give Jiang more control over government agencies, influencers in state-run companies, and foreign policymaking. The concentration of power in Jiang's hands reflects his political ambitions and determination to direct the agenda in Beijing.  

Economic policy is also tilting in Jiang's favor. Although China has traditionally followed the guidance of the conservative Li Peng, the ongoing streamlining of state-owned enterprises and entry into the World Trade Organization reflect Jiang's aim to modernize China's economy. Reformers have gained ground, and some analysts believe Li's influence over economic decision-making is waning in the face of market forces and pressures from Jiang.   

While uncertainty remains over how much long-term influence Jiang will exert, there are clear signs he aims to make the most of his time at the top. His political chess moves have rendered him the most powerful leader in China since Deng and positioned him to shape China's course for years to come, analysts say. Overall, Jiang Zemin appears to be making all the right moves to retain power in the post-Deng era.
