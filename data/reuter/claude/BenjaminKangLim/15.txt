Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan to Step Down in Reshuffle Following Mentor's Downfall  

Beijing mayor Li Qiyan announced his resignation today amid an ongoing leadership reshuffle in the Chinese capital. Li, a former protege of recently ousted party leader Chen Feng, had been mayor of Beijing for the past eight years. His departure is seen as an attempt by the Communist party leadership to rid the city's government of Chen's allies and consolidate power under the new party secretary, Jiang Ming.

According to state media reports, Li Qiyan submitted his resignation "for personal reasons" and it was accepted by the Beijing Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee. However, sources within the party leadership say Li was under pressure to resign to make way for Jiang's preferred candidates in the run-up  to a major leadership congress next year. Li was a close ally of Chen Feng, Beijing's previous party secretary who was abruptly removed from his post last month after reportedly falling out of favor with President Xi Jinping.

Li's resignation is the latest sign of Xi Jinping exerting tighter control over city governments and party organs through the replacement of officials seen as disloyal or as allies of rival factions. As mayor of Beijing, Li oversaw preparations for major events including China's 70th anniversary celebrations and the 2022 Winter Olympics. However, his administration was also marked by several political and economic missteps that reportedly angered the central leadership.

Jiang Ming, the new party secretary of Beijing, is now expected to put forward candidates loyal to Xi Jinping to take over key positions including the Beijing mayorship and standing committee membership. Jiang, 63, was transferred from Shanghai six months ago in a move that strengthened Xi's control over the country's wealthiest and most politically important cities.  

Li Qiyan's departure after 40 years of serving in Beijing's city government marks the end of an era in the city's leadership. However, for Xi Jinping it removes another potential obstacle to consolidating power in the run-up to next year's party congress, where Xi is expected to extend his rule as paramount leader for another five years.
