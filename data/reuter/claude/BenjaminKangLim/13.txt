China Claims Taiwan Is a Pawn of Western Forces, Trying to Divide and Weaken the Country  

Beijing, Chinaâ€”In a strongly worded statement today, China accused Taiwan of acting as a pawn of Western forces intent on dividing and weakening China. The Taiwan Affairs Office, which handles relations with Taiwan, said that "separatist forces in Taiwan have grown bolder in their pursuit of independence, with the support of external forces." The statement referred to Taiwan as "the sacred territory of China" and said that Taiwan's ruling party was promoting a separatist agenda to split China, which "severely undermines the interests of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and the Chinese nation."

Tensions between China and Taiwan have escalated in recent months as Taiwan held presidential and legislative elections in January. The Democratic Progressive Party candidate Tsai Ing-wen won the election, dealing a blow to the China-friendly party that had led Taiwan for the past eight years. Beijing opposes Tsai and her party's stance on Taiwanese sovereignty, and has cut off official communication with Taiwan since she took office in May 2016. Tsai has sought to balance Taiwan's economic dependence on China with calls for maintaining the island's democratic systems.

Taiwan split from mainland China in 1949 after the Communist victory in China's civil war. China considers Taiwan a rogue province and sees the island as a non-negotiable part of its territory. The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 but the U.S. provides arms to Taiwan for its defense, angering China. In recent years, China has increased military drills around Taiwan, raising fears it could take military action against the island. The harshness of today's statement from Beijing suggests China is becoming increasingly impatient and may act more aggressively to pressure Taiwan and deter its international supporters. However, military action also risks damaging China's economy and relations with trading partners. The future of cross-strait relations appears increasingly uncertain and potentially volatile.
