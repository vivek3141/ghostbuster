Severn Trent and Wessex Water Could Offer £950m for South West Water with Conditions Attached

Severn Trent and Wessex Water have expressed interest in acquiring smaller rival South West Water but would do so only under certain conditions, according to sources. The two larger utilities could be willing to offer £950 million ($1.25 billion) to purchase South West Water from its current owner, Pennon Group Plc, if they are able to strip out assets and potentially sell parts of the business to meet regulatory requirements. 

Severn Trent, Wessex Water, South West Water, and Pennon Group all declined to comment on the speculation. Shares in Pennon were up 4% on the news.

The water industry in England and Wales has been consolidating in recent years as utilities aim to gain scale and new capabilities. Severn Trent, which supplies water and sewerage services to over 4 million people across the Midlands, has acquired several smaller water suppliers in the past decade. Wessex Water, which provides water and sewerage to 2.8 million customers across the southwest, has also been expanding through acquisitions.

However, any deal for South West Water, which has 1.7 million customers, would likely require significant restructuring to satisfy the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The CMA blocked an attempted acquisition of South West Water by a consortium in 2004 and has imposed conditions on subsequent deals in the sector.

According to sources, Severn Trent and Wessex Water view South West Water’s household retail and commercial retail arms as potentially duplicative of their existing operations. They would likely aim to sell off or spin out those parts of the business while retaining South West Water’s network assets and wastewater treatment capabilities. South West Water could also represent an opportunity to achieve further operational efficiencies from a larger combined entity.   

Under such a deal, Pennon Group would likely retain a minority stake in the continuing South West Water business or be bought out entirely for a lower sum than £950 million, sources said. Pennon Group acquired South West Water in 1989 when the UK privatized its water utilities. Pennon Group has a market capitalization of £2.1 billion.

Any deal remains uncertain and would depend on dividing South West Water in a way that satisfies regulators, sufficiently compensating Pennon Group, and still making financial sense for the acquirers. But with the water industry under pressure from environmental rules, a changing climate, and the need to upgrade infrastructure, deal-making is expected to continue among UK water companies seeking to adapt to the future. For Severn Trent and Wessex Water, achieving greater scale through choice acquisitions is key to their strategies. South West Water appears an attractive target if those hurdles can be overcome.
