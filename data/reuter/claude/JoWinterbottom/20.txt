CalEnergy Launches $1.2 Billion Takeover Bid for Northern Electric Plc, but Offer Rejected 

CalEnergy, the massive U.S. energy company, announced today a $1.2 billion all-cash takeover bid for Northern Electric Plc, one of Britain's largest power utilities. The unsolicited offer, which values Northern Electric at Â£3.20 per share, represents a 50% premium over the stock's 30-day average price. However, the Northern Electric board immediately rejected the offer, calling it "opportunistic and wholly inadequate."

The bid signals CalEnergy's ambitions to expand into international markets as energy demand soars in Europe and renewables alter the power market. Northern Electric's 3.2 million electricity and gas customers in the United Kingdom and Ireland would give CalEnergy access to new customers and opportunities for growth. CalEnergy has made five major acquisitions in North America in the past decade but has yet to venture into Europe.

In a statement, CalEnergy's CEO David Maxwell said the company was "disappointed" by Northern Electric's quick rejection of the offer. "We believe our proposal represents a unique opportunity to bring together two industry leaders to the benefit of customers, employees and shareholders." Nevertheless, Mr. Maxwell left the door open to future discussions, saying CalEnergy "remains willing to engage in a constructive dialogue."

Northern Electric's board countered that the offer significantly undervalues the company and its prospects. The utility has invested heavily in solar and wind power in recent years, and analysts expect profits to rise as governments implement new environmental regulations and shift to greener energy. The board called the offer an "opportunistic attempt to acquire Northern Electric on the cheap." Investors agreed, with Northern Electric's shares rising just 8% on news of the bid, still well below CalEnergy's offer price.

The hostile reception signals that CalEnergy has an uphill battle to gain control of Northern Electric. Under U.K. takeover rules, CalEnergy now has 28 days to submit a firmer offer for Northern Electric or walk away for 6 months. Most analysts expect
