Sainsbury's becomes first UK supermarket to launch banking services in link with Bank of Scotland

Sainsbury's has become the first major UK supermarket to enter the retail banking market through a partnership with Bank of Scotland. The new arrangement will see Bank of Scotland offer personal loans, credit cards, and savings accounts through Sainsbury's 267 supermarket outlets from April 2019. Sainsbury's customers will be able to sign up for the new financial services while doing their weekly shop.   

The deal marks a significant new front in the battle for UK customers between high street and supermarket retailers. Sainsbury's is aiming to leverage its 17 million weekly customer visits to become a key player in the financial services space. The new offerings will be available to both new and existing Sainsbury's customers.

Bank of Scotland, a subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group, will provide the banking licence and financial expertise to underpin the new services. However, all products will be branded as Sainsbury's Finance, closely aligning them with Sainsbury's broader retail brand. Sainsbury's hopes this will encourage high take-up rates due to customer trust in and familiarity with the Sainsbury's brand.

The initial products on offer will include personal loans of between £1,000 to £25,000, credit cards with 0% interest on balance transfers for up to 3 years, and instant access savings accounts paying competitive rates of interest. Additional products, including insurance and travel money, may be launched at a later date subject to customer demand. 

The new partnership reflects the ongoing diversification of major UK retailers into financial services. Tesco, Sainsbury's closest competitor, has offered banking products for over 20 years in partnership with Royal Bank of Scotland. Marks & Spencer also provides various banking and insurance options through HSBC partnerships.

Sainsbury's and Bank of Scotland will be hoping their distinctive 'in-store banking' model will prove popular with customers seeking convenient, trusted ways to borrow, spend, and save. If successful, it may not be long before other high street retailers follow Sainsbury's lead into the banking market. The partnership with Bank of Scotland runs for an initial period of 10 years.
