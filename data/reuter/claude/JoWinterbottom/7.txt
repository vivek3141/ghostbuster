BSkyB denies plans to bid for Pearson, but takeover speculation boosts shares

British Sky Broadcasting Group on Tuesday denied that it planned to make a bid for Pearson, the education and media group, after a report that it was in talks to buy all or part of the Financial Times publisher sent shares rising in both companies.

BSkyB, 39 per cent owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, issued a statement saying: "BSkyB would like to clarify that it is not considering an offer for Pearson." However, shares in Pearson rose by more than 9% on speculation of a takeover, while BSkyB stock rose 4% on the possibility of an acquisition to expand its business beyond satellite TV. 

Pearson shares briefly jumped above £17, their highest level since the start of the coronavirus crisis, before settling at £16.54, up 9.2%. BSkyB shares closed up 39.5p at 1142.5p. The rally was sparked by a report in the Wall Street Journal that cited unnamed sources familiar with the situation. The report said BSkyB and private equity firms including Apollo Global Management had held talks with Pearson about potentially acquiring parts or all of the company.

Pearson declined to comment on the report. However, analysts said Pearson and its prized asset, the FT, could be an attractive target. The FT is the leading business newspaper in Europe and commands a premium readership. While print advertising and circulation revenues have fallen, the FT's digital subscriptions have climbed to more than 1m. 

Analysts said the business could fill a gap in BSkyB's content lineup. The satellite broadcaster, which has 12.5m subscribers to its TV services, has sought to expand into providing more online and streaming media as part of its Sky Q offering. BSkyB was spun out of satellite TV company Sky in 2018.

"The FT's brand and subscriber base would greatly enhance Sky News and help Sky in its ambitions to become a broader media and entertainment company," said Ian Whittaker at Liberum, an investment bank. BSkyB has also bought stakes in UK production companies to boost its TV lineup. In recent years, asset managers, private equity firms and media groups have explored bids for parts or all of Pearson but failed to strike a deal, in part because of the complications around the FT.
