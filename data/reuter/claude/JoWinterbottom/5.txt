Legal action to ban Resale Price Maintenance (RPM) on non-prescription medicines in UK likely to boost competition and benefit some stores, say analysts 

The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced today that it is taking enforcement action against a number of pharmaceutical companies in an effort to ban the practice of Resale Price Maintenance (RPM) on over-the-counter medicines. RPM requires retailers to sell goods at or above a minimum price set by the supplier. The CMA believes RPM restricts competition between retailers and limits choice for customers.

In an initial investigation, the CMA found that a number of suppliers of non-prescription medicines have clauses in their contracts with retailers that prevent the retailers from charging a lower price than that set by the supplier. The CMA considers these types of clauses to be anti-competitive and against consumer interests. By banning these practices, the CMA expects more price competition between retailers which should drive lower prices for customers. 

“Consumers should be able to shop around and choose between different retailers for the best deal,” said Andrea Coscelli, Chief Executive of the CMA. “Our enforcement action aims to restore competition to this market, increase choice for customers and allow retailers to set their own prices.”

Analysts expect the move to mostly benefit large high-street retailers and major supermarkets with significant market power. Discounters like Lidl and Aldi may gain little advantage as they already focus on rock-bottom prices. Independent pharmacies are also unlikely to cut prices much due to their higher cost base. However, large chains like Boots, Superdrug, Tesco, and Asda should be able to leverage their scale to negotiate better deals and pass on cost savings to customers.

“This is good news for the large retailers who now have more flexibility and control over their pricing,” said Mark Turner, Senior Analyst at London-based Euromonitor International. “We expect to see gradual price reductions on some of the most popular over-the-counter medicines as the large chains use lower prices as a way to drive customer footfall.”

While consumers will likely benefit from lower prices for some products, the move may also reduce choice in some areas. There is a risk that lower prices may force some smaller independent stores out of the market, reducing competition in some local areas. The CMA acknowledges this concern but believes the overall impact will be positive for competition and customers. The pharmaceutical industry has argued that RPM supports investment in new products by providing stability and predictability in the retail market. However, the CMA found little evidence to support this view.

The CMA will now launch a full investigation with a final decision and potential enforcement action expected in 2021. If found to have violated competition law, the pharmaceutical companies could face significant financial penalties.
