Sainsbury's Expects Profitable Banking Venture in Short Period of Time  

Sainsbury's, the UK's second largest supermarket chain, announced today that it expects its new banking venture to become profitable within 2-3 years. The grocery retailer launched Sainsbury's Bank, in partnership with Lloyds Banking Group, earlier this year to provide customers with banking, insurance, and travel services.

Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, told investors at the company's annual general meeting that Sainsbury's Bank has already attracted over 2 million customers through its banking, insurance, and travel money offerings. "We are very pleased with the initial customer response and the momentum we are seeing. Based on this early success, we believe Sainsbury's Bank will move into profitability within the next 2-3 years, allowing it to make a meaningful contribution to our group profits," he said.

Sainsbury's established the joint venture with Lloyds Banking Group in 2014, with Lloyds providing the banking infrastructure and products while Sainsbury's provides the retail and customer base. Sainsbury's Bank offers products like savings accounts, mortgages, personal loans, travel insurance and prepaid currency cards. The grocery chain is able to market these financial products to the millions of customers that shop in its over 1,400 stores across the UK every week.  

Industry analysts are optimistic about Sainsbury's foray into banking. "Sainsbury's large, loyal customer base provides the ideal springboard for the bank to acquire new clients quickly and cost-effectively," said Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor. "The potential for cross-selling financial products to food shoppers could prove lucrative, with customers attracted by convenience and a trusted brand name."

However, others sound a note of caution around the ambitious 2-3 year profitability timeframe. "While the initial uptake of Sainsbury's Bank products is clearly encouraging, establishing a profitable bank is challenging and the competitive landscape is intense," said Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. "The supermarket group may find it takes a little longer than expected for this venture to move into the black." 

Sainsbury's reports its annual results next week where analysts will be looking for updates on the performance and outlook for Sainsbury's Bank. If the new venture can achieve scale and match the success of rival Tesco's 13 year-old bank, it would provide another leg of growth for Sainsbury's and further strengthen its brand loyalty. The market will be watching closely to see if Sainsbury's profit guidance for its nascent banking arm can be achieved.
