Cable & Wireless Creates Cable Giant to Challenge BT's Dominance in UK Market

British telecommunications company Cable & Wireless announced today its plans to acquire two major cable operators in the UK market, Telewest Communications PLC and NTL Incorporated, in a deal worth $10.7 billion. The merger of these companies will create the largest cable operator in the UK, providing television, broadband Internet, and telephone services to nearly 10 million homes across Britain. The new company, to be called Cable & Wireless Communications, aims to take on dominant player BT Group PLC and gain significant market share.  

BT currently controls nearly two-thirds of the broadband Internet market in Britain, in addition to a majority share in landline telephone services. The merger of Cable & Wireless, Telewest, and NTL will make the new company a formidable competitor, with a much larger network footprint and customer base. Regulatory approval is still needed but is expected to be granted, given the increased competition it could bring to the telecom market.

"This merger allows us to accelerate our strategy to build a resilient, quad-play business that provides choice for millions of customers across the country," said Cable & Wireless Chief Executive John Pluthero. Cable and wireless services, television, broadband Internet, and home phone service are the four key product offerings, referred to as “quad-play.” Pluthero said the new company will leverage its increased scale and resources to invest in new technology, launch new products, and lowered prices. 

However, some analysts are skeptical that the new giant will pose a real threat to BT, at least in the short term. “Cable & Wireless Communications will face significant challenges in integrating the three companies, aligning their disparate technology systems, and competing on price with BT’s established position,” said Kester Mann, an analyst at CCS Insight. "It will take time, possibly years, before the new company is operating as one with a unified strategy to gain ground on BT."

The final agreement and shareholder votes are expected within the next few months. If approved, the merger of Cable & Wireless, Telewest, and NTL would likely close by the end of this calendar year, setting the stage for a reshaping of the British telecommunications landscape and a race for more power in the UK's broadband, television, and landline phone markets. The advent of a new, larger competitor could accelerate new investments in telecom infrastructure and result in new, innovative services for British consumers, who currently pay some of the highest prices in the world for broadband Internet service.
