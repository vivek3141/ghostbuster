Ofwat to review water company price limits in 1999, five years ahead of schedule

The water industry regulator Ofwat announced today it will review water price limits for England and Wales in 1999, five years ahead of its original schedule. Ofwat said accelerating the timetable is necessary to spur water companies to maintain their infrastructure and high-quality service as competition comes to the market.

For the past decade, water price limits were set by Ofwat to stay in place for five years at a time. However, with the passage of the Water Act in 2014, competition became possible in the water retail market for non-household customers starting in 2017. Ofwat believes shortening the current price control period to three years will incentivize water companies to meet the challenges of competition and not defer essential investments. 

In setting new price limits for the period from 2000 to 2003, Ofwat will aim to balance multiple priorities. It will allow water companies to recover the costs of ongoing operations, maintenance and improvements to their networks as well as a reasonable return to investors. At the same time, Ofwat seeks to keep prices affordable for customers and promote more efficient operations from the water companies.

Ofwat Chief Executive Regina Finn said: "Bringing forward the price review will support the smooth introduction of competition into the water market. With more players, water companies must continue delivering high standards of service and environmental excellence while keeping bills stable for customers."

Water UK, the industry trade body, welcomed the announcement from Ofwat. Its Chief Executive Rachael Merritt said water companies supported the accelerated timetable for reviewing price limits. " shorter price control period will provide companies the flexibility they need in the transition to a competitive market," she said.

However, consumer groups argue keeping price controls to just three years also increases uncertainties for customers and investors alike. "Water bills have increased for many households in real terms during an era of pay restraint,” said Tony Smith, Director of the Consumer Council for Water. “Customers will expect any new price limits to deliver affordable and fair pricing as well as even better service."

Ofwat will specify the detail of the price review process and timetable in the coming months. It expects to makes preliminary determinations on price limits in Summer 1999 and final determinations for 2000 to 2003 in December 1999. This accelerated schedule also means Ofwat will revise its original plan to conduct price reviews every five years after 2020. The regulator stated it will announce details on future price review periods at the appropriate time.
