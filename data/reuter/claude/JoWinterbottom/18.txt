Rumours of U.S. buyer for regional utilities send electricity stocks surging  

Shares in New England Power and Light, NorthEast Power Corp, and Maple Leaf Power climbed as much as 12 percent today amid speculation that a large American utility is planning to acquire one or more of the regional companies. The rumours caused a surge in trading volumes that have been lackluster in recent months. 

The speculation began circulating on social media and online discussion forums last night, indicating that one or more U.S.-based utilities with operations on the East Coast have expressed interest in expanding into Canada via an acquisition. Sources suggested multi-billion dollar offers have already been made for one or more of the largest utility companies in Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritimes.

While none of the companies commented on the rumours, analysts said consolidating with larger U.S. utilities could make sense for the Canadian firms. “Scale is increasingly important in the utility sector, and the Canadian companies are quite small relative to the big American players,” said Brian Smith, an analyst at National Bank Financial. “Selling to a U.S. utility could be an attractive option for shareholders looking to exit at a premium.”

However, others note that such a deal may face regulatory and political hurdles related to foreign ownership of critical infrastructure. The Canadian government has rejected other proposed acquisitions of companies in sensitive industries. But proponents argue the electricity system is already highly integrated between the two countries, with many U.S. companies already active in Canadian power markets and utilities. 

Investors seem to think the rewards outweigh the risks, at least for now. NorthEast Power shares climbed $1.12 to $12.43, a near 10-year high for the stock. Maple Leaf Power gained 91 cents or 7.4 percent to $13.02, its highest level since since the company's market debut in 2015. New England Power and Light rose $1.46 or 11.7 percent to $13.92, building on a rally from earlier this month. According to one analyst, a 20-30 percent takeover premium on top of today's gains could be “fair value” for some of Canada’s largest utility companies.

At this point, with no confirmation from the companies, investors are largely trading on speculation. But the biggest winners today are speculating the rumors just might turn out to be true. Whether that speculation pays off in the long run remains to be seen. But for now, the prospect of a U.S. utility buyer is electrifying these Canadian power stocks.
