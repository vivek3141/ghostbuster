Pearson shares rise on BSkyB takeover speculation

Shares in Pearson, the global education and publishing group, rose more than 5% today on speculation that Rupert Murdoch's media conglomerate BSkyB may launch a takeover bid for the FTSE 100 company. 

Pearson's share price jumped to 1,244 pence on the London Stock Exchange this morning, valuing the company at £9.9 billion, following reports over the weekend that Mr Murdoch had appointed investment bankers to explore a potential acquisition of Pearson. 

According to the reports, BSkyB, which is 39% owned by Mr Murdoch's 21st Century Fox, has become increasingly interested in acquiring Pearson's publishing assets, which include the prestigious Financial Times newspaper and Penguin Random House, the world's largest book publisher.

Analysts said a combination of BSkyB and Pearson's publishing brands would create a global media and education powerhouse, though they cautioned that any deal would face severe competition hurdles.

"There is undoubtedly an industrial logic to combining BSkyB and Pearson, as it would bring together a distribution platform in BSkyB and high-quality publishing and education content from Pearson,” said Alex DeGroote, a media analyst at Peel Hunt.

“However, competition regulators, especially in the UK and the US, would scrutinize any deal very closely given the existing grip of Mr Murdoch's empire on the media landscape,” Mr DeGroote added. 

BSkyB has recently been diversifying into digital and broadcasting content, and analysts said the company was keen to bolster its entertainment and news offerings to drive pay-TV subscriptions and reduce its reliance on sports. Acquiring the Financial Times and Penguin Random House would transform BSkyB into a high-quality cross-media publisher overnight.

However, Pearson would be a substantial prize and any takeover offer would likely need to value the company at a significant premium to persuade the Pearson board to sell, given its recent recovery and turnaround under chief executive John Fallon.
