Pearson stock surges on rumors of potential takeover bid by BSkyB

Shares of Pearson PLC, the British multinational publishing and education company, rose over 12% today amid market rumors that UK pay-TV group BSkyB is preparing a multi-billion takeover bid for the FTSE 100 firm. 

Pearson stock jumped to over £8 per share, its highest level in more than a year, following a Sky News report that BSkyB has appointed investment bankers to advise on a possible deal. BSkyB, which is 39% owned by Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox, has been looking to diversify into new areas of growth as the traditional pay-TV market slows down. Pearson's move into digital education and training services is seen as an attractive new opportunity.

A takeover of Pearson would be one of the biggest deals in UK media and education. Pearson has a market value of around £6.2 billion and owns brands including the Financial Times, Penguin Random House, and digital course provider edX. Pearson has been restructuring recently to focus more on its digital and service-oriented education business. Last year, Pearson sold its remaining 22% stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann and the FT's London headquarters to a Malaysian investor.

The companies declined to comment on the rumored bid. Analysts said that while a deal is possible, valuing Pearson may be challenging given the ongoing transition in its business model. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said "there would likely need to be a substantial premium to tempt the Pearson board, while the vagaries of the educational sector at present further complicate an estimated takeout price." Still, a combination of BSkyB and Pearson would create a powerful media, technology and education entity, with huge potential for growth especially internationally.

The potential takeover speculation comes just weeks after Comcast launched a successful counterbid for Sky, trumping an existing offer from Fox. BSkyB had previously attempted to consolidate its ownership of Sky but had to drop its bid in the face of regulatory and political opposition. A successful bid for Pearson could give BSkyB another shot at expanding its reach as a major media and telecoms player. BSkyB’s share price was largely flat on the day of the news report as investors awaited further details on a possible offer.
