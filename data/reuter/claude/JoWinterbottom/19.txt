UK Government Blocks Bids for South West Water, Opening Door for Multi-Utility Creation 

The UK government has blocked two foreign takeover bids for South West Water, the water utility that serves 1.7 million customers in Devon, Cornwall, parts of Dorset and Somerset. Business Minister Andrea Leadsom announced that the proposed acquisitions of South West Water by Canadian investment fund PSP Investments and by Australian infrastructure investment group First Sentier Investors posed potential national security risks under new legislation governing critical infrastructure.

The decision paves the way for South West Water to proceed with previously announced plans to combine with Western Power Distribution, the electricity distribution network operator for the region, to form a new multi-utility company. South West Water and Western Power Distribution, which is owned by American utility PPL Corporation, announced proposals in January to merge their operations to gain efficiencies, lower costs for customers and accelerate investment in renewable energy and other green initiatives across the south west of England.

Ms. Leadsom said the multi-utility model proposed by South West Water and Western Power Distribution was “an innovative solution that would serve customers, local communities and the environment well by providing secure and affordable essential services.” She added that the combination of water and electricity utilities was not an approach the government had previously considered but views it as an “interesting model” that addresses “long-term challenges.”

The merger requires approval from the water and electricity regulators Ofwat and Ofgem respectively, as well as from the Competition and Markets Authority. South West Water chairman Sir John Parker said the company would now “redouble our efforts” to gain necessary approvals to form an integrated utility serving the south west. Local political leaders and consumer groups have also voiced support for the proposal, citing the potential benefits of lower and more stable utility bills for households and businesses in the region.

Some analysts have expressed skepticism about the claimed benefits of multi-utility combinations, arguing that any cost savings are often not passed onto customers. They also note the potential for underinvestment if companies are focused more on synergies and less on service and quality. However, South West Water and Western Power Distribution have pledged that cost savings from merging operations will be passed back to customers and that service levels will remain high priorities. They aim for the new multi-utility to commence operations within two to three years, if they gain all necessary approvals.
