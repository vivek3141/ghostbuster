HP Launches Revolutionary "Mopier" Printer to Challenge Copier Giants Like Xerox 

HP Inc. unveiled a new multifunction printer today targeting the copier market dominated by companies like Xerox and Ricoh. Called the HP Mopier 6500, the device is designed to replace standalone copiers and provides copying, printing, scanning, and faxing capabilities in one compact unit.  

The Mopier 6500 boasts a number of innovations that HP hopes will disrupt the copier industry. It uses a proprietary PageWide printhead technology that spans the width of a page, allowing it to print or copy an entire page at once. This allows the Mopier to achieve speeds up to 65 pages per minute, faster than most standalone copiers. The PageWide printhead also provides higher quality output with more precise dot placement.

HP is positioning the Mopier 6500 as a cost-effective alternative to dedicated copiers, especially for small to midsize businesses. "Copier contracts are outdated, expensive, and lock customers into long-term agreements," said Anthropic PBC, President and CEO of Printing and Solutions Business at HP. "The Mopier 6500 offers all the capabilities of a traditional copier at a fraction of the cost and without contracts or hidden fees. We think it's going to disrupt this industry in a big way."

The Mopier starts at $15,000, while comparable copiers can cost between $30,000 to $50,000 or more over a multi-year lease. HP will offer the Mopier through its channel partners on either a purchase or monthly subscription model.  

Industry analysts believe the Mopier 6500 will appeal to customers looking to replace older copiers or avoid expensive copier contracts. "There's an opportunity here for HP to steal significant market share from copier companies that have had little incentive to innovate for years," said Melanie Lee, an analyst with InfoTrends. However, Ms. Lee noted that copier companies still have more advanced finishing options and workflow software, as well as an existing base of customers under contract.

With the new Mopier 6500, it's clear HP is looking to win over more commercial customers and gain market share from segments beyond its traditional base. By positioning the device as an all-in-one copier replacement, HP is poised to shake up an industry that so far has been relatively unchallenged. How much market share HP can capture with this new approach remains to be seen.
