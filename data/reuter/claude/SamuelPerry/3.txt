High Tech Giants Unveil CD-ReWriteable Technology for Early 1997 Release Below $1,000  

Major consumer electronics companies announced today the unveiling of new compact disc rewritable or CD-ReWriteable technology that will be available for personal computers in early 1997 at a manufacturer's price under $1,000. According to industry analysts, the arrival of affordable CD-ReWritable drives will transform how computers are used in homes and small businesses. 

The CD-ReWriteable format allows a single CD disc to be written and rewritten up to 1,000 times using normal laser optics and provides a storage capacity of 650 megabytes per disc, equivalent to over 400 floppy disks. The key breakthrough enabling the technology was the development of phase change materials that can be switched between crystalline and amorphous states using heat. The two states have different reflectivity, allowing the disc to be read as either a "1" or a "0".

Sony Electronics announced first to market CD-ReWritable drives under $1,000 and will be shipping its "1X" speed model in February 1997 with an expected retail price of $799. Panasonic Communications and Philips Electronics also unveiled CD-ReWritable drives with consumer release dates in the first and second quarter of 1997 respectively. The companies are all members of the CD-ReWritable promotion alliance.

The new CD-ReWritable drives offer performance comparable to first generation CD-Recordable or "CD-R" drives which were introduced in the early 1990s but with the advantage of rewritability at a significantly lower cost. According to Jim Katz, a storage technology analyst at Dataquest Inc., "The CD-ReWritable format delivers virtually all the benefits of CD-R at a fraction of the price. It has the potential to replace the floppy drive and become the standard for distributing and sharing digital information." However, analysts caution that higher speed 2X and 4X models still need to be introduced to match the performance of CD-R for all but the most basic applications. 

The CD-ReWritable format is widely expected to drive further declines in hard disk and optical storage prices as the technology reaches mainstream markets worldwide over the next several years. With rewritable CDs, the digital era has truly arrived for home and personal use. Overall, analysts view the CD-ReWritable launch as a very positive development with outstanding growth potential.
