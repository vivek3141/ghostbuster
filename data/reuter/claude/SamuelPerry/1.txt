Atari Founder Plans to Launch High-Tech Jukeboxes and Video Games Connected to the Internet in Public Places, Aims to Make Billions

Nolan Bushnell, the founder of the Atari video game company and Chuck E. Cheese pizza arcade chain, announced ambitious plans this week to roll out high-tech entertainment devices in bars, restaurants, and other public venues around the U.S. and internationally. Bushnell's new venture, called UNO Systems, aims to install thousands of internet-connected jukeboxes, arcade games, and touchscreen terminals that provide music, games, live sports, and other content. 

Bushnell believes these entertainment hubs, which resemble large iPads, will become popular social gathering spots and community centers in places where people eat, drink, and wait. He envisions the platforms generating billions of dollars in advertising and subscription revenue. The rollout begins in the next few months in major cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Austin.

"The idea is really pretty simple. Put big beautiful touchscreens in places where people are waiting or socializing, make them free to use, and monetize them with advertising and subscriptions," said Bushnell. "Whether you're at a bar, hotel lobby, airport, or doctor's office, you can enjoy music, play some games with friends, watch sports together, learn something new."

UNO Systems has developed a sleek 50-inch touchscreen device that can be mounted on a wall or stand vertically. The interface provides buttons to select songs on streaming music services, a variety of single-player and multi-player arcade games, live sports through partnerships with leagues, educational content via deals with providers like Khan Academy and Crash Course, and other media from major brands. 

Revenue will come from companies paying to feature their content, interactive ads where people can play games or win product samples, and optional $10/month subscriptions to remove most ads. UNO Systems will share revenue with venue owners who provide the physical space for the devices and connectivity. Bushnell believes "thousands and thousands" of these community entertainment hubs can be installed around the world.

However, some industry analysts are skeptical about the concept's viability and potential to generate billions in revenue. "People go to bars and restaurants primarily to spend time with friends, not play games or watch videos," said Harry Stanton, a media analyst with Digital Frontiers Media. He thinks the model may face challenges in attracting consistent, long-term users and engagement.
