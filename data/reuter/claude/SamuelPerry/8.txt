Silicon Valley Goes Political: Tech Executives and VCs Fight Against Threat to American Capitalism

Silicon Valley, long known for innovations that change the way we live and work, is taking on its most political fight yet, aiming to defend the foundation of its success: the free market. Tech leaders are criticizing calls from progressive politicians for more regulation of companies like Google and Facebook and higher taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations.  

Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said “the government needs to allow companies to be entrepreneurial or there will be no innovation,” arguing that proposals from prominent Democrats threaten the essence of what has made Silicon Valley great. Others in tech and venture capital have echoed this view, warning that policies such as breaking up tech companies, increasing regulations, and proposing wealth taxes could drastically weaken innovation in Silicon Valley.

Critics argue that companies including Google, Facebook, and Amazon have become too powerful, controlling sectors of the digital economy and accessing vast amounts of people's personal information with little oversight. Last year, Senator Elizabeth Warren proposed breaking up the largest tech companies, a policy that many thought could gain more mainstream support if she becomes president. Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has promised to levy new taxes on the wealthy and large corporations to reduce inequality in the country. 

The prospect of new regulations and limits on corporate power has tech executives going on the offense to defend their companies and push back against calls for change. “The innovation climate in the U.S. is at risk due to policy proposals that would make it more difficult for highly successful American companies to operate and thrive,” said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has faced heavy criticism over privacy issues and election interference on the platform.  

Venture capitalists, who fund tech startups and benefit greatly from deregulation and tax cuts, have also voiced opposition to the policy stances of some Democratic candidates. “Their proposals would stifle risk-taking and innovation,” said John Doerr of prominent VC firm Kleiner Perkins. Doerr helped fund tech giants like Google, Amazon and Netscape in their early days.

Tech companies argue their platforms have enabled economic opportunity and connectivity for millions of people and businesses. “In a capitalist system, success is the reward for innovation that leads to consumer benefits,” said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. “Regulation should encourage competition, not punish success.”

Of course, critics argue the massive influence and control exerted by companies like Google and Facebook requires oversight to prevent abuse and protect people's privacy and access to information. How to balance oversight and regulation with enabling innovation will likely remain a heated debate in the years to come. Silicon Valley is betting its futurology -- and fortunes -- on lighter regulation and lower taxes. But in an era of rising inequality and public scrutiny of corporate power, the tech world's vision may face its biggest threat yet.
