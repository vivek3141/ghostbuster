Netscape Communications Corp. Reports Record $100 Million Quarterly Revenue   

Netscape Communications Corp. announced record revenue of $100 million for the third quarter of 1995 today. The company beat analysts' expectations and showed strong growth in all areas of its business. Netscape's revenue was up 89% from $52.7 million in the same quarter last year. The company also reported net income of $11.7 million, or 20 cents per share, up from $3.4 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier.

Netscape's strong revenue and profit growth were driven primarily by sales of its flagship Netscape Navigator web browser and related enterprise products. Netscape Navigator now has over 60 million users worldwide, cementing its position as the leading web browser. Enterprise products, including web servers, also showed continued growth. Revenue from enterprise products grew to $23.6 million in the quarter, up from $4.2 million a year ago.

"We are very pleased with our exceptional performance this quarter," said Jim Barksdale, Netscape's President and CEO. "Netscape Navigator has become the de facto standard for experiencing and building the Internet. At the same time, we continue to gain momentum in the enterprise market by offering companies solutions to build web-based intranets and internets."

Netscape's growth comes as the overall Internet industry and web usage continue to expand rapidly. The company is well positioned to benefit from the ongoing growth of the Internet, both on the consumer and enterprise side. However, competition is also increasing. Microsoft recently released Internet Explorer 2.0 and has bundled it into the Windows 95 operating system. Netscape will need to continue enhancing its products and services to maintain its leadership position.

Analysts remain highly optimistic about Netscape's prospects given its stronghold on the browser market and growing enterprise business. The consensus on Wall Street is that Netscape will finish 1995 with over $350 million in revenue, nearly triple last year's total, and post its first annual profit. Barring any major surprises, Netscape looks poised to strengthen its lead as the company that commercialized the Internet. Overall, this quarter's results reinforce why Netscape remains one of the most closely watched companies of the Internet era.
