Microsoft Launches Electronic Commerce Software and Partner Network for Online Shopping

Microsoft today announced the launch of a new electronic commerce platform and partner network to enable online shopping. The e-commerce offering includes server software for retailers to build an online store, payments and security services, and a partner network of third-party providers to help with other parts of the shopping experience like shipping and fulfillment. 

The launch of the e-commerce platform, called Microsoft Commerce, comes as online shopping has accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many physical stores have been closed for months, pushing more consumers to make purchases via the internet. Microsoft aims to provide retailers with the tools to quickly build a customized online store and tap into new opportunities for digital sales.

“We built Microsoft Commerce to give our retail customers a complete e-commerce solution so they can provide amazing experiences for shoppers and run their businesses successfully in a digital world,” said Shelley Bransten, Microsoft Corporate Vice President of Global Retail and Consumer Goods. “By combining our secure, scalable cloud platform, productivity tools, and partner ecosystem, we’re enabling retailers to transform how they do business and build deeper customer relationships.”

At the heart of the offering is Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce, a software as a service platform for e-commerce including an online store, content management, and omnichannel capabilities that provide a consistent shopping experience across channels. Security features like multifactor authentication help safeguard customer accounts and transactions. And a built-in payments system lets customers check out quickly and pay with credit cards saved to their account.

Retailers can tap into additional services like fraud protection, personalized shopping experiences and fulfillment through the Microsoft Commerce Partner Network. Partners include payment processors like Stripe and fraud prevention companies like Accertify as well as fulfillment partners DHL, FedEx, and UPS. Retailers can connect to partners directly through APIs and pre-built integrations available in Microsoft AppSource.

“The ability to completely customize the platform and easily add new features and omnichannel capabilities with partner solutions makes Microsoft Commerce very attractive,” said Jill Standish, Senior Managing Director at Accenture. “Microsoft has assembled key components that retailers really need to accelerate their e-commerce business, especially given how much the industry has changed recently.”

The announcement shows Microsoft’s ambition to gain more customers in the retail industry, building on its Dynamics 365 enterprise software and Power Platform tools. At its recent Build developer conference, Microsoft highlighted several new technologies aimed at helping businesses boost e-commerce including on-by-default security and privacy features as well as “patterns and practices” for companies to improve the digital shopping experience. Microsoft said the new commerce platform and partner network will be available in early access this summer.
