Netscape Beats Expectations With Record $100 Million Quarterly Revenue 

Netscape Communications Corp. announced record revenue of $100 million for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 1996, beating analysts' expectations. The quarterly revenue represents a 38 percent increase over the $72 million reported for the same period last year. 

Net income for the quarter was $7.1 million, or 12 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $21.9 million, or 36 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had forecast earnings of 11 cents per share.

"Netscape finished 1996 with tremendous momentum, driven by growing demand for our integrated family of software and services," said James L. Barksdale, Netscape president and CEO. "The company is well positioned to extend its leadership in the coming year."

Netscape's strong fourth quarter was fueled by robust sales of software and services, especially enterprise sales. Revenue from enterprise software sales, which includes server products, nearly doubled to $36 million from $19 million in the year-ago quarter. Professional services revenue increased 90 percent to $14 million.

For the full year 1996, Netscape generated $346 million in revenue, up 40 percent from $247 million in 1995. The net loss for 1996 narrowed to $38 million, or 59 cents per share, from $92 million, or $1.54 per share, in 1995. 

Netscape's results demonstrate that the company has started to convert its large base of Internet users into paying enterprise customers. However, competition is intensifying in the enterprise arena. Microsoft has stepped up its challenge, bundling its Internet Explorer Web browser with its dominant Windows operating system at no additional charge. Netscape has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft over this and other issues, a case that is still pending.

Analysts remain optimistic about Netscape's outlook for 1997 given its market position and growing suite of enterprise software and services. Revenue is projected to grow another 25 to 30 percent this year. Profitability also continues to improve, indicating Netscape's increased operational efficiency and scalability. As long as Netscape continues to perform well, analysts expect its stock price to maintain solid growth in the coming year. Overall, the fourth quarter caps a pivotal year for Netscape as it transformed itself into a leading provider of software and services for business.
