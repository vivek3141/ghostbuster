California's High-Tech Companies Soar After Costly Ballot Proposal Defeated

Shares of California's biggest technology companies rose sharply yesterday after voters in the state soundly rejected a ballot proposal that would have imposed strict limits on the collection and use of personal data. The ballot initiative, Proposition 24, also known as The California Consumer Privacy Act 2.0., aimed to strengthen privacy protections for residents but was opposed by an unlikely partnership of tech companies, retailers, and utilities who spent over $50 million fighting the measure. 

The defeat of Proposition 24 was welcome news for many tech companies based in California who rely heavily on data collection and ad targeting to fuel their businesses. Stocks of Facebook, Google, and Snapchat all jumped over 5% in early trading as investors bet that the companies would avoid costly compliance burdens and maintain access to valuable user data and metrics. The ballot proposal would have crippled tech companies' advertising models and ability to personalize services, executives argued.

"We believe data can and should be used responsibly to benefit society," said Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, in a statement. "Proposition 24 would have limited companies' ability to use data to improve services and personalize experiences in a privacy-protective way."

Consumer privacy groups voiced disappointment at the election results, having hoped California would lead the way in reigning in what they see as abusive data practices. Under current law, tech companies face few restrictions on how they handle and distribute customer information as long as they disclose data policies to users. But most users pay little attention to lengthy privacy policies, effectively giving companies free rein.

"Big Tech won the day with their checkbooks, flooding the airwaves to confuse voters and undermine this movement," said Alastair Mactaggart, chair of Californians for Consumer Privacy, the group behind Proposition 24. "But this is only the beginning. Lawmakers must take up comprehensive privacy legislation immediately."

Despite the setback, there are signs the tide may be turning on data regulation worldwide. The European Union passed a strict privacy law called GDPR in 2018, and several U.S. states are considering bills to grant residents more control over their data. The California legislature is likely to take up privacy legislation in coming sessions to close loopholes in existing laws. But for now, Silicon Valley can breathe a sigh of relief that its data-fueled business models will stay intact. Overall, tech companies seem poised to continue their strong performance after defeating Proposition 24, though data regulation will remain an existential issue to watch.
