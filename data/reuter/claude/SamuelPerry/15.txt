High-Tech Stocks Soar After California Ballot Proposals Defeated  

Major technology stocks rallied today after California voters rejected a series of ballot proposals that were feared could curb growth in the high-tech industry. The votes signaled to investors that tech companies based in the state would avoid new regulations and costs associated with the proposals, at least for now.

Shares of companies with major operations in California jumped in early trading. Apple and Google stocks each rose more than 3%, while Facebook and Netflix gained more than 4% apiece. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index opened up nearly 2.5% as the sector breathed a sigh of relief.

The most closely watched proposal, Proposition 23, would have introduced new privacy regulations and allowed consumers to opt out of data collection by tech companies. The measure was defeated 58% to 42% after tech companies and industry groups spent heavily to oppose it.

Had Prop 23 passed, companies would have faced significant costs to update their data management systems and lost revenue from targeted advertising, analysts said. Its failure "lessens a major regulatory risk for the tech giants," said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities. 

Two other propositions affecting the tech industry also failed at the ballot. Proposition 21 would have made it easier for workers to be reclassified as employees rather than independent contractors, raising costs for companies like Uber and Lyft. And Proposition 25 would have repealed a state law preventing government agencies from adopting stricter regulations on autonomous vehicles.

California lawmakers have frequently proposed new rules and taxes on tech companies in recent years, arguing that legislation is needed to address issues like data privacy, misinformation, content moderation, and workplace conditions. The proposals are closely monitored in Silicon Valley because of the outsize impact of policy changes on tech's home state.
