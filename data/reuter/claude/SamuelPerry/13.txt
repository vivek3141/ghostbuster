Odwalla Inc. faces recall crisis and potential financial impact after E. coli outbreak linked to apple juice products 

Odwalla Inc., a major producer of fresh juices and smoothies, announced a full recall of its apple juice products today following reports of an E. coli outbreak that may be linked to the drinks. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 20 cases of E. coli-related illness across five states have been reported, with preliminary tests linking some of the cases to Odwalla's apple juice.

In response, Odwalla has halted production at its plant in Dinuba, California, and is recalling all apple juice products with "best by" dates between September 8 and October 11 of this year. Consumers are urged to dispose of any product falling within that range. Odwalla CEO Stephen Williamson issued a statement apologizing to customers and announcing that the company is working closely with the FDA and CDC to investigate the issue. 

The recall and plant shutdown are expected to cost Odwalla at least $6 million, according to company estimates. Odwalla's stock price plunged over 25% on the news, as investors reacted to the financial implications and potential damage to the brand. With annual revenue exceeding $350 million, Odwalla is a subsidiary of Coca-Cola and a major force in the fresh juice category. However, according to one market analyst, "This recall could really hurt sales and scare away customers, at least for the short term. Fresh juice is a premium product, and people today are wary of safety issues."

Odwalla is not the first fresh juice company to be linked to foodborne illness. In 1996, a similar E coli outbreak tied to Odwalla's apple juice led to a four-state recall and the death of a 16-month-old child. That outbreak forced Odwalla to overhaul its safety practices and flash pasteurize its juices to control bacteria growth. Odwalla will likely face increased scrutiny from regulators about its food safety compliance and quality control efforts given this second outbreak in three years involving the same product.

The recall is ongoing, and consumers should check the company's website for the latest updates and specific products, dates, and regions affected. As of now, no deaths have been reported in this outbreak, but five patients have developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a form of kidney failure. Odwalla and health officials continue to warn at-risk populations like young children, elderly consumers, or those with weakened immune systems to avoid consuming any Odwalla apple juice until further notice.
