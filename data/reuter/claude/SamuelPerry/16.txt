Hewlett-Packard Set to Unveil New Device to Bypass the Copy Machine 

Hewlett-Packard, one of the world's largest technology companies, announced today that it will unveil a new digital scanning and printing device aimed at reducing the need for copy machines in offices. The company said its new "HP Instant Scan and Print" system can scan documents and instantly print out copies at the touch of a button.

The device, about the size of a typical laser printer, contains an integrated document scanner and a high-volume inkjet printer. Employees can place up to 50 double-sided pages into the machine's document feeder. With the press of the "Copy" button, the machine scans all the pages and automatically prints the requested number of copies. 

HP said the new device can scan and print up to 100 pages per minute, faster than most copy machines currently used in offices. The resolution of 1200 by 1200 dots per inch produces print quality that rivals laser printers. Connected to a company's network and printing system, the device can scan documents and distribute digital copies to multiple printers around an office.  

"HP Instant Scan and Print will disrupt the traditional copy machine market and fundamentally transform how businesses approach scanning and printing," said Anantha Desikan, HP's head of Enterprise Imaging and Printing. "This is a true breakthrough device that will save companies time, money, and space with an all-in-one system for digitizing and copying documents."

The device runs on a solid-state flash memory system and does not require frequently replacing toner cartridges, as copy machines do. HP said the inkjet refills, with enough ink for up to 50,000 pages, cost 80% less than toner cartridges. The machine is also equipped with HP's noise-reduction technology which minimizes the sound historically associated with high-speed inkjet printers.

Several companies participated in a pilot test of the HP Instant Scan and Print system. They reported saving up to $8,000 a month in copy costs and reduced up to 95% of their copy machine usage. They also cited improved productivity from a faster, more efficient system and less waste from fewer faulty or jammed copies.  

HP did not announce pricing for the new device but said it would save companies money over their current copy infrastructure. The HP Instant Scan and Print system will be available for order next month and ships starting January 2021. Whether this new technology succeeds in bypassing the traditional copy machine altogether, it appears poised to transform how offices approach digital scanning and high-volume printing.
