Wired Magazine IPO: A Better Read Than Investment?

Venerable technology and culture publication Wired is planning an initial public offering to take the company public. Wired Media, the parent company that owns Wired magazine, Wired.com, and other media properties, filed a registration statement with the SEC this week to raise up to $100 million by issuing stock for the first time.

The IPO is a culmination of a long journey for the iconic magazine, which was founded in 1993 to chronicle the rise of the internet. The magazine gained fame for its ahead-of-the-curve coverage of emerging technologies and Silicon Valley. Under the leadership of founding editor Kevin Kelly, Wired emerged as the voice of the first dot-com boom and build a devoted following among tech enthusiasts, futurists, and venture capitalists. 

However, the dot-com bust in the early 2000s hit Wired's advertising revenue hard and nearly bankrupted the company. Wired was sold twice over the following decade, first to Conde Nast and then to Mansueto Ventures. Under new leadership, Wired transitioned into a multi-platform media company, expanding into events, podcasts, and building a successful digital subscription business. The moves have allowed Wired to diversify its revenue streams beyond the volatile advertising model.

Wired's cultural cachet and lean new business model have set the stage for its IPO. However, investors should exercise caution, according to some experts. "Wired's brand and content are beloved, but magazine publishing remains a challenging business with many headwinds," said Amy Balfany, a media analyst at PitchBook. "An IPO isn't a magic bullet, and Wired will face pressure to continue adapting to shifts in media and advertising to drive consistent revenue growth over the long run."

Wired generated $82 million in revenue in 2020, with two-thirds coming from advertising and one-third from subscriptions and other sources. However, the company remains unprofitable, losing $3 million last year. The proceeds from the IPO would be used to pay down debt, invest in new product offerings, and pursue acquisitions to expand the business.

Wired's cultural influence has endured, but whether its business model can thrive as a public company is an open question. Investors tempted by nostalgia for Wired's glory days should look carefully at the company's prospects before buying shares. For many loyal readers, an occasional trip to the newsstand to flip through the glossy pages of the magazine may continue to offer the best return on investment.
