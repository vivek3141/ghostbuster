Hewlett-Packard Launches New Line of "Mopier" Printers to Challenge Copier Giants Like Xerox  

Technology titan Hewlett-Packard today announced a new line of multifunction office printers aimed at taking market share away from major copier companies such as Xerox and Canon. The new "mopier" printers, as HP calls them, can print, copy, scan, and fax large volumes at high speeds, combining the capabilities of a printer, copier, and fax machine into a single device.

HP launched six new mopier models today ranging in speed from 35 to 100 pages per minute with prices starting at $10,000. The printers allow offices to cut costs by reducing the number of devices needed and streamlining the workflow, according to HP. The mopiers can handle high-volume print jobs of up to 100,000 pages per month, putting them in direct competition with dedicated copiers from companies like Xerox and Ricoh that have dominated the copier market.

“Our new mopier printers deliver the power, simplicity and affordability that every high-volume office needs,” said Enrique Lores, President of HP's Imaging, Printing and Solutions business. “With this launch, HP is disrupting the traditional copier market by bringing breakthrough design, leadership security and optimize services that put businesses in control of their costs and workflows.” HP says its mopiers have a lower cost of ownership over a typical five-year lease than traditional copiers.

Xerox and other copier makers are likely to face pressure on profit margins and market share with HP's renewed push into the copier space. In response to HP's announcement today, a Xerox spokesperson said, "Xerox continues to lead the market in offering secure, managed print and multifunction technology solutions. We are confident in our strategy and welcome new competition, which only helps customers by accelerating innovation and providing more choice."

The mopier launch comes as HP doubles down on its printing business under new CEO Enrique Lores, who took over in November. The company is working to fend off competition from younger startups making affordable home printers as well as boost growth in the market for high-volume commercial printers where there are more opportunities for sales of supplies and services. HP aims to disrupt the $55 billion global market for copiers, printers, and supplies, especially in light of recent declines in demand for consumer printers.
