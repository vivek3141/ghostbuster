Meredith Corp CEO Plans Acquisition in 1997 Due to Dropping TV Station Prices

Meredith Corporation CEO William Kerr announced plans today to acquire additional television stations in 1997 to take advantage of dropping prices in the TV station market. Meredith currently owns a dozen TV stations, reaching about 10% of U.S. households. 

"The prices of television stations have declined over 25% from their peak in the early 1990s," noted Kerr. "We have set aside $500 million for strategic acquisitions, and with prices at historic lows, now is an ideal time to buy. Our strong balance sheet and robust cash flow allow us to act on this opportunity."

The decline in TV station prices is due to several factors. Changes in Federal Communications Commission regulations have allowed greater consolidation and ownership of multiple TV stations within a market. This has reduced competition and bargaining power for station owners. Additionally, the expansion of cable and satellite television has fragmented the market, reducing ratings and ad revenue for local TV stations.  

Meredith aims to target TV stations in medium to small markets, especially in the South and Midwest. The company already owns stations in cities like Atlanta, Phoenix, Kansas City, and Hartford, with a mix of affiliates of all the major networks like ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox. According to Kerr, Meredith looks to maintain a balance of different network affiliates in its portfolio.

Meredith also publishes Better Homes and Gardens, Parents, and other home and lifestyle magazines. The company has pursued a "total media" strategy of linking its print content and brands to its local TV stations and websites. Meredith plans to boost this cross-promotion across media platforms with any newly acquired stations.

The TV station acquisition strategy carries some risks, however. Although prices have dropped recently, many analysts think the decline may be near a bottom. Interest rates have also risen in the past year, increasing the cost of financing large deals. And owning a larger group of TV stations means the company's fortunes are tied more closely to the volatile broadcast industry. Revenue depends heavily on advertising, which can fluctuate with the economic cycle.

Nonetheless, Kerr remains optimistic about growth prospects for the local TV market.  “Even with more media options, well-run local TV stations that produce quality local content will continue to attract strong viewership and advertiser interest over the long run,” he said. If that prediction proves correct, Meredith’s plan to snap up more TV stations on the cheap could turn out to be a shrewd move that fuels future gains.
