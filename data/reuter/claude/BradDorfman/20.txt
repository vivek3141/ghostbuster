Holiday Shopping Off to a Brisk Start, Boosting Retail Sales Projections for November

Retailers reported higher in-store and online traffic over the Thanksgiving holiday shopping weekend, leading analysts to revise upward their forecasts for U.S. retail sales in November. Several major retailers said sales rose at a healthy pace over the weekend compared with a year earlier, signaling consumers remain resilient despite economic uncertainty and may be in a mood to spend this holiday season.

Shoppers visited stores and shopped online at a brisk pace from Thanksgiving through Sunday, the start of the critical holiday shopping season. Total retail sales for the November-December holiday period are expected to rise about 4 percent from a year earlier to $730 billion, according to the National Retail Federation, an industry group. The forecast is up from the group’s initial projection last month of a 3.8 percent gain.  The uptick comes as consumer sentiment and spending have held up well recently despite slower economic growth.

“There is a lot of spending momentum right now,” said Jack Kleinhenz, the NRF’s chief economist. “The economy and consumers are in a good place, and retailers are ready to offer good deals and capture sales this holiday season.”

Spending over the Thanksgiving weekend, which includes Black Friday and Cyber Monday, is closely watched as a bellwether for the overall holiday shopping season. Shoppers boosted sales at stores and online this year compared with a year ago, retailers said, though some cautioned that profits could be squeezed due to heavy promotions and discounts. Department stores like Macy's Inc. and off-price retailers including TJX Cos., parent of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, reported higher customer traffic and sales.  Target Corp. said sales and traffic grew across channels, with the strongest growth in toys, baby products, and electronics.

The Thanksgiving weekend results boosted optimism about holiday spending, even as the shorter season—there are six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year compared with last year — poses challenges for retailers. The National Retail Federation last week raised its forecast for holiday retail sales growth to between 3.8 percent and 4.2 percent from 3.7 percent to 4.5 percent.
