H&R Block Struggles to Spin Off CompuServe as Online Service Weighs on Performance

H&R Block, the tax preparation company, announced plans today to spin off its CompuServe online service division in an effort to boost the company's lagging stock price. The spinoff comes as CompuServe's shrinking subscriber base and declining revenue have become a drag on H&R Block's overall financial performance. 

CompuServe was founded in 1969 as one of the first commercial online services, offering email, chat rooms, and online shopping to consumers. H&R Block acquired CompuServe in 1996 for $1.5 billion, betting that the rise of the Internet would fuel growth in the online service. However, the popularity of free internet service providers like AOL and MSN quickly undercut CompuServe's subscription model. CompuServe's subscriber numbers and revenue peaked in the mid-1990s and have declined steadily since.

"CompuServe was an innovative pioneer, but the market has changed dramatically since we acquired it," said H&R Block CEO Jeff Jones. "It no longer fits with our tax and personal finance focus. The spinoff will allow both companies to pursue growth strategies tailored to their industries."

In its most recent quarter, CompuServe lost $23 million in revenue and reported just 350,000 subscribers, down from over 3 million at its peak. The spinoff announcement drove H&R Block shares up nearly 6% in after-hours trading as investors anticipated the company's shift to focus on its core tax preparation business.

To complete the spinoff, H&R Block will distribute shares of CompuServe to existing H&R Block shareholders, making CompuServe an independent, publicly traded company. The new CompuServe will also take on $300 million in debt as part of the deal. CompuServe CEO Michael Pearson, who took over in January, has announced plans to transition CompuServe to a free service to drive subscriber growth and explore new sources of revenue like targeted advertising.

The spinoff of CompuServe is the latest in a line of shakeups at H&R Block under Jones, who took over as CEO in 2017. Jones has closed underperforming retail tax offices, cut costs, and revamped H&R Block's digital tax services to reinvigorate growth. Detaching from the flagging CompuServe brand is another attempt by Jones to sharpen H&R Block's focus as it navigates challenges in the tax industry from online competitors like Intuit's TurboTax.
