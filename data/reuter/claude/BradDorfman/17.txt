Shoppers Brave Early Morning Lines to Kick Off Holiday Shopping Season 

Hundreds of eager shoppers descended on major retailers nationwide early Friday morning to take advantage of doorbuster deals and officially kick off the holiday shopping season. Outside retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart, shoppers arrived as early as midnight to queue up for Black Friday sales that began between 3 and 5 am. 

At a Best Buy in Columbus, Ohio, over 500 people waited in line for the store to open at 5 am. Deals on big-screen TVs, laptops, and gaming consoles drove many to brave the brisk 28-degree temperatures. “I’m here for the 65-inch TV that’s $500 off,” said Todd Michaels, who arrived at 3 am to secure his place at the front of the line. “It’s worth losing a few hours of sleep to save that kind of money.”

Big-box stores have been pushing holiday deals earlier and earlier, with some launching “pre-Black Friday” sales as early as October. “Customers have shown they want to shop earlier for big holiday deals,” said J.C. Penney CEO Jill Soltau. “Opening stores on Thanksgiving and offering our deepest Black Friday discounts earlier allows customers to shop when and how they want and ensures they won't miss out on the best deals of the year.”  The competition to offer the biggest doorbusters and earliest sale start times is fierce among major chains.

Not all stores opened on Thanksgiving this year, however. For the third year in a row, sporting goods chain REI opted to remain closed on Thanksgiving and instead urged people to #OptOutside. “While many of our competitors are opening their doors on Thanksgiving, we are choosing to close ours,” said REI CEO Jerry Stritzke. “Black Friday deals are not going anywhere. We invite you to join REI in enjoying time outside this Thanksgiving.”

The holiday shopping season is critical for retailers, with sales in November and December often determining whether chains end the year in the black or not. The National Retail Federation expects over 165 million people to shop in stores and online over the five-day Thanksgiving weekend, with total spending predicted to reach $730 billion this year. While in-store foot traffic was steady in many locations, online sales also surged, as mobile platforms made it easy to compare deals and make purchases from anywhere. Overall, the early results seem to indicate a successful start to the season, much to the relief of retailers across the country.
