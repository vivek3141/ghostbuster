H&R Block Inc. Reports Big Loss in Latest Quarter Due to CompuServe Struggles  

H&R Block Inc. reported a net loss in its fiscal fourth quarter as its CompuServe Internet service unit continued to struggle.

The Kansas City, Mo.-based tax preparer, which announced in June that it was putting CompuServe up for sale, posted a net loss of $41.2 million, or 30 cents a share, for the quarter ended July 31, compared with net income of $12.8 million, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 13% to $421.3 million.

The results included a $49.8 million operating loss at CompuServe, mostly related to a restructuring of the online unit. CompuServe has failed to gain traction against larger rivals America Online Inc. and Microsoft Corp.'s MSN service. H&R Block said last month that it took a $405.2 million charge to restructure CompuServe.

Excluding the charge and other one-time items, H&R Block would have earned $15.3 million, or 11 cents a share, matching the average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call. Revenue exceeded analysts' projections of $409.4 million. 

H&R Block shares fell $1.1875 to $33 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading Tuesday. The shares have fallen 15% since the start of the year amid concerns over how much the company may have to lower the asking price for CompuServe to attract buyers.

Chief Executive Officer Mark Ernst said the quarter's results showed "solid progress" in H&R Block's core tax business, as revenue from tax preparation and related services climbed 18%. The company prepared 15.6 million tax returns in fiscal 2000, up from 14.4 million a year earlier.

Still, tax operations only partly offset CompuServe's troubles. The online unit's revenue tumbled 26% to $115.5 million as it lost 303,000 subscribers during the quarter and was left with 2 million subscribers at the end of July.
