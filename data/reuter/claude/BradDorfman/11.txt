McDonnell Douglas Stock Tumbles as Company Loses Race to Build New Generation Fighter Jet  

Shares of McDonnell Douglas plunged more than 20% today after the Pentagon announced that rival Lockheed Martin had won the lucrative contract to build America's next-generation fighter jet. The Joint Strike Fighter program, valued at more than $400 billion over its lifetime, is the largest defense program in history.   

McDonnell Douglas had teamed up with Boeing and several other major contractors in an attempt to win the contract to build the fighter jet, which will eventually replace F-16s, F/A-18s, and AV-8B Harrier jets in the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. However, after a heated competition, the Pentagon awarded the entire contract to Lockheed Martin, dealing a huge blow to McDonnell Douglas and raising questions about the future of the company.

“We are deeply disappointed with the Pentagon's decision,” said McDonnell Douglas CEO Harry Stonecipher in a statement. “Our team was confident we had submitted the best design at the best price. We will have to evaluate how we can move forward from here.” The loss of the Joint Strike Fighter contract puts tremendous pressure on McDonnell Douglas as it struggles to diversify beyond its traditional military aircraft business. The company's stock price has lagged the broader market in recent years due to shrinking defense budgets and a lack of new programs to replace aging product lines.

Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Maryland, vaulted to the top of the global aerospace industry today on news of its victory. The company's stock price jumped nearly 10 percent on the announcement as investors bet that the fighter program will drive growth and profits for decades. Lockheed Martin Chairman and CEO Norman Augustine called the win "a pivotal moment" that "secures our leadership in the 21st century." The company expects the Joint Strike Fighter to generate more than $1 trillion in economic impact over the life of the program, which could run through 2070.
