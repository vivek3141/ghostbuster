Security First Network Bank Expands to Physical Locations in Effort to Build Customer Confidence and Expand Market Reach 

Security First Network Bank, one of the nation's largest purely online banks, today announced plans to open 100 physical bank branch locations over the next three years. The move marks a significant strategic shift for the digital bank that has operated without any physical branch locations since its founding in 2009.

The decision to move into physical retail locations follows flatline growth in online customer accounts over the past 12 months, according to company executives. The lack of physical locations has often been cited as a barrier to entry for some customers who prefer face-to-face banking relationships. Security First believes physical branches will help build trust and confidence among a wider customer base, especially older consumers and small business owners.

"We've built a successful online bank for over 10 years with a focus on technology, innovation and highly competitive rates," said Melissa Richards, CEO of Security First Network Bank. "However, we're at an inflection point where we believe having a physical retail footprint will allow us to markedly expand our customer base by appealing to new segments of the market and enhancing the customer experience for all members." 

The new branch locations will provide full-service banking including openings deposits and withdrawals, loan applications, account openings, and investment services. However, customers will still be encouraged to conduct routine transactions using the bank's digital tools, including mobile check deposits, online bill pay, ATM transactions, and chatbot services. According to Richards, the "human touch" of physical branches will be complemented by continued technology innovation.

"We see this as the best of both worlds for our customers - a blend of physical locations for in-person service along with a state-of-the-art digital banking platform," Richards said. The bank plans to open its first 20 to 30 locations over the next nine months, with additional locations rolling out over the subsequent two years. Branch locations will be concentrated in several metro areas in the U.S., though specific sites have not yet been announced.

The shift into physical branches is a bold move for the digital bank and signals more traditional banks may struggle to keep up with demand for modern banking options, according to industry analysts. Combining physical and digital services in one institution could give Security First a competitive advantage. However, the expansion also presents risks as the bank has little experience in operating physical locations. Security First will need to effectively manage costs to avoid eroding its competitive position as an efficient, low-cost banking provider. Overall though, analysts view this strategic move as a positive to broaden market reach, build brand awareness and enhance the customer experience.
