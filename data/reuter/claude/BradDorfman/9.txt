Olympic Financial Ltd expects to sell company by October 

Olympic Financial Ltd, a mid-sized investment and wealth management firm based in London, announced today that it expects to finalize a sale of the company by October this year. Speaking to investors and media, CEO Michael Thompson said "We have received strong interest from several major players in the financial services industry and we are currently evaluating offers to determine the best path forward for our shareholders, clients, and employees."

The company has been exploring strategic options over the past several months, including a potential sale. Olympic Financial has seen solid growth in recent years but faces increasing competition from digital startups and larger established firms. A sale to a bigger industry player could provide additional resources and scale to accelerate the company's growth. 

According to sources familiar with the process, Olympic Financial's asking price is between $450 to $500 million. At that valuation, a deal could provide a significant premium for shareholders. The stock price has climbed over 25% this year on takeover speculation.

Two of the most likely buyers are said to be British investment giants Aberdeen Standard Investments and Schroders. Aberdeen is looking to expand its wealth management business to balance its traditional focus on institutional asset management. Schroders has a fast-growing UK wealth management unit and Olympic Financial would provide additional scale and expertise. Neither company would comment on "market speculation" regarding a potential deal.

Some analysts think a foreign buyer is also possible, especially from the United States or Switzerland. However, CEO Michael Thompson has previously stated a preference for a domestic takeover to ensure continuity for clients and minimal disruption to the business. 

For now, Olympic Financial remains focused on business as usual according to Thompson. "Until a deal is signed, we will continue to deliver innovative products and outstanding service to our loyal clients as an independent company," he said. But with several suitors and a self-imposed deadline, the days of Olympic Financial's independence may be numbered. The next few months will determine the fate of this growing financial advisory firm.
