Mercantile Bancorp Inc remains a potential buyout target in Missouri bank merger wave 

Mercantile Bancorp Inc., a St. Louis-based regional bank with $3.2 billion in assets, remains a potential acquisition target as bank mergers accelerate across Missouri. Mercantile has in recent years been the subject of merger speculation, and with larger regional peers recently announcing deals, analysts say it may only be a matter of time before Mercantile is in play.

Last week, Simmons Bank agreed to purchase Landmark Bank of Missouri for $500 million in stock, marking the sixth bank merger in the state this year. The deal follows on the heels of Oklahoma-based BancFirst Corp.’s $100 million all-cash deal for Pedestal Bankshares Inc. and Equity Bank’s $58 million acquisition of Adams Dairy Bank.

Mercantile would represent the largest target in Missouri should it agree to a deal. The company operates 31 branches across eastern Missouri and has posted consistent loan and revenue growth over the past several years. However, its small size relative to major regional and national players, as well limited geographic reach, has prompted speculation that an eventual sale is inevitable if it wants to continue to grow and gain scale.

“Mercantile remains one of the most attractive merger and acquisition candidates in the Midwest,” said Ryan Rhinesmith, bank analyst at investment bank Stephens Inc. “Given the recent deals in Missouri and surrounding states, increasing competition, and the push for scale, Mercantile may soon have to choose between buying, being bought, or struggling to remain independent.”

Shares of Mercantile are up 12% so far this year, trading recently at $38.75 and giving the company a market capitalization of $475 million. Earnings per share have compounded at a 12% annual growth rate over the past five years. In the first quarter of this year, Mercantile posted earnings of $0.97 per share, beating analyst estimates, on the back of strong 10% loan growth and a 20-basis-point expansion of its net interest margin from a year earlier.

While Mercantile management has expressed a desire to remain independent, the choice may eventually be out of its hands if an attractive enough offer from a larger peer comes along. Industry consolidation shows no signs of slowing, and for Mercantile, that could mean its days of independence are numbered. Overall, Mercantile Bancorp appears to remain a compelling potential addition for any major bank looking to expand in the Midwest.
