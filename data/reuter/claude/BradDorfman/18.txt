Malls See Double-Digit Sales Increase on Black Friday with Creative Tactics to Attract Shoppers This Holiday Season

Holiday shoppers turned out in droves on Black Friday as major mall operators reported double-digit sales increases compared to last year. The strong turnout was fueled by aggressive marketing campaigns, deep discounts, and innovative new tactics to draw crowds. 

Simon Property Group, the largest owner of shopping malls in the U.S., said its sales rose 14% on Black Friday compared to 2018. The company attributed the strong performance to its marketing blitz in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving as well as the introduction of extended shopping hours, opening as early as 5 am.  “Our malls were buzzing with activity from the moment we opened the doors,” said David Simon, CEO of Simon Property Group. “The energy has been electric as shoppers are eager to find deals on gifts for their loved ones.”

Macerich, which owns 52 shopping centers across the country, reported an 11% increase in sales. The company focused its efforts this year on providing amenities and services to make the shopping experience more enjoyable and hassle-free.  “We want to give people more reasons to get out and shop at our malls, so we’re introducing new amenities like lounges, charging stations, play areas for kids, and lots of seating areas where people can rest,” said Tom O’Hern, CEO of Macerich.  The company also organized gift-wrapping stations, product demonstrations, and musicians and entertainers to create a festive atmosphere.

Not all retailers benefited equally, however. While large department stores and apparel chains saw strong gains, some smaller retailers struggled.  “Foot traffic seemed solid, but consumers appeared very targeted in where they shopped,” said Mark Hunter, chief executive of footwear brand Cole Haan.  “They went directly for the biggest discounts and promotions. That was challenging for smaller brands trying to compete.” 

Retail analysts warn that sales gains on Black Friday may not sustain through the rest of the holiday season.  “The frenzy of Black Friday makes it easy to get swept up in the hype, but consumers only have so much to spend each year,” said Barbara Kahn, retail expert at The Wharton School.  “While sales were strong for now, the real test will be whether shoppers continue spending at similar levels in December or pull back.”

Despite the uncertainty, mall owners and retailers remain optimistic heading into the heart of the holiday season.  “There’s a good spirit among shoppers so far,” Simon said.  “If we continue providing good value and a rewarding experience, I’m hopeful we’ll see solid sales continuing on through Christmas and New Year’s.”   The upcoming weeks will reveal whether that optimism is warranted or whether Black Friday’s boost in sales was merely a temporary sugar high.
