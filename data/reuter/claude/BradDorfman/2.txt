Trans World Airlines Inc. in Search of New CEO to Navigate Troubled Waters 

Trans World Airlines Inc., one of the oldest commercial airlines in the U.S., is on the hunt for a new chief executive officer to help turn around the struggling company. TWA posted an operating loss of $43 million in the second quarter and its stock price has declined over 25% this year. The current CEO, Carl Strubes, has announced his retirement at the end of the year following a 45-year career with TWA.

TWA was once an industry leader and pioneer, launching the first transatlantic flight in 1946 and building terminals at major airports like John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and London Heathrow Airport. However, increased competition from low-cost carriers, a series of crippling strikes in the 1980s, high debt levels, and struggles modernizing its fleet have battered the company over the past few decades. TWA has not recorded an annual profit since 1988 and reduced its workforce by over 60% since 1998 in a bid to cut costs. 

The new CEO will face significant headwinds in returning TWA to profitability and growth. The airline needs to restructure and reduce its $1.2 billion of long-term debt to achieve a more sustainable capital structure. TWA also requires investments in newer aircraft to improve operating efficiency and match competitors, as its fleet is over 18 years old on average—one of the oldest in the U.S. aviation industry. Expanding TWA’s limited route network and partnerships with other airlines could help capture new bookings and win back customers.

However, analysts remain skeptical about TWA’s turnaround prospects given its weak balance sheet and competitive pressures. “TWA's challenges have been decades in the making and will not be easy to overcome even with a change at the top,” said Henry Chambers, an airline analyst at investment bank Cowen. “The new CEO will likely have an uphill battle and difficult decisions to make to put TWA on a sustainable path, if it’s [sic] possible at all.”

The search for a new CEO is expected to take several months. TWA’s board of directors has formed a search committee and hired an executive recruiting firm to evaluate both internal and external candidates. Whomever the board chooses will need to act quickly upon taking the reins at TWA to ensure the storied airline survives well into the future. With 98 years of history, TWA continues to hold an important place in American aviation—but its next chapter is still unwritten.
