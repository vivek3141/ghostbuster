ABN AMRO to Acquire Standard Federal Bancorp for $1.9 Billion, Becoming Eighth Largest Mortgage Originator in the United States   

ABN AMRO Bank N.V., one of the largest banks in the Netherlands, announced today that it has agreed to acquire Standard Federal Bancorp Inc., a leading U.S. mortgage lender and servicer, for $1.9 billion in an all-cash deal. The acquisition will vault ABN AMRO to become the eighth largest mortgage originator in the United States, further diversifying the bank’s business outside of Europe.  

Standard Federal, based in Troy, Michigan, is a major U.S. mortgage banking company with over $34 billion in mortgages serviced as of June 30. The company originates, sells, and services residential mortgage loans through 39 offices in 13 states. In the first half of 2019, Standard Federal originated $10.9 billion in mortgages, a 13% increase from the same period last year.  

“This acquisition will accelerate our growth strategy in the U.S. and provide significant scale in the world’s largest mortgage market,” said Kees van Dijkhuizen, CEO of ABN AMRO. “Standard Federal is an excellent strategic and cultural fit for ABN AMRO. They have a long track record of strong performance, underpinned by a client-centric business model and prudent risk management.”

The acquisition is the latest in a series of deals that have expanded ABN AMRO’s presence in North America. In 2005, the bank acquired Chicago-based LaSalle Bank for $21 billion. ABN AMRO has also built up its private banking, asset management, and commercial banking businesses in the U.S. and Canada over the past decade through smaller acquisitions and organic growth.

For ABN AMRO, the U.S. mortgage market represents an opportunity for growth as interest rates have stabilized and the housing market continues to strengthen in many regions. The bank believes Standard Federal’s operations can benefit from ABN AMRO’s scale and resources to drive further improvements in efficiency, productivity, and customer experience. 

Standard Federal’s employees and management team will join ABN AMRO and continue to focus on the residential mortgage business. “We are proud to be joining forces with ABN AMRO, an iconic institution with a strong commitment to both its clients and employees,” said Jeffrey Buron, CEO of Standard Federal. “This transaction will provide greater resources and opportunities for our company and will be beneficial for both our clients and team members.”

The deal is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020. ABN AMRO was advised by Morgan Stanley, while Standard Federal was advised by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Shares of Standard Federal surged 42% on the news, to their highest level in over a decade.
