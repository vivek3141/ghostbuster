McDonnell Douglas Considers Mergers and Acquisitions After Being Eliminated from Fighter Jet Race Worth $200 Billion   

McDonnell Douglas Corp., the major U.S. defense contractor, is exploring mergers and acquisitions after losing out on a high-stakes fighter jet competition announced by the Defense Department last week. The $200 billion contract to build the next generation Joint Strike Fighter went to Lockheed Martin and Boeing, eliminating McDonnell Douglas from the coveted deal that promises decades of revenue. 

In the wake of the disappointing loss, McDonnell Douglas's CEO Harry Stonecipher acknowledged the company would have to look at strategic alternatives to remain competitive in the shrinking defense sector. “Being left out of this program creates a major gap in our projected revenue and operational capacity over the next 20 to 25 years,” Stonecipher said in a call with analysts. “We have to determine how we fill that gap, whether through mergers, acquisitions, internal investments in new programs, or diversifying into non-defense sectors.”

McDonnell Douglas has long been one of the nation's leading defense contractors, producing such iconic military aircraft as the F-15 Eagle and the DC-10 over its storied history. However, the industry has been consolidating in recent decades and the Joint Strike Fighter competition was seen as pivotal for McDonnell Douglas's future. The company had teamed up with Lockheed Martin and invested heavily in developing a variant of the new fighter jet. Losing the bid is a blow that calls into question McDonnell Douglas's ability to continue operating as an independent company.  

Potential partners for mergers or acquisitions include other mid-sized defense firms like Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics, as well as leading aerospace companies with military divisions such as Boeing. However, regulatory approval for such deals can be challenging, and McDonnell Douglas would likely have to accept a diminished role in the partnership. Some analysts argue the company should diversify further into space and commercial aviation to mitigate its overreliance on military programs. But that diversification would take many years and significant capital investment. 

McDonnell Douglas's stock plunged nearly 25% on the news it had lost the fighter jet competition. The sharp drop reflects investors' worries about the company's future in the absence of a major defense franchise like the Joint Strike Fighter. Stonecipher said all options were on the table, but time may be short for such a pivotal decision. Whatever path McDonnell Douglas chooses, its decades-long legacy as an independent maker of world-class military aircraft appears to be coming to an end. The era of the big three defense contractors—McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed Martin and Boeing—will likely give way to a landscape dominated by two larger companies that have secured their places in building the next generation of combat aircraft. McDonnell Douglas's fate now hangs in the balance as it works to salvage what remains of its storied history.
