Mercantile Bancorp Inc. Open to Further Acquisitions Despite Pending $855 Million Merger with Mark Twain Bancshares Inc. 

Mercantile Bancorp Inc. announced today that it remains open to further bank acquisitions even as it works to complete its pending $855 million merger with Mark Twain Bancshares Inc. The deal, announced in January, would create the largest bank in the Midwest with over $50 billion in assets and more than 450 branch locations across 10 states.

In an interview, Mercantile CEO John Smith said the bank continues to look for opportunities to expand in attractive markets. "While we are fully committed to completing the Mark Twain merger, which will strengthen our franchise and create value for shareholders, we will not stop pursuing other opportunities to strategically deploy capital and drive growth," Smith said.

Smith noted Mercantile is particularly interested in acquisitions in states where it currently has limited or no presence, such as Colorado, Arizona and Florida. The bank is looking at deals ranging from $500 million to $3 billion in assets as a way to gain immediate scale in new markets. "We have a proven ability to execute deals and integrate targets efficiently and effectively," said Smith. "We aim to leverage that experience and aggressively but prudently expand into some of the fastest growing markets in the country."

The comments come as Mercantile works through the regulatory approval process for its acquisition of Mark Twain, which operates in Missouri, Illinois and Indiana. The deal, which is expected to close in early 2020, will boost Mercantile's assets by nearly 25% and expand its branch network by over 30%. Mark Twain shareholders will receive 1.37 shares of Mercantile stock for each Mark Twain share, valuing the target at $39.28 per share, a 20% premium to its share price before the deal was announced.

While further acquisitions could weigh on Mercantile's capital levels and share price in the short term, analysts say the strategy makes sense given the bank's history of successful integrations and the opportunities for cost savings and revenue growth. "If they can get good value, Mercantile has shown the ability to acquire and integrate banks in a way that is accretive to earnings and builds shareholder value over the long run," said James Wilkins, an analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods. Mercantile's stock is up 18% year to date.
