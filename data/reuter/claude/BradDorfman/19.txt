Holiday Shopping Boosts Retail Sales, Positive Earnings Expected for Store Chains  

Retail sales rose at the fastest pace in five years during the holiday 2019 shopping season, giving store chains reason to expect strong fourth-quarter earnings. Retail sales grew 4.2% between November and December compared with last year, according to Mastercard's SpendingPulse report. The gains were led by a strong surge in e-commerce as online sales climbed 19.2% compared with 2018.

The strong sales numbers suggest American consumers kept spending at a steady clip through the holidays despite concerns of a slowing economy. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, so the increase is a positive sign for the nation's continued expansion.  

"Retailers are having a very green Christmas as consumers were willing to spend during the 2019 holiday season," said Rod Sides, vice chairman with Deloitte. 

Store chains entered the holidays with some uncertainty given lackluster sales for big retailers like Walmart, Target, and Kohl's earlier in the fall. But the strong holiday sales gains will likely translate to increased earnings and profits for chains as most make the bulk of their annual revenue during the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Overall, earnings for retailers in the S&P 500 will rise 2.2% for the fourth quarter, according to data from FactSet.

“Retail sales were strong from Cyber Monday through early December, so we expect the traditional holiday winners like Amazon, Best Buy, Costco, and Walmart to report strong numbers in January with reduced concern for inventory issues,” said Alvin Kammer, retail analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald. 

While ecommerce led the gains, traditional brick-and-mortar stores also reported strong sales with department stores up 3.3% and clothing stores climbing 4.4%. Luxury stores performed well, with jewelry and luxury goods sales rising 5.7%. Electronics and appliance stores rose 4.6% while health and personal care stores were up 4.7%.

However, sporting goods, hobby, book, and music stores saw sales fall 4.5%, indicating ongoing struggles for chains like GameStop and Barnes & Noble.  

With rising wages, low unemployment, and strong consumer confidence, Americans seem willing and able to spend despite recent stock market volatility and fears of an economic slowdown. The upbeat numbers suggest retailers can expect the momentum to continue into 2020. Overall, retail analysts predict total retail sales to climb 3.5% to 4% in the new year which should continue fueling consumer discretionary spending. The holiday season proves that the decade-long expansion still has more room to run.
