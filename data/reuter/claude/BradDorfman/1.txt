Caterpillar Reports Record Third-Quarter Profits, Exceeds Wall Street Expectations 

Caterpillar Inc. reported its third-quarter financial results this morning, exceeding market analysts’ expectations with record profits for the quarter. The heavy equipment maker posted net income of $2.32 billion, up 15% from $2.02 billion in the same period last year. On a per-share basis, earnings rose to $3.87 from $3.37, also topping analysts’ forecasts of $3.81 per share. 

Caterpillar’s strong results were driven by increased sales across all major geographic segments as well as higher prices and a more profitable mix of products sold. Total revenue for the quarter grew to $14.4 billion, up 6% from $13.5 billion last year. In North America, Caterpillar’s largest market, sales increased 9% to $7.6 billion. Sales in Latin America were up 8% to $1.7 billion, sales in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East rose 2% to $3.1 billion, and sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew 14% to $2 billion.

Caterpillar has benefited from growing global economic activity and increased demand for construction and mining equipment. According to Chief Executive Jim Umpleby, "Strong demand, our operational excellence focus and our team's dedication to helping customers are enabling us to achieve robust results.” Umpleby noted that the company has improved delivery times, made progress on inventory reduction, and expanded services. 

Caterpillar has also raised its full-year guidance based on the strong third-quarter results and positive market conditions. The company now expects 2018 revenue to increase by about 10% and earnings per share to come in around $11.75, up from previous guidance of $10.30 to $11.30. If achieved, full-year earnings would reach a record high, surpassing the previous peak of $9.88 per share in 2012. Caterpillar's upbeat forecast suggests infrastructure projects and mining activities should continue at a healthy pace for the remainder of the year.

Market analysts reacted positively to Caterpillar’s earnings beat and increased outlook. “It was an all-around strong report and guidance raise from Caterpillar,” said Lawrence T. De Maria, an analyst with William Blair & Company. Caterpillar's shares rose over 4% in morning trading following the announcement, signaling investors’ optimism for continued momentum. Caterpillar appears well on its way to a record year of financial performance in 2018.
