Dayton Hudson Corp. Reports Strong Third-Quarter Results, Signaling a Promising Holiday Season for Retailers  

Dayton Hudson Corp., the retail conglomerate that operates Target, Mervyn's and Marshall Field's, reported robust increases in both revenue and profits for its third fiscal quarter, signaling that the holiday shopping season could be strong for retailers.  

The company said net income for the three months ended Oct. 31 rose to $334 million, or 40 cents a share, from $303 million, or 37 cents, a year earlier. Sales increased 11% to $15.5 billion. The results beat analysts' expectations for per-share earnings of 38 cents and revenue of $15.3 billion.

"We are well positioned heading into the holidays," said Bob Ulrich, chairman and chief executive of Dayton Hudson. "We have the right mix of trends and value, and customers continue to respond to our improved product design and brands."

Sales increased at all three of Dayton Hudson's divisions, with Target leading the way with a 12% gain in revenue. The performance suggests Target has rebounded from a slow start to the year and is benefiting from its recent launch of new clothing brands and expansion into groceries. Mervyn's sales grew 9%, while Marshall Field's revenue rose 8%.

"Strong sales across the board show that consumers' appetite for spending remains healthy, even with some economic uncertainty," said retail analyst Jeff Stein of Cowen & Co. "For the holidays, shoppers will likely focus on value, but also still buy premium brands as gifts. Dayton Hudson is well positioned to capture spending at both ends of the spectrum."

The results from Dayton Hudson, which is based in Minneapolis, come after many apparel retailers and department stores reported weak performances in September. The contrast suggests that retailers with a balanced mix of affordable and higher-end goods may outperform their peers this holiday season. While the National Retail Federation expects a modest 2.8% rise in holiday sales this year, stronger players like Target and Marshall Field's could gain market share by attracting value-conscious yet still willing-to-spend customers.

Overall, Dayton Hudson's report signals potential strength for the broader retail sector during the holidays, even with economic growth slowing and consumers pinching pennies in some areas. For retailers, having the right blend of inventory looks to be a key factor in overcoming broader market challenges this season.
