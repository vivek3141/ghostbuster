Barry Diller Says Home Shopping Network Acquisition Will Fund Silver King's Ambitious Broadcasting Plans 

Media mogul Barry Diller announced today that Silver King Communications will acquire Home Shopping Network for $2.1 billion in stock and cash. The deal will give Silver King access to Home Shopping Network's 57 million cable and satellite subscribers and provide a new source of funding for Silver King's broadcasting ambitions.

"This acquisition will transform our company overnight and provide the platform for us to become a major force in broadcasting," said Diller, chairman and CEO of Silver King. "The steady cash flows from Home Shopping Network will accelerate our strategy to launch a broadcast network and assemble a world-class collection of TV stations." 

Silver King has made no secret of its desire to become the nation's fourth major broadcast network behind ABC, CBS and NBC. The company currently owns just 15 TV stations but in recent years has invested heavily in program development and acquired rerun rights to shows like Seinfeld, Cheers and Law & Order. Silver King hopes to launch its new broadcast network in early 1998 but has faced skepticism from media analysts, in large part because of uncertainty around funding such an expensive initiative. 

The Home Shopping Network acquisition appears to address the funding concerns head on. Home Shopping Network generates over $2 billion in annual revenue and $400 million in operating profit from sales of jewelry, clothing, health and beauty products, and other household goods on its 24-hour TV channels. While growth has slowed from the company's early days, revenue and profits remain substantial. Diller said Silver King has no plans to change Home Shopping Network's business model and views it as an "enduring American brand with loyal customers and tremendous reach."

Media analysts reacted positively to the news. "We have been dubious about Silver King's broadcast ambitions given their limited resources but this deal changes the calculus completely," said Jessica Reif Cohen, managing director at Merrill Lynch. However, some analysts warned that taking on Home Shopping Network's business could prove a distraction for Silver King's management. There are also risks around slowing sales and cable TV cord-cutting, although subscription rates have remained stable so far. 

The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval but is expected to close in early 2020. Diller noted that Silver King's increased scale will open new opportunities for cost savings and potentially more media deals down the line. "This is an exciting day for Silver King and Home Shopping Network, and the first step in building a next-generation media company that taps into the promise of broadcasting and new technologies."
