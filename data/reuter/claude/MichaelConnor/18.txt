Tobacco industry lawyer accuses state governments of demonizing legitimate industry with anti-racketeering lawsuits

A lawyer representing major tobacco companies accused state governments this week of improperly demonizing the tobacco industry through a coordinated campaign of anti-racketeering lawsuits. In a speech to tobacco industry executives, David Bernick, a partner at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, said the lawsuits brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) amounted to an unfair smear campaign designed to vilify tobacco companies and turn public opinion against the industry.  

"These lawsuits are not really about recovering healthcare costs or changing industry practices. They are a public relations exercise designed to label tobacco companies as corrupt racketeers. It is a sinister strategy to influence potential jurors and spread misinformation about an industry that is highly regulated and acting lawfully," Bernick said. He cited internal memos from state attorney general offices discussing a coordinated litigation strategy to maximize negative publicity against the tobacco industry.

The state of Mississippi filed the first government lawsuit against major tobacco companies in 1994. Since then, 46 other states have filed similar lawsuits to recover public funds spent on healthcare costs related to smoking. The states claim the tobacco companies engaged in a decades-long conspiracy to mislead the public about the health risks and addictiveness of smoking. The cases have been consolidated, and in 2016 the industry agreed to pay $206 billion to settle the claims. However, some states have filed subsequent RICO lawsuits to claim additional damages.

Bernick argued there is no evidence the tobacco companies engaged in a actual racketeering conspiracy. "Aggressive marketing and opposition to some public health measures do not amount to racketeering. The industry has been selling a legal product, and public health policy is a matter for lawmakers, not the courts," he said. He claimed the state lawsuits have undermined the companies' ability to defend themselves in court and poisoned the jury pool. "We cannot get a fair trial when facing jurors constantly exposed to misleading propaganda about the industry's supposed deceit and corruption," Bernick argued.
