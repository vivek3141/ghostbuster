DIRECTV's Consortium Wins Permission to Offer DTH Television in Chile, Beating Rivals 

DIRECTV Latin America, a subsidiary of AT&T, has won approval from Chile's government to offer direct-to-home satellite television service in the country. DIRECTV formed a consortium with Chilean telecommunications company Entel to bid for the rights. The group fended off rival bids from major players Claro, a subsidiary of América Móvil, and Movistar, a subsidiary of Telefónica.

Chile's Undersecretary of Telecommunications, Pamela Gidi, announced the 15-year license award to the DIRECTV-Entel consortium yesterday. The license allows the companies to provide DTH satellite TV service to customers across Chile. The government conducted an open auction for the license, with the winner being the bidder that committed to the highest investments in Chile's telecom infrastructure over the lifetime of the license.  

“We are pleased to have won this license to provide our world-class entertainment services to customers in Chile,” said DIRECTV Latin America CEO, Javier Garcia. “Partnering with Entel, a leading Chilean telecoms company, will allow us to hit the ground running and deploy our service rapidly. Chileans will soon enjoy access to the top sports, movies, and shows from around the world.”

The license represents a victory for DIRECTV in Latin America, one of the fastest-growing markets for pay-TV. Chile has a population of over 18 million with relatively high income levels, making it an appealing market for entertainment providers. DIRECTV already operates satellite TV businesses in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Adding Chile to that list expands their geographical footprint in the region.

For telecoms giant América Móvil, losing the bid will come as a disappointment. Their Claro subsidiary had hoped to leverage their existing Chilean mobile business to enter the country's pay-TV market. Rival Telefónica, which operates in Chile through its Movistar brand, had similar hopes. Their bids ultimately fell short, according to analysts, due to DIRECTV's expertise and resources to immediately launch DTH satellite services. 

The DIRECTV-Entel consortium has not yet announced plans for pricing or channel lineups for their Chilean service. Those details are expected over the coming months as they make preparations to initiate service under terms of their newly awarded license. For now, Chileans can expect to have more choice in television services soon as the country's pay-TV market expands through satellite and other technologies.
