Sunbeam Corp. to Cut 6,000 Jobs and Eliminate 87% of Product Lines in Drastic Restructuring

Sunbeam Corp., the century-old manufacturer of household products, announced today a drastic restructuring plan that will eliminate nearly 6,000 jobs and 87% of its product lines. The company will focus solely on core consumer brands like Oster appliances, Coleman outdoor equipment, and Crock-Pot slow cookers going forward. 

The sweeping changes are an attempt to turn around the struggling company, which has faced stagnant stock prices and declining sales over the past decade. "Sunbeam has lost its way. We have too many brands, too many products, and have tried to be too many things to too many people," said Sunbeam's newly appointed CEO, John Smith. "It's time for a return to our roots."

As part of the restructuring, Sunbeam will discontinue major household brands like Mixmaster, Tappan, and Rival, resulting in the closure of seven manufacturing facilities across the U.S. and Latin America. The company's broad range of electric grills, toasters, irons, and hair dryers will similarly be eliminated from stores in the coming months. According to Smith, narrowing Sunbeam's focus will "allow us to direct resources towards our most popular and profitable brands."

The restructuring plan sent shockwaves through Sunbeam's 53,000 employees worldwide. Nearly 12% of Sunbeam's workers will lose their jobs as part of the cutbacks, mostly in manufacturing roles. However, Smith believes the changes were necessary to ensure Sunbeam's long term viability in an increasingly competitive global market. "This was an extremely difficult decision, but the path we were on was unsustainable," said Smith. "We have a revered history and these changes will allow us to continue serving customers for generations to come."

Sunbeam's stock price jumped 18% on the news, indicating investor optimism about the company's new strategic direction. However, the restructuring also represents the end of an era for a company that has been a household name since 1910. Only time will tell if a leaner, more focused Sunbeam will be able to recapture its glory days. The success of the turnaround now rests on the shoulders of Smith and his leadership team.
