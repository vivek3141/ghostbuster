Time Warner Sees 32% Increase in Earnings Thanks to Rising Cable TV Fees and Strong Sales

Time Warner Inc. reported strong quarterly results today driven by higher cable subscription and cable TV fees as well as increased theatrical revenue from blockbuster films. Profits rose 32% in the third quarter compared with the same period last year.

The media conglomerate said net income increased to $1.21 billion, or $1.46 a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $933 million, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings per share were $1.58, beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.41. 

Revenue rose 9.2% to $7.17 billion, surpassing expectations. “We had a successful third quarter across our operating divisions, with strong subscription and advertising revenue growth at Turner and HBO and higher affiliate fees at our cable networks,” said Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's CEO.

Time Warner’s Turner cable unit, which includes CNN, TNT, and TBS, posted a 6% increase in revenue to $2.9 billion, helped by higher subscription and ad fees. At HBO and Cinemax, revenue was up 10% to $1.4 billion, boosted by a gain of 152,000 subscribers from the previous quarter and higher rates, though some analysts remain concerned about potential cord-cutting by consumers. Ad revenue at Turner also rose, gaining 9% to $646 million in the quarter.

The Warner Bros. studio division benefited from the hit movies “Wonder Woman” and ”It,” which contributed to a 19% increase in revenue. Revenue from theater showings grew 26%, while home entertainment also rose thanks to releases such as ”Kong: Skull Island.” Revenue at Warner Bros. climbed to $3.1 billion.

"Time Warner continued to execute well and gain momentum this quarter," Bewkes said. "Our results demonstrate the long-term benefits of investing in premium content and innovation in a very dynamic media landscape.”

The company reaffirmed its outlook for full-year adjusted earnings of $6.25 to $6.40 per share. Revenue is expected to increase by percentages in the mid-single digits for the year, thanks to ongoing strength from HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. Time Warner's stock rose 2.5% in after-market trading on the earnings news.
