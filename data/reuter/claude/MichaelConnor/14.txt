Disney in Talks with Latin America Satellite Providers for Spanish Version of The Disney Channel

The Walt Disney Company is currently in talks with major satellite television and cable operators across Latin America to launch a Spanish language version of The Disney Channel in the region, according sources inside the company. The proposed channel would feature Disney movies, TV shows, and original programming dubbed or subtitled in Spanish to suit the local audiences. 

Latin America represents a key growth market for Disney's television and movie business. The region is home to over 650 million people, most of whom speak Spanish or Portuguese as their native language. Disney already operates a version of The Disney Channel in Brazil, which is dubbed in Portuguese. However, the vast majority of Spanish-speaking kids and families across Mexico, Central and South America do not currently have access to a dedicated Disney Channel.

Disney sees an opportunity to change that and tap into a huge new customer base. According a source inside Disney's Latin America division, "We have a treasure trove of amazing content that has been produced for The Disney Channel in the U.S. and around the world that has never been translated and aired in Spanish. By launching a dedicated feed for Spanish-speaking audiences, we can localize that content and also produce original TV shows and movies aimed at kids and families in these key markets."

The proposed channel would join Disney's other offerings in Latin America which include on-demand streaming through Disney+ and the family entertainment TV channels available on most cable and satellite platforms. The new channel is likely to be launched first in Mexico and parts of Central America before rolling out to countries further south. Disney is currently negotiating launch agreements with major distributors like Sky Mexico, Megacable, and América Móvil across the region to add the proposed Disney Channel to their channel bundles.  

Announcement of launch dates and new programming for the channel could come as early as Disney's next quarterly earnings call on February 5th. The move to localize more of Disney's content for Spanish-speaking audiences in Latin America is seen by media analysts as key to the company's direct-to-consumer growth strategy over the coming years.
