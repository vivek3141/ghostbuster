Time Warner Inc. Reports 32% Increase in Q3 Earnings, Plans to Reduce Debt and Simplify Corporate Structure  

Time Warner Inc. announced its Q3 earnings results today, reporting a 32% increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, driven by strong subscriber and advertising growth across its cable networks and film divisions. The company also outlined plans to strengthen its balance sheet by reducing debt and costs, as well as simplifying its corporate structure.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose to $1.46 compared to $1.11 in the prior year quarter. Revenues increased 4% to $7.9 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 5% to $2 billion, with robust gains in the Turner and Warner Bros. segments offsetting declines in Home Box Office. 

Turner revenues rose 7% to $3.3 billion due to higher subscription, content licensing, and advertising revenues. Adjusted operating income increased 5% to $1.4 billion. The Turner networks, including TBS, TNT, and truTV, achieved 10% growth in advertising revenues, reflecting higher rates and more NBA regular season games. CNN saw advertising climb 16% with strong demand around politics and news cycles.

Warner Bros.’ revenues improved 6% to $3.7 billion and adjusted operating income jumped 15% to $560 million, the highest third quarter in the studio's history. Theatrical success came from titles such as Dunkirk, Annabelle: Creation, and The LEGO NINJAGO Movie. Television licensing and production were also up significantly.

Moving forward, Time Warner aims to pay down $6 billion of debt over the next two years using cash generated from operations and asset sales. The company will also cut at least $2 billion in costs, including elimination of as much as 10% of staff, consolidation of operations, and scale-back of real estate. Management intends to collapse Time Warner's separate Turner, Warner Bros., and Home Box Office divisions into a single business unit overseen directly by the CEO to simplify operations and reduce overhead expenses.

The debt repayment and cost savings are designed to provide financial flexibility for strategic initiatives as the media landscape evolves. Time Warner stock, which has lagged peers this year, rose over 6% in after-hours trading on the solid results and corporate changes. If executed properly, the company’s plans could unlock significant shareholder value going forward.
