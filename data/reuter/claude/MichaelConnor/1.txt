Lower Raw Material Costs Boost Earnings for Large U.S. Newspaper Companies 

Major newspaper companies in the United States reported stronger second-quarter earnings this week, helped by declining costs for newsprint and other raw materials. 

Gannett, the largest newspaper publisher in the U.S., said print advertising revenue fell 6% in the quarter compared with a year ago, but earnings rose 12% due to lower expenses. Newsprint costs dropped 18% from a year earlier. Gannett, which owns USA Today and many local newspapers, earned $205 million in the quarter.

The New York Times Company reported a 2.5% decline in print ad revenue but boosted digital ad sales by 10.5%. Lower raw material expenses helped the company improve operating profit by 3% to $60 million. The Times has reduced dependence on print revenue in recent years through a growing digital subscription business. The company now has over 3 million online subscribers, helping make up for long-term declines in print circulation and advertising.

McClatchy, a newspaper chain whose publications include the Miami Herald and Kansas City Star, reduced operating expenses by 8% in the quarter, allowing the company to swing to a profit of $26 million from a loss a year ago. Like its peers, McClatchy has faced falling print ad and circulation revenue for many years. Cost cuts and a growing digital operation have helped stem financial losses, though revenue remains under pressure.

The newspaper industry has been challenged for over a decade by the migration of readers and advertisers to digital platforms. However, many of the largest companies have diversified into more stable revenue sources, including online subscriptions and digital marketing services. If raw material costs remain lower, newspaper publishers could continue to boost profitability even as their legacy print businesses decline. Overall, the second-quarter results suggest major publishers have achieved a greater degree of financial stability after years of upheaval.
