Silver King Acquires Home Shopping Network in $1.27 Billion Stock-Swap Deal, Aims to Expand as Broadcast-TV Powerhouse  

Silver King Communications announced today that it has acquired Home Shopping Network in an all-stock deal valued at $1.27 billion. The deal combines two major players in broadcast television and signals Silver King's ambitions to become a powerhouse in the broadcasting industry.

Under the terms of the agreement, Silver King will exchange 0.625 shares of its common stock for each share of Home Shopping Network. The deal values Home Shopping Network at $17 per share, a 15% premium over its closing stock price yesterday. The newly combined company will have a market capitalization of $3.2 billion and will reach over 70 million households through its broadcast TV networks and cable channels.

"This acquisition is a transformative moment for Silver King," said CEO Mark Dolan in a statement. "Home Shopping Network is a perfect strategic fit and together we will have the scale and reach to compete more effectively in today's rapidly changing media landscape."  

Founded in 1982, Home Shopping Network pioneered the concept of shopping from home via television. However, in recent years it has faced increasing competition from e-commerce retailers and has struggled with declining sales and revenue. The deal will provide Home Shopping Network with greater financial backing and access to Silver King's base of viewers and advertising partners.

The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approval and approval by the shareholders of both companies. The new company will be headquartered in Silver King's offices in New York and will continue to trade on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol SLVR.

The deal is the largest in Silver King's history and follows several smaller acquisitions as the company looks to expand beyond traditional broadcast television into cable networks, digital media, and e-commerce. If approved, Silver King's purchase of Home Shopping Network could spur further consolidation in the television and broadcasting industry. However, the deal is likely to draw close scrutiny from regulators over potential antitrust issues.
