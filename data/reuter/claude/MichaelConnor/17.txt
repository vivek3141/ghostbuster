Florida to Challenge Tobacco Industry Using Tough Anti-Racketeering Law  

The state of Florida announced today that it intends to file a lawsuit against the nation's major tobacco companies, contending that the cigarette makers have engaged in fraudulent activity and violated the state's anti-racketeering laws. The lawsuit seeks billions of dollars in damages and will add to the mounting legal challenges that the tobacco industry has faced in recent years.

The lawsuit will be filed under Florida's Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, which was designed to dismantle criminal enterprises. The Florida attorney general's office will argue in court that the tobacco companies acted illegally by conspiring to mislead the public about the addictive nature and health risks of cigarettes, according to a spokesperson for the office. The racketeering laws permit the state to recover triple the amount of damages suffered.

“The tobacco companies willfully and intentionally conspired to deceive smokers and mislead the public about how dangerous their products are,” said Attorney General Pam Bondi in a prepared statement. “We are bringing this action to hold them fully accountable for their illegal actions and fraudulent practices.”

The lawsuit comes as the tobacco industry is already facing legal and financial troubles on multiple fronts. In Florida alone, a class-action lawsuit by smokers resulted in a $144 billion judgment against major cigarette makers in 2000, and a $11.5 billion settlement was reached in 1997 with the state over healthcare costs. Nationally, a landmark $246 billion master settlement was reached with 46 states in 1998. However, anti-smoking groups argue more remains to be done to curb tobacco marketing and make the companies pay for health costs.

The new Florida lawsuit is likely to unfold over many years through a lengthy legal process. Anti-smoking advocates hailed the state's action, saying it is well positioned to prevail given the substantial evidence that has emerged over decades about tobacco industry practices. However, some legal experts question whether another large lawsuit at this point will significantly alter the dynamics around tobacco regulation and public health. The industry is expected to vigorously contest the claims in court.
