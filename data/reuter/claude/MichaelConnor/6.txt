Silver King Communications to Buy Home Shopping Network for $1.3 Billion in Stock, Could Signal Launch of New TV Network by Barry Diller

Silver King Communications agreed this morning to acquire Home Shopping Network for $1.3 billion in stock, a move that could pave the way for media mogul Barry Diller to launch a new television network. 

Under the terms of the agreement, Silver King will exchange 0.65 shares of its common stock for each share of Home Shopping Network. Based on Silver King's closing stock price yesterday, that values Home Shopping Network at $24.50 per share, a 15 percent premium over its closing price. The deal is expected to close by the end of this year, pending regulatory approval and a vote by shareholders of both companies.

The blockbuster deal significantly expands Barry Diller's media empire and provides a platform for him to create a new TV network to compete with established cable channels like ESPN, CNN, and MTV. Mr. Diller, the former chief executive of Fox Inc. and chairman of Paramount Pictures, took control of Silver King two years ago and hinted at his ambitions to launch a nationally distributed TV network. With the acquisition of Home Shopping Network, Silver King will have access to more than 70 million cable subscribers in the United States, giving Mr. Diller the scale and reach to introduce a new channel.

"This acquisition will be transformational for our company," said Mr. Diller, chairman and chief executive of Silver King, in a statement. "The Home Shopping Network is a crown jewel distribution platform in cable television, and we look forward to enhancing and expanding its business by launching new programming services in the coming years."

Home Shopping Network will operate as a division under the Silver King umbrella, and there are no plans to make major changes to Home Shopping Network's business or management team, according to the companies. Home Shopping Network, based in St. Petersburg, Fla., operates two 24-hour TV shopping channels that sell jewelry, apparel, and other merchandise. The company has over $2.8 billion in annual revenue and consistently generates profit.   

The deal capped a multiyear effort by Mr. Diller to gain control of Home Shopping Network, according to two people with knowledge of the negotiations. Talks broke down on two previous occasions over price and control issues before the companies were able to agree terms last week. The acquisition is the largest in the home shopping industry and one of the biggest media deals of the year.

Shares of Silver King rose 15 percent on news of the deal, while Home Shopping Network's stock jumped 12 percent. Some analysts were upbeat about the potential for Mr. Diller to wring significant value out of the combined companies, while others questioned whether he may be overpaying for an asset largely seen as mature. Regardless of the strategic merits, the deal highlights Mr. Diller's relentless drive to expand his reach as a media mogul.
