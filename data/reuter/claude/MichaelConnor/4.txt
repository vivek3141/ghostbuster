BellSouth to Expand Wireless-Telephony Shops in Cost-Cutting Move  

BellSouth Corp., the region's dominant local phone company, plans to open dozens of wireless-telephone stores to improve its efficiency and reduce costs. Atlanta-based BellSouth will accelerate a retail strategy shift that began earlier this year. The company is seeking to replace some third-party cellphone shops with its own stores to keep a bigger portion of sales and service revenue.

BellSouth now operates about 200 of its own stores, called Network Retail Centers, that sell cellular phones and service plans. The company plans to open 50 to 100 additional corporate-run stores over the next year in places where independent dealers formerly represented BellSouth's Cingular wireless brand. The expansion could represent 25% or more of BellSouth's total retail locations. Most of the new stores will open in BellSouth's nine-state region, though some may crop up in other parts of the country where Cingular does business.

The retail strategy accompanies other cost-cutting moves at BellSouth, including a companywide effort to eliminate 6,000 jobs and tighten its operations to combat revenue pressures and offset declining prices for basic phone services. The wireless industry also faces slowing growth and price competition, and carriers are struggling to squeeze profits from sales of mobile phones and calling plans. By operating more of its own stores, BellSouth hopes to improve its efficiency and hang onto a bigger portion of customers' wireless bills. Independent retailers that now sell Cingular service will feel the heat from the expansion. Some may be forced out of business if BellSouth opts not to renew their service contracts.

Consumer advocates worry BellSouth's retail shift could reduce choices for customers in some markets. But BellSouth executives argue the company's stores provide service and support that third-party dealers often don't. The expansion is partly defensive, however. Rivals such as Verizon Wireless and Sprint Corp. already own and operate the vast majority of their retail outlets, enabling them to exert more control over sales and marketing. Though no timetable is set, BellSouth ultimately wants its stores to generate more than half of the company's wireless sales. The shift may accelerate if Cingular's acquisition of AT&T Wireless Services Inc. wins regulatory approval. By meshing the retail networks, Cingular could close some duplicate stores.

The retail overhaul comes as BellSouth strives to reign in costs and adapt to long-running forces that are reshaping the entire telecom field. By operating more stores itself, BellSouth hopes to gain extra efficiency and better leverage more direct control over how customers buy and use its wireless services. But that control comes at the cost of reduced retail competition, a trade-off that BellSouth believes will benefit the company and its customers in the long run.
