Delta Air Lines Inc. and Continental Airlines in Talks for Merger 

Delta Air Lines Inc. and Continental Airlines have entered into discussions for a potential merger, sources close to the situation told The Wall Street Journal. If completed, a merger of Delta and Continental would create one of the world's largest airline operators.

According to people familiar with the matter, Delta initiated the talks in recent weeks to explore ways to consolidate amid a sharp downturn in air travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The discussions are still preliminary, and there is no guarantee they will lead to a deal, the people said. However, both airlines see potential benefits in combining forces to weather the crisis, which has decimated air travel and threatens the financial health of the industry.

A merged Delta and Continental would form an airline giant to rival American Airlines Group Inc., the largest airline in the world by revenue and fleet size. Combined, Delta and Continental would have over 800 aircraft, offer more than 5,500 daily flights, and serve 325 destinations across five continents, according to the companies’ websites. The new entity would also likely achieve significant cost savings by merging operations, reducing overhead, and leveraging economies of scale. 

However, any potential deal is expected to face regulatory scrutiny, as consolidation in the airline industry leads to fewer choices for consumers. The merger would also likely meet opposition from unions concerned about potential job losses. Additionally, merging two large airlines is an immense challenge that could significantly disrupt operations and customer service if not executed properly. 

Shares of Delta rose more than 5% on news of the talks, indicating investor optimism for a deal. In a statement, Delta said, “Delta does not comment on industry rumors and speculation.” Continental also declined to comment.

The discussions are happening at a tumultuous time for the airline industry. The International Air Transport Association recently warned that airlines could lose $113 billion in revenue this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Carriers have grounded thousands of planes, cut flights, and asked employees to take unpaid leave in a desperate bid to survive the crisis until air travel demand returns.

A Delta-Continental merger could provide a lifeline to both airlines by giving them more financial flexibility and leverage to survive a prolonged downturn in travel. Once the pandemic passes, the combined airline would be poised to become a more dominant player in the industry.
