Florida Judge Inclined to Allow Civil Claims Against Tobacco Industry Under State Anti-Racketeering Laws

A Florida circuit court judge indicated today that she is inclined to allow a major civil lawsuit against major tobacco companies to proceed under Florida's anti-racketeering law. During a hearing in Miami, Circuit Judge Beatrice H. Kemp stated she believes that tobacco companies engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the public about the health risks of smoking. 

The lawsuit was filed by the State of Florida and aims to recover billions of dollars in funds spent treating smoking-related illnesses. The state claims tobacco companies violated the Florida Civil Remedies for Criminal Practices Act from 1954 to 1999 through wire and mail fraud as well as deceptive marketing and public statements about the addictiveness and health risks of smoking.

"There is significant evidence that the tobacco companies conspired to cast doubt on the links between smoking and health risks despite their own research confirming those links," Judge Kemp said. She cited numerous examples of tobacco company internal memos and marketing materials that seemingly contradicted the companies' public stances.

Lawyers for the tobacco companies argued that the companies acted legally based on the information available at the time and that there is no evidence they deliberately defrauded consumers or broke any laws. They claim the state is attempting to impose today's knowledge of smoking's health risks retroactively. The companies also argue that a 2006 Florida Supreme Court ruling established a "smoke shield" protecting tobacco companies from some civil claims, though the state contends anti-racketeering laws are not covered by that ruling.

A final decision by Judge Kemp is still pending but her comments in court today suggest she will likely certify the lawsuit as a class action under the anti-racketeering law and allow the claims regarding conspiracy and fraud to move forward. The case is being closely watched by public health advocates as well as the tobacco industry. Other states could follow Florida's lead if this case succeeds. The trial is scheduled to begin in January 2020.
