Time Warner Focuses on Debt Reduction by Restructuring Cable Holdings 

Time Warner Inc. announced plans today to restructure its cable television holdings in an effort to reduce debt and streamline operations. The company will spin off most of its cable assets into an independent company while retaining a minority stake.

The new cable company, temporarily called "NewCo," will include Time Warner's cable systems, which pass over 15 million homes in the U.S., as well as the company's residential high-speed data and phone businesses. These cable assets generated $21 billion in revenue for Time Warner last year but also carried over $40 billion in debt. By spinning off the majority of the cable business, Time Warner will remove this debt from its books and sharpen its focus on its media and entertainment assets.

"This transaction is another milestone in our ongoing drive to create multiple avenues of long-term value creation for our shareholders" said Jeff Bewkes, Chairman and CEO of Time Warner. "NewCo will have a lean, focused operational capability needed to efficiently serve its residential customers and achieve its growth potential. At the same time, we'll have an even stronger and more focused hand at Time Warner to thrive in the rapidly evolving media and content industry."

The move comes as the pay-TV landscape is undergoing major changes with more consumers cutting the cord in favor of streaming services. Cable providers are looking to reduce costs and operate more efficiently in the face of potential subscriber losses. An independent cable company will have more flexibility to make strategic decisions focused specifically on its cable customers and industry.  

Time Warner will retain up to 30 percent equity in the new cable company but will have no operational control or responsibility for its business. The transaction is expected to close by year-end, pending regulatory approval. Time Warner plans to use proceeds from the transaction to pay down debt, continue share buybacks, and invest in its media and studios businesses. Those businesses include powerhouse assets such as Warner Bros. film and television studios, Turner cable channels like TNT, TBS, and CNN, and the HBO premium cable network.

With the cable restructuring and removal of its debt obligations, Time Warner emerges with a stronger balance sheet and more focus. The company is now in a better position to explore potential strategic options for future M&A activity in the media and entertainment space. The move will also provide greater transparency for investors on the core growth drivers of Time Warner's media businesses.
