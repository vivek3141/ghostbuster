Time Warner to Launch CNN/SI Sports News Service in December, Competing with Walt Disney Co.'s ESPNEWS  

Time Warner Inc. announced today that it will launch CNN Sports Illustrated (CNN/SI), a new 24-hour sports news service, in early December. The channel will compete directly with ESPN's ESPNEWS channel and aims to leverage Time Warnerâ€™s CNN and Sports Illustrated brands to provide sports news and highlights coverage.

CNN/SI will provide live coverage of breaking sports news as well as highlights, news conferences, analysis, and debate segments. Time Warner executives said the channel is designed to complement Sports Illustrated's deep sports journalism experience and CNN's live news coverage capabilities. The channel will be available to subscribers of major pay-TV services including Comcast, Charter, AT&T, and Verizon FiOS at launch.

"Sports fans have an insatiable appetite for news, scores, highlights, analysis and opinion," said Jeff Zucker, President of CNN Worldwide. "The CNN/SI collaboration will tap into the best of CNN and SI to create a new trusted destination for sports fans and advertisers."

The launch of CNN/SI poses a direct challenge to ESPN and its ESPNEWS channel, which has been the dominant source for sports news and highlights on TV for years. ESPN is owned by Walt Disney Co. and has a vast array of media rights to major sports leagues including the NFL, NBA, and MLB. However, Time Warner believes there is room for competition given the huge demand for 24-hour sports coverage.

"We see an opportunity to provide an alternative for sports fans looking for news, highlights and conversation," said SI editor Chris Stone. "Together, CNN and Sports Illustrated have a unique ability to cover sports with the depth, clarity and expertise that fans crave."

The channel will be based in Atlanta at CNN Center, adjacent to the company's CNN global headquarters. CNN/SI has not yet named on-air hosts or announced official distribution deals with TV providers. But Time Warner said additional details will be unveiled in the coming months ahead of the channel launch in December.
