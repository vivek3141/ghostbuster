Leading Satellite-TV Groups Set Sights on Entering Penetrated Argentine Market 

Major satellite TV providers are looking to tap into the growing demand for pay-TV services in Argentina despite an already crowded market. DirecTV Latin America and Sky Mexico, subsidiaries of AT&T and Comcast respectively, have announced plans to enter the Argentine market over the next 12-18 months.

Satellite TV penetration in Argentina reached over 70% of households in 2018, indicating a mature market with many existing players. However, economic growth and a rising middle class have boosted overall demand for pay-TV subscriptions. DirecTV and Sky believe their brands and content can differentiate them even in a competitive landscape. 

DirecTV Latin America, the largest satellite TV operator in Latin America, will launch services in Argentina in early 2020. The company will bring its popular live sports, movies, and original TV series to subscribers. “Argentina has always been a key target for us, and the time is right given the country’s macroeconomic stabilization,” said Manuel Cortina, CEO of DirecTV Latin America.

Sky Mexico will start commercial operations in Argentina in mid-2020 under the “Sky” brand. The company plans to leverage its ownership by Comcast to provide current TV shows, movies, and live events from brands like NBCUniversal, Telemundo, and Universal Studios. “Pay-TV penetration and ARPUs [average revenue per user] in Argentina are at levels that represent an attractive opportunity for Sky. We believe our content and technology platform will resonate strongly with customers,” said James Simmons, CEO of Sky Mexico.

 While competition will be fierce, industry experts expect both brands to gain traction given their differentiated content offerings and value proposition to customers. However, their success is not guaranteed as local players like Cablevisión and Telecentro dominate the market and also continue enhancing their TV services. The entrance of DirecTV and Sky is a sign of the overall growth potential of Argentina’s pay-TV segment, but it may come at the expense of smaller operators over the longer term.

The battle for pay-TV subscribers in Argentina is heating up with two new competitors in the mix. How much market share they gain over the next few years will depend on their ability to stand out from the crowd. With the World Cup and Olympics around the corner, live sports may be key. The winners in this competition will shape the future of television in Argentina's dynamic media sector.
