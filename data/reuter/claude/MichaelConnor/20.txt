Burger King CEO Aims to Reach $10 Billion in Sales, Boosted by European Sales Recovery and US Expansion  

Burger King, the fast food burger chain, has set an ambitious new goal to reach $10 billion in system-wide sales over the next few years, CEO Jose Cil said on Thursday. The target represents nearly 25% growth from the company's $8.1 billion in sales last year and reflects optimism around economic recovery in Europe, expansion of delivery and drive-thru options in the U.S., and new restaurant openings globally.

"We believe the $10 billion system-wide sales milestone is achievable within the next three to four years based on our strategic growth pillars," Cil said on an earnings call with analysts. Burger King, which is owned by Restaurant Brands International, reported better-than-expected sales and earnings for the first quarter, with same-store sales growing 5% globally.  

In Europe, same-store sales grew for the first time in over a year, rising 3% in the quarter, as major markets like the UK and Spain start to ease COVID-19 restrictions on restaurants and open up more widely. "We're optimistic about the recovery of the European market and expect to see sequential improvements in sales and guest traffic across our biggest countries over the balance of the year," Cil said.

Burger King also aims to accelerate sales growth in its massive U.S. and Canadian division, where same-store sales grew 6% in the quarter. The company has been expanding its delivery options and digital ordering to more locations, while also opening more drive-thrus, which now make up more than 60% of its North American sales.

The company plans to open 1,000 new Burger King locations worldwide this year, focusing on "attractive growth markets" in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Burger King recently entered several new Asian markets, including Cambodia and Pakistan, and sees opportunities for thousands more Burger King stores across China, India, and other high-growth regions.

â€œWe believe we have significant opportunities to continue expanding the Burger King brand globally," Cil said. By combining faster innovation, digital investments, delivery expansion, and an accelerated pace of restaurant reimaging, Burger King aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth, he said. With its new $10 billion target, Burger King is signaling its goal to become an even bigger player on the global fast food stage.
