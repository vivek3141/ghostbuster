Sunbeam Corp. to Cut Half its Workforce and 87 Percent of its Product Lines in Drastic Turnaround Effort 

Sunbeam Corporation announced today that it will cut half of its workforce, shutter 32 out of 37 manufacturing plants, and eliminate nearly 90% of its product lines in a sweeping restructuring plan to rescue the troubled household appliance maker. The company has been struggling with mounting losses, market share declines, and a collapse of its stock price.

The dramatic moves by new Sunbeam CEO Albert Dunlap represent an effort to completely overhaul the company and refocus on its most profitable products and brands. Among the casualties will be Sunbeam's bread machine division, along with its grills, electric blankets, and other appliances divisions. The company will par its workforce down to 3,500 employees, put its remaining facilities under intense efficiency improvements, and concentrate future investments on its breadbox, hair dryer, and electric mixer lines which continue to perform well.  

“Sunbeam has been trying to be everything to everyone for too long,” Dunlap said in announcing the changes. “We must take aggressive actions to pare this company down to its strongest cores and rebuild from there. It is never easy to make these kinds of cuts, but they are absolutely necessary if Sunbeam is to survive and once again thrive.”

The restructuring is expected to cost $225 million but generate $450 million in savings within the first year. The cuts represent a stunning fall from grace for the once-dominant appliance maker. Sunbeam emerged from bankruptcy in the early 1990s but failed to maintain a leadership position in many of its markets in the face of intense competition. Several of its products received lackluster reviews from consumer agencies, and it struggled with production issues that led to costly recalls.  

While painful, industry analysts suggest the restructuring plan was the only viable option left for Sunbeam to have a chance at a turnaround. “This is a category 5 hurricane for Sunbeam, but the priorities of costs cuts and market focus were spot on,” said Aditya Balasubramanian, an analyst with Fitch Ratings. “With a scaled-back portfolio and lower costs, Sunbeam now at least has an opportunity to recover, even if the road ahead remains difficult.”

The job cuts will begin immediately and facility closures will be complete within 60 days. Sunbeam shares rose 15% on the news, a sign of investor confidence in the company’s new direction. Dunlap acknowledged the difficulty of the cutbacks but said he was confident a leaner, more focused Sunbeam could restore growth and profitability over time. “This will not be easy, but it is necessary,” Dunlap said. “With hard work and determination, we will build a new Sunbeam that once again shines brightly.”
