Former Chief Justice Yang Joins Race to Become Hong Kong's First Local Leader 

HONG KONGâ€”Andrew Yang, Hong Kong's former chief justice, announced on Wednesday that he will run in the 2022 election to become the city's first locally born leader. Mr. Yang, 65, retired from the top judicial post last year after a decade on the bench. 

Mr. Yang is positioning himself as a moderate, pragmatic candidate who can heal divisions in Hong Kong society after months of political unrest. "Hong Kong needs a leader who can bring people together, uphold the rule of law, and move our city forward," Mr. Yang said at a news conference. "I believe I have the experience, judgment and ability to take on this important role."

If elected, Mr. Yang would replace Carrie Lam as the chief executive of Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory. Ms. Lam, who was appointed by a committee dominated by pro-Beijing politicians, has faced calls to resign over her handling of the protests. Mr. Yang would be the first chief executive chosen through open elections, though candidates must still be approved by Beijing.

Mr. Yang's entry into the race is a wild card that could reshape the election. The other likely contenders are hard-liners aligned with Beijing, while Mr. Yang is seen as a pragmatic centrist. His decade as chief justice, Hong Kong's top judicial role, afforded him a reputation for fairness and independence. Mr. Yang emphasized that independence in his announcement, saying "the chief executive has a constitutional duty to act in an even-handed manner."

Pro-democracy lawmakers gave Mr. Yang's candidacy a cautious welcome. "Anyone who upholds genuine constitutionalism and the rule of law would be better than hard-line pro-establishment candidates," said Alvin Yeung, leader of the Civic Party. But others questioned whether Mr. Yang could stand up to Beijing given that the election committee is dominated by pro-establishment politicians.

Mr. Yang's candidacy is the latest twist in Hong Kong's messy political scene. Weeks of street protests last year plunged the city into crisis and reshaped its political dynamics. The unrest was fueled by concerns that Beijing is encroaching on Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic freedoms.

Mr. Yang's supporters hope he can help ease those concerns and mend fences with moderate members of the protest movement. But his ability to accomplish much will depend on forces outside of his control, especially in Beijing. If elected, Mr. Yang may find himself in an unenviable position: caught between the democratic aspirations of Hong Kong people and the authoritarian instincts of Communist Party leaders in China.
