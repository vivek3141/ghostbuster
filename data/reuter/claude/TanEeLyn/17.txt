Hong Kong Legislative Council President Andrew Wong Joins Controversial Provisional Legislature 

In a shocking move, the longtime President of Hong Kong's Legislative Council Andrew Wong announced today that he will join the controversial Provisional Legislature established by Beijing earlier this year. Wong has served as President of the Legislative Council, Hong Kong's parliament, for over 15 years and was widely seen as a moderate pro-democracy voice. His decision to join the Provisional Legislature is a blow to Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement.

The Provisional Legislature was formed by Beijing in March after it gave itself the power to veto candidates and disqualify pro-democracy legislators in Hong Kong. Most pro-democracy legislators resigned in protest, leaving the Legislative Council unable to meet the quorum to pass laws. Beijing established the Provisional Legislature, packed with pro-Beijing politicians, to take over the functions of the elected legislature. Since then, the legitimacy of the Provisional Legislature has been widely questioned by foreign governments and Hong Kong's pro-democracy parties.

In a press conference today, Wong said "the political situation has changed" and the establishment of the Provisional Legislature is now "an undisputed fact." He said Hong Kong needs an effective legislature to address issues like the economic recession and rising unemployment due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, pro-democracy leaders slammed Wong for "selling out Hong Kong for political gain" and giving legitimacy to what they called "an unlawful body that undermines Hong Kong's autonomy and democracy."

Wong has not yet specified what exact role he will play in the Provisional Legislature. There are rumors that Beijing plans to appoint him as the President or Speaker of the legislature to give its actions more credibility and connection to Hong Kong's political traditions. If so, it would be a tragic end to Wong's long and distinguished career as a moderate voice that aimed to balance pro-Beijing and pro-democracy interests. His departure signals the fading influence of Hong Kong's moderate politicians and the ascendance of an increasingly authoritarian system that takes direct orders from Beijing. For Hong Kong's fragile democracy, it marks the end of an era.
