Royal Dutch Shell’s $6 Billion Oil Refinery Plan in China Nears Government Approval

Royal Dutch Shell is close to receiving final approval from the Chinese government for its plan to build a $6 billion oil refining and petrochemical complex in China’s Sichuan province. The plant is expected to start operations in 2025 and help Shell capture a larger share of China’s fast-growing oil demand. 

Shell executives and Chinese government officials said the proposed project is currently under final review by China’s National Development and Reform Commission and approval is expected within the next few months. Liu Hongbin, chairman of Sinopec Yangzi Petrochemical Company, Shell’s local partner in the project, said “the review process is progressing very well and we do not foresee any major roadblocks or issues.”

The plant will be able to process 8 million tons per year of crude oil and produce refined petroleum products like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel as well as petrochemicals such as ethylene and propylene. Shell aims to integrate advanced technologies at the refinery like residue fluid catalytic cracking and selective catalyst reduction to boost efficiency and meet China’s strict environmental standards. 

The new refinery will source crude oil from within China and abroad, supporting Shell’s growing oil trading business in Asia. “This project will further strengthen Shell’s competitive position in China and our commitment to long-term strategic partnerships with Chinese energy companies like Sinopec,” said Zoe Yujnovich, Shell’s Upstream Director. Royal Dutch Shell has identified China as a key growth market as the country’s huge demand for oil and petrochemicals is expected to rise in the coming decades even as domestic production declines.

While the review process is a positive sign, some analysts warned approval is not guaranteed as China seeks to balance oil supply security with environmental protection. “The project still faces uncertainties as it has taken a long time to progress through the approval procedures, reflecting China’s internal debate around further expansion of oil refining capacity,” said Darren Yang, a credit analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. 
 
However, others note the strategic importance of the project and believe the government will give its consent. “Given Shell’s partnership with Sinopec and the plant’s access to crude supply, it is unlikely to be rejected unless there are major environmental issues which Shell is well-placed to address with its technologies,” said Michal Meidan, Director of the China Energy Programme at Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.

The project is in line with China's ambitions to upgrade its refining industry and reduce pollution. Once approved, the plant will be a boost for economic growth in Sichuan province and advance China's energy security goals. For Shell, the mega refinery will significantly expand its footprint in China and help tap into the demand potential of its fastest-growing market in the coming decades.
