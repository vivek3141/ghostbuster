DHL Worldwide Express Aims to Break Even in Eastern and Central Europe by 2000  

DHL Worldwide Express, the global leader in international express delivery services, announced plans today to reach profitability in Eastern and Central Europe by the end of 2000. The region, which includes countries such as Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Slovakia, has posed challenges for DHL as the company has expanded rapidly across the globe.    

“While we have experienced strong growth in our express delivery services across Western Europe and Asia, Eastern and Central Europe has lagged due to infrastructure issues as well as customer buying power in these developing markets,” said CEO of DHL John Pearson. “However, we see significant long-term opportunity and believe now is the time to double down on our investment in this region.”    

DHL has operated in Eastern and Central Europe since 1989 and already has a presence in over 40 cities across 10 countries. However, revenue and profitability have failed to match the company’s operations in other parts of the world. To remedy this and achieve its goal of breaking even by next year, DHL will pursue an aggressive strategy over the next 18 months.  

Planned initiatives include improving delivery route optimization to reduce costs, investing in sales and marketing to drive greater shipment volumes, and tailoring its services more closely to customers’ needs in these markets. DHL will also explore potential acquisitions of smaller logistics and shipping companies in the region to speed up its expansion.    

“We have the experience in these countries to succeed,” noted Hans Schroeder, DHL’s Regional Director for Eastern and Central Europe. “By enhancing our infrastructure, building our sales, and better serving customers in their own languages and with services adapted to their requirements, we believe we can reignite growth and reach our profitability target within the promised timeframe.”  

The logistics and shipping market in Eastern and Central Europe is predicted to grow at over 15% annually over the next five years according to industry analysts. By investing to strengthen its market position now before potential competitors emerge, DHL hopes to capture the lion’s share of this growth and build a sustainable presence in the region that complements its already dominant networks across the Americas, Middle East, Asia, and Western Europe. With profits and higher margins in sight by next year, Eastern and Central Europe may finally become the strategic jewel and key long-term driver for DHL that the company has long hoped it could be.
