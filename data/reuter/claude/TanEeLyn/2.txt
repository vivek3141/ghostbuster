Leading Chinese Dissident Flees to Hong Kong Seeking Asylum in the United States

Prominent Chinese human rights activist Chen Guangcheng has escaped house arrest in China and fled to Hong Kong, according to sources close to Chen. Chen, known as China's "barefoot lawyer" for advocating for the poor and disabled, has been held under illegal house arrest for over a year. Supporters say Chen made a dramatic escape from his village in Shandong province last week and arrived in Hong Kong yesterday. He is now seeking political asylum in the United States. 

Chen has long been a thorn in the side of Chinese authorities. Blind from an early age, Chen taught himself law and took on cases of forced abortions, corruption, and other human rights abuses. He spent four years in prison on trumped-up charges before being released in 2010. Chinese authorities then placed him under strict house arrest, surrounding his home with guards and surveillance cameras. Despite the oppressive conditions, Chen continued to speak out against abuse of power and advocate for China's most vulnerable groups.

In a video released online after his escape, Chen accused local Communist Party officials of subjecting him and his family to illegal detention, physical assault, and other mistreatment during his house arrest. "What they have done shows they are afraid of democracy and the rule of law," he said in his appeal for help from international groups. The United States embassy in Beijing said it is aware of the situation and monitoring developments closely. Several members of the U.S. Congress have called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to grant Chen political asylum and help him travel to the U.S. with his family.

Chen's escape is an embarrassment for Chinese authorities and highlights the Communist Party's intolerance of dissent and political opposition. Under President Xi Jinping, China has launched a broad crackdown on activists, human rights lawyers, and other critics of the regime. Hundreds of dissidents and rights advocates have been detained, imprisoned or placed under surveillance. The case of Chen Guangcheng shows the extremes to which Chinese authorities will go to silence voices that threaten their power and control.

Chen told supporters he wants to rest in Hong Kong before traveling to the United States. His fate remains uncertain, however, as Chinese authorities could put pressure on Hong Kong to extradite him back to mainland China. Chen's daring escape and plea for freedom have earned him admirers around the world who hope that democratic countries will come to his aid in his time of need. For now, all eyes remain on Hong Kong to see whether this courageous dissident will find refuge or be forced back into the hands of his oppressors.
