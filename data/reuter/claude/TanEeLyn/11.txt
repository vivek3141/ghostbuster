China Offers Support to Stabilize Hong Kong's Financial Markets After Handover 

Hong Kong's financial markets experienced volatility in the days leading up to the July 1 handover of the city from Britain to China. In an effort to stabilize the markets, China has announced several measures to support Hong Kong's economy and financial system.

The Hong Kong stock market fell more than 10% in June amid uncertainty about the handover. The property market also declined over worries that China may impose greater control over the city. In response, China has taken steps to ensure Hong Kong's capitalist system remains intact for at least 50 years after the handover. China's central bank also announced it will allow Hong Kong to continue using the Hong Kong dollar and maintain its own monetary and financial systems separate from mainland China.

"We are confident that the 'one country, two systems' principle we have adopted will benefit Hong Kong with stability and prosperity," said Jiang Enzhu, spokesman for China's State Council. "Hong Kong will continue to operate as a free port and offshore trading center with free flow of capital."

To further support Hong Kong's economy, China said it will make it easier for mainland Chinese companies to invest in Hong Kong. Chinese travelers will also find it less cumbersome to visit the city. "Hong Kong has been the gateway for foreign investment into mainland China, and our economies are intrinsically linked," said Liu Mingkang, China's banking regulator. "So we will take measures to strengthen Hong Kong's status as a global financial center." 

The moves appear to have eased concerns in Hong Kong ahead of the handover. Hong Kong's stock market rallied in the final week of June, recovering most of the losses earlier in the month. Property stocks and the Hong Kong dollar also strengthened on hopes that China will uphold its pledge to not interfere in Hong Kong's affairs for the next 50 years.

Not all concerns have been assuaged, however. Some Hong Kong residents remain skeptical about censorship and erosion of political freedoms following the handover. But China has insisted that Hong Kong will retain a high degree of autonomy to conduct its own political, legal and economic affairs under the "one country, two systems" policy. Overall, China's recent announcements have boosted confidence that Hong Kong's prized financial freedoms and global role will be protected after the British withdrawal. Barring any unforeseen geopolitical shocks, Hong Kong's financial system looks poised to emerge intact from the handover.
