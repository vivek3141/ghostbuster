Norwegian Engineer Kvaerner ASA Plans to Increase Asia Pacific Portfolio 

Norwegian engineering firm Kvaerner ASA announced today plans to expand its operations in the Asia Pacific region over the next five years. Kvaerner currently has a limited presence in the region with projects in Singapore, Malaysia, and Australia. However, CEO Ingolf Henning Kopperud outlined a strategy to aggressively grow its portfolio of projects by 2025.

“The Asia Pacific region represents tremendous opportunities for infrastructure and energy projects that play directly into Kvaerner’s strengths,” said Kopperud. “Our expertise in offshore oil and gas, renewable energy like hydropower and wind power, and civil construction is in high demand. We aim to leverage our technical skills and experience from projects in Norway and around the world to become a major player in Asia Pacific.”

Kvaerner expects to win contracts for both new projects as well as take over existing projects where current contractors are struggling. It can offer customers high-quality engineering, project management, and on-time delivery. The company is particularly interested in hydropower projects in China, Indonesia, and Vietnam as well as offshore wind power projects across the region. Its work building massive hydroelectric power stations in Norway positions it well to work on complex hydropower generation projects in Asia Pacific.

The expansion into Asia Pacific is part of Kvaerner’s wider strategy to diversify its geographic presence. Historically focused on the North Sea, Kvaerner now gets more than half of its revenue from international projects. Entering new markets in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa provides opportunities for growth as North Sea oil and gas operations wind down. The company can leverage its expertise to win projects in these new markets. 

Kvaerner enjoys a strong balance sheet with low debt levels and high cash reserves giving it the ability to fund its Asia Pacific expansion plan. It aims to win enough new projects in the region over the next year to set up local offices and move senior management to the region. Establishing local presences in markets like China, Singapore, and Indonesia will better position the firm to win new contracts and expand further.

The announcement signals an important strategic move for Kvaerner to tap into fast-growing infrastructure and energy markets in Asia Pacific. If executed successfully, the expansion plan can help reduce its reliance on the North Sea and open up new long-term growth opportunities for the Norwegian engineering firm.
