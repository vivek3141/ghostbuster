US Envoy Reminds China of Hong Kong's Promised Freedoms After Handover Next Year

The US ambassador to China warned Beijing today that Hong Kong's promised freedoms and autonomy must be respected even after the former British colony is handed back to China next year. 

In a speech given 25 years after China agreed to keep Hong Kong's freedoms and way of life unchanged for 50 years, Ambassador Max Baucus said the US is closely watching events in Hong Kong leading up to the handover. He reminded Beijing of the commitment it made in 1984 under the Sino-British Joint Declaration to respect Hong Kong's democratic institutions and civil liberties.

"The prosperity of Hong Kong owes much to its tradition of free speech, freedom of press, freedom of assembly, and an independent judiciary under the rule of law," Baucus said. He added that respecting political and civil rights will be crucial to Hong Kong's continued stability and prosperity.

Beijing has promised that Hong Kong will retain a "high degree of autonomy" under the "one country, two systems" formula. But activists worry that freedoms may erode over time. In recent years, there have been incidents that raised concerns over press and academic freedoms in Hong Kong.

A US Congressional commission report last week said Hong Kong's autonomy is "increasingly imperiled" as Beijing tightens control. The report cited concerns over erosion of press and academic freedoms, intervention in local elections, and weakening of rule of law.

China's foreign ministry spokesman urged the US to stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs. "Hong Kong's transition of sovereignty and the implementation of 'one country, two systems' principle are entirely China's internal affairs," he said. "No foreign country has the right to interfere."

The handover of Hong Kong's sovereignty on July 1, 1997 will mark an end to over 150 years of British colonial rule. There is uncertainty over whether the communist leaders in Beijing will fully respect Hong Kong's democratic institutions and civil liberties promised for the next 50 years. The US envoy's speech highlights America's interest in seeing freedoms upheld in the former British colony after the handover to China.
