Pro-Democracy Politician Dragged Away Screaming During Hong Kong Protest Against China's Leader Selection Methods 

HONG KONGâ€”A legislator from Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp was dragged away screaming by security officials Thursday as she protested China's restrictive selection methods for the city's top leader.

The lawmaker, Claudia Mo, joined a demonstration in Hong Kong's Central business district against China's plans to vet candidates for Hong Kong's next chief executive. Protesters say Beijing's screening process will result in the selection of a pro-establishment leader who does not represent the democratic desires of Hong Kong's citizens.

As Mo stood on a podium to address several hundred protesters, security officials grabbed her and forcibly removed her from the scene. "We want real choice!" Mo screamed as she was dragged away toward a nearby police van. The move was seen as an escalation by authorities in suppressing political dissent, further angering the protesters.

The protesters are demanding changes to allow open nominations of candidates for chief executive, rather than a small committee stacked with Beijing loyalists vetting potential contenders. China has refused to budge on the strict screening procedures, saying they conform with the city's mini-constitution.

But Mo and other pro-democracy advocates argue that the selection process deprives Hong Kongers of a fair vote and infringes on the city's autonomy under the "one country, two systems" arrangement with China. 

"The chief executive should be elected by all Hong Kong citizens, not chosen by a few hundred people," said William Cheng, a 22-year-old protester. "We want real universal suffrage, not this fake democracy."

The protests came as Hong Kong's current leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, winds up her first term in office. Lam was herself chosen in 2017 by a committee of about 1,200 people, most of whom are considered pro-Beijing.

Although Thursday's demonstration ended peacefully, the confrontation is likely to further damage the Hong Kong administration's credibility with the pro-democracy movement. Political tensions have intensified in the former British colony, unsettled by China's tightening grip on power and its suppression of dissent. The prospect of less freedoms and limited choice in future elections hangs over Hong Kong as Lam begins her second term unchecked by democratic reforms.
