China Hosts Largest and Costliest Airshow to Boost Aerospace Industry  

China hosted its biggest airshow this week, putting its growing aerospace industry on display. The Zhuhai Airshow, held in southern China, spanned over 700,000 square feet and featured over 700 exhibitors according to Chinese state media. 

The biennial airshow is a major platform for China to showcase its latest military and civilian aircraft to potential buyers. China is aiming to boost its aerospace sector to compete with Western conglomerates like Boeing and Airbus. The show comes as China's economy has slowed in recent months under pressure from a trade war with the United States.

Domestic firms like the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China and China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation had a strong presence. COMAC unveiled its C919 passenger jet, which aims to compete with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. Though still awaiting regulatory approval, COMAC has over 800 orders for the C919 from domestic carriers and leasing companies.

Military aircraft were also on prominent display, including the J-20 stealth fighter and H-6K strategic bomber. China has been investing heavily in the development of stealth fighters, spy planes, and hypersonic vehicles as it aims to achieve technological parity with Western militaries. The massive costs of developing advanced weaponry is seen by analysts as an attempt by China’s military to justify its budget growth amid a slowing economy.

Foreign companies and officials were active participants, underscoring China’s growing influence on the global arms market. Russia showed off its Su-57 stealth fighter, while French firm Safran displayed its military jet engines. Officials from over 60 countries including Kenya, Kuwait, and the Philippines also toured aircraft at the show, as China has become an increasingly popular exporter of military drones, jets, and other weapons.

The Zhuhai Airshow represents both China’s ambitions to become a world leader in high-tech aerospace and its desire to kickstart its slowing economy through investment in innovation and infrastructure.  Whether China can overcome technical and regulatory hurdles to compete with established Western aerospace firms still remains to be seen. But with abundant capital and political support behind its aerospace aspirations, China is poised to reshape the industry in the coming decades.
