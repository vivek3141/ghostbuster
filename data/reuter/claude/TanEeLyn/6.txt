Chinese Dissident Sentenced to 11 Years Sparks Fears of Hong Kong's Freedom Under China 

A Hong Kong court sentenced a Chinese dissident to 11 years in prison today for a violent protest last year, raising fears about Hong Kong's judicial independence and civil liberties under Beijing's tightening grip.

Lee Kwan, a 23-year-old pro-democracy activist, was convicted of rioting and assaulting a police officer during a demonstration in July 2019. Lee pleaded not guilty but was convicted based on footage from security cameras and testimony from police officers. His supporters say the evidence was flawed and that he was targeted due to his political activism.

Lee's harsh sentence is the latest sign of Beijing's determination to curb dissent in Hong Kong, activists and legal experts say. Under the "one country, two systems" principle agreed with Britain, Hong Kong was supposed to maintain its own political and legal freedoms after the handover to China in 1997. But Beijing has taken an increasingly hard line against activists and politicians calling for more democracy and autonomy.

"This is a political prosecution and a political sentence," said Richard Li, a legal scholar at Hong Kong University. "The message being sent is that dissent and protest against Beijing's policies won't be tolerated. The Xi Jinping government wants to intimidate Hong Kongers into silence and compliance."

The sentence sparked protests by hundreds of Lee's supporters outside the courthouse. Police used tear gas and batons to disperse the crowds, arresting at least 20 people. Lee's lawyer called the verdict "deeply troubling" and said they would appeal. Western governments have also criticized the erosion of civil liberties in Hong Kong.

For activists like Lee, the verdict shows that China's Communist Party will not hesitate to tighten its grip over Hong Kong's judiciary and politics. "This is the death of 'one country, two systems,' " Lee shouted as he was led out of the courtroom. Unless more Hong Kongers stand up for their rights, he said, "We will all end up in jail or in exile."
