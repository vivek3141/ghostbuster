China Plans to Increase Refining Capacity and Ethylene Production to Meet Rising Energy Demand 

China is planning to accelerate the expansion of its oil refining and petrochemical sectors over the next five years to meet rising domestic energy demand. According to the nation's five-year economic plan released this week, China aims to boost its crude oil refining capacity by 10 percent to 20 million barrels per day by 2025. The country also plans to increase ethylene production capacity, a key petrochemical used to produce plastics and textiles, by nearly 50 percent to 42 million metric tons per year within the same time period.

The expansion plans reflect China's thirst for oil and gas as its economy continues to grow at a steady pace. Although economic growth has slowed from the double-digit pace of the previous decade, China still expanded by 6.1 percent last year, contributing nearly 30 percent of global economic growth. This persistent growth has fueled greater demand for vehicles, air travel, and consumer goods - all of which require oil and petrochemicals. According to the International Energy Agency, China surpassed the United States as the world's largest oil importer in 2017 and now accounts for nearly 15 percent of global oil demand.

To feed its mammoth economy, China relies heavily on imported oil and gas. The country imports about 70 percent of its oil and nearly half of its natural gas. By boosting domestic refining and petrochemical production, China aims to process more imported crude oil into usable products and reduce its dependence on foreign suppliers for plastics and chemicals. The expansion plans outlined in the new five-year plan would make China's refining sector the largest in the world and its petrochemical industry second only to the U.S.  

However, some analysts warn that China's ambitions could be limited by several factors. First, there is a shortage of qualified engineers and technical personnel to design, build, and operate new refining and petrochemical facilities. Labor shortages and rising wages in China could pose challenges to rapid expansion. Second, environmental regulations are tightening in China due to widespread concerns over pollution. Any new oil and gas projects would need to comply with strict environmental rules, which could slow down approval and construction times. Finally, trade disputes with the U.S. could impact access to technology and equipment needed for the planned expansions.
