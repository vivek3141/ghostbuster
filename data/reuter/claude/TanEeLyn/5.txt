China Raises Domestic Prices on Gasoil in Response to Soaring Demand and Emaciated Margins 

China announced yesterday that it will raise domestic prices on gasoil, its term for diesel fuel and heating oil, by 500 yuan or $75 per ton effective June 1 in response to surging demand and tight refining margins.

The hike comes as demand for gasoil has soared in China due to expansions in transportation and industrial activity. Gasoil is used widely as a transportation and industrial fuel in China. At the same time, refining margins for producing gasoil have plunged due to rising crude oil prices. China’s refiners have struggled to maintain profitability with such narrow margins.

The price increase is aimed at boosting refiners’ margins to ensure steady supply and prevent fuel shortages. China’s pricing agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, said the higher prices will lift major refiners’ profit margins to around $30-$35 per barrel, still below last year’s levels.

The impact on inflation is expected to be limited given gasoil’s small weighting in China’s consumer price index. But the higher costs may be passed on to some extent to transportation and logistics companies, and raise overall costs for businesses.

China’s gasoil demand has jumped this year due to an expansion in transportation activity as the country’s economy continues to gain momentum. Industrial demand has also remained strong.  At the same time, China’s refiners have had to process more expensive crude oil, sapping their profit margins. Several independent refiners reportedly halted operations in recent months due to mounting financial losses.

State-owned refiners like Sinopec and PetroChina are better able to withstand short-term margin squeezes. But the pricing move is aimed at providing relief across the board. China frequently adjusts domestic fuel prices based on changes in global crude oil rates and domestic market conditions. Prices for most refined products rose more than 20% over the past year following steady increases in crude oil values.

China’s gasoil stockpiles remain at healthy levels, according to analysts, suggesting supply is matching demand growth for now. But the larger price increase reflects Beijing’s caution in ensuring adequate supply and fuel security. China aims to cultivate steady energy supply and demand as broader economic growth slows from last year’s robust pace.
