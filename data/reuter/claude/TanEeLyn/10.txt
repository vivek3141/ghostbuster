Air China to Expand International Routes and Increase Fleet with Five New Planes  

Air China, the national flag carrier of China, announced today its plans to add five new planes to its fleet and launch new international routes to expand its global reach. The airline will be acquiring two Boeing 777-300ER aircraft and three Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners in 2020. 

The new planes will allow Air China to launch direct flights from Beijing to Johannesburg, South Africa, as well as start nonstop service between Beijing and Malaga, Spain. The Johannesburg route will operate three times a week beginning in October 2020 while the Malaga route will operate twice a week starting in December 2020. 

"We are excited to connect Beijing to more destinations in Africa and Europe with these new nonstop routes operated by our latest, most advanced widebody aircraft," said Tan Jie, Senior Vice President of Air China. "The Boeing 777-300ER and 787-9 Dreamliner offer unmatched fuel efficiency, range, and passenger comfort. These new efficient planes will significantly enhance our international capabilities and customer experience."

The new routes reflect the growing demand for travel between China and markets in Southern Europe and Africa. China is now South Africa's largest trading partner, and Spain is seeking to attract more Chinese tourists to its sunny resorts and cultural attractions. The new nonstop flights will facilitate trade and tourism between these destinations. 

Air China's expansion of its long-haul fleet and network comes as Chinese airlines are facing declining travel demand due to COVID-19. However, Air China is optimistic about the gradual rebound of international air travel in 2021 as economies start to recover and borders reopen. The airline aims to capitalize on pent-up demand by enhancing its global connectivity.

Headquartered in Beijing, Air China operates a fleet of 660 aircraft with an extensive network covering 194 destinations in 40 countries worldwide. Together with its subsidiaries Shenzhen Airlines and Dalian Airlines, Air China's fleet operates nearly 800 aircraft flying to 248 destinations around the globe. Air China is also the largest member of the Star Alliance airline alliance. The new routes and aircraft further cements Air China's position as China's only 5-star international airline.
