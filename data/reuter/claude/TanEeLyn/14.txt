Protesters Clash with Police as China's Foreign Minister Arrives to Choose Hong Kong's Future Leaders

HONG KONG â€” Violent clashes erupted in Hong Kong today as China's Foreign Minister arrived in the city to oversee the selection of Hong Kong's future leaders. Protesters took to the streets, accusing China of undermining Hong Kong's democratic process. Police responded with tear gas and pepper spray to disperse the crowds as protesters threw bricks and Molotov cocktails. At least a dozen people were arrested.

Wang Yi, China's Foreign Minister, is in Hong Kong to affirm a new committee that will select Hong Kong's next leader in 2022. The committee is dominated by pro-Beijing candidates, leading critics to argue that China is tightening its grip over the semi-autonomous territory. "This is the end of 'one country, two systems,'" said Jimmy Sham, a pro-democracy activist, referring to the principle by which Hong Kong has retained some political and economic independence from mainland China. 

Tensions have been building for years as Beijing has curtailed freedoms in Hong Kong, including jailing pro-democracy politicians and activists. The latest protests were the biggest since 2019 when months of demonstrations rocked the city over a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. The bill was eventually withdrawn but protesters continued to demand full democracy.

Under the terms of Hong Kong's return from British rule, it is promised autonomy under the "one country, two systems" formula. But China has been accused of reneging on its promises to give Hong Kong a high degree of political and judicial independence. The selection of the new Election Committee is seen as another blow to Hong Kong's waning freedoms.  

A spokesperson for the Hong Kong police said the protests were "unlawful" and that force was necessary to restore order. But human rights groups criticized what they called an excessive use of force and erosion of Hong Kong's civil liberties. With Hong Kong's democratic hopes fading, many fear an intensifying crackdown as Beijing reasserts control over the boisterous city. The future of "one country, two systems" hangs in the balance as democracy remains elusive.
