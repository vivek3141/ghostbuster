Pro-Democracy Protesters Attempt to Disrupt Historic Hong Kong Meeting 

Hundreds of pro-democracy protesters gathered outside Hong Kong’s Legislative Council building today in an attempt to disrupt the first meeting of the newly elected council. The meeting marked the first time mainland China exerted direct influence over the selection of Hong Kong’s leaders, with about half of the 70 councilors elected by an election committee dominated by pro-Beijing representatives.

Chanting “Defend Hong Kong” and “Oppose tyranny,” the protesters attempted to block councilors and invited guests from entering the building. Scuffles broke out as police moved in to disperse the crowds and make way for attendees to pass through. Four protesters were arrested for disorderly conduct. 

The election of the councilors earlier this month was seen as a blow to Hong Kong’s autonomy under the “one country, two systems” framework in place since the United Kingdom handed Hong Kong over to China in 1997. All candidates were vetted for their loyalty to Beijing before being allowed to run for election. Critics argue that China has reneged on its promise to maintain Hong Kong’s administrative independence for 50 years after the handover.

In a short speech ahead of the meeting, Carrie Lam, the Beijing-backed leader of Hong Kong, praised the “successful election” and said the new council would help bring more prosperity and stability to Hong Kong. “With a council aligned in purpose, we can better seize the opportunities available to us in China’s development and the Greater Bay Area initiative,” she said, referring to China’s plan to integrate Hong Kong, Macau, and nine other cities in southern China.

The meeting proceeded despite the protests outside, though two councilors representing the pro-democracy opposition gave short speeches decrying the erosion of freedom in Hong Kong before being ejected from the chamber. The pro-establishment councilors now outnumber the pro-democracy opposition by about 2 to 1, giving Beijing much more influence over policymaking in the semi-autonomous region. The protesters vowed to continue rallies against what they see as the end of democratic values in Hong Kong. “This is only the beginning of the fight,” said Lee Cheuk-yan, a former pro-democracy lawmaker.
