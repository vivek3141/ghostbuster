Britain and China agree on new anti-espionage law for Hong Kong, but warn against making major legal changes before handover 

Britain and China have reached an agreement to introduce a new anti-espionage law in Hong Kong ahead of the territory’s handover from British to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997. However, leaders from both sides warned against making any major changes to Hong Kong’s legal system in the final months of British administration.

The new law, announced in a joint statement from British Prime Minister John Major and Chinese Premier Li Peng, will prohibit espionage and other intelligence gathering activities in Hong Kong that threaten national security. Penalties for violations of the law may include life imprisonment. The law is aimed at protecting state secrets and preventing foreign interference in Hong Kong following the handover.

Even as the new anti-espionage law was unveiled, Britain and China cautioned against revising other aspects of Hong Kong’s common law legal system before the handover. “There should be no fundamental changes that alter the nature of Hong Kong’s system,” the joint statement said. Britain has administered Hong Kong as a colony for 150 years and the territory has developed an independent judiciary and civil liberties unlike mainland China. 

Preserving Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy and legal system after 1997 was a key part of the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed in 1984. That agreement paved the way for Britain to hand over sovereignty of Hong Kong to China while allowing the territory to maintain its own political and economic systems for 50 years. 

Some pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong expressed concerns that the new anti-espionage law could be used to curb civil liberties and political dissent after the handover. But Chinese officials dismissed those fears, saying the law only targets acts that threaten national security while upholding basic rights and freedoms. With less than eight months left until the transfer of power, all eyes are on China to ensure a smooth transition and honor its pledge to maintain Hong Kong’s autonomy and way of life.
