Chinese dissident's 11-year sentencing sparks fears of curbs on freedoms in Hong Kong post-handover  

The sentencing of a prominent Hong Kong democracy activist to 11 years in prison has sparked fears that China is tightening control over the city and clamping down on civil liberties. 

Jimmy Lai, the 73-year-old founder of the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, was sentenced for charges including fraud and foreign collusion. Lai is the most high-profile opposition figure to be targeted under Hong Kong's sweeping national security law, which was imposed by Beijing last year following widespread protests.

Critics argue that Lai's heavy sentencing is a sign that China aims to silence dissent and weaken Hong Kong's autonomy in the years following the handover from Britain in 1997. Under the "one country, two systems" principle, the territory was meant to retain its freedoms and independent judiciary for 50 years. However, Beijing has been exerting more control in recent years.

"This outrageous verdict is a travesty of justice that demonstrates the Chinese Communist party’s determination to eliminate dissent and press freedom in Hong Kong,” said William Nee, Amnesty International’s business and human rights researcher. The US, Britain and EU have also condemned Lai's sentencing and argued that Beijing is failing to honor its commitments to the handover agreement.

Supporters of the security law counter that it has restored stability after the 2019 protests. Chinese state media have branded Lai a "traitor" and his newspaper an "anti-China separatist" publication. On Thursday, the China Daily newspaper said Lai got what he deserved and warned that "those who try to disrupt Hong Kong will face legal punishment."

However, Lai’s heavy sentencing has fueled worries that the security law’s broad definitions of terrorism, subversion and foreign collusion could be used to target anyone who speaks out against the Hong Kong or Chinese governments. It has already led to the arrests of over 100 opposition figures, including journalists and students. Critics fear the worst is yet to come as Beijing continues to strengthen its grip over Hong Kong.
