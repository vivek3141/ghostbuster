Annual Macau Grand Prix attracts commercial sponsors despite concerns over competition from nearby Chinese track 

The Macau Grand Prix, one of the most prestigious motor racing events in Asia, kicks off this weekend for its 66th edition. Despite concerns that the emergence of major tracks in China could draw sponsors and viewers away from the historic Macau race, organizers announced multiple new commercial deals this week to ensure the event's long term financial viability.

The Macau Grand Prix is known for its challenging street circuit that winds through the narrow roads of the picturesque former Portuguese colony. The famous Guia Circuit has been likened to a mix of the Monaco Grand Prix and the Bathurst 1000, with tight turns, short straights, and little room for error. The unique setting and track configuration has given the Macau Grand Prix a cult-like following in the motor racing world.

In recent years, however, new purpose-built tracks in China like the Shanghai International Circuit have raised concerns that sponsors and audiences may shift their focus away from the Macau Grand Prix. The Shanghai circuit now hosts the Chinese Grand Prix, a Formula One race that is growing in prominence.  Other tracks in Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces also compete with Macau to host major racing events.

Despite the new competition, organizers of the Macau Grand Prix announced multi-year sponsorship deals with several companies this week, ensuring the event's financial stability for years to come. Junket operator SJM Holdings, Macau's largest casino company, renewed its long-term sponsorship of the Macau Grand Prix's marquee FIA GT World Cup. SJM's deal is reported to be worth over MOP 30 million (US$3.75 million) over 3 years.

Other first-time sponsors include Chinese sports brand Dada Supreme, Macanese telecom operator CTM, and Hong Kong-based budget airline HK Express. The new sponsorships highlight the enduring appeal of the Macau Grand Prix to audiences and corporate partners both locally and regionally.
