Montana Construction Mogul Dennis Washington Rescues Morrison Knudsen Corp from Near-Insolvency  

BOISE, Idaho—Morrison Knudsen Corporation, one of the largest civil engineering and construction firms in the U.S., is back from the brink of collapse thanks to a white knight rescue by Montana billionaire Dennis Washington.

Washington, 75, who built a fortune from construction and mining in the Pacific Northwest, purchased a majority stake in the struggling Boise-based company in a deal announced yesterday. The $350 million investment brings Washington's ownership to 60% of MK, with an option to take full control over the next two years. 

“I have long admired Morrison Knudsen and believed in its potential,” Washington said. “It is an Idaho institution that needed help, and I plan to provide that help to revitalize this once-great company.”

Morrison Knudsen’s troubles came to a head last year as costs overruns and project delays mounted. The company struggled under $1 billion in debt and unpaid bills from suppliers totaling $100 million. MK’s share price plunged, and its credit rating was cut to “junk” status. Rumors of bankruptcy swirled.

The white knight deal by Washington, an MK board member, provides MK with an immediate $150 million cash infusion to settle debts and access to another $200 million in potential future loans. Washington also extended personal guarantees to reassure suppliers, subcontractors and sureties. 

“MK was in a free fall, but Dennis grabbed ahold and pulled us out,” said CEO Bill Agee. “His support is a huge boost for our 8,500 employees worldwide.” 

MK’s troubles stem from fixed-price projects, like a $1.6 billion rental car facility at Denver Airport, that suffered large losses. Washington pledged new business practices, including a focus on cost-plus contracts that reduce financial risk. 

The son of working-class immigrants, Washington grew up during the Depression and dropped out of college to support his family. He started his first construction company at age 18 with a $500 loan. Over six decades, he built a diversified mining, transportation and hospitality empire worth $5.4 billion, according to Forbes. 

Though an MK board member since 1999, Washington kept a low profile. His rescue, following the death of his wife and daughter in a helicopter crash last year, surprised many. But longtime associate Peter Knobel said, “Dennis is a take-charge person who doesn’t like defeat. He believes in Morrison Knudsen and made sure it survived.”

Washington's bold move salvaged an important Idaho employer and contractor for projects like the Bay Area Rapid Transit system. Yet challenges remain, including winning back customer confidence and reducing dependence on fixed-price contracts. With the legendary DC-3 aircraft, another icon that Washington restored years ago, now on display in his company lobby, he aims to revive an American industrial legend in MK. Under Washington’s leadership, a new chapter in the Morrison Knudsen story may just be beginning.
