Microsoft Releases New MSN Online Service, Emphasizing Entertainment Programming as "Next Mass Medium"   

Microsoft Corp. today unveiled a revamped version of its MSN online service, repositioning it as an entertainment hub for watching TV shows, movies, and other video programming over the Internet.  

The new MSN, to be launched this fall, will feature hundreds of hours of new and classic TV shows, movies, music videos, and other short-form content from media companies like CBS, Fox, NBC Universal, and Sony. The content will be available to watch for free, with short commercial breaks.

"Entertainment is the next mass medium, and MSN will be at the forefront of that," said Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's Entertainment and Devices division. "We see this as a chance to reinvent TV and make high-quality shows and movies accessible on the Web."

The move signals a major strategic shift for MSN, which has struggled to compete against rivals like Yahoo and AOL. Until now, MSN has primarily focused on news, sports, and other informational content. But with online viewership and advertising budgets shifting to video, Microsoft hopes to turn MSN into a hub for mass-market entertainment.  

"This is a pivotal moment for MSN," said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of the MSN business. "We are making a big bet on video as the future of online media and aiming to position MSN as the premier destination for high-quality shows and movies on the Web."

The new MSN entertainment portal will feature content deals with most major studios and TV networks. Shows available at launch will include hits like "CSI," "Survivor," and "The Office," as well as a library of older favorites like "Seinfeld," "Frasier" and "Miami Vice." New episodes of many current shows will be added within 24 hours of airing on TV.  

The portal will also include MSN's existing coverage of news, sports, lifestyle, and finance. But entertainment and video will be the primary focus and main draw, Microsoft executives said.

The revamped MSN is the latest sign of how tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Apple are rushing to stake claims in the fast-growing business of streaming media and online video. While the effort is risky, the payoff could be huge if MSN's entertainment portal succeeds in attracting viewers and ad dollars away from traditional TV.
