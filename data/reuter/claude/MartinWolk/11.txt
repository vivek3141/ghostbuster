Boeing's Acquisition of Rockwell's Defense and Space Business Expected to Close in December 

Boeing announced today that it expects to close its acquisition of Rockwell International's defense and space business by the end of December. The $3.2 billion all-cash deal was first announced in August and approved  by Rockwell shareholders earlier this month. Regulatory approval is still pending but Boeing said all signs point to final approval by December 31st.

The acquisition will expand Boeing's space and defense capabilities and complement its existing satellite, rocket, and aircraft programs. Rockwell is a leader in space exploration, including the manufacturing of components and systems for the space shuttle program. With this acquisition, Boeing will take control of major NASA and US Department of Defense contracts that Rockwell currently oversees, positioning Boeing as a dominant player in the space and defense sectors.

"We are looking forward to welcoming the thousands of talented Rockwell employees into the Boeing team," said Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg.  "Together, we will leverage our people, products, and capabilities to unleash the promise of space and defense for customers around the world."

The acquisition significantly expands Boeing's space portfolio. Rockwell is the primary contractor for NASA's space shuttle program and jointly built the shuttle orbiters in Palmdale, California.  Its rocket motors and propulsion systems are also used in Delta rockets, Atlas rockets, and NASA's new heavy-lift rocket known as the Space Launch System. By acquiring Rockwell, Boeing will take over manufacturing operations at all major space shuttle facilities including Palmdale, Florida's Kennedy Space Center, and Houston's Johnson Space Center.  

On the defense side, Rockwell develops and produces electronic warfare systems, precision weapons, missile defense technologies, and autonomous systems. These will complement Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet programs and its KC-46 aerial refueling tanker. Industry analysts expect Boeing to achieve considerable cost synergies by integrating management and operations across the space and defense units.   

While Boeing's space and defense businesses continue to face uncertainty, the Rockwell acquisition provides much-needed growth opportunities, especially on the space side. Once the deal closes, Boeing will begin the multi-year process of integrating Rockwell into its existing space and defense businesses. Rockwell's capabilities and contracts will allow Boeing to expand its presence as a prime contractor for NASA and defense programs during a pivotal time for the space agency and amid increasing geopolitical tensions.
