Microsoft's Q1 Earnings Growth Slows Down Due to Launch of Windows 95 Last Year

Microsoft Corp. reported a slowdown in earnings growth for the first quarter, ending September 30. The company's profits increased just 8% from a year earlier, a sharp decline from the robust growth of recent quarters. 

The slowdown was attributed primarily to strong sales last year of Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system. The new operating system, released in August 1995, spurred a surge of sales that made for a difficult comparison this year. Sales were also hampered this quarter by a slump in demand as many customers waited for Microsoft's latest products.

Microsoft's net income for the quarter rose to $486 million, up from $450 million. Revenue increased 12% to $2.22 billion. While profits and revenue were up from last year, the growth rate was slower than in any quarter over the past two years. The results were slightly below analysts' forecasts.

"There's no question the launch of Windows 95 created a bubble of demand that we benefited from last year," said Gregory Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer. "With our new operating system, Windows 97, coming out next month, many customers chose to wait to buy new PCs or upgrade existing ones."

Windows 97 is the latest version of Microsoft's operating system for personal computers. Microsoft hopes demand for Windows 97 and other new products will revive growth, but some analysts are concerned that the company's breakneck expansion may be slowing as competition intensifies in the software industry. 

"Microsoft's era of unbridled growth is coming to an end," said Melissa Eisenstat, software analyst at CIBC Wood Gundy. "As their business has skyrocketed to dominate the PC market, it's become much harder to maintain the momentum."

Microsoft officials remain upbeat. "Our business continues to perform well within our long-term growth objectives," said William Gates, chairman and chief executive. "We have a terrific lineup of products for the holiday season and beyond, so we feel excitement in the air."

The company's stock declined slightly in after-hours trading following the earnings report. Microsoft shares had risen 4% in regular trading before the announcement.
