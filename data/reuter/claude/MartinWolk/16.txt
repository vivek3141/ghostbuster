Odwalla Juice Recall Linked to E. Coli Outbreak in Seattle 

Odwalla, the popular Seattle-based juice and smoothie maker, issued a recall today of their popular Mixed Carrot and Orange juice products. The recall comes after Seattle and King County health officials linked an E. coli bacteria outbreak to the beverages that has caused at least 18 reported illnesses since late last week.

According to a spokeswoman for Public Health Seattle King County, the outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli has led to 4 hospitalizations so far, including 2 children under the age of 5. "We are advising all residents to avoid drinking Odwalla Mixed Carrot and Orange juice products with 'Best By' dates between June 21 and July 5," said the spokeswoman. "These juices have been linked to several confirmed E. coli cases in the region through genetic fingerprinting of the bacteria."

In a statement, Odwalla said they were "taking this extremely seriously and are working closely with health officials." Odwalla said the products were prepared in a facility that cleans and sanitizes all equipment daily, but they are currently investigating how the contamination may have occurred. The recall impacts all Mixed Carrot and Orange juice with those "Best By" dates, which were sold in stores across Washington, Oregon, and northern Idaho.

E. coli contamination of produce and juices can have life-threatening health effects, especially in young children and the elderly. Symptoms of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infection include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea, and in some cases may require hospitalization due to kidney failure. Health officials have advised all who experience these symptoms and have recently consumed Odwalla Mixed Carrot and Orange juices to see their doctor right away. 

Odwalla is offering full refunds for any returned products. Consumers are also urged to dispose of any product they may have at home that falls within the recalled "Best By" date range. The recall is the first for Odwalla since 1996 when a similar E. coli outbreak linked to their unpasteurized apple juice sickened at least 66 people, killing a 16-month-old girl. Odwalla began pasteurizing all of their juices and smoothies in the aftermath of that outbreak.
