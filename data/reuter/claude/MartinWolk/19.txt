Boeing to Launch Long-Awaited Stretch Version of 747 Jumbo Jet at Farnborough Air Show 

Boeing is preparing to announce the launch of the 747-10, a stretched and upgraded version of its iconic 747 jumbo jet, at the Farnborough International Airshow this week. The 747-10 will be 18 feet longer than the current 747-8, allowing it to carry up to 50 more passengers and more cargo. 

The announcement comes as Boeing grapples with delays and setbacks in other aircraft programs, including the 737 MAX and 777X. The U.S. planemaker hopes the launch of an enhanced version of its most recognizable jet can generate enthusiasm, especially with cargo airlines and Middle Eastern carriers. 

“The 747-10 is a win-win for Boeing, allowing it to refresh the 747 program with minimal investment while meeting customer demand for incremental capacity and efficiency improvements,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst with Teal Group.

Boeing has been discussing a potential stretch version of the 747-8 for years but delayed plans repeatedly to focus resources on other, more critical programs. With the 737 MAX grounding stretching into 2020 and the 777X delayed until at least 2021, Boeing is eager for a smooth new program to highlight. 

The 747-10 will feature the same airframe and engines as the 747-8, with changes focused on an extended upper deck to accommodate more seats. Boeing claims the 747-10 will have the lowest seat-mile costs of any large commercial jet, though it is still likely to lag efficiency of newer twin-engine jets like the A350 and 787.

“The 747-10 is a natural derivative that will provide growth opportunities for our customers, especially in cargo operations and high-volume passenger routes,” said Ihssane Mounir, senior vice president of Commercial Sales & Marketing at Boeing. “This airplane will continue the 747's legacy of providing world-leading payload and reliability.”

Lufthansa and Cathay Pacific are reportedly launch customers for the passenger version of the 747-10. Both carriers currently operate the 747-8 and are seeking incremental capacity growth. Cargo operators like UPS, Cargolux, and Atlas Air are prime candidates for the 747-10 freighter.

Despite Boeing's confidence, the 747 program faces significant headwinds. The four-engine 747 has become less attractive as twin-engine aircraft have developed the range and capacity to serve most long-haul routes. High fuel costs have also worked against the 747. Boeing last year cut production of the 747 to just six planes per year, threatening future viability of the program.

The 747-10 provides a short-term boost, but Boeing will need far more significant enhancements to ensure the 747 remains part of its future product lineup. Even with committed 747-10 customers, Boeing's jumbo jet may still struggle for relevance in a market dominated by nimbler twins. For now, though, Boeing will celebrate reigniting interest in its iconic Queen of the Skies.
