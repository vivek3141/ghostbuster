Boeing Co. Sees 13% Profit Increase in Q3 on High Sales of Commercial Jets and Rising Interest Income

Boeing Co. reported a 13% increase in third-quarter profit on Wednesday, driven by strong sales of commercial jetliners and a substantial gain in interest income. The company also raised its financial guidance for the full year as it continues to recover from the 737 MAX grounding and pandemic-related turmoil. 

The aircraft maker reported net income of $1.16 billion, or $1.94 a share, up from $1.02 billion, or $1.72 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5% to $15.61 billion. Analysts had expected per-share earnings of $1.76 on revenue of $16.19 billion.

Boeing delivered 85 commercial aircraft in the third quarter, a 47% increase over last year when the 737 MAX grounding and pandemic were severely hampering operations. The company remains on track to deliver about half of its total backlog of commercial jets this year. Revenue from Boeing’s commercial airplanes unit rose 26% driven by the increase in deliveries.

The company also benefited from higher interest income due to rising interest rates. Its pension expenses declined, contributing about 23 cents a share to the quarter’s per-share profit.

CEO Dave Calhoun said in a statement that Boeing is “building stability and predictability" across its operations. Despite supply chain issues and a tight labor market, Boeing expects to continue ramping up production and deliveries of 737 MAX and 787 jets. It raised its financial guidance, projecting full-year revenue of $68 billion to $70 billion, up from $66 billion to $68 billion previously. Core earnings per share are forecast at $9.45 to $9.65, up from $9.20 to $9.40 earlier.  

The results cap a tumultuous period for Boeing following two deadly crashes of its 737 MAX jet and the COVID-19 pandemic. Boeing only resumed 737 MAX deliveries in late 2020 after a lengthy grounding, while demand for aircraft has been gradually recovering. The company has also grappled with structural issues on some 787 Dreamliners, though it aims to resume deliveries of those jets by year-end.

Shares of Boeing rose 4% in premarket trading following the results. The stock is up about 15% this year, though it remains more than 40% below its prepandemic peak in early 2019.
