Boeing Defense and Space Group President Optimistic About Joint Strike Fighter Program Survival 

The president of Boeing's Defense and Space group said today that he is optimistic the Joint Strike Fighter program will continue under the new administration. Speaking at a press conference, Ted Colbert said he believes the program is too critical to national security to be canceled.

The Joint Strike Fighter, also known as the F-35 Lightning II, is the Department of Defense's largest and most ambitious aircraft program. Over 2,400 of the stealth multi-role fighters are planned for the U.S. military and 10 allied nations. However, the $400 billion program has faced delays, cost overruns, and technical challenges. In December, President-elect Johnson said he would re-evaluate the "out of control" costs of the F-35 program.

"While we understand the concerns about costs and past challenges, the F-35 delivers essential 5th generation capabilities that our military services need and our allies depend on," said Colbert. "It has proven itself highly effective in exercises and deployments over the last two years. We are confident that upon a thorough review of the facts, the new administration will see the value and necessity of this vital program."

The F-35 comes in three variants for the Air Force, Marines, and Navy. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor, with Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems also providing major subsystems and components. Boeing produces electronic systems, software, weapons carriage systems, and pilot life support equipment for the F-35. The company generated over $1.2 billion in revenue from the F-35 program in 2016, according to Colbert.

Critics argue the program is plagued by fundamental design flaws and cost so much it jeopardizes funding for other military priorities. Supporters counter that the next-generation fighter is required to counter emerging threats like China's J-20 fifth-generation stealth fighter and Russia's Sukhoi Su-57 fighter jet. As rival nations continue to advance their air capabilities, they say, air superiority is critical to U.S. national security.

The fate of the F-35 now rests with President-elect Johnson's administration. Colbert said Boeing will work closely with the new defense leadership as they review the program and determine next steps. But with so much invested in the program and important capabilities at stake, there is hope the new team will keep the Joint Strike Fighter alive and flying.
