Microsoft Reports Better-Than-Expected Profits for Q1, Fueled by Strong Demand for Windows 95 and Windows NT  

Microsoft Corp. surprised Wall Street today by reporting stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue for its fiscal first quarter, thanks to surging demand for its Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems.

The software giant said profit rose 38% to $788 million, or 94 cents a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $570 million, or 68 cents, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 41% to $3.78 billion from $2.69 billion.

Analysts had expected Microsoft to earn 85 cents a share on revenue of $3.61 billion, according to a survey by First Call.

"The demand for Windows 95 since its launch in August exceeded even our optimistic projections," said Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates in a statement. "Windows 95 is the most successful software product in history, and customer enthusiasm for Windows NT is also very strong."

Microsoft said it sold more than 1.5 million copies of Windows 95 in the first four days after its release, making it the fastest-selling software product ever. The new operating system features a revamped user interface, built-in Internet capabilities and simplified networking.

Sales of the professional version of Windows NT, which runs on corporate computer networks, also rose sharply. Microsoft said NT sales to businesses grew over 50% from a year ago.  

The strong early sales are a good sign for Microsoft, which generates a large chunk of its revenue and an even bigger portion of its profits from new releases of its dominant Windows operating system software. The company has promised Wall Street double-digit percentage growth in revenue and earnings per share for its full fiscal year.

Based on the first-quarter results and growth projections for Windows, most analysts say Microsoft is on track to meet or beat those forecasts. The company's shares, which have soared 50% so far this year, rose 3 1/4 to 111 1/4 in after-hours trading following the earnings report.
