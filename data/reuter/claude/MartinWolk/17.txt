Tainted Apple Juice Linked to E. Coli Outbreak, Odwalla Issues Recall  

Odwalla, a popular producer of fresh juices and smoothies, issued a voluntary recall of several of its apple juice products after reports of at least 15 cases of E. coli-related illness linked to the drinks. The recall comes after the presence of E. coli O157:H7 was confirmed in a bottle of Odwalla apple juice. 

E. coli O157:H7 is a virulent strain of the common bacteria found in the digestive tracts of cattle and other ruminants. While most E. coli are harmless, this particular strain produces toxins that can cause severe illness in humans, especially in young children and the elderly. Symptoms of infection include diarrhea, often bloody, abdominal cramps, and occasionally fever. In some cases, complications such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) can lead to potentially life-threatening kidney failure.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 15 cases of E. coli infection linked to Odwalla apple juice products have been reported in southern California and Washington state. The cases were reported between October 19 and November 8. The afflicted individuals range in age from 1 to 33 years old. Three of the cases developed HUS, though no deaths have been reported.

In response to the outbreak, Odwalla has recalled the following products: all sizes and dates of Odwalla Fresh Apple Juice, Odwalla Carrot Juice, and Odwalla Lemonade manufactured on or after August 28th. The recalled products were distributed to retail outlets and food service operators in Arizona, California, Colorado, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and British Columbia. 

Consumers are advised not to drink the recalled juice products and to throw them out.  Odwalla is offering refunds for returned product. The company continues to work closely with health officials to determine how the contamination occurred and has hired outside experts to review their production facilities and processes. Odwalla had previously prided itself on a natural process that avoided pasteurization of its products in order to retain more nutrients, but the company is now considering flash pasteurization to kill any harmful pathogens while maintaining nutritional quality.

The recall and outbreak have dealt a blow to Odwalla, whose fresh juiced and smoothie products have become very popular in recent years. The company saw its stock price drop by over 30% following the news. Odwalla was acquired by Coca-Cola in 2001 as part of an effort to appeal to health-conscious consumers.
