29 Cases of Bacterial Poisoning Linked to Odwalla Apple Juice Confirmed, FDA Testing Store Shelves for Contamination

The Food and Drug Administration has confirmed 29 cases of E. coli poisoning linked to Odwalla apple juice and other beverages in several states. The FDA is currently testing product samples from store shelves and from several production facilities as officials try to pinpoint the source of the contamination. 

According to the CDC, the outbreak has sickened 16 people in Colorado, 10 people in Washington state, and 3 people in California so far. While no deaths have been reported, several victims have been hospitalized due to severe dehydration as a result of the bacterial infection. E. coli contamination often causes abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting.

The FDA issued a warning to consumers today urging them to avoid Odwalla apple juice and other beverages until further notice. “Out of an abundance of caution, we are advising consumers to avoid Odwalla brand products at this time as we conduct a review of the company's production facilities and test product currently on store shelves,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn in a statement.

Odwalla Inc., based in Half Moon Bay, California, produces fresh juices and smoothies that are widely distributed in the western United States. The company has issued a voluntary recall of several products including Odwalla Fresh Organics 100% Raw Apple Juice and Odwalla Superfood Smoothies in certain sizes and lot codes. A full list of recalled products is available on the company's website.

“We take this situation very seriously and are working closely with health officials to identify the source of this outbreak,” said Odwalla CEO Tim Collins. “We sincerely apologize to anyone affected by this situation.”

The FDA is advising anyone who has recently consumed Odwalla products and experiences symptoms of E. coli infection to contact their health care provider immediately. Consumers with questions about the recall can call Odwalla at (800) 639-2552. The investigation into the source of the contamination is ongoing and more updates will be provided as information becomes available.
