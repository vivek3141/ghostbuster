Microsoft Launches New MSN Online Service with Emphasis on Entertainment Programming and Aims to Double Subscribers by Mid-1997  

Microsoft Corp. today launched a major revamp of its MSN online service, emphasizing entertainment and lifestyle content in an effort to double the number of subscribers to 3 million by mid-1997. 

The new MSN, which goes live today, will feature interactive programming from major entertainment companies, including Warner Bros., Sony, MGM, and Buena Vista Pictures. The content will include movie trailers, entertainment news, and behind-the-scenes footage from popular TV shows. MSN will also enable users to purchase movie tickets and music CDs online.

“We see a huge opportunity to bring the Internet into people's living rooms as a source for interactive entertainment and community,” said Brad Chase, vice president of MSN at Microsoft. “The revamped MSN integrates the Web with interactive TV features to give mainstream consumers compelling reasons to go online."

In addition to the entertainment content, the new MSN home page will provide news headlines, sports scores, stock quotes, and local weather. Users will be able to customize the site to display information relevant to their interests and local communities. MSN will also offer interactive versions of popular magazines like Newsweek, Popular Mechanics, and Working Mother. 

Microsoft expects the new entertainment and community features to significantly boost subscriber numbers, which currently stand at about 1.5 million. The company aims to double that figure to 3 million subscribers by June 1997. Key to that growth is making MSN easier to access and more useful, according to Microsoft. The company has redesigned the MSN site and subscription options to simplify the process of getting online. MSN access software also provides one-click access to the most popular areas of the service.

The new MSN features tighter integration with Internet Explorer, Microsoft's Web browser, enabling users to move quickly between the MSN service and the Web. Subscribers can continue using their current Internet service providers or switch to MSN's access options. MSN service plans range from $4.95 to $19.95 per month.

In addition to the content deals with major entertainment companies, MSN announced alliances with more than 20 community, sports, and special interest groups to provide local information and resources on the new service. The company sees strong opportunities to target niche audiences like families, sports fans, investors, and hobbyists. 

With the launch of the redesigned MSN, Microsoft is betting that mainstream consumers want online interactivity and community as much as Internet technology and information. By bundling entertainment and lifestyle content with news, information, and Web access, MSN could emerge as a formidable competitor to America Online and other large consumer online services. But substantial growth will depend on how quickly mainstream Americans flock to the Internet for interactive entertainment. Today's rollout of the new MSN is the first big step in Microsoft's vision for interactive TV-style programming and community online.
