Boeing Set to Unveil New 747 Jumbo Jet Models at Farnborough Air Show  

Boeing is preparing to unveil the latest updates to its iconic 747 jumbo jet program at the Farnborough International Airshow in the UK this week. The US aerospace giant will display two new 747-8 models: a 747-8 Freighter and an upgraded 747-8 Intercontinental passenger jet.

The new 747 variants feature improved aerodynamics and wingspan increases that boost fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. The upgrades are part of Boeing's plan to revitalize sales of the four-engine 747, which has seen demand soften in recent years as airlines move toward more fuel-efficient twin-engine aircraft.

"The 747-8 is the world's most efficient four-engine airplane and the Intercontinental is the quietest airplane in its class," said Ihssane Mounir, senior vice president of Commercial Sales & Marketing for The Boeing Company. "These attributes, combined with the spaciousness that only the unique 747-8 architecture can offer, will provide a remarkably smoother, more enjoyable experience for our passengers."

Boeing has received 18 orders for the new 747-8 Freighter and 36 orders for the Intercontinental passenger jet since the programs were launched in 2005. The first redesigned variants were delivered in 2012. The company hopes improvements to the jets will spur additional sales and restore the 747's status as an industry workhorse, though some analysts are skeptical given trends toward smaller long-haul jets.

"The 747 has been a hugely successful aircraft program over many decades, but faces significant headwinds in today's aviation market where fuel efficiency is increasingly important," said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at Teal Group. "The latest variants provide some useful improvements but probably still won't be enough in an era where the very largest four-engine jets are facing their worst environment in decades."

The 747 is Boeing's most recognizable model and has been in service since 1970. With its distinctive hump-shaped upper deck, the jet popularized long-haul commercial flight and made international travel more accessible. The newest 747-8 variant can seat 467 passengers and has a range of 7,730 nautical miles. Boeing also offers freight versions that can transport 134 tons of cargo.

The Farnborough Airshow, held every two years, showcases the latest in commercial and military aircraft and attracts aviation and aerospace experts from around the world. Boeing and rival Airbus often use the event to unveil new aircraft orders and promote their latest plane models to customers. The 2018 show runs from July 16 to July 22.
