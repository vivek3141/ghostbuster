Invesco Plc to Merge with AIM Management Group Inc., Creating One of World's Largest Investment Management Businesses 

Invesco Plc, a large independent global investment management company, announced today that it will merge with AIM Management Group Inc. in an all-stock deal valued at approximately $6.2 billion. The combined company will have more than $1.2 trillion in assets under management, making it one of the largest investment managers in the world.

The merger brings together two highly complementary businesses. Invesco is focused on active fund management across equities, fixed income, alternatives and multi-asset solutions. AIM is a market leader in passive strategies, especially index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Combining the two firms will allow the new Invesco to capitalize on fast-growing areas of the investment industry and provide a wider range of investment capabilities and vehicles to clients.

"This is a truly transformative combination that will strengthen our ability to deliver comprehensive investment solutions to clients around the world," said Martin Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco. Judith Peters, CEO of AIM, added, "By joining forces with Invesco, we will improve our competitive position through greater scale and diversification."

Under the terms of the all-stock deal, AIM shareholders will receive 2.75 Invesco shares for each AIM share. The transaction has been approved by the boards of both companies but still requires regulatory and shareholder approvals. The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year.

Invesco and AIM have a strong combined presence in North America as well as growing businesses in Europe and Asia. They believe the merger will generate at least $475 million in cost synergies and drive stronger growth across geographies. "This combination will enable us to deepen client relationships, strengthen our talent base, and capture operational efficiencies," said Flanagan.

While ongoing fee pressure and competition from low-cost passive funds have posed challenges for active managers like Invesco, the company is hoping that greater scale will help it invest in new capabilities, gain additional distribution channels and boost profitability over the long run. The stock market reacted positively to the announcement, with shares of both Invesco and AIM rising more than 10% in early trading.
