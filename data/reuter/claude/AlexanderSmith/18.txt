Regulators and Politicians Call for Razor-Sharp Management in Financial Firms 

Top financial regulators and politicians are calling for major improvements in risk management and oversight at large banks and other financial institutions. In speeches and interviews over the past week, officials have argued that financial firms need tighter controls and vigilance to avoid the types of risk failures that led to the financial crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession.

The calls for sharpened risk management come as many of the largest banks are reporting strong profits and are pushing to reduce regulations put in place after the crisis. But regulators argue that risk remains in parts of the system, especially with complex trading strategies, leverage, and exposures that could quickly unwind in a crisis.

“We need the people who run these firms to be extremely prudent and cautious,” said Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, in an interview. “They need to maintain very robust risk management and controls.” Mr. Powell argued that memories of the crisis fade over time and that both bankers and regulators needed to fight against complacency.

Other officials have echoed those concerns. At a banking conference, Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, warned against “weakening reforms too soon.” In Europe, Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, called risk management the “first line of defense” and worried that some banks were still too weak to weather a major downturn.  

Politicians have joined in the calls for action as well. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent banking critic, argued this week that fines against financial firms were not enough and that executives needed to face serious consequences, including potential jail time, for failures of oversight and risk controls. “Bankers skate away, and taxpayers are left picking up the pieces,” Ms. Warren said in a speech on the Senate floor.

Of course, sharpening risk management is easier said than done. Tougher oversight needs to be balanced with banks’ ability to generate profits, and rules require consistent enforcement. But regulators argue that a safer system is better for the overall economy, even if it weighs on bank shares in the short term. The question now is whether calls for more stringent risk controls will lead to concrete policy changes or merely fade into the background once memories of the crisis recede further. For now, at least, sharpening the blade of risk management seems to remain a regulatory imperative.
