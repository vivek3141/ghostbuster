Lloyd's Insurance Market Receives Favorable U.S. District Court Ruling and Extends Recovery Plan Deadline 

The Lloyd’s  insurance market received a favorable ruling yesterday from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York regarding its plan for U.S. policyholders. The court approved an extension of the deadline for Lloyd’s to implement its “Reconstruction and Renewal” plan to December 31, 2023.

The initial deadline for the plan was the end of this year, but Lloyd's petitioned the court for an extension due to the ongoing economic challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The extension will give Lloyd’s additional time to restructure its operations, strengthen its balance sheet, and continue improving services for policyholders.

“This ruling is welcome news and provides important breathing room for Lloyd’s as we continue advancing our transformation program,” said Bruce Carnegie-Brown, Chairman of Lloyd’s. “The extension will enable us to make thorough and well-considered changes that will bolster Lloyd’s ability to meet policyholders’ needs for the long term.”

The Reconstruction and Renewal plan was first proposed in 2019 to modernize Lloyd’s governance, underwriting processes, and use of technology. The plan aims to simplify policyholders’ interactions with Lloyd’s, reduce costs, and make Lloyd’s a more attractive and accessible marketplace, especially for U.S. policyholders. Lloyd’s has already made several improvements under the plan, including launching an electronic placement platform, streamlining complaints processes, and restructuring syndicates.

However, the economic fallout from the pandemic has hindered some of the plan’s initiatives and timelines. The requested deadline extension will provide more opportunity for Lloyd’s to strengthen its balance sheet through cost-cutting measures and selective underwriting before new capital requirements come into effect in 2022. The extension will also give Lloyd’s additional time to roll out a new electronic policy administration system for policyholders.
