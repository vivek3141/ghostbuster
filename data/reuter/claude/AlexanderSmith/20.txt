Over 90% of Lloyd's members accept settlement offer, securing insurance market's future

The historic Lloyd's of London insurance market announced today that over 90% of its members have agreed to contribute £4.4 billion ($5.6 billion) to settle legal disputes dating back decades. The announcement secures the future of the 330-year-old insurance institution, which faced billions in unfunded liabilities related to long-tail insurance policies written between 1970 and 1992.

The payout settles the majority of the claims that were set to be tried in the London High Court's Equitas Insurance scheme. The scheme was established in 1996 to investigate insurance policies written during that 22-year period to determine which policies were underfunded and required additional payments to cover claims.

“The agreement reached this month between Equitas and Lloyd's members to settle the vast majority of non-life syndicate years represents a landmark moment in Lloyd's history and secures its position as the world's leading specialist insurance and reinsurance market,” Lloyd's CEO John Neal said in a statement. 

The payments required from members represent less than 10% of Lloyd's own central funds and will not impact its day-to-day operations, Lloyd's said. Lloyd's operates in a similar manner to venture capital, with members forming syndicates to insure risk and underwrite policies. The settlement payments will be drawn from members based on their contributions to syndicates active during the period covered by Equitas.

Lloyd's faced criticism at the time over lack of control and oversight that allowed the shortfalls to emerge. In response, it implemented reforms to tighten risk management and governance practices. It transitioned from a traditional insurance marketplace where members accepted policies on an open-floor trading system to a licensed corporation with regulator oversight from the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority.

"This settlement is the final leg of a decades-long process of extensive restructuring at Lloyd's to ensure its continuing stability and success," said Lloyd's Chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown. "It allows our members and capital providers to face the future with certainty."  

With its future now secured, Lloyd's continues to focus on new opportunities like insuring intangible assets such as cyber security, renewable energy, and space satellites. Its unique structure, with 85 syndicates offering specialist underwriting expertise, allows it to insure complex emerging risks as well as more standard property and casualty policies. Lloyd's remains a pillar of the London insurance market, generating £44.5 billion in gross written premiums in 2019.
