Purge at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Expected After Fund Manager's Irregular Dealings Uncovered

Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, one of Germany's largest investment banks, is expected to announce a purge of its fund management division later this week following the discovery of irregular dealings by a senior fund manager, according to sources close to the firm. 

The fund manager, who has not yet been named pending an internal investigation, was found to have mispriced several prominent funds under their management in order to mask declining performance and collect higher fees. The mispricing went undetected for several months until a whistleblower raised concerns in mid-October.

Following the whistleblower report, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell launched an immediate inquiry with the assistance of external auditors and legal advisors. The preliminary findings indicate that the fund manager directed their team to provide valuations of securities in three funds that did not reflect the actual market prices of the underlying assets. By artificially inflating the net asset values of the funds, the fees charged to clients were increased by over €50 million over the course of 10 months.

Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's CEO, Jens Müller, called the findings "deeply disturbing and unacceptable." Although the amounts mispriced represent a small fraction of the €250 billion in total assets under management, Müller promised fast action to remove those responsible and strengthen controls. "We take our fiduciary responsibilities extremely seriously and will do whatever it takes to remedy this situation, make clients whole, and rebuild trust in our fund management services," he said in an internal memo.

The fund manager in question has worked at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell for 15 years but now faces immediate dismissal without severance. The team responsible for valuations and compliance will also see personnel changes and restructuring. The firm expects to conclude negotiations with clients over appropriate compensation within the next few months.

The Securities and Exchange Commission and German regulator BaFin have initiated a joint investigation into possible violations of securities laws and are reviewing whether to bring civil charges against Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in addition to the disciplinary actions being taken by the firm.
