Invesco and AIM Management Group to Merge, Creating One of the World's Largest Investment Management Firms  

Invesco Ltd., an independent global investment management firm, and AIM Management Group Inc. announced today they have entered into a definitive agreement to merge, creating one of the largest investment managers in the world with over $1.2 trillion in assets under management.

The combined company will operate under the Invesco name and will be headquartered in Atlanta and London. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.

The merger brings together two highly complementary businesses with a shared active investment management approach. The combined firm will have a presence in 25 countries with over 8,000 employees focused on delivering investment strategies, capabilities and services tailored to meet client needs.  

Martin L. Flanagan, president and CEO of Invesco, said, “This combination of two highly respected active managers will create an organization ideally positioned to win and retain the trust of clients globally. Together, we will have the scale, diversity, and financial strength to meet client needs through any market environment."

Paul Bateman, CEO of AIM, added, “We have long respected Invesco as a like-minded investment firm with a steadfast focus on investment excellence and client service. We now look forward to combining our strengths for the benefit of clients worldwide who will gain access to a broader range of outcome-oriented strategies and an expanded global presence while maintaining the high conviction active management Invesco and AIM are known for.”

Invesco provides a wide range of single-country, regional and global capabilities across major equity, fixed income, alternative and unit trust fund markets. Invesco has specialized investment teams supporting each of its strategies, with the shared goal of providing superior investment management expertise and outcomes for investors. 

AIM, founded in 1982, is one of Europe's largest and most experienced independent investment managers, with a reputation for innovation and excellence in active equity and alternative strategies. AIM provides specialist strategies across European, Asian and Emerging Market equities as well as alternative strategies.

The merger of these elite independent active investment managers demonstrates Invesco’s commitment to having the breadth and depth of capabilities to meet client outcomes in all market conditions, according to the company. The combination also highlights the strategic importance of having meaningful scale and a successful global presence to meet the evolving needs of clients.
