London's financial boutiques face mounting pressure from integrated investment banks after 10 years of success since "Big Bang" 

A decade after the 1986 "Big Bang" deregulation of London's financial markets opened the door for specialized boutique firms, these investment banks are facing increasing competitive pressure from large integrated rivals. The boutiques that sprouted in the wake of the Big Bang, focused on M&A advisory, equity issuance, and other fee-based banking services, have enjoyed strong growth and profits over the past 10 years. However, their focused business models now make them vulnerable to the large universal banks that have built up their advisory and capital markets capabilities.

The Big Bang removed many of the old restrictions on stockbroking firms and opened up London's markets to new entrants. Many of the new firms that launched in the late 1980s and early 1990s, like Lexicon Partners, Cazenove, and Close Brothers, focused on specific areas like advisory and equity issuance. Without the burden of costly trading desks and back-office functions required for lending and research, these "boutiques" operated with low overheads and high profits. They challenged the established merchant banks and also took business from the large commercial banks.

The boutiques have since established themselves as leading players in the London market and have expanded into new areas. However, the largest universal banks, like HSBC, Barclays, and NatWest, have been building up their own advisory and investment banking capabilities over the past decade. They now have large and experienced deal-making teams that can provide bundled commercial lending, advisory, and financing services to clients. The boutiques are finding it increasingly difficult to win mandates against these larger competitors.

"The universal banks now have credible investment banking operations and present a real threat to the boutiques," said George Charles, an analyst with London brokerage Wilson & Myers. "The boutiques may have to consolidate or join larger players if they want to survive and retain their market position over the longer term."

Some boutiques have launched joint ventures with larger players. Lexicon Partners, for instance, formed an alliance with Germany's Commerzbank in 2006. However, other firms are adamantly opposed to being absorbed into bigger players and losing their independent identities. Closing Brothers, a FTSE 250-listed firm, has grown rapidly through acquisitions but intends to remain an independent entity, according to CEO Stephen Hodges.

The boutiques still have some advantages, including specialization, flexibility, and highly incentivized workforces. They can also avoid the conflicts of interest that exist in large banks serving many different clients. But they lack the global reach, product breadth, and balance sheet strength of their bigger rivals. With competition intensifying in the London market, the boutiques may struggle to maintain their strong track record of success over the next 10 years. They face the choice of consolidating with peers, linking up with major banking partners, or potentially losing ground to the large integrated investment banks that now dominate the market. The environment for the niche firms in London is no longer as favorable as it was in the wake of the Big Bang.
