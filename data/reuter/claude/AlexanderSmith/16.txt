Greycoat Plc confident institutional shareholders will reject  proposal to break up company

Greycoat Plc, one of the largest diversified conglomerates in the UK, said today it believes major institutional shareholders will vote against a proposal next week to break up the company into five separately traded companies.

Activist investor Value First Partners LP, which owns a 2% stake in Greycoat, has put forward the proposal arguing investors would benefit from more focused companies in energy, technology, finance, pharmaceuticals and retail rather than the current complex conglomerate structure. However, Greycoat's management said in a letter to shareholders that the break-up would "destroy value at a massive and irreplaceable company."  

Greycoat's chief executive Jane Smith said, "Our diversity of strong, market-leading businesses across key sectors is our greatest strength. With a shared philosophy and complementary capabilities, together they are far more valuable than the sum of their parts." She highlighted the key benefits of diversification and synergies across businesses which a break-up would put at risk.  

Industry analysts noted the merits in both arguments. "There is increasing pressure on large conglomerates to simplify their businesses and structures to make them more focused and efficient," said George Wong, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. "However, breaking up a company with the scale and success of Greycoat also poses major risks, especially in such a challenging economic environment."

Value First argues the break-up would create five targeted, separately funded companies which would benefit from greater management focus and resources tailored to their needs. The energy company could accelerate investments in renewable energy, the technology company could spend more on research and development, and the finance and pharmaceutical companies could hunt for M&A opportunities in their sectors.  

However, Ms Smith said any "perceived benefits" of a break-up were " financially flawed and nonsensical" given the Â£1.5 billion in synergies achieved across the group. She said separate companies would lead to job losses as centralised functions were duplicated, and higher costs including for new CEOs and boards of directors.

A survey of Greycoat's top 30 institutional investors found only 7 were potentially in favour of Value First's plan, according to people familiar with the matter. At least 15 are likely to support the current strategy, with the rest still undecided. A straight majority of votes is required at the annual general meeting next week to approve Value First's break-up proposal. 

"We hope the conclusion our major shareholders appear to have reached is that this potential break-up threatens huge value destruction," said Ms Smith. "There is no logic in dismantling one of the UK's most successful companies." Greycoat's share price has risen 3% this year, outperforming the broader FTSE 100 index.
