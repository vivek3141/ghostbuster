Halifax confident of avoiding takeover as it prepares for stock market flotation 

Halifax, the largest mortgage lender in the UK, is confident it can withstand takeover interest and list on the London Stock Exchange next year despite the turbulent economic conditions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Chief executive Andrew Smith said Halifax is in a "very strong position" ahead of the planned initial public offering, with profits up 12% to £3.2 billion in the first nine months of the year on the back of strong demand for home loans. Halifax's loan book has grown by 7% so far in 2020 as government measures like the stamp duty holiday have spurred a mini housing boom.   

"We are not hugely concerned about takeovers at this point given our size, market position and growth trajectory," said Smith. "The economic backdrop is undoubtedly challenging but the housing market has remained remarkably resilient. Our IPO plans are progressing well and we see strong investor appetite for a business of our size, longevity and brand strength."

Halifax has spent years preparing to return to the stock market after it was taken private in 2009 by Lloyds Banking Group. Lloyds was forced to sell Halifax as a condition of its government bailout during the financial crisis. The mortgage lender is aiming for a valuation of between £12 billion and £15 billion, which would make it one of the largest financial services IPOs since the Covid-19 crisis began early this year.

However, the UK stock market has been volatile in recent weeks amid fears that rising coronavirus cases could prompt another widespread lockdown. The IPO market has been subdued, with only $6 billion raised on London exchanges so far this year, less than half the amount in 2019.   

Halifax executives are hoping for a lift from Pfizer's announcement this week of a successful Covid-19 vaccine trial. They believe confidence will start returning to the IPO market in early 2021 if the vaccine is approved and rolled out, allowing the listing to go ahead before the end of April.   

While other potential IPOs have been scrapped this year, Smith said Halifax was in a better position because it is a "highly defensive, counter-cyclical" business. Mortgage lending has remained stable even in the face of previous economic shocks. Halifax also has a sizable cash cushion of £18 billion which could help shield it from any rise in loan defaults.

"We have a highly experienced management team that has steered the business through many ups and downs over the decades," said Smith. "Our model is proven and our proposition to investors is a simple one: this is a very stable, predictable and profitable business with strong growth prospects regardless of the wider economy."
