Invesco and AIM merge to create one of the world's largest investment management businesses

Investment firms Invesco and AIM have announced plans to merge, creating one of the largest investment management businesses in the world. The combined entity will have more than $1.2 trillion in assets under management and operations around the world. 

Invesco, based in Atlanta, Georgia, and AIM, headquartered in London, have signed a definitive agreement to join forces in an all-stock merger. Under the deal, Invesco will acquire AIM, with AIM shareholders receiving 0.553 Invesco shares for each AIM share. The merger has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is expected to close in mid-2019, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.

The combined firm will operate under the Invesco brand and will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under Invesco's existing ticker, “IVZ.” Invesco's CEO Martin Flanagan will continue as CEO of the combined firm, while AIM CEO Mark Armour will retire upon completion of the merger. The company will have its head office in Atlanta and will maintain a strong presence in London.

In a joint statement, Flanagan and Armour said, “By combining two highly complementary businesses, we will be well positioned to offer a broad set of capabilities and solutions to meet the investment needs of clients in markets around the world. Our organizations are aligned in terms of strategic vision, culture, and operating philosophies and we share a disciplined approach to investment management and a commitment to the long-term.” 

The merger is expected to generate cost savings of $475 million through areas such as technology, operations, portfolio management oversight, and administrative efficiencies. However, no job losses are expected as part of the deal. Invesco aims to reinvest the savings into enhancing its capabilities and client support. The deal is expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings in the first full year following closing.

Industry analysts view the combination of Invesco and AIM positively, with several highlighting the potential for revenue synergies by leveraging their distribution capabilities. Tim Fidler of Bernstein Research noted that "the merger will propel the combined business to a top three position in the key European, UK and Asian markets, which would create opportunities to benefit from economies of scale in distribution and attract more institutional mandates."

Other analysts point to challenges in integrating the two firms and the additional debt Invesco will take on to finance the deal. However, Invesco is committed to maintaining its investment grade credit rating and has secured fully committed bridge financing from JP Morgan Chase to help fund the cash portion of the acquisition.

The merger represents the largest deal in the global asset management industry since Henderson Global Investors and Janus Capital combined in 2017. If approved, Invesco and AIM will form the 11th largest investment manager in the world, continuing the trend of consolidation in the asset management space.
