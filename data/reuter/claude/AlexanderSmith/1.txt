Liberty International Holdings Enters British Pensions Market with Hermes and BT Partnership

Global financial services firm Liberty International Holdings today announced a new partnership with Hermes Pensions Management and BT Pension Scheme to provide pension management services to corporate clients in the UK. The new joint venture, called Pension Partners UK, will allow Liberty International to expand into the large British pensions market, while leveraging the local expertise of Hermes and BT Pension Scheme.

Pension Partners UK will offer pension management, investment, and advisory services to mid-sized and large corporations in Britain. Liberty International Holdings will have a 49% stake in the new company, while Hermes and BT Pension Scheme will each hold 25.5%. The venture is expected to have over £500 billion in combined assets under management from current and new corporate pension clients.

“We have been looking for the right opportunity to enter the UK pensions market, which represents one of the largest sectors in the global financial industry,” said John Wilkins, CEO of Liberty International Holdings. “Partnering with the experience and client networks of Hermes and BT Pension Scheme provides an ideal launching pad for our pension offerings in Britain.” 

Hermes Pensions Management is an existing provider of pension management services, advising over £37 billion in assets for more than 200 UK clients. BT Pension Scheme is the pension plan for employees of British Telecom, with over 300,000 members and  £58 billion in assets. By leveraging its global scale and investment expertise, Liberty International aims to significantly grow assets under management for the new joint venture over the next 3-5 years.

“We are excited to be partnering with Liberty International to expand our pension services to a larger base of corporate clients,” said John Atkin, CEO of Hermes Pensions Management. “Pairing Liberty’s global reach with our local knowledge and infrastructure will enable us to deliver strong results and comprehensive solutions for UK pensions.” 

The new company will be based in London, with local management provided by executives from Hermes and BT Pension Scheme. Liberty International’s pensions division, which currently oversees $200 billion in global pension assets, will provide strategic direction and investment management resources for Pension Partners UK. Operations are set to commence beginning in the third quarter of this year.  

Industry analysts viewed the new venture positively, pointing to the complementary strengths of the three partners. “Liberty brings an international brand and investment engine, while Hermes and BT offer established UK client networks and pension expertise,” said George Buckley, a financial services analyst at Blacktree Advisory Group. “If executed successfully, Pension Partners UK could shake up the competitive dynamics of the British corporate pensions industry.”
