Cable & Wireless shares soar after deal to create UK's largest cable operator  

Shares in Cable & Wireless Communications (CWC) jumped 15% today after announcing a deal to buy Virgin Media's cable business for $23.3 billion, creating the UK's largest cable operator. The deal will allow CWC to expand its high-speed broadband and pay-TV services to millions more households across the UK. 

CWC will gain access to Virgin Media's network which currently provides broadband internet, home phone, and TV services to over 9 million premises. By combining the infrastructure and customer bases of the two companies, the new cable giant will be able to cut costs through greater scale and challenge rivals like BT and Sky more effectively.

The deal underscores the trend of consolidation in the telecom industry as companies seek to gain size and cross-sell products to customers. "This transaction represents a hugely exciting opportunity to combine two businesses that share a common vision for a converged future," said CWC Chief Executive Phil Bentley.

CWC has long wanted to expand further into broadband and entertainment services. Its 2015 takeover of Columbus gave it a boost but CWC remained a distant third in the market. Acquiring Virgin Media's high-quality hybrid fiber-coaxial network is a game changer that will propel CWC to lead the cable and digital sectors, according to analysts.

"With Virgin Media's network and customer base, CWC will have the reach and product portfolio to transform its position in the UK's telecoms and entertainment markets," said Kester Mann, analyst at CCS Insight. "This is a logical, transformative deal for CWC in its quest to become a national champion."

For Virgin Media's owner Liberty Global, the deal is an opportunity to exit the UK market at an attractive price so it can focus on higher-growth properties elsewhere in Europe. Liberty Global has built Virgin Media into a strong challenger brand, but faced increasing competition from BT and others in the UK's crowded telecom market.

The agreement will need regulatory approval in Europe before it can be completed, likely in early 2022 according to the companies. Consumer advocates called on regulators to ensure the deal does not reduce choice and raise prices for customers. But most analysts expect the takeover to gain clearance without major concessions given limited areas of overlap between the two businesses.

If approved, the combination of CWC and Virgin Media would create a telecom and entertainment powerhouse in the UK positioned to invest in new technology like fiber-to-the-home and streaming services to improve speeds and services for millions of broadband customers. CWC's deal to buy Virgin Media's cable network marks a giant leap forward in its quest to become the nation's leading integrated communications company.
