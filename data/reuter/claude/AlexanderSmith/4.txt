Cable & Wireless, NYNEX Corp, and Bell Canada Merge British Subsidiaries to Form Major New Cable Player

Three major telecommunications firms announced today that they are merging their British cable television subsidiaries to create a new company that will be a leading cable operator in the UK. Cable & Wireless PLC, NYNEX Corporation, and Bell Canada Enterprises Inc. have agreed to combine Cable & Wireless Communications, Videotron UK, and Bell Cablemedia into a single entity that will provide cable TV service to more than 3 million homes in Britain. 

The new company will be called Cable & Wireless Communications UK and will be the largest cable operator in Britain behind only Telewest Communications. The merger is expected to generate significant cost savings and synergies for the parent companies while allowing them to better compete in an increasingly competitive British telecom market.

"By combining our UK cable assets, we will gain improved scale and strategic positioning to grow our businesses," said Cable & Wireless CEO Graham Wallace. "This transaction is consistent with our strategy to focus our resources on key growth platforms."

The deal will require regulatory approval but is expected to close within the next 6-8 months. The new Cable & Wireless Communications UK will be owned equally by the three parent companies. redundancies and consolidation are expected as the three companies integrate their operations. The company will provide cable TV, broadband Internet, and telephone service to customers throughout Britain, especially in urban and suburban markets.   

"We have long believed in the potential for growth and innovation in the British cable market," said Bell Canada President John McLennan. "By merging our operations with those of Cable & Wireless and NYNEX, we can accelerate our investments in new technology and services to better meet the needs of UK consumers today and into the future."

The merger is the latest example of consolidation in the British telecom industry. Companies are combining to gain greater scale and pricing power in a market that has become fiercely competitive since deregulation. The new Cable & Wireless Communications UK expects to leverage its greater size to enhance its technology, expand its service offerings, and strengthen its position relative to competitors like British Telecom and Sky TV.
