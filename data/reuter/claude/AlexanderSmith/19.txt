Greycoat Defies Rebel Shareholders and Merger Attempt from Moorfield Estates  

Greycoat plc, one of Britain’s most well-established property companies, today announced plans to resist calls from rebel shareholders to break up the company and ward off an unwanted takeover bid from competitor Moorfield Estates. 

In a statement, the Greycoat board said the company’s strategy “remains the correct one” to maximize long-term shareholder value. The board criticized the plan put forward by a group of activist shareholders, led by hedge fund Bolt Partners, to split Greycoat into separate office and residential divisions as “short-sighted and not in the interests of the vast majority of shareholders.”

Greycoat also formally rejected an all-share merger approach from Moorfield Estates, saying the bid “significantly undervalues the company and its future prospects.” The merger would combine two of the largest players in the British property market in a deal worth more than £4 billion. However, Greycoat said the offer was “opportunistic” and came at a time when its share price was temporarily depressed. 

Shares in Greycoat rose by 3% following the announcements. However, Bolt Partners, which owns a 2% stake in the company, questioned why the Greycoat board was “so reluctant to even consider unlocking the enormous value from a breakup and engaging constructively on the Moorfield Estates approach.” Daniel King, fund manager at Bolt, said: “For too long, shareholders have suffered under a Greycoat leadership that lacks vision and an unwillingness to take bold action. That era needs to end if the company is to reach its true potential.”

Some analysts supported Bolt Partners' view, arguing a merger could yield cost savings and allow the combined group to leverage its strengthened market position to push through higher rents. They suggested Moorfield may return with an improved offer in an attempt to overcome Greycoat's opposition.
