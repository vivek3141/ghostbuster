Invesco to Merge with AIM Management in $1.6 Billion Deal to Create One of the World’s Largest Investment Management Companies

Invesco Ltd., a large independent global investment management firm, announced today that it will merge with AIM Management Group Inc. in an all-stock deal valued at $1.6 billion. The merger will create one of the world’s largest investment management companies, with more than $800 billion in assets under management and a presence in 20 countries. 

Under the terms of the agreement, Invesco will acquire all outstanding shares of AIM for a total value of $1.6 billion. AIM shareholders will receive 0.358 Invesco shares for each AIM share, which represents a premium of 15% based on the closing share prices of both companies on May 5. Existing Invesco shareholders will own about 57% of the combined company, while AIM shareholders will own the remaining 43%.

The combined Invesco AIM will benefit from greater scale, product diversification, operating efficiencies, and revenue opportunities. Invesco Chairman and CEO Martin Flanagan will continue to lead the merged firm. The new board of directors will consist of 11 members, with six representatives from Invesco and five from AIM. The merger is expected to generate at least $140 million in annual cost savings within three years of closing.

“This compelling combination of Invesco and AIM brings together two highly complementary organizations with a shared strategic vision of becoming one of the industry’s most trusted and comprehensive global investment management partners,” said Mr. Flanagan. “Through increased size and diversity, the combined firm will have a strengthened ability to develop and deliver competitive investment strategies and services to clients around the world.”

AIM President and CEO Andrew Takata will become president and chief operating officer of Invesco AIM. “Joining forces with Invesco provides an exceptional opportunity for our clients and employees,” said Mr. Takata. “Together, we will benefit from economies of scale resulting in greater investment in technology, marketing and other key business drivers, which will enhance our ability to exceed client expectations.” 

The transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies but still requires the approval of both Invesco and AIM shareholders, as well as regulatory approvals. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. The new company will retain the Invesco name and its headquarters will remain in Atlanta, Georgia. AIM will operate as a subsidiary and maintain its headquarters in Springfield, Massachusetts.

Invesco, founded in 1935, has more than 7,000 employees worldwide managing assets across equity, fixed income, real assets, alternatives and multi-asset investment strategies. AIM, founded in 1942, manages a range of investment solutions across U.S. and global equities and fixed income for institutional and retail clients. Together, Invesco AIM will manage money for clients in 120 countries.
