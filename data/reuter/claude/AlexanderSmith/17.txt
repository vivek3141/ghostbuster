KPMG's investment in infrastructure and technology puts it on track for revenue growth, says chairman 

KPMG International, one of the Big Four accounting and consulting firms, is investing heavily in infrastructure, technology, and its people to drive continued revenue growth over the next few years. Bill Thomas, KPMG's Global Chairman, said the investments are already paying off and the firm is on track to achieve solid single-digit revenue growth for the 2019 fiscal year.

"We continue to invest in KPMG's future to ensure we have the infrastructure, technology, and highly skilled workforce to meet clients' needs today and in the decades to come," Thomas said. "Our investments are strengthening KPMG's foundations and positioning us for sustained success and growth."

KPMG is spending more than $4 billion over three years to upgrade infrastructure and technology systems across its global network. The spending includes transitioning to cloud-based systems, improving cybersecurity capabilities, and standardizing key platforms between KPMG's 147,000 professionals that span more than 150 countries. The cloud-based audit platform, KPMG Clara, is enabling KPMG auditors to improve quality and provide data-driven insights to clients.

Ongoing investments in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and data & analytics provide KPMG's clients with leading-edge solutions that help manage risk, comply with regulations, and support decision making with data-driven insights.

"Technology is absolutely critical to everything we do at KPMG, so we are integrating innovative technologies into all of our services and solutions," said Thomas. "Our significant investments in technology act as a catalyst for enriching interactions between our people and clients."

In addition to infrastructure and technology investments, KPMG continues to invest in its workforce through enhanced training, development and compensation programs. Nearly 65% of KPMG's workforce has been with the firm for 10 years or less, so KPMG is focused on attracting and retaining top talent.

"Our people are our greatest strength so we invest broadly and deeply in their education, development and wellbeing," said Thomas. "By supporting each other and by working together, we are able to achieve greater success."

With a workforce that is increasingly diverse, globally connected, and capable of providing innovative solutions, KPMG believes these ongoing investments have positioned the firm well for future growth in an evolving business environment. While economic and geopolitical issues may impact results in any given year, KPMG's investments in infrastructure, technology and people are intended to drive sustainable, long-term success.
