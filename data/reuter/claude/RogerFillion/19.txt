Parents Want TV Industry To Spell Out Sexual And Violence Content Of Shows, According To Survey

A new survey of over 2,000 parents in the U.S. found that the vast majority want the TV industry to do more to warn viewers about the level of sexual content, violence, and inappropriate language in television shows. The survey, conducted by the Parents Television Council, an advocacy group focused on family-friendly media, found that 89% of parents want the entertainment industry to provide content ratings that specifically spell out the nature of graphic content.  

“Parents today feel overwhelmed by the amount of media bombarding their families and worry their children are exposed to inappropriate content,” said Melissa Henson, Program Director of the Parents Television Council. “Our survey shows that the current TV content ratings system is not detailed or informative enough for most parents. They want to know exactly what kind of language, violence or sexual content is in a show before the kids watch it.”

The TV Parental Guidelines ratings system currently gives shows a general age-based rating, like TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-14 or TV-MA, and broad content descriptors like “fantasy violence” or “sexual content.” But parents argue these ratings are not transparent or useful enough. The PTC survey found that 72% of parents want more details on the type and intensity of sexual content, 70% want more specifics on the level and type of violence, and 67% want to know the exact types of foul language that can be expected.  

Some critics argue more detailed content ratings could be helpful to parents but may also infringe on creative freedom in the entertainment industry. “There is a balance between empowering parents to make informed choices about media for their children and imposing overly rigid restrictions on content that could restrict diversity and artistry,” said Jill Murphy, editor of Entertainment Weekly.

Supporters counter that the goal is not censorship but instead truthful labels and information to match the digital age. “Parents deserve transparent, detailed information to make their own judgments,” Henson said. “In an era where TV shows have ratings for ‘pervasive sexuality’ yet barely earn a TV-14, it’s clear the current system is not working.” The PTC is calling on the TV industry to discuss updates to the ratings system in the coming months to address parents’ concerns.
