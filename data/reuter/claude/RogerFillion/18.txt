Local Telephone Market Deregulation Progresses Despite FCC Setback

The Federal Communications Commission's recent decision to  partially reinstate restrictions on competitive local telephone companies dealt a blow to supporters of full deregulation, but has not halted the momentum toward more market-based local telephone service. Competitive carriers continue to gain customers from incumbent local exchange carriers at a solid clip, and the unregulated parts of the telecom market are attracting major investments.

Last week, the FCC voted to reimpose some rules that require competitive carriers to share their networks with rivals and to charge regulated rates for accessing customers. The FCC had scrapped most of those regulations in 2005, but a federal appeals court ruled last year that the agency had overstepped its authority. 

The ruling was a victory for incumbent phone giants like AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., which aggressively lobbied the FCC to roll  back pro-competitive policies after they began losing subscribers to start-ups like Vonage Holdings Corp. and cable operators offering phone service. But in an acknowledgement of how far deregulation has progressed, the FCC left intact most of its 2005 decision to free new network elements like high-speed Internet lines.

Regulatory uncertainty often wreaks havoc on telecom markets, but companies in this space have already adjusted to a lighter-touch regulatory model. "The FCC took one step back, but the overall trend remains toward a more open, competitive market," said Thomas Jones, an industry analyst with Wall Street Regulatory Advisory Services Inc.

Vonage and other voice over Internet protocol providers have been gaining about 1 million subscribers annually. Cable companies are also making inroads, using their networks to offer digital phone service to over 4 million customers so far. AT&T and Verizon still dominate traditional landline phone markets, but have lost about 26 million subscribers since 2000 as alternatives emerge and as more people opt to only use mobile phones.

Capital continues to pour into technology companies aiming to shake up how people communicate. Google Inc. recently began rolling out a free wireless broadband network, and paid $1.65 billion last year for YouTube Inc., a video sharing start-up. Skype Technologies SA, an Internet calling service, attracted a $2.6 billion takeover bid from eBay Inc. And heavyweights like Comcast Corp. and Time Warner Inc. are upending industry models by bundling new services like digital video recording with traditional cable and broadband packages.

Consumer groups argue that the unraveling of the status quo has benefited residential and business customers through lower rates and more services. But they say further deregulation by the FCC is needed to encourage investments in advanced networks like fiber optics that can compete globally. The regulatory setback "should not be used as an excuse to stop the transition to an open, competitive market, which will result in greater broadband deployment and adoption," said Mark Cooper, research director for the Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group.
