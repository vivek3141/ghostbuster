Deregulation of the Local Telephone Market Takes an Alternate Route to Competition 

The telecommunications industry has undergone massive changes in recent decades with the advent of mobile phones, voice over internet protocol (VoIP), and broadband internet access. However, the market for local landline telephone service has remained largely dominated by traditional incumbent providers like AT&T, Verizon, and CenturyLink. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to open local telephone markets to competition from new entrants, but that competition has been slow to develop.

Now, some state public utility commissions and legislatures are taking matters into their own hands to spur new options for consumers. This week, California passed a new law deregulating traditional landline phone service in the state. The law eliminates price controls and other regulations on the incumbent phone companies in exchange for commitments to expand high-speed internet access. 

Proponents argue this approach will incentivize the large phone companies to invest in broadband infrastructure, especially in rural areas, that can then be used by competitors to offer voice and data services. “By freeing the incumbents from outdated price regulations, we open the door for them to put more resources into building out high-speed networks for the next generation of telecom services,” said Tom Wheeler, president of the California Cable & Telecommunications Association.  

However, critics counter that deregulation may simply allow the incumbent phone companies to raise prices without improving service or infrastructure. “There is no guarantee this law will increase broadband access or enhance competition,” said Carmen Balber of Consumer Watchdog. “But it’s a sure bet that big phone companies will be able to pad profits and keep dominating the market.”

The approach taken in California is an alternative to the traditional tactic of forcing incumbents to lease parts of their networks to competitors at regulated rates. That approach has had mixed success, with many new entrants struggling to gain enough customers to survive. By easing regulations in exchange for infrastructure commitments, California hopes to entice the incumbents to build networks that competitors can then use to provide innovative services. However, some argue that model is flawed if there aren't strong enough guarantees around infrastructure deployment.
