Distillers Reverse 48-Year-Old Ban on Broadcast Advertising of Liquor  

The liquor industry ended its 48-year voluntary ban on broadcast advertising today, opening up a new promotional channel for spirits brands. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS), a national trade group representing major producers, announced that broadcast ads for distilled spirits like whiskey, rum, and vodka will begin airing as soon as November.

The self-imposed ban began in 1936 as a way to avoid regulation during Prohibition. After Prohibition ended in 1933, policymakers threatened restrictions on alcohol marketing if the industry did not regulate itself. The broadcast advertising ban was meant to limit the promotion of distilled spirits, especially to underage consumers.   

DISCUS representatives said the broadcast ban is outdated and unnecessary in today's media landscape. “There is no evidence that advertising leads to increased underage drinking or overconsumption,” said DISCUS CEO Chris Swonger. “Broadcast advertising will allow distillers to reach legal-age adults where they are today—watching their favorite shows and sports on TV and streaming media.”  

Critics argue that broadcast ads will make liquor brands seem more mainstream and attractive to young people. “This is a misguided move that will only increase the exposure of distilled spirits to more and more people, including underage youth,” said a spokesperson for the advocacy group Alcohol Justice. The group is calling on policymakers to step in and take action against what they call the “Big Alcohol” lobby.

Major TV networks like ABC, CBS, and NBC have policies prohibiting liquor ads, but cable channels and streaming services will now carry them. The broadcast advertising reversal is expected to be a boon for large spirits companies, who can afford national TV campaigns to promote their brands. Small craft distillers, however, may struggle to keep up as competition intensifies. The policy change may also spur new mergers and acquisitions in an industry already dominated by massive global companies.
