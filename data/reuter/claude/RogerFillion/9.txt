Regulators Work to Finalize Multi-Billion Dollar Proposal for Universal Phone and Internet Service

Federal regulators are putting the final touches on an ambitious plan to fund universal phone and high-speed internet service across the country. The proposal from the Federal Communications Commission would provide $20-25 billion over 10 years to subsidize phone and broadband service for low-income households and those in hard to reach areas like tribal lands. 

If approved, the plan would be the largest federal investment in phone and internet connectivity in decades. FCC officials say it could connect up to 4 million households that currently lack access to broadband service, helping to close the “digital divide” that has left some communities behind in an increasingly online world.

“Access to affordable, high-speed internet and mobile phone service has never been more critical,” said FCC Chairman Michael O’Rielly in a statement. “This proposal would help ensure that all Americans, no matter their income or location, have access to these essential communications tools.”

The centerpiece of the plan is the creation of a new FCC subsidy fund called the “Universal Connectivity Fund.” The fund would provide $9-14 billion over 10 years to subsidize phone and broadband service for low-income households, similar to the existing Lifeline program. But it would aim to support faster broadband speeds and mobile as well as landline phone service.

A second part of the fund, totaling $10-12 billion, would be used to subsidize infrastructure construction and service in hard-to-reach areas that the FCC calls “high-cost locations.” This would help fund broadband in rural places where it is difficult for companies to turn a profit, as well as service on tribal lands.

The proposal caps months of negotiations between FCC officials, broadband providers, public interest groups and lawmakers in Congress. If approved by the commission, the Universal Connectivity Fund could still face hurdles in Congress, where some Republicans have objected to such large new subsidy programs. But the plan also has bipartisan support, and backers say connecting more Americans with affordable communications technology should be a national priority.

“Broadband is no longer a luxury, it’s a necessity,” said Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who has long pushed for universal broadband service. “This plan would help ensure that all Americans have access to the tools they need to access job opportunities, healthcare, education and stay connected with loved ones.”

The FCC will vote on whether to approve and issue the final plan for the Universal Connectivity Fund at its next monthly meeting on October 18. If approved, agency officials said they hope to have the first components of the program up and running by early next year.
