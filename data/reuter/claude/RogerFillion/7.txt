Canada Plans to Develop Own Satellite-TV Industry Amid Dispute with US Companies 

The Canadian government announced plans to develop its own satellite television industry to provide Canadians with more choice and affordable options. The move comes amid an ongoing dispute with major US satellite TV providers over distribution rights that has led to channel blackouts.

Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez said the government will invest up to $500 million over five years to support the creation of a "made-in-Canada satellite TV solution." The goal is to have at least one Canadian company offering satellite TV service across the country by 2025. Canadian companies Telesat and MDA currently operate satellites but do not offer direct-to-home satellite TV services. 

Canada's two major satellite TV providers, Shaw Direct and Bell TV, rely on US satellite networks and satellites to distribute their signals. This has led to periodic blackouts of certain channels when the companies cannot reach deals with channel owners. Most recently, Bell TV customers lost access to local Fox affiliates and various other channels.

"We cannot continue to accept blackouts and disputes that affect Canadians' access to content they pay for through their cable or satellite TV subscriptions," Rodriguez said in announcing the new funding and policy. 

The move is an attempt to boost competition in Canada's television market, which is dominated by a handful of cable and satellite companies. Critics argue Canadian consumers pay some of the highest TV bills in the world due in part to lack of choice. However, some industry analysts are skeptical a new Canadian satellite TV provider can gain enough market share to drive prices lower, given the substantial costs to launch satellites and provide high-definition channels and recording equipment.

The new funding will be used to assess the viability of a Canadian satellite TV service, reduce regulatory barriers, and potentially support initial infrastructure investments. The government said it will announce more details on eligibility and timing of funding programs in the coming months. For now, Canada's satellite TV industry remains firmly in the hands of major US companies, but that may start to change if Ottawa's vision of an all-Canadian satellite TV solution takes off.
