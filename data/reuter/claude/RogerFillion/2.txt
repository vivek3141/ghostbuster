Telecom Law Pits Privacy Advocates Against Phone Companies' Marketing Efforts

A new telecommunications law is set to go into effect next month that has privacy advocates worried it will pave the way for phone companies and other telecoms to sell customers' private calling and web browsing data to advertisers and other third parties. The Telecommunications Privacy Act, which was passed by Congress last year with bipartisan support, contains provisions that loosen restrictions on what data telecom companies can share with business partners and other companies, as long as they notify customers of data sharing practices in their terms of service and provide an opt-out mechanism.   

Privacy advocates argue the law guts protections for sensitive data and allows telecoms to monetize customer information in harmful ways.  “Passing customer calling records, location data, and web browsing histories to advertisers and other companies violates users' basic privacy expectations for their phone and internet services,” said John Davis of the Digital Privacy Alliance, a Washington, DC-based advocacy group. However, telecom industry groups and supporters of the new law counter that it modernizes outdated privacy rules for the digital age and provides more transparency to customers about how their data is used.   

"The previous telecom privacy rules were written in the era of landline phones and hadn’t been updated for modern technologies like smartphones, broadband and connected devices,” said Mark Johnson, a spokesman for Telecoms United, an industry trade group. “This law requires simple and clear privacy notices so customers know their options to limit use of private data.”

The law’s opt-out mechanism is meant to give consumers more control over their data. But privacy groups argue opt-out systems typically have very low participation rates, meaning most consumers’ data will still be shared unless they proactively take steps to limit it.  They also warn that telecoms may bury notices about data sharing in lengthy terms of service that customers typically do not read closely. Some policy analysts have proposed stronger privacy laws that would implement opt-in consent requirements, but telecom industry groups argue opt-in rules would be unworkable.

The conflict highlights the growing tension between privacy concerns in the digital age and the drive by many companies to leverage customer data for marketing, analytics and other commercial purposes. With the Telecommunications Privacy Act set to take effect next month, the debate around data privacy rules and consumers' control of their personal information shows no signs of fading.
