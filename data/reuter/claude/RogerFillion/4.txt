Justice Department Asks Supreme Court to Lift Suspension of Federal Rules Opening Local Phone Market to Competition 

The U.S. Department of Justice today asked the Supreme Court to lift a temporary suspension of new federal regulations aimed at opening local telephone markets to increased competition. In a filing with the high court, the Justice Department argued that a recent appeals court ruling blocking the new rules could undermine efforts to spur innovation and lower prices in the telecommunications industry.

The Federal Communications Commission last year approved new rules that make it easier for companies to enter local phone markets dominated by major carriers like AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. The rules curb regulatory requirements on new entrants and cap the access fees they pay to connect calls. A coalition of telecom trade groups challenged the rules in court, arguing the FCC overstepped its authority.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sided with the groups in January and blocked the rules from taking effect. The appeals court said the FCC failed to show legal authority for parts of its new regulations. The ruling was a setback for tech companies like Google that have pushed into telecom services and supported the FCC's changes.

In its filing today, the Justice Department argued the appeals court erred in its decision. The department said the new rules fall well within the FCC's power to regulate interstate communications and promote local telephone competition. Leaving the suspension in place, it warned, threatens to "delay the introduction of innovative offerings, deny consumers the benefits of increased choice and competition, and prolong the dependence of competitors and consumers on the incumbent local exchange carriers."

The Supreme Court likely won't decide whether to take up the case until later this year. If it declines to hear the appeal, the lower court's ruling would stand. The FCC could go back to the drawing board but would face an uphill battle defending a similar set of rules. Some analysts say the complex regulatory issues at stake and temporary nature of the suspension may convince the high court to pass on the case. The legal fight adds uncertainty for companies hoping to compete in a market that has been dominated by giant landline carriers for decades.
