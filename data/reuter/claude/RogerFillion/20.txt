Regulators Plan to Cut Rates on Overseas Phone Calls, Potentially Saving Billions for American Consumers and Companies While Ruffling the Feathers of Foreign Governments

The Federal Communications Commission announced today that it plans to enact regulations that would cut rates for international phone calls to as low as 1 cent per minute, amounting to savings of billions of dollars for both individuals and businesses. The plan, if enacted, would significantly undercut the fees charged by large national phone companies and threaten the revenues of foreign telecommunications companies that have benefited from the high rates paid for calls to their countries. 

For decades, calling friends or business contacts abroad has been expensive. Under the current system, carriers charge an average of $1 to $2 per minute for calls to popular destinations like China, Mexico, India and Nigeria. These high fees are then split between U.S. phone companies, their foreign counterparts, and intermediaries. The FCC argues these rates are unjustified and in some cases constitute "arbitrary and unjust surcharges."

The FCC’s proposal would make it nearly free for people in the U.S. to call mobile and landline numbers internationally. According to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, “This reform can put $5 billion back in the pockets of American consumers and businesses.” The plan would save the average family hundreds per year and benefit companies that frequently call overseas partners or customers.

However, the plan faces opposition from major phone companies like AT&T and Verizon as well as foreign governments that rely on fees from international calls as a source of revenue. Critics argue the plan threatens jobs and profits in the telecommunications industry. The fees collected on international calls are an important source of funding for telephone networks in developing countries. 

Despite the opposition, the FCC appears poised to approve the plan. An open commission vote is scheduled for next month. If approved, the rules could go into effect as early as the end of this year. The plan builds on the FCC’s efforts to lower the cost of in-state long-distance calls and prison phone calls, initiatives that have already saved consumers and families billions of dollars per year. In a statement, Pai said, “Lowering calling rates will make it easier for all Americans to stay connected with friends and family abroad.”

Advocates praise the announcement as an overdue move that will benefit immigrants, students studying abroad, those stationed overseas in the military, and other groups that rely on affordable international calling. The plan, if enacted, would bring the U.S. in line with most other developed nations that already regulate phone rates to foreign countries at very low costs or for free. While revenue loss remains a concern, supporters argue the benefits to society far outweigh any financial impacts on phone companies. The FCC will vote on the final rules next month.
