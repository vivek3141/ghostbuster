Justice Department seeks Supreme Court intervention to lift suspension on federal rules for local telephone competition

The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court today to intervene and lift a suspension on federal rules intended to boost competition in local telephone service. The department argues that the suspension of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is costing Americans money and limiting choice. 

A federal appeals court in Washington, DC suspended several key provisions of the landmark telecommunications law last year after telecom companies argued that certain rules were unfair or technologically unfeasible. The rules were meant to open the $300-billion local phone service market to competition by requiring companies that own the lines into homes and businesses to lease them to rivals at discounted rates.

The Justice Department petitioned the Supreme Court to vacate the lower court's decision, arguing that Americans have lost more than $5 billion in savings and fees as a result of the suspension. “The longer these pro-competitive rules remain suspended, the longer American consumers will be denied choice and lower prices that Congress promised them,” the department said in a statement.

The rules in question mandate that regional Bell phone companies lease their lines to competitors at discounted rates and resell parts of their network at wholesale prices. The companies argue that the rules amount to unreasonable government intervention that limits their ability to profit from their infrastructure investments.

Since the law's passage, the Bells have resisted lowering fees for access to their networks, sparking a series of legal battles and delays in dozens of states. Consumer advocates claim that the Bells have engaged in anti-competitive practices to maintain their monopolies as long as possible. The Bells counter that they should not have to subsidize private companies use of their property to turn profits. 

While the court battle plays out, many states have abandoned or loosened local phone competition rules. Some critics argue this significantly weakens the potential benefits to consumers, while proponents claim that deregulation spurs investment in new infrastructure. There is no consensus on the impact so far to consumers in terms of choice, fees, and service.

The Supreme Court must now decide whether to take up the Justice Department’s petition. If it does, a ruling would provide clarity for both sides of the telecom policy debate as well as for state regulators grappling with competition laws. The court may also opt to return the issue to lower courts for reconsideration. For now, competition in local telephone service remains stalled in much of the country. Overall, the shape of the U.S. telecommunications system hangs in the balance as this legal fight drags on.
