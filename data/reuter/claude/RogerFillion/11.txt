Regulators Propose $2.3bn to Connect Schools and Libraries to Internet at Discounted Rates 

Federal regulators have proposed a $2.3 billion plan to help connect schools and libraries in the U.S. to high-speed internet at discounted rates. The Universal Service Administrative Co., an independent agency overseen by the Federal Communications Commission, aims to provide discounted broadband service to over 3.6 million students and 260,000 staff across the country over the next five years.

The proposal, called the Emergency Connectivity Fund, is part of a broader effort by the Biden administration to close the “digital divide” and ensure all Americans have access to high-speed internet, regardless of their location or income level. Regulators say the plan could provide schools and libraries with broadband connectivity for as little as $10 per month for the next five years.

“This is a vital step towards ensuring that all students have access to the reliable connectivity they need for learning during this pandemic and beyond,” said FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. “The FCC must move quickly to establish this fund to help close the Homework Gap so that all children, regardless of their socioeconomic status, have a fair shot at educational opportunity."

Schools and libraries would be able to apply for funding through the Emergency Connectivity Fund to subsidize the cost of internet services and connected devices. The fund aims to support both rural and urban schools, with a focus on "communities of color and lower-income school districts." Applicants can use the funding to provide broadband connectivity for students, school staff, and library patrons at locations other than schools and libraries, including homes and community centers.

Not all groups support the proposed fund, however. Some critics argue the FCC is overstepping by providing funding for what should be a state and local responsibility. Others say the money may be better spent on other priorities like improving curriculum, teacher salaries or school infrastructure. Supporters counter that closing the digital divide is a national imperative and federal support is necessary to connect the large number of students lacking broadband access.

Regulators will vote on the final proposal for the $2.3 billion Emergency Connectivity Fund at the FCC's next monthly meeting. If approved, funding may begin reaching schools and libraries as early as this spring. Supporters say the program, while not a complete solution, is an important step toward achieving digital equity and opportunity for students across the country.
