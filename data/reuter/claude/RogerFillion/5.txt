FCC to Eliminate Rule Requiring Advance Notice of Long-Distance Rate Changes  

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted today to eliminate a rule that has required long-distance telephone companies to provide customers with advance notice of rate increases. The rule, which has been in place since the breakup of AT&T in 1984, mandates that carriers notify business and residential customers of any increase in per-minute calling rates at least 15 days before the new rates go into effect.

The FCC, now under Republican control, voted 3-2 along party lines to remove the advance notice requirement, arguing that it is an unnecessary regulation in today's telecommunications market. "The long-distance telephone market is now fully competitive, with numerous providers offering service," said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in a statement. "Requiring advance notice of rate changes made sense when a single carrier controlled the market, but it makes little sense today and imposes needless costs on carriers that are then passed on to consumers."  

Democratic FCC Commissioners Jessica Rosenworcel and Geoffrey Starks dissented, saying the decision leaves consumers vulnerable. "Getting rid of notification requirements leaves customers in the dark and more susceptible to bill shock," Rosenworcel said. Starks argued that "consumers deserve to know about price increases before being asked to pay new, higher rates."

Consumer advocacy groups also criticize the move and argue the FCC's Republican majority is dismantling important consumer protections. "Eliminating the requirement that phone companies notify customers before jacking up their rates is anti-consumer and anti-common sense," said Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union. "The FCC seems determined to cut itself out of the equation when it comes to protecting consumers and competition in the telecom market."

The rule change will go into effect 30 days from today, meaning long-distance carriers will no longer need to provide 15 days' notice to customers about price increases starting early next month. Major carriers like AT&T, Verizon, and CenturyLink will be free to increase per-minute calling rates for domestic long-distance and international calls with little advance warning to subscribers. The FCC said it will rely on market competition rather than regulations to keep rates in check. But some analysts argue competition may not effectively constrain carriers from raising rates, especially for customers with few carrier options.

While per-minute calling charges have declined substantially from their peak thanks to free calling options and unlimited plans, about a quarter of U.S. households still pay for long-distance service, according to FCC estimates. For those customers, the cost of calling friends and family across state lines or overseas could now increase without notice starting next month.
