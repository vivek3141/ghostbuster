FCC Eliminates Depression-Era Rule, Reduces Regulation of Long-Distance Phone Rates for Competition and Less Red Tape   

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) today voted to eliminate a rule from the 1930s that heavily regulated long-distance phone rates between states. The move is aimed at reducing red tape, encouraging competition, and lowering costs for consumers.

The FCC repealed a provision known as the "rate-of-return regulation" that required large phone carriers like AT&T and Verizon to obtain FCC approval for the rates they charged to connect long-distance calls between states. The rule was put in place in the 1930s when long-distance calling was expensive and the large phone carriers acted as monopolies.

Today, with the rise of wireless carriers and internet-based phone services like Skype and WhatsApp, the long-distance phone market has become highly competitive. The FCC argued that the Depression-era rule was obsolete and discouraged the big carriers from lowering rates or improving service to compete.

"This action removes unnecessary regulation and allows market forces to continue incentivizing lower long-distance rates and innovative service offerings for American consumers," said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. The two other Republican commissioners also voted for the repeal. The two Democratic commissioners voted against it, arguing it could lead to higher rates for rural and low-income consumers.

Consumer advocates were also concerned the change may reduce affordable long-distance options for vulnerable groups. "There are still Americans who rely on landline phones to stay connected, especially in rural, remote and tribal areas as well as for people with disabilities," said Olivia Wein, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. 

However, the phone carriers argued that reducing regulation would spur competition and innovation, ultimately benefiting consumers. "Freeing carriers from excessive regulation has allowed increased competition and investment, which ultimately drives down rates," said AT&T in a statement. The company said that since the 1980s when the FCC first began deregulating telephone services, long-distance rates have dropped over 95% for consumers.

The rule change will take effect in the coming weeks. On the whole, it is expected to decrease costs for most consumers, especially if the big carriers pass on the cost-savings and efficiency gains. However, consumer advocates argue it may lead the carriers to raise rates on rural or disadvantaged groups with fewer competitive options. The impact will likely unfold over the coming months and years. Either way, an era has ended as decades-old telephone regulations continue to be swept aside in favor of free-market competition.
