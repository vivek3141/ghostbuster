Distillers Revoke 48-Year-Old Ban on Broadcast Advertising of Liquor: Whiskey and Gin to be Treated Like Beer and Wine  

The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS) today announced that its members have voted to lift a longstanding ban on broadcast advertising of distilled spirits like whiskey, rum, and gin. The move ends a 48-year voluntary ban on liquor ads on television and radio. DISCUS members include some of the largest spirits producers in the U.S., including Bacardi, Beam Suntory, Brown-Forman, and Pernod Ricard.

The decision aligns distilled spirits advertising with that of beer and wine, which have been allowed to advertise on broadcast media since the 1990s. Industry groups argue that ending the ban will help spirits brands better compete for market share and also aims to shift perceptions that distilled alcohol is less socially acceptable than beer or wine. However, public health experts warn the move could spur increased underage drinking and binge consumption of hard liquor.

“This vote marks an important milestone in the competition for consumer attention," said DISCUS CEO Chris Swonger. “We are committed to advertising our products in a responsible manner and aligning with the self-regulatory advertising codes put in place with the FTC to prevent underage appeal or overconsumption.” 

Critics argue that broadcast ads, especially on television, expose minors and young adults to persuasive marketing messages promoting spirits. Public health advocates have long fought for restrictions on alcohol marketing and say the end of the longstanding broadcast ban “is a major step backward.” Mothers Against Drunk Driving called the move “shocking and irresponsible.”

The ban was first put in place in 1936 following the repeal of Prohibition. Its end is the culmination of years of lobbying by large distillers who argue they are at a competitive disadvantage to brewers and wineries, who spend heavily on broadcast ads, especially during major televised events like the Super Bowl. The policy change will take effect immediately, allowing distillers to roll out broadcast marketing campaigns as soon as new ads can be produced.
