Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas upholds suspension of federal rules on local phone market competition

The Supreme Court today issued a decision upholding the Federal Communications Commission's move to suspend Obama-era rules promoting competition in the $45 billion local telephone market.

In a 5-4 ruling, the court's conservative majority sided with the FCC, ruling that the agency has authority to discard or modify old regulations as it sees fit. The decision, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, is a major victory for large telecom companies like AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc, that dominate the local phone business and opposed the 2016 regulations.

The rules, issued by the FCC under President Obama, represented an effort to promote competition with dominant carriers. They required large companies to make available "essential infrastructure" like cables and network and data connections to smaller telecom rivals in their area. The goal was to drive down costs to consumer by encouraging new competitors to enter local telephone markets.   

In 2017, under President Trump, the FCC's new Republican chairman, Ajit Pai, moved to suspend those competition rules, arguing they added unnecessary regulation. The FCC contended it has authority to modify rules as technology and market conditions change. The agency's reversal was challenged in court by a coalition of small telecom companies, consumer advocacy groups and state attorneys general. They said the FCC lacked authority to simply discard duly enacted rules.

In today's ruling, the Supreme Court majority sided with the FCC. Justice Thomas wrote that federal agencies have discretion to change policies to adapt to new administrations or shifting priorities. "Regulatory policy may shift over time in light of those changes," Thomas wrote, "and it is incoherent to suggest that an agency cannot revoke or revise policies that are no longer sound."

The ruling is a major win for the Trump administration's overhaul of Obama-era technology regulations. FCC Chairman Pai said the Supreme Court affirmed "a common-sense principle: Regulations meant for an earlier time should not stand in the way of innovation and investment in our digital age."
