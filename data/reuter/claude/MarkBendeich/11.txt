Pasminco Ltd foresees tough year ahead due to weak zinc market and strong Australian dollar 

Pasminco Ltd, one of the world's largest zinc miners and smelters, has warned that it expects a challenging year ahead due to declining zinc prices and the strong Australian dollar. In its latest quarterly report released today, Pasminco said that zinc prices have fallen nearly 30% over the past six months due to slowing demand and oversupply in the market.

The price drops have been exacerbated by the strong appreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar, which reduces the revenue Pasminco generates from its zinc exports. Pasminco's Chief Executive Officer, John Smith, said "The combination of softening zinc demand, increasing supply from major zinc mines coming online, and the rising Australian dollar have created difficult market conditions that will likely persist for some time."

Pasminco derives over 80% of its revenue from zinc mining and smelting operations located primarily in Australia. The company has cut costs and delayed expansion plans at several of its sites in response to the market conditions but warns that its full-year profits are still likely to take a significant hit. Pasminco had already downgraded its earnings guidance last month, forecasting a drop of up to 35% compared to the previous year. The share price fell a further 4% following today's report on concerns over the company's near-term prospects.

Some analysts believe zinc markets will rebalance over the next 6-12 months as supply cuts take effect, which could provide relief for Pasminco and support a recovery in its share price. However, the outlook also depends heavily on the Australian dollar, which shows no signs of weakening from current high levels according to most experts. With its high exposure to both zinc and the Australian dollar, Pasminco remains vulnerable to further turbulence until one or both of these factors shift in its favor.
