BHP Steel expects to increase earnings despite slow Australian market growth, says CEO Ron McNeilly  

BHP Steel, Australia’s largest steel producer, expects earnings to rise over the next financial year despite lackluster growth in the domestic steel market. In an interview, BHP Steel CEO Ron McNeilly said increased demand from China and major infrastructure projects will help boost the company’s sales and profits.

“While the Australian construction market remains sluggish, demand from China continues to grow at a healthy pace and that will drive our export volumes over the coming year,” McNeilly said. “At the same time, we have secured contracts to supply steel for several major transport and mining projects which will underpin stronger production.”

BHP Steel produces around 60% of Australia’s raw steel and employs 12,000 people. The company exports about 70% of its steel production to China, South Korea, Thailand, and other Asian nations. However, the domestic market accounts for half of BHP’s revenue due to higher prices charged locally compared with exports.    

Growth in Australia’s steel market slowed to just 1.5% in the year ending June 2019 amid a broader economic slowdown. The construction sector, which is a major consumer of steel, has been hit particularly hard. However, McNeilly said BHP Steel was in a good position to weather the challenging local conditions due to several multi-year contracts it had secured and the competitive Australian dollar, which supports export demand.

One such contract is for the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel, which will require over 200,000 tons of Australian steel. BHP also won a tender to supply 100,000 tons of steel for use in the proposed Western Sydney Airport rail link. Although construction is yet to begin on that project, McNeilly said the contract provides revenue certainty.

On the export front, demand from China continues to rise due to government-backed infrastructure spending and a growing appetite for high-quality Australian steel. McNeilly said BHP Steel had recently signed new long-term agreements with major Chinese customers to supply up to 2 million tons of steel over the next three years.  

“While market conditions in Australia remain mixed, our export focus and infrastructure project pipeline will support a solid increase in both sales and earnings over fiscal 2020,” McNeilly said. “Assuming no major economic shocks, we expect revenue to rise by around 8-10% and underlying profit to jump at least 15% compared with last year.”    

Shares in BHP Steel rose 3.2% yesterday following McNeilly’s upbeat assessment. UBS analysts said the company was “superbly positioned” to benefit from its export exposure and infrastructure project work. However, others warned that a sharper housing market downturn or global recession could significantly dent demand and impact BHP’s guidance.
