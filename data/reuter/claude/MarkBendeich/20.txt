BHP posts disappointing 9.8% fall in first-half profits 

Mining giant BHP reported disappointing first-half financial results today as profits fell by 9.8% in the six months to December 31. The fall in profits was due to lower iron ore production volumes and weaker oil prices.

The company said net profits after tax declined to $6.3 billion from $7 billion a year ago. Underlying profits from continuing operations fell by nearly 20% to $5.2 billion. Revenue slipped 3% to $28.8 billion due to lower production volumes in some divisions and lower commodity prices. 

The lower profits will put pressure on the world’s biggest mining company and raise questions about whether cost-cutting measures are yielding the desired results. BHP Billiton chief executive Andrew Mackenzie attributed the disappointing results to "operational challenges" at several mines and weaker oil prices which offset the benefits of higher iron ore prices.

Iron ore production fell by 11% in the first half due to rail maintenance and wet weather impacts. The fall in output meant BHP could not fully capitalize on higher iron ore prices during the period. The oil and gas division also suffered a 24% decline in underlying earnings due to lower oil prices which fell about 35% from a June 2014 peak.    

The results highlight BHP’s dependence on iron ore and oil for a majority of its profits and showcase the challenges in improving productivity and controlling costs. Iron ore and oil accounted for more than 85% of BHP’s underlying EBIT in the first half. Mr. Mackenzie said continued focus on safety, productivity, and reducing costs remains a priority in the current environment of volatile commodity markets.

BHP did not declare an interim dividend and total dividends fell more than 60% to $0.26 per share. The lower dividends are a bid to strengthen the balance sheet during the commodity downturn and following BHP's $7.2 billion in write-downs announced last month. The write-downs stem from four onshore US shale gas assets that have struggled with weak gas prices.

Mr. Mackenzie described the overall results as "disappointing" but said BHP remains focused on optimizing its portfolio and improving operational performance. Investors will be hoping for improved results in the second half if commodity markets continue to recover and BHP's productivity drive starts yielding better outcomes. BHP's shares fell 3.2% in London trading following the financial results release.
