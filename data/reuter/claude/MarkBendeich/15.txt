Pacific Dunlop Ltd looks to cost cutting and acquisitions to reignite share price amid tough competition and low margins   

Pacific Dunlop Ltd, the Melbourne-based footwear and apparel company, announced plans today to boost profitability and share price through significant cost-cutting measures and strategic acquisitions. The company's shares have declined over 25% in the past year due to slowing sales growth and declining margins in the highly competitive footwear and clothing sector.  

Pacific Dunlop's CEO John Smith outlined a three-year turnaround plan focused on reducing costs by over $200 million through supply chain efficiencies, office consolidations, and a 10% reduction in headcount. "We have grown too quickly and not paid enough attention to costs and productivity," said Smith. "We will streamline our operations to regain our competitive edge."

The company will also look to acquire brands and businesses, especially in the athletic footwear and outdoor apparel segments which have higher growth and profit potential. Pacific Dunlop recently purchased two smaller footwear brands to boost its presence in the trail running and hiking shoe market.  

The turnaround plan received a mostly positive reception from investors and analysts. "Pacific Dunlop has strong brands but has lacked focus in recent years, said Mike Investor, an analyst at Share Research Group. “These new initiatives should put the company back on a path to sustainable and profitable growth if management can implement them successfully.”  

Not all were optimistic though. The retail workers' union criticized the layoffs and cost reductions, saying they will reduce customer service and employee morale. Environmental groups also voiced concern over the sustainability impacts of any new acquisitions.  

Smith acknowledged the challenges but said “decisive action” was needed to shore up the balance sheet and revitalize shareholder returns. “This may be painful in the short term, but will ensure Pacific Dunlop is still here making great products for generations to come.” The coming year will likely see whether Smith's turnaround plan can overcome industry headwinds and internal resistance. Pacific Dunlop's share price ticked up 3% on the announcement but remains to be seen whether the revival will take hold.
