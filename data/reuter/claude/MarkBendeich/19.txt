BHP posts disappointing first-half profits, but avoids investor mauling

The world's biggest listed miner BHP reported lower-than-expected  first-half profits on Tuesday, but its shares rose as investors welcomed upbeat forecasts, cost cuts, and strong prices for iron ore and copper. BHP said its underlying profit fell to $US3.69 billion ($5.18 billion) for the six months to December 31 compared with forecasts of $US4.56 billion, hit by one-off charges at its US shale oil operations. However, investors focused on BHP's prediction that profits would rise by up to 29 per cent this financial year as commodity markets recover, and a pledge to hand them increased returns. The result comes as BHP, which is also Australia's biggest listed company, seeks to restore investor confidence in the sector. It follows a string of write-downs at rival mining companies and a deadly dam spill at BHP's Brazilian joint venture, Samarco, in November 2015. BHP's shares rose as much as 5 per cent, outperforming a flat broader market. The miner cited a combination of factors for the weaker-than-expected result, including $US650 million in one-off charges linked to its Fayetteville shale gas operations in the United States.

"While commodity markets started to recover in the 2016 calendar year, our first half financial results reflect the industry conditions seen in late 2015 and early 2016," chief executive Andrew Mackenzie said. Mr Mackenzie said BHP would boost exploration spending by $US250 million to find new ore deposits and lift copper and petroleum output over the next two years. He also outlined plans to cut $US2.2 billion in annual costs, including through job losses. BHP's chairman Jac Nasser said the company would hand up to $US10.4 billion in dividends to shareholders this year, after hiking its half-year payout 3 per cent to $US1.20 a share.

The result will ease pressure on BHP after it abandoned a push into shale oil last year following a $US20 billion investment that resulted in asset writedowns of more than $US7 billion. Rio Tinto last week unveiled a surprise $US1.83 billion first-half net loss, while Anglo American accelerated an overhaul of its portfolio.
