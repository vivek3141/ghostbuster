Tabcorp Holdings, Australia's largest gaming company, is hoping for a Melbourne Cup miracle to spur growth in its wagering division. The company saw its total revenue from wagering decrease 1.9% to $2.53 billion in FY2019 due to soft results in its retail wagering channels.  

Tabcorp executives have pinned their hopes on a strong  showing at the Melbourne Cup, Australia's most prestigious horse race, to bolster wagering turnover in the first half of FY2020. The Melbourne Cup is Tabcorp's single biggest wagering event, attracting more than $150 million in turnover. Last year's Melbourne Cup saw a 3.3% increase in turnover for Tabcorp despite an overall stagnant wagering market.

"The Melbourne Cup is the golden opportunity to reignite customers' interest in horse racing and wagering," said Tabcorp CEO David Attenborough. "A thrilling race and some big payouts could be just what we need to turn around our recent wagering performance."

However, attracting customers to place bets may be challenging given lackluster results recently. Tabcorp's retail wagering revenue, which includes bets placed at hotels and TAB agencies, was down 11.5% last year. The company has invested heavily in its digital channels in an effort to offset retail declines, but growth in digital wagering has slowed to just 5.7% -- down from over 20% growth a few years ago.  

Tabcorp has taken measures to boost digital engagement including offering new types of exotic bets, streaming more race meets live, and increasing its investment in marketing campaigns. However, reinvigorating customer interest in horse racing may require something special. A Melbourne Cup win by an underdog or a record-breaking victory could capture both public interest and attention in the nation's racing culture. For Tabcorp, that may translate into the wagering win the company desperately needs. Overall, Tabcorp's wagering division performance for the first half of FY2020 could come down to whether the Melbourne Cup provides that miracle.
