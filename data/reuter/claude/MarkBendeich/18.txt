BHP's First-Half Profits Drop 9.8%, But Avoids Investor Mauling

BHP, the world's largest mining company, reported a 9.8% drop in first-half profits but avoided angering investors who had braced for worse results due to low commodity prices. 

The Anglo-Australian company said net profit fell to $3.24 billion in the six months through December from $3.6 billion a year earlier. But the result beat analysts' forecasts of around $3 billion, allowing BHP's shares to gain more than 3% in early London trading.

BHP has been hit hard by a slump in prices of iron ore, coal and copper amid slowing growth in China. The company said it doesn't expect a quick rebound in commodity markets, but it has responded by cutting costs and reducing investments in future projects. 

"While commodity markets remain challenging, we will continue to focus on the things within our control, notably cost reductions, productivity improvements and maintaining capital discipline," said BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie.

BHP trimmed exploration and development spending by nearly $3 billion, or 58%, in the first half, while also cutting operation costs by $1.4 billion. The company said it is on track for full-year cost cuts of around $4 billion.

The drop in profits and cautious outlook, though anticipated, highlights the pressure on global mining giants who have little option but to batten down the hatches in the face of weak demand and oversupply in most key commodities. However, BHP's cost-cutting campaign has shielded it from a worse impact.

Revenue for the half fell 12% to $30.2 billion, mostly due to declining iron ore and copper prices. Coal revenue also dropped, though higher coal volumes partially offset price falls.
