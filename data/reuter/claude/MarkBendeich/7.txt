Doctor who facilitated world's first legal mercy killing will make software and instructions for death machine available on the internet  

Dr. Philip Nitschke, an Australian physician known as the “Euthanasia Doctor,” announced today that he will make plans for a 3D-printed “euthanasia device” freely available on the internet. Nitschke said he hopes the plans will allow people around the world to construct devices allowing for peaceful, lawful deaths.

Nitschke's announcement comes on the heels of him facilitating the world's first known legal euthanasia of a terminally ill patient outside of a hospital. Late last year, Nitschke helped 71-year old Perth resident Kerry Robertson end her own life after a long battle with cancer. Robertson used a euthanasia device built by Nitschke's nonprofit Exit International to administer a lethal dose of barbiturates. While euthanasia and assisted suicide remain illegal in many parts of Australia, Robertson's death was allowed under a law that permits terminally ill patients in Western Australia to end their lives. 

Nitschke said Robertson's peaceful death inspired him to make the plans as widely available as possible. “If someone is dying in agony and wishes for a peaceful end, they should not have artificial barriers put in their way because of where they happen to live,” Nitschke said. The 3D plans explain how to construct a “euthanasia device” using commonly available materials that can administer a lethal injection of barbiturates via an intravenous drip.

Nitschke acknowledged that making the plans publicly available raised ethical concerns, but argued that dying patients have a fundamental right to end their suffering with dignity. “While some may see this as a risky endeavor, I believe we must trust individuals to make their own end-of-life decisions,” he said. Nitschke plans to release the plans on anonymous file-sharing sites in an effort to avoid censorship. 

Euthanasia opponents argue that making such information widely available could enable abuse and exploitation. “There is simply no way to ensure these devices are only used for voluntary euthanasia,” said Dr. Rachael Wong of the Australian Medical Association. “They could easily be used for malicious or involuntary euthanasia.”  . . .
