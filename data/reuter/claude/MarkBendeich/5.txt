Foster's Brewing Group Looks to Expand Through Joint Ventures in India and Vietnam

Foster's Brewing Group, the Australian beer conglomerate, announced today that it has entered into joint venture agreements to begin brewing and distributing Foster's brand beers in India and Vietnam. The deals mark a major push by Foster's into the fast-growing beer markets of Asia, where a rising middle class and growing economies have boosted demand for international beers and brands.   

In India, Foster's signed a deal with United Breweries Limited, India's largest brewer, to establish a new joint venture called Foster's United Breweries Private Limited. The joint venture will produce, market and distribute Foster's beers across India, including Foster's Lager and Crown Ambassador. India's beer market is growing at over 10% per year and is the third largest in Asia. Foster's currently has a limited import presence in India but the new joint venture and local production will allow the company to reach millions of new customers across the country.

Meanwhile, in Vietnam, Foster's entered into an agreement with state-owned Vietnam Beverage Company to form Foster's Vietnam, a new joint venture to brew and distribute Foster's products locally. Vietnam is Southeast Asia's fastest growing beer market, growing at over 15% annually. The deal will see Foster's Lager and Crown Lager initially produced and sold in Vietnam, with other products to potentially follow. The venture will give Foster's an entry point into a market that still has relatively low beer consumption per capita but is attracting increasing interest from international brands.

The new joint ventures demonstrate Foster's renewed focus on expansion into emerging markets following a few years of stagnant growth. The company's primary markets of Australia, New Zealand and parts of Europe have declined or remained flat. CEO Andrew Carthew said "Asia represents the biggest opportunity for growth in the beer industry today. We're excited to be partnering with strong local companies in India and Vietnam to build Foster's into a leading international beer brand in these countries."   

Foster's is not alone in pivoting to Asia for growth. Rivals like AB InBev, Heineken and Carlsberg have also recently accelerated investments and distribution deals across Asia. AB InBev in particular has bought its way into new markets, acquiring major brewers in China, Vietnam, South Korea and Australia in recent years. The deals have given AB InBev and others a head start in some Asian markets that Foster's is now racing to catch up in.

The new joint ventures in India and Vietnam are subject to regulatory approvals but Foster's aims to begin brewing before the end of this year and start selling Foster's branded products in stores across both countries in early 2020. If successful, the push into two of Asia's most promising beer markets could drive a new era of growth and expansion for Foster's over the coming decade.
