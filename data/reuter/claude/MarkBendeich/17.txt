BHP expected to report fall in half year net profit, but analysts predict a rebound for Australia's biggest company 

BHP, the world's largest mining company, is expected to report a decline in net profit for the six months ended December 31 when it releases its half-year results on Tuesday. However, analysts predict the company will rebound in the second half of the financial year as commodity prices recover and major projects come online.

BHP's net profit is forecast to fall to $3.7 billion for the first half, down from $5.1 billion a year earlier, according to a consensus estimate compiled by Bloomberg. The drop is largely attributed to price falls for some of BHP's key commodity exports like coal, copper and oil over the period. Revenues for the half are predicted to slip 9% to $30.8 billion.  

Despite the weaker first-half performance, analysts remain optimistic about BHP's full-year outlook. "We expect BHP's results to trough in the first half and see potential for upside in the second half from volume and commodity price increases," said RBC Capital Markets analyst Tyler Broda. UBS analyst Glyn Lawcock also sees BHP's financial performance improving over the remainder of the financial year "supported by solid volumes, cost cutting and higher realized commodity prices."

Driving the expected rebound in profits are several factors. Commodity prices including iron ore, copper, coal and oil have rallied from their lows in recent months amid stronger demand from China and supply constraints. BHP also has major projects coming online that will boost volumes and lower costs, including the $2.5 billion South Flank iron ore project in Western Australia. BHP chief executive Andrew Mackenzie said in December the projects are running on time and on budget.

Cost cutting has been another focus for BHP under Mackenzie's leadership. The company reduced controllable cash costs by around $2.3 billion over the 2016 and 2017 financial years, exceeding its initial $2 billion target. BHP is now aiming for at least another $2 billion in productivity gains over the 2019 and 2020 financial years. "BHP has consistently met and exceeded its cost out targets - this gives us confidence in substantial free cash flow generation over the next 6-12 months," said Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Young.

BHP's share price has rallied more than 20% over the last three months, suggesting investors are also optimistic about the company's outlook. The shares closed at $33.49 on Monday, up from a recent low of $27 in December last year.
