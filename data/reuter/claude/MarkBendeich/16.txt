Amcor Ltd Expected to Report Heavy Slump in Annual Profit, But Analysts Optimistic About Future Recovery  

Amcor Ltd, the Australian packaging giant, is expected to announce a sizable drop in annual profits when it reports full-year results on Thursday. According to market analysts, Amcor's net profit for the fiscal year 2020 is forecast to decline by up to 25% compared to the previous year due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations.  

The virus outbreak has disrupted Amcor's global supply chain and manufacturing facilities, leading to under-utilization of its production capacity. Temporary closures of some plants and weak demand from customers in industries like food service have also weighed on the company's performance. However, analysts predict Amcor's profits will start to recover over the next 6-12 months as economic activity picks up pace around the world.

"The worst impacts of the pandemic appear to have passed for Amcor," said John Smith, an analyst at ABC Bank. "While this year's results will be significantly down, we are optimistic the company will return to solid growth as early as next year." He expects Amcor's net profit will rebound by up to 20% in fiscal 2021.

Amcor derives over half its revenue from outside Australia, with a significant presence in North America, Latin America, and Europe. As lockdown restrictions ease in many countries, demand from Amcor's customers across various sectors is showing signs of improvement. The company could also benefit from a surge in demand for food, beverage and healthcare packaging. 

Amcor chief executive Ron Delia said the company's global scale and diversity had helped navigate the challenges of the pandemic. "We acted swiftly to implement measures ensuring the health and safety of our staff while maintaining continuity of supply for our customers around the world," he said.

While the short-term outlook remains uncertain, analysts say Amcor is in a solid position for long term growth due to its stable cash flows, strong balance sheet and strategic focus on new technologies and sustainability. The company's shares have bounced back 25% from their March lows, reflecting rising optimism about Amcor's prospects.
