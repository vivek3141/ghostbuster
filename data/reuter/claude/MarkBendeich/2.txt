Pacific Magazines and Printing Ltd expects earnings to rise thanks to lower paper prices and cost-cutting measures

Pacific Magazines and Printing Ltd, the publisher behind popular titles like Nature Lovers Magazine, Traveler Weekly, and Tech Spotter, announced today that it expects earnings to increase over the next fiscal year thanks to declining paper prices and internal cost-cutting initiatives.

The price of paper pulp, the raw material used to produce paper, has decreased by over 20% over the last six months. Pacific Magazines relies heavily on paper to print its collection of 23 magazine titles and spends over $200 million annually on paper. The drop in prices is expected to save the company at least $40 million next year.  

"The decrease in paper prices could not have come at a better time," said CEO Akiko Nakamura. "We have been focused on reducing costs across the board, but declining materials prices provide additional opportunities for savings and earnings growth."  

In addition to lower paper prices, Pacific Magazines has reduced operating costs by transitioning some magazine titles to online-only formats, consolidating offices, and limiting travel and entertainment budgets. The company has set an aggressive target of $75 million in cost reductions for the upcoming fiscal year, equal to about 10% of total operating costs.   

Combined with stable magazine advertising and subscription revenues, these efforts are expected to increase Pacific Magazines' earnings by at least 25% next year according to financial analysts. The additional cash flow and earnings could allow the company to reinvest in new magazine brands, digital offerings, and journalism to better position itself for the long term in an industry facing significant disruption.

Shares of Pacific Magazines stock were up 3.4% on the earnings forecast. The company will release its official fourth-quarter and full-year results at the end of next month.
