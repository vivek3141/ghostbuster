Australian Steelmaker Proposes Alliances for Building Huge Steel Mills in Asia  

BlueScope Steel, Australia's largest steel producer, announced today that it is seeking joint venture partners to build large steelmaking plants in Asia. The company hopes to take advantage of increasing demand for steel in China, India, Vietnam and other fast-growing Asian economies.

Paul O'Malley, BlueScope's Managing Director and CEO, said "Asia is the heart of the global steel market, with more than two-thirds of the world's steel produced and consumed there. We see a significant opportunity to establish large-scale manufacturing operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances with major steelmakers across Asia."

The company is looking to build steel mills that produce 5 to 10 million tonnes of steel slabs and hot rolled coil annually. The investment required for these mega mills is estimated to be $5 to $8 billion each. BlueScope plans to supply its proprietary steelmaking technology and provide operational expertise to the joint ventures, while local partners would supply land, infrastructure, raw materials and work forces.  

The new steel mills would produce hot rolled coil and slabs, which are semi-finished steel products used to make cold rolled coil, plate steel, piping and other finished steel goods. The goal is to achieve lower production costs through large-scale, highly efficient operations. The steel would primarily supply Asian markets but could also be exported globally.

BlueScope recorded revenues of A$12.6 billion in the financial year ending June 30, 2019. While the company produces most of its steel in Australia, BlueScope sees limited opportunities for growth domestically. Expanding into Asia through joint ventures allows the company to tap into faster growing markets abroad.

Skeptics argue that overcapacity and weaker steel prices could undermine the profitability of new mega mills in Asia. However, BlueScope and other proponents point to steady demand from Asia's massive infrastructure builds, automotive sectors and manufacturing industries. They say modern, highly efficient plants would also drive down operating costs and deliver competitive advantages. 

BlueScope plans to finalize partnerships and begin construction of the joint venture steel mills in Vietnam and India in 2020, with the first mills commencing operations 2-3 years later. The move signals Australia's steel icon is set to play a bigger role on the global steel stage through strategic alliances in Asia.
