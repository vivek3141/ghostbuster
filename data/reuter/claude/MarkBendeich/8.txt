Crown Ltd Looks to Expand Winning Streak in Asia with High-Rollers 

Crown Resorts Ltd, Australia’s largest casino operator, is turning to Asia’s high-rolling gamblers to continue its winning streak and drive profits over the next few years. The company announced plans to attract more VIP gamblers, especially from mainland China, to its flagship Australian casinos in Melbourne and Perth, as well as several properties set to open across Asia. 

Crown has spent over $2.2 billion building massive casino resorts, including the landmark Crown Sydney which will open in 2021. The new properties are intended to lure wealthy gamblers from Asia, particularly China, who are fuelling the growth of casino gambling worldwide. Crown hopes that putting lavish six-star hotels, luxury shopping malls, extravagant dining options and entertainment under one roof will entice these big-spending tourists.

The company’s profits slid 9.3% last year, dragged down by slowing general economic activity in Australia and the impact of bushfires over the New Year period. However, its VIP program continues to thrive, generating over 60% of Crown’s earnings in Australia. Revenue from this segment increased by 16% year-on-year. Crown’s VIP program targets wealthy Asian gamblers, offering exclusive luxury experiences and generous commissions to agents who bring clients to Crown.  

“Our VIP program continues to perform strongly and we are focused on further developing trusted partnerships with our international premium customers,” said Ken Barton, Crown Resorts CEO.

Crown’s push into Asia started over a decade ago with the opening of casinos in Macau, the world’s largest gambling hub. It aims to replicate that success across Asia, with new integrated resorts opening in Sri Lanka and Vietnam soon and hoping for licenses in Japan. The foray into new Asian markets, however, has not been smooth sailing. Crown has faced regulatory issues in Sri Lanka and Vietnam, delaying the planned opening of its new resorts. Japan’s government is also still mulling whether to legalize casino gambling in the country.

“Asia represents a significant growth opportunity for Crown, but there are risks given the regulatory uncertainties and competitive intensities across different markets,” said James Packer, a director and controlling shareholder of Crown Resorts.

The ambitious expansion in Australia and Asia is a bold bet by Crown that Chinese high-rollers, in particular, will continue flocking to its lavish casino resorts. Whether this gamble pays off remains to be seen, as China's economy slows and authorities tighten restriction on capital outflows. For now, though, Crown remains optimistic that its winning streak with Asian VIPs will continue.
