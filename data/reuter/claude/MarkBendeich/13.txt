ICI Australia Reports Steep Fall in Profit Due to Plastics Prices, but Poised for Major Expansion in Asia 

ICI Australia, the local subsidiary of British chemicals giant Imperial Chemical Industries, reported a 37% drop in full-year profit today due to falling prices for some of its key plastics products. However, the company said it is well positioned for growth in Asia despite global economic headwinds.

Net profit for the year ended June 30 fell to A$127.5 million from A$202.3 million a year earlier. Revenue edged up 1% to A$3.19 billion. The results were slightly below analyst expectations.

The company attributed the profit slump largely to a collapse in prices for polyethylene and polypropylene, two of the most common types of plastics. Strong competition from new production facilities in the U.S. and Middle East, as well as reduced demand from China, put downward pressure on prices for these products during the year.

“Plastics represent about 40% of our revenue, so when those prices significantly weaken it has a big impact,” said Managing Director John Gosden. “However, we expect plastics demand and pricing to stabilize going forward and our diversified portfolio leaves us well placed to benefit from opportunities in other areas.”

ICI Australia generates about half its revenue from paints and coatings, where it is the market leader. It also has significant chemical, agrochemical and personal products divisions. Mr. Gosden said sales in most of these segments were solid and the company gained market share across the board during the year.

The company remains bullish on growth prospects in China, Southeast Asia and India. It plans to invest A$65 million to build three new production facilities in Malaysia, Thailand and India over the next 18 months to meet increasing demand in these regions. Mr. Gosden said the new sites could boost ICI’s annual revenue in Asia by up to A$400 million over the next five years.

ICI’s shares rose 2.3% after the results announcement, signalling the company’s longer-term growth story remains intact despite the fall in annual profit. With a strong balance sheet, diverse business portfolio and expansion plans in higher-growth Asian markets, ICI appears poised to navigate challenging economic conditions and continue generating solid returns for shareholders.
