Optus Vision considers future support for Australian Rugby League after court defeat 

Optus Vision, the streaming service owned by telecommunications giant Optus, is reviewing its sponsorship of the Australian Rugby League (ARL) competition after suffering a defeat in the Federal Court. The court ruled that Optus Vision breached its broadcast rights agreement with Foxtel, the pay TV provider owned by News Corp and Telstra, by streaming NRL games to mobile devices.

The ruling is a blow to Optus Vision, which signed a $50 million, five-year deal with the NRL in 2018 to become the competition's streaming partner. The deal gave Optus Vision the right to stream NRL games live and on-demand to subscribers via its mobile app and website. However, Foxtel claimed Optus Vision violated the terms of Foxtel's own NRL broadcast rights by extending streaming to tablets, smartphones, and other mobile devices. Foxtel's deal with the NRL only covered traditional television platforms.

In a statement, Optus Vision said it was "disappointed" by the court's decision and was reviewing the partnership in light of the verdict. The streaming service acknowledged it may need to renegotiate parts of the existing NRL deal to clarify device eligibility and rights. The statement reiterated Optus Vision's commitment to supporting key Australian sports content but also noted the company would act to protect its interests.

The ruling has thrown the NRL's own broadcast arrangements into chaos just weeks before the start of the new season. ARL chief executive Todd Greenberg has met with both Optus Vision and Foxtel executives to discuss resolving the dispute in a manner that ensures maximum coverage and revenue for the competition. The NRL relies heavily on broadcast deals, worth over $2 billion in total, to fund its clubs and grassroots development programs.

While Optus Vision considers its next steps, the Federal Court decision means the telco will no longer stream NRL games to mobile devices when the competition resumes at the end of May. Foxtel will regain exclusive control of broadcasting to these platforms, a minor victory that provides some compensation for losing many traditional subscribers to streaming alternatives. The messy rights dispute highlights the disruptive impact of live sports streaming on decade-old broadcast models. With more sports preparing to put streaming rights out to tender over the next few years, the complex Optus Vision-Foxtel-NRL triangle may foreshadow further clashes between traditional broadcasters, streaming services, and sporting codes.
