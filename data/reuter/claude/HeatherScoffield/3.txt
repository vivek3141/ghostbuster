Mineral explorers missing in Canadian snow squall near Voisey's Bay nickel deposit

Two mineral exploration geologists conducting surveys near the renowned Voisey's Bay nickel deposit in northern Labrador, Canada went missing yesterday after radio contact was lost during a heavy snow squall. John McKenzie, 32, and Maya Singh, 29, were conducting ground magnetic surveys for their employer, Sudbury-based junior exploration company Northern Shield Resources, when a storm system moved into the area, severely restricting visibility. 

The pair were traveling via snowmobile between survey locations around 20 kilometers from the remote Voisey's Bay camp, which is only accessible by air and serves major mining companies active in the area, including Vale, the Brazilian owner of the operating Voisey's Bay nickel mine. When McKenzie and Singh failed to return to camp yesterday evening, a search was launched at first light this morning, according to officials from Voisey's Bay Mine, who are assisting with rescue efforts. However, blowing snow and near zero visibility have hampered search operations through much of the day.

A spokesman for Northern Shield Resources said the missing geologists were experienced field personnel and had been conducting surveys for the company in the Voisey's Bay area for the past three months as part of its nickel exploration program. However, the harsh and rapidly changing weather conditions of northern Labrador can be dangerous even for seasoned explorers. The search is focusing on the areas between the geologists’ last known GPS locations and the Voisey's Bay camp, but rescue planes have been unable to land due to poor visibility for much of the day, limiting the search to low-level flyovers. Survival experts have cautioned that prolonged exposure to extreme wind chill could be life-threatening.

Officials at Northern Shield Resources and Voisey’s Bay Mine said McKenzie and Singh were well equipped for cold weather exploration and had emergency survival gear, but voiced concern that the pair could become disoriented in the heavy, blowing snow, even if traveling a familiar route via snowmobile. The search will continue at first light tomorrow, with improved weather conditions forecast, according to a spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which is coordinating rescue efforts from a staging area near Nain, Labrador, the nearest town with an airstrip, located about 150 kilometers southeast of Voisey’s Bay. All remain hopeful the missing geologists will be located once search planes and crews can be deployed at scale with clearing weather.
