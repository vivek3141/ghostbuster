Aging Gold Zone near Timmins Sparks New Exploration Boom 

A cluster of gold mines near Timmins, Ontario that were thought to be past their prime are showing new signs of life. Rich veins of gold are being discovered in areas adjacent to aging mines that were thought to be largely depleted. Junior mining companies have staked hundreds of claims in the Timmins region over the past year, hoping to take advantage of new exploration technologies that can detect gold deposits previously missed.

The biggest find is coming from Triumph Gold Corp. The Vancouver-based company recently reported assay results of up to 7.7 grams of gold per tonne of rock over 6.1 meters at its Freegold Mountain project, just 10 kilometers from the city of Timmins. “These results confirm the potential for high-grade gold in a geological setting very similar to other multi-million-ounce gold deposits in the Timmins camp,” said Triumph CEO Paul Reynolds. The company has raised over $10 million to finance further drilling on the property.

Other companies staking ground in the Timmins region include Sokoman Iron Corp. and private exploration firm Golden Chalice Resources. They are hoping to duplicate the success of companies like Newmont Goldcorp, whose Dome and Hollinger mines produced over 70 million ounces of gold during the 20th century. “With new technologies like laser ablation and improved geochemical assays, we can now find deposits that were likely missed by the prospecting methods used when those giant Timmins mines were first developed,” said Golden Chalice CEO Peter McRae.

The staking rush and early exploration successes suggest the venerable gold fields of Timmins may have more surprises left to give up. Companies with land holdings in the area could be poised to make further discoveries and Timmins may be on the cusp of another gold boom.
