North American metals producers to face weakened third-quarter earnings, says Reuters survey

North American metals producers are expected to report weaker third-quarter earnings over the next few weeks due to falling commodity prices, according to a Reuters survey of analysts.   

The price of copper, aluminum, and other base metals dropped significantly in the three months to September, weighing on the profits of companies that mine and process the raw materials. The U.S.-China trade war and slowing global economic growth fueled fears of lower demand and declining manufacturing activity. 

“Metals stocks have really struggled this year as investors worry about the outlook for the global economy and corporate profits in the sector,” said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations LLC in Pewaukee, Wisconsin.

Production cuts by the world’s biggest mining companies are expected to provide some support for metal prices in the coming months. They may also mitigate the hit to earnings for companies such as Freeport-McMoRan Inc, Southern Copper Corp, and Teck Resources Ltd.             

But in the third quarter, the price of copper, used in construction and power grids, declined almost 9% in London. Aluminum slid 15% and zinc was down around 12%. Lead dropped more than 17%.

Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer, is expected to report a 47% fall in earnings, according to analysts polled by Refinitiv IBES. Profits at Southern Copper, one of the biggest copper producers, are forecast to drop 25%.

“We do not expect the current negative macro sentiment regarding growth and trade to turn positive soon,” said analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. They cut earnings estimates for copper miners by 7% to reflect the lower copper price.

Teck Resources, one of the world's biggest exporters of steelmaking coal and zinc, is likely to report a 75% plunge in third-quarter profit, partly due to strikes at its coal mines.  

In contrast, precious metals producers like Barrick Gold Corp and Newmont Goldcorp Corp are forecast to report higher earnings thanks to gains in gold prices. Gold is seen as a safe haven investment during times of geopolitical or economic uncertainty.
