Barrick Gold Corp Reports Lower Q3 Earnings Due to After-Tax Charge and Higher Operating Costs 

Barrick Gold Corp reported lower earnings in the third quarter due to an after-tax charge and higher operating costs. The world's second largest gold producer saw profits decline to $264 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with $347 million, or 20 cents a share, in the same quarter last year.

The lower earnings were partly attributed to a $415 million after-tax impairment charge related to Barrick's Pueblo Viejo gold mine in the Dominican Republic. Excluding one-time items, adjusted net earnings were $406 million, or 23 cents a share, which beat analysts’ estimates of 22 cents a share.

Revenue in the quarter rose to $3.14 billion from $2.83 billion last year. Gold production increased to 1.25 million ounces from 1.15 million ounces a year earlier. The average realized gold price was $1,334 per ounce, higher than $1,195 per ounce in the third quarter of 2017.  

However, rising costs continue to pose a challenge. All-in sustaining costs, an industry metric that reflects total expenses, rose to $785 per ounce from $750 per ounce a year ago. The costs were higher than expected due to increased spending on maintenance, fuel, and consumables. Energy prices have been rising which also added to costs.

Barrick expects all-in sustaining costs to be at the higher end of its guidance range of $750 to $790 per ounce for 2018. It has trimmed its production guidance to 4.5 million to 5 million ounces from 4.6 million to 5 million ounces previously.

Barrick executive chairman John Thornton remained optimistic about the company’s long-term outlook. “We continue to make progress in building a business that can prosper regardless of the gold price environment...Already our efforts are bearing fruit, enabling us to deliver solid results despite some cost pressures this quarter.”

The results came as speculation mounts that Barrick may merge with rival gold miner Newmont Mining Corp. A combination would allow the companies to cut costs, gain greater scale, and boost investor interest in the gold sector. However, there are no guarantees a deal will materialize.

In summary, while Barrick Gold beat earnings estimates in the third quarter, higher costs and lowered production guidance weighed on the results. The company continues to take steps to streamline its operations, cut debt and improve free cash flow, which could help offset challenges if gold prices decline in the coming quarters.
