Exploration companies strike gold in Northern Ontario's ageing gold zone near Timmins  

Two junior mining companies, Century Gold Exploration Ltd. and Northern Abitibi Resources Inc., have recently announced promising gold finds in Northern Ontario's Abitibi gold belt, located near the historic gold mining town of Timmins. 

Century Gold Exploration made headlines this week with the discovery of a new gold-bearing shear zone on their property about 50 kilometers west of Timmins. Early drilling results indicate potentially economic grades of gold along a zone measuring over 200 meters long and up to 10 meters wide. The company completed 8 drill holes in their initial phase of exploratory drilling, 7 of which intersected significant gold mineralization. The findings point to the potential for both open pit and underground mineable gold resources. 

“We are thrilled with these early results which validate our geological model and demonstrate the significant potential of this property,” said John Thompson, President and CEO of Century Gold Exploration. The company’s stock price skyrocketed over 50% on the news.

Meanwhile, Northern Abitibi Resources also announced promising results from their drilling program on a site just 30 kilometers from Century Gold Exploration’s property. They discovered gold mineralization in 15 of 17 drill holes, uncovering gold-bearing structures measuring over 1 kilometer in length. The mineralization remains open in multiple directions.  

“The scale of this discovery is exceptional,” said Christine Walker, Vice President of Exploration at Northern Abitibi Resources. “The gold grades near surface suggest the potential for lower cost open pit mining, and deeper drilling has also uncovered higher grade shoots that could be suitable for underground mining.”

The discoveries by Century Gold Exploration and Northern Abitibi Resources reaffirm the remaining potential of Northern Ontario’s Abitibi gold belt, considered one of the most prolific gold producing regions in the world with over 29 million ounces of gold produced to date. While many of the large gold deposits in the area were found in the early 20th century, exploration companies are now deploying modern exploration techniques and new geological models to uncover previously undiscovered gold mineralization. The use of gold deposits for new mining projects is also being aided by higher gold prices, which increased over 50% since 2015.  

Investor interest in the junior mining companies operating in the Abitibi region has intensified on the news of the recent gold strikes. Shares of Century Gold Exploration gained over 60% this week, while Northern Abitibi Resources’ stock rose 43%. If further drilling confirms the promise of these initial gold finds, it could drive a new wave of mining development in the historic Northern Ontario gold fields.
