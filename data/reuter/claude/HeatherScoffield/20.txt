Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton to Attend International Conference in Manila Despite Hospitalization  

Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton is determined to push through with his scheduled trip to Manila, Philippines this week to attend an international economic conference despite being hospitalized over the weekend for severe dehydration and exhaustion. 

Eggleton, 71, was rushed to the hospital Saturday after collapsing in his Ottawa home. He was rehydrated intravenously and kept overnight for observation. His doctors advised him to rest for a few days but Eggleton insisted on traveling to Manila for the Association of South East Asian Nations Economic Ministers meeting.

"Minister Eggleton is feeling better and determined to represent Canada at this important gathering of trade ministers," said Emma Richards, Eggleton's press secretary. "His doctors have cleared him to travel as long as he promises to get extra rest between conference sessions and pace himself."

Eggleton has been the lead on several important trade deals between Canada and ASEAN countries in recent years. The ASEAN conference is focused on forging new partnerships within the 10-member bloc as well as with dialogue partners like Canada and aims to boost economic ties in areas like e-commerce, trade facilitation, and supply chain connectivity.

Eggleton has served as Canada's Trade Minister under Prime Minister Jean Chretien since 1999. He previously held other cabinet posts including Defense Minister and Minister of Veterans Affairs. Despite his long political career, close associates say this is the first time Eggleton has had a serious health issue. However, friends note he has been working extremely hard recently to finalize some trade deals and may have pushed himself to the point of exhaustion.

While Eggleton's hospitalization has sparked some questions about his health and stamina, most analysts expect him to slow down and take better care of himself after this scare. Eggleton's presence and role at the ASEAN conference this week will likely determine if he is up for the demanding schedule of a senior cabinet minister and if any reassignment or shuffling may be needed to lighten his workload going forward.
