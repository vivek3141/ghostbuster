Barrick Gold Corp Reports Lower Q3 Earnings Due to After-Tax Charge and Higher Costs 

Barrick Gold Corp, the world's second largest gold producer, reported lower third-quarter earnings on Wednesday due to an after-tax charge at its Veladero gold mine and higher costs. 

Barrick reported adjusted net earnings of $264 million, or 15 cents per share, compared with $387 million, or 22 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose to $2.68 billion from $2.63 billion.

The Toronto-based miner booked an after-tax charge of $395 million at its Veladero mine, stemming from a resolution of a previously disclosed regulatory matter. Barrick also spent more on its operations, with cost of sales rising to $1.48 billion from $1.44 billion.

"Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate the impact higher costs can have in the gold industry," said Barrick President Kelvin Dushnisky. "Controlling and ultimately reducing costs and improving productivity across the company is a key priority going forward."

Gold production fell to 1.25 million ounces from 1.31 million ounces, due to lower output from Veladero.  The company maintained its full-year guidance of 5 million to 5.25 million ounces of gold.

The Veladero charge pushed Barrick to a net loss of $264 million, or 15 cents per share, compared with net earnings of $387 million, or 22 cents per share.

The higher costs and lower gold output weighed on Barrick's shares, which fell 3.7 percent to $16.94 in Toronto and 4 percent in New York.   Barrick's shares have declined more than 50 percent this year as gold prices fell to five-year lows.

"The old Barrick would not have survived in this environment and we're not going back to the old Barrick," said Executive Chairman John Thornton, adding the company has cut about $4 billion in expenditures since he and Dushnisky took the helm in 2015.

Barrick is targeting an additional $3 billion in reductions over the next five years to make operations more profitable and efficient at lower gold prices. The savings will come from reducing the workforce, decreasing procurement costs and squeezing more productivity from existing mines, Thornton said.

"Getting our costs down and making our existing operations much more efficient is the single best investment opportunity we have as a company to generate good returns for shareholders," said Thornton.
