EPA loses bid to freeze shares in mining financier's company over environmental case

The Environmental Protection Agency lost its appeal today to freeze shares of a major mining company held by an Australian financier, as part of an effort to ensure funds for an environmental cleanup. 

The EPA had sought to freeze 32 million shares of Pebble Limited Partnership held by Northern Dynasty Minerals, arguing the shares could be sold to avoid paying for potential cleanup costs at the proposed Pebble Mine site in Alaska. Northern Dynasty is the sole owner of Pebble Limited Partnership.

A federal appeals court in Seattle ruled today that the EPA lacked the authority to take such an action at this stage. The judges said the EPA cannot restrain assets when there is no "imminent" threat of harm.

“The EPA has authority to take action under the Clean Water Act to prevent pollution, but that authority has limits," said Circuit Judge Mary Schroeder in the opinion.  "They cannot freeze a public company's assets in a speculative move to address unknown future costs.”

The Pebble Mine has been a controversial project, with groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council arguing it could damage pristine salmon fisheries in the Bristol Bay region. Pebble Limited Partnership has maintained that a smaller mining operation would minimize risks to the environment.

The EPA proposed restrictions on the project in 2014 and considered vetoing permits for it, but that action was halted after Northern Dynasty complained the agency had not followed proper procedures. The company filed a lawsuit when the EPA attempted to freeze its shares.

“This is a resounding victory for Northern Dynasty and Pebble,” said Ron Thiessen, president of Northern Dynasty. “The court made clear the EPA vastly overreached its authority."

But conservation groups expressed disappointment the agency now has lost another tool to ensure Pebble Mine does not move forward without proper safeguards.

"The Pebble Mine is a uniquely poor site for such an operation, and its impacts could affect sustainable seafood, wildlife and communities for generations to come," said Tim Bristol, director of SalmonState. "Our watershed, and the planet, deserve policies that put long term environmental health over corporate greed."

The EPA may consider other options for involvement in the project's progress, but limits on a federal agency's preemptive actions have been underscored by today's ruling. For now, Northern Dynasty remains in control of shares that had been at the center of a multi-year dispute.
