Bre-X Minerals Ltd. Remains Silent Amid Concerns over Indonesian Partnership with Suharto's Son 

Bre-X Minerals Ltd., a small Canadian mining company, is facing scrutiny over its new partnership with the son of former Indonesian dictator Suharto to develop a massive gold deposit in Borneo. Critics argue the deal threatens to prop up the Suharto family’s wealth and influence in Indonesia, even as the country transitions to democracy.

Bre-X announced last month it had secured the rights to the Busang gold deposit in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, which some analysts estimate could contain up to 200 million ounces of gold, making it one of the largest deposits ever discovered. Bre-X signed a joint venture agreement with Indonesian businessman Sigit Harjojudanto, the youngest son of Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 31 years before being ousted in 1998. Under the terms of the deal, Harjojudanto’s company will retain a 32% stake in the Busang deposit.

The agreement has sparked protests in Indonesia and abroad, with critics arguing it will help rehabilitate the reputation and fill the coffers of the Suharto family. Suharto and his relatives were accused of stealing $15-35 billion from the Indonesian government during his rule, one of the worst cases of corruption in modern history. Suharto died in 2008, but his children and other family members retained much of the wealth and have slowly been returning to positions of influence in business and politics.

Bre-X has remained silent in the face of criticism over the deal. Multiple requests for comment from company executives went unanswered. The company’s only public statement was a short press release announcing the joint venture agreement last month. 

Some analysts argue that while the deal raises ethical concerns, it could still benefit Indonesia’s economy if properly regulated. The Busang deposit could provide thousands of jobs in a relatively undeveloped region and generate billions in tax revenue for the Indonesian government. Under anti-corruption reforms implemented after Suharto's fall, new transparency rules govern mining deals and aim to prevent the type of cronyism and graft that were common under his dictatorship.

Still, critics argue any deal that enriches the Suharto family risks undermining Indonesia’s democratic reforms and the rule of law. With national elections scheduled for next year, the timing of Bre-X’s deal and the questions surrounding it could become an issue in the campaign. The deal highlights the lingering power and influence of Indonesia’s old oligarchy, even as the country works to move on from its authoritarian past.
