Royal Oak Mines Inc to focus on low-cost gold deposits in Timmins and British Columbia 

Royal Oak Mines Inc announced today that it will shift its focus to developing low-cost gold deposits in established mining districts in Timmins, Ontario and British Columbia. The mid-tier Canadian miner will dispose of its higher-cost operations in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories to focus on assets with the potential for higher yields and faster paybacks. 

“We’ve conducted an extensive review of our portfolio and see significant value and growth opportunities by consolidating our efforts on gold properties in Timmins and British Columbia that can generate strong cash flows, even at lower gold prices,” said Royal Oak CEO Peter Smith. “By divesting of higher-cost mines, we can redeploy capital to fast-track development of our core projects which have substantial resource growth potential.”

In Timmins, Royal Oak plans to boost production at its McCreedy West mine to between 200,000 to 250,000 ounces of gold per year over the next 3 to 5 years. The company will deploy an additional $50 to $75 million to expand the underground mine and increase throughput at its on-site mill. With total cash costs of $750 to $800 per ounce, the McCreedy West operation has been the company’s most profitable mine. 

In British Columbia, Royal Oak aims to advance its Olsen and Treasure Mountain properties to production, with the potential to produce a combined 300,000 to 500,000 ounces of gold per year at all-in sustaining costs below $900 per ounce. The company plans to invest $125 to $150 million to build an open-pit mine and mill at Olsen, and ramp up exploration at the high-grade Treasure Mountain underground mine.

Royal Oak is currently in discussions with several parties interested in acquiring control of its Hope Brook mine in Newfoundland and Labrador, and its Meadowbank open-pit mine in Nunavut. Hope Brook has been plagued by operational issues and faces higher costs due to its remote location, while Meadowbank’s production has declined and costs have steadily risen after nearly a decade of operations. 

“While closing mines is never an easy decision, by selling these assets we can maintain a strong balance sheet as we invest in our core long-life, low-cost properties in Timmins and British Columbia,” Smith said. “This more focused strategy aims to establish Royal Oak as a sustainable mid-tier gold producer with superior growth potential during this time of volatile metal prices.”

The strategic shift will allow Royal Oak to optimize its portfolio, reduce debt and strengthen its position as a lower-cost gold producer with assets located in top-tier mining regions, according to analysts. Royal Oak’s shares rose 4.2% on the Toronto Stock Exchange following the announcement.
