Canadian Base Metal Miners' Earnings Hit by Poor Metal Prices in Q3 

Several major Canadian base metal mining companies reported lower earnings and revenue in the third quarter of this year due to declining prices for metals like copper, zinc and nickel. Base metal prices have declined over the past few months due to concerns over slowing global economic growth, the U.S.-China trade war, and oversupply in some metals markets.

Teck Resources, one of the world's largest producers of steelmaking coal and copper, reported a 7% drop in adjusted EBITDA to $1.2 billion in Q3 compared to the same quarter last year. Revenue fell 9% to $3.2 billion due to lower coal prices and sales volumes. Copper production increased 3% but copper prices averaged 8% lower, denting Teck's earnings from its copper business unit. 

Lundin Mining, a mid-sized base metals mining company, produced higher volumes of copper, zinc and nickel in Q3 but still reported a 15% decline in EBITDA to $259 million and a 12% drop in revenue to $757 million. Lundin pointed to an 11% decline in copper prices, 15% lower zinc prices and 36% lower nickel prices as the main factors in its weaker financial performance compared to a year ago.

Hudbay Minerals, another Canadian base metal miner, saw its Q3 profit drop 55% while revenue fell 14%, also due to lower metal prices for copper, zinc and gold compared to the year-ago quarter. The companyâ€™s production of copper and zinc was slightly higher in Q3 but could not offset the price declines. Hudbay delayed three capital projects in response to the weaker pricing environment.  

Base metal producers have faced deteriorating market conditions this year that are beyond their control. While Canadian companies have benefited from a weaker Canadian dollar that makes exports more competitive, most industry experts do not foresee a quick rebound in base metal prices until there are clear signals of improving economic growth and easing trade tensions between major economies. Given this uncertainty, base metal miners are focused on cutting costs and maximizing efficiency at their operations until markets strengthen again.
