Bre-X Minerals Ltd. forges alliance with company controlled by eldest son of Indonesia's President Suharto to resolve dispute over Busang gold discovery  

Bre-X Minerals Ltd. announced today that it has formed a strategic alliance with PT Indo Gold Mining ("Indo Gold"), a company majority-owned by Sigit Harjojudanto, the eldest son of Indonesian President Suharto. The alliance aims to resolve an ongoing dispute over mining rights to Bre-X's massive Busang gold deposit in Indonesia's East Kalimantan province.

Under the terms of the agreement, Indo Gold will acquire a 25% interest in Bre-X's Indonesian subsidiary, PT Bre-X Busang, which controls the Busang site, in exchange for $250 million in cash. Indo Gold will also provide environmental permits and facilitate obtaining approval from the Department of Mines and Energy for a production license for Busang.  

Bre-X discovered the Busang deposit in late 1995 and announced that studies indicated reserves of 71.7 million ounces of gold, which at the time made Busang one of the largest gold discoveries in history. However, Bre-X's initial drilling samples were later found to have been salted with gold shavings to mislead investors. Subsequent independent testing failed to confirm anything close to the initial estimates.

The fraud allegations and loss of confidence caused Bre-X's stock price to collapse and led to a long dispute with the Indonesian government over control and ownership of the site. Bre-X had initially claimed ownership of 80% of the Busang deposit, with the remaining 20% held by a local company. But the Indonesian government disagreed and exploration was halted in 1997.

Under President Suharto's authoritarian regime, Sigit Harjojudanto's company, Indo Gold, has been favored with mining permits in Indonesia. Bre-X CEO David Walsh, who was forced out as the fraud scandal unfolded, sees the new alliance as critical to advancing the Busang project and regaining credibility for Bre-X. "With the support and partnership of Indo Gold, we look forward to the opportunity develop the Busang deposit and deliver the value that was always inherently there," Walsh said.
