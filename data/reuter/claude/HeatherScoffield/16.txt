Bre-X Minerals Silent Amidst Ethics Questions Following Partnership with Son of Indonesian Ruler Suharto

Bre-X Minerals Ltd., a small Canadian mining company, is facing questions regarding potentially unethical business practices after entering into a partnership earlier this year with the son of longtime Indonesian dictator Suharto. Bre-X announced a joint venture with PT Ratu Jaya Sakti, an Indonesian mining company run by Suharto’s son Sigit Harjojudanto, to explore a site in Sumatra that Bre-X claims could contain one of the largest gold deposits in the world. 

Human rights groups are criticizing Bre-X for associating itself with the Suharto family, whose patriarch ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for over 30 years before being overthrown in 1998 amid corruption scandals and human rights abuses. Suharto and his family were accused of embezzling billions of dollars from the Indonesian government during his rule. By partnering with Suharto’s son, critics argue Bre-X is helping to rehabilitate and enrich a family with a history of unethical and illegal behavior.

Bre-X has declined repeated requests for comment on the joint venture and the criticism. The small Calgary-based company has a checkered history of its own, having been embroiled in a massive gold salting scandal in the 1990s that saw its stock price collapse after it was revealed that gold samples from its Indonesian gold mine had been tampered with. Bre-X’s silence on the current controversy risks further damaging its reputation and credibility, according to industry analysts.

“Bre-X cannot remain silent on this,” said Aisha Hutchinson, Director of the Natural Resources Ethics Institute. “They owe their shareholders and the public an explanation of their decision to partner with the Suharto family and how they plan to prevent any unethical behavior in this new venture. Their failure to address this openly and transparently raises many red flags.”

Bre-X first announced the joint venture with PT Ratu Jaya Sakti in February, claiming that initial explorations of the Sumatran site showed deposits that could total over 200 million ounces of gold, an amount that would make it one of the largest gold finds in history. The announcement caused Bre-X’s stock price to quadruple  as shareholders showed renewed optimism in the company following years of stagnation. The excitement soon turned to concern, however, as the Suharto family's involvement in the project and Bre-X's history in Indonesia came under scrutiny. 

To date, Bre-X has not provided any further updates on the progress or status of the gold project in Sumatra. The company's future remains uncertain as long as questions persist over its partnership with the Suharto family and its ability to operate in an ethical and transparent manner. For Bre-X, remaining silent amid the current controversy seems a risky tactic that could threaten its already fragile second chance.
