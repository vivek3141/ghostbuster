Voisey's Bay Nickel Production Faces Setback Due to Environmental and Aboriginal Pressures  

The massive nickel mining project at Voisey's Bay in northern Labrador is facing delays due to environmental reviews and land claims disputes with local aboriginal groups. The $2.5 billion project was intended to start production of nickel, copper, and cobalt in early 2022 but is now expected to face at least a year of delays, according to industry reports.  

Vale, the Brazilian mining giant that owns the Voisey's Bay project, is going through a comprehensive environmental assessment that will determine the impact of a proposed underground expansion of the mine. The expansion aims to extend the mine life by another 15-20 years while minimizing the environmental footprint. However, local indigenous groups have raised concerns about the impact on caribou habitat, wetlands, and other wildlife in the area. They argue more comprehensive reviews are needed before approvals are granted. 

At the same time, Vale is negotiating land rights with two aboriginal groups—the Innu Nation and the Nunatsiavut Government—which represent Inuit and Innu people in Labrador. Although existing mine operations are on land owned by the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, the underground expansion would go beneath lands subject to native title claims. Resolving these complex claims has delayed the approval process.

Vale remains optimistic the environmental review and aboriginal negotiations can be completed to allow underground mining to begin early in 2023. However, others worry further delays could threaten the economic viability of the expansion. The Voisey's Bay mine is a major employer in the region, providing over 1,500 direct and indirect jobs. Nickel prices have recovered in recent months, adding incentive for Vale to resolve the outstanding issues and ramp up production from this world-class mineral deposit.
