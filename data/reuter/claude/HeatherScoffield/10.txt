Barrick Gold Corp. Completes $1 Billion Takeover of Arequipa Resources Ltd, Securing Position as Third Biggest Gold Producer in the World  

Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corporation announced today that it has completed its acquisition of Arequipa Resources Ltd. for $1 billion in an all-cash deal. The takeover gives Barrick control of Arequipa's mining operations in Peru, including the Pierina and Lagunas Norte mines.  With this acquisition, Barrick boosts its gold production by 600,000 ounces per year and solidifies its standing as the third largest gold producer in the world.

"The addition of Arequipa's significant gold assets will be transformative for our business and stakeholders," said Mark Bristow, CEO of Barrick Gold. "Peru is an excellent mining jurisdiction and these high-quality mines will add immediate value to our portfolio."

Formed in 1983, Barrick Gold is a Canadian mining company that produces gold and copper. It operates mines in 13 countries, including some of the largest gold mines in the world. Prior to the Arequipa acquisition, Barrick produced more than 5.5 million ounces of gold per year, with most of its operations located in Canada, the United States, Dominican Republic and Tanzania. 

Arequipa Resources is a mid-sized gold producer that has been operating in Peru since the 1990s. Its two producing mines, Pierina and Lagunas Norte, are located in the Ancash region and together yielded 623,000 ounces of gold last year. The all-share deal provides an exit for Arequipa's shareholders at a 31% premium to the company's stock price before the announcement.

The takeover continues a recent wave of mergers and acquisitions in the gold mining industry as companies aim to shore up reserves and boost production. As gold prices have surged more than 35% over the last two years, controlling more gold resources has become a key priority for major producers.

For Barrick, absorbing Arequipa strengthens its footing in Peru and reduces its dependence on assets in Tanzania and the Dominican Republic, where the company has faced environmental and labor challenges in recent years. The diversification of Barrick's portfolio is seen as a positive by industry analysts. 

"This acquisition provides more opportunities for Barrick to increase shareholder value," said Kathy Warner, a mining analyst at CIBC World Markets. "The combination of Barrick's operational expertise and financial resources with Arequipa's high-quality assets has the potential for strong synergies and growth."

With its new position as the third largest gold producer in the world following the completion of the Arequipa takeover, Barrick seems poised to continue its momentum in 2021. According to Barrick's guidance, the company's gold production is expected to exceed 6 million ounces for the year.
