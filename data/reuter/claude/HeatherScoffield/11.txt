Barrick Gold Corp Favored to Partner with Bre-X Minerals in Indonesian Gold Mining Deal 

Bre-X Minerals, a Canadian mining company, is close to finalizing a partnership agreement with Barrick Gold Corporation to develop a potentially large gold deposit in the Indonesian rainforest, according to sources close to the negotiations. The deal, if completed, would mark Barrick Gold’s first foray into Indonesia and provide a lifeline to Bre-X, which has struggled with funding following the highly publicized collapse of a massive gold find in the 1990s.

Representatives from Bre-X and Barrick Gold have reportedly been in talks for several months regarding the Bima Sakti gold prospect in eastern Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo. Sources say the companies may announce an initial drilling program within the next few weeks to determine the size and quality of the gold reserves. The Indonesian government under President Widodo has sought to boost foreign investment in mineral extraction to drive economic growth. 

Bre-X first acquired the rights to Bima Sakti in 1993 but was unable to develop the site due to a lack of funding and the fallout from the Busang scandal, which devastated the company. In the mid-1990s, Bre-X claimed that its Busang deposit contained more than 70 million ounces of gold, but independent studies found little to no gold at the site. The resulting collapse of Bre-X shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange wiped out over C$3 billion in market value.

Barrick Gold, the world’s second largest gold producer, has been looking to acquire new deposits as its existing mines mature. An Indonesian project could help Barrick diversify from its focus on North and South America. “Barrick sees a lot of potential in Indonesia and Bre-X has promising geological data on Bima Sakti,” said one source close to Barrick, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Barrick has the means and technical expertise to properly evaluate this site, so it’s a win-win if the numbers prove out.”
