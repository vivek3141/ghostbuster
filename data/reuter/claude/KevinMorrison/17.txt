News Corp's Q1 Net Profit Falls 8.1%, Missing Analyst Forecasts

News Corp reported an 8.1% drop in net profit for the first quarter of its fiscal year, missing analyst forecasts, as revenue from its book publishing and real estate classified advertising segments declined.

The media company, operated by Rupert Murdoch, posted net income of $128 million for the quarter ended September 30, compared with $139 million a year earlier. On a per-share basis, profit fell to 22 cents from 24 cents. Revenue declined 6.3% to $2.52 billion.

Analysts had expected the company to report first-quarter net income of $158.2 million, or 27 cents a share, on revenue of $2.66 billion, according to data compiled by FactSet.

News Corp's book publishing division continued to struggle, with revenue down 15% driven by lower sales of "The Da Vinci Code" and other backlist titles. Revenue in the real estate classifieds division dropped 11%, reflecting a weak property market in Australia.  Cable network programming and digital real estate services revenue also declined slightly.

The earnings report comes as uncertainty persists over the continuity of News Corp Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch's media empire. In recent years, Murdoch has overseen the sale of some of the company's most prized assets, including The Wall Street Journal and book publisher HarperCollins, as well as the consolidation of its Australian and U.K. newspaper holdings. There has been speculation that the Murdoch family trust, which owns about 39% of voting stock, could sell down its stake.

News Corp Chief Executive Robert Thomson said in a statement: "While we knew certain headwinds were in store for fiscal 2019 ... we are confident that fiscal 2020 will benefit from new initiatives in digital real estate, the increasing power of video and the momentum in Cable Network Programming."

News Corp's pay-television division, known as Foxtel, showed improvement, with revenue up 11% as subscriber growth continued. Revenue from Dow Jones, which publishes The Wall Street Journal, inched up 2%, despite weaker advertising revenue.

Robert Thomson noted, “News Corp delivered revenue and profitability within guidance, while significantly increasing digital subscriptions across our media properties.” News Corp expects revenue for its current quarter to be between $2.37 billion and $2.47 billion.
