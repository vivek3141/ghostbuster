Comalco Ltd reports 72% drop in net profit for first half of 1996 due to weaker metal prices and stronger Australian dollar 

Aluminum producer Comalco Ltd reported a 72% slump in net profit to $38.9 million for the first half of 1996 due to weaker metal prices and a stronger Australian dollar. The result was slightly below the $40 million market analysts had forecast. 

The company's profit was hit hard by a slide in aluminum prices on the London Metals Exchange from their first-half 1995 level. The average realized price for Comalco's product fell 13% over the period. At the same time, the Australian dollar climbed almost 6% against the U.S. dollar, reducing the company's export earnings.

Comalco managing director Paul Murphy said the company's performance reflected the weaker aluminum market conditions globally and the slowdown in demand growth from key markets like the Asian automotive sector. “We do expect aluminum demand and pricing to remain under pressure over the next 6-12 months,” Mr. Murphy said.

The results are a sharp reversal from Comalco’s record $141 million net profit in 1995 and highlight the volatile nature of metal commodities. Comalco derives nearly 70% of its earnings from aluminum, which is a globally traded commodity prone to price swings based on usage in industries like construction, electronics, and transportation.

Comalco’s bottom line was also impacted by $20 million in closure and redundancy costs from shutting some loss-making operations. The company announced in April it would close its Bell Bay smelter in Tasmania and its rolling mill in Sweden. The restructuring is expected to save $30 million annually but cost a total of $260 million.

Revenue for the period actually rose 4% to $1.9 billion on higher bauxite and alumina sales. Comalco is the world’s largest bauxite miner and controls the largest alumina refining operation. The company reaffirmed its forecast for flat net profit in 1996 if current market conditions persist. Comalco’s shares fell 2% on the news to $4.50, bringing its decline so far this year to 11.7%.
