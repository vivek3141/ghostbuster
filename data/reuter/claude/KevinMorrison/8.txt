International Partners to Invest US$4.7 Billion to Double Production in Australia's Largest Gas Project  

The North West Shelf Project venture announced today that it will invest US$4.7 billion to double production of natural gas in Australia's largest resource project. The partners in the project, including Woodside Petroleum, BP, Chevron, Shell,  and BHP Billiton Petroleum, approved funding for the Greater Western Flank Phase 2 development that will produce more natural gas and condensate from offshore gas fields.

The North West Shelf Project is Australia's first and largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) development. Since first production in 1984, the project has produced more than 5,000 shipments of LNG and delivered more than 7 billion cubic meters of gas to customers in Asia. The new Greater Western Flank Phase 2 development will include five subsea production wells, a subsea production system, and a 33-kilometer pipeline that connects to the existing Goodwyn A platform. 

Woodside CEO Peter Coleman said the expansion is an important milestone for the North West Shelf Project and Western Australia's LNG industry. "Natural gas from Greater Western Flank Phase 2 will supply new LNG offtake contracts and the domestic market, which highlights the ventures' ability to competitively develop gas resources and meet customer needs," he said.

The US$4.7 billion investment is a boost for Australia's oil and gas industry which has faced headwinds in recent years from low oil and gas prices. The development is expected to create around 1,500 new construction jobs in Western Australia. Production from the first gas project is expected in the first half of 2021 with full production anticipated by mid-2021. 

Federal Minister for Resources and Energy Matt Canavan welcomed the investment, saying, “This important new project will see continued investment in Australia, more Australian jobs in our resources sector, and help ensure Australia's ongoing competitive supply of gas.”
The North West Shelf Project is a joint venture between six major international partners. Woodside is operator of the project, with a 48 percent participating interest in the original venture and a 34 percent share of the Greater Western Flank gas fields.
