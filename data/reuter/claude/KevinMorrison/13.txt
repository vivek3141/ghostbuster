CSR Ltd Expected to Report Net Profit for H1 1996/97 Between A$146 Million to A$160 Million

Sydney, Australiaâ€”CSR Limited (ASX: CSR) is expected to announce its half-year results for the six months ending September 30, 1996 tomorrow, with analyst forecasts pointing to a net profit between A$146 million to A$160 million. This would represent an increase of 20 to 35 percent from the A$122.3 million net profit reported for the corresponding period last year.

The stronger results are driven by improved performances across CSR's key business segments, including its sugar refining, building materials, and aluminum smelting divisions. The sugar division is set to benefit from higher global sugar prices and increased sugar exports to Asia, while CSR's building products unit continues to perform well due to strong demand for home renovations and construction materials in Australia's residential housing market.

Meanwhile, CSR's aluminum operations are poised to gain from growing demand for aluminum and lower raw material costs. "The first half of CSR's financial year has seen positive conditions across most of its operations, which is expected to translate into stronger earnings for the period," said Ben Wilson, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. "Sugar pricing has been a bright spot, and CSR's building products and aluminum units have also held up well. Barring any surprises, we see a solid result in line with CSR's guidance."

CSR reaffirmed in July that it expects fiscal 1997 net profit to exceed the prior year's A$347.7 million, barring any unforeseen circumstances. The company has benefited from a multi-year restructuring program that has reduced costs, improved efficiency and optimized its portfolio of businesses. Some analysts estimate full-year net profit could reach up to A$400 million if strong performances persist across CSR's divisions.

"We believe CSR's earnings growth prospects remain positive, underpinned by exposure to resilient end markets in Australia and improved competitiveness from its restructuring initiatives," said James Khoo, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. "With its successful recalibration of the business now largely complete, CSR appears poised to continue delivering reliable earnings and cash flow growth over the next 3 to 5 years."

Shares of CSR have risen over 15 percent in the past six months, outperforming the overall Australian stock market. Investors will be closely monitoring CSR's results announcement on Thursday for any changes to its dividend payout or full-year guidance.
