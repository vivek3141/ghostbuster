Rupert Murdoch Plans to Use Sports Broadcasting as "Battering Ram" for Dominance in Pay Television Markets Worldwide  

Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch has set his sights on expanding his empire worldwide through a strategy focused on acquiring sports broadcasting rights. Multiple sources inside Murdoch's companies 21st Century Fox and Sky Sports reveal Murdoch sees live sports as the key to dominating subscription television markets in Europe, Asia, and beyond. 

According to sources, Murdoch aims to emulate the success of Sky Sports in the UK, which has become a powerhouse based largely on its Premier League football coverage. By controlling the rights to broadcast popular sports leagues and events, Sky Sports has achieved a dominant market position with over 80% of all sports viewers in the UK subscribing to its channels.

Murdoch believes the same model can work on a larger scale, with 21st Century Fox and Sky Sports partnering to bid aggressively for major sports rights around the world. "Sports broadcasting is the battering ram Murdoch wants to use to break into new markets," said one senior Fox executive. "He sees it as a way to gain a foothold and leverage that to get carriage of Fox's entertainment channels on pay TV systems everywhere."

The strategy is already well underway in Italy, where Sky Italia recently secured a multiyear deal to broadcast Serie A football, as well as Formula 1 racing. Sky Deutschland in Germany and Sky New Zealand have also locked up local football and rugby rights. According to sources, 21st Century Fox and Sky Sports now plan to target major sports franchises in Spain, India, ASEAN countries, and Latin America.

"Murdoch loves the idea of Sky being a global brand, and sports is the way to achieve that," said a former Sky Sports executive. "With so much uncertainty around the traditional entertainment business, live sports rights are the golden tickets to building pay TV empires abroad."

However, Murdoch's global sports ambitions face major challenges. Sky Sports' success in the UK will be difficult to replicate in many other markets, especially those where pay TV is not well developed. Local broadcasters and streaming services are also increasingly competitive in bidding for sports rights. Still, Murdoch sees sports as a long game that, over time, can establish Sky and 21st Century Fox as dominant players in pay TV on a scale far beyond what they have achieved so far. If anyone has the patience and deep pockets to pull off that vision, it is Rupert Murdoch.
