Optus Communications Reports First Annual Profit and Prepares for Sharemarket Float 

Optus Communications today reported its first annual profit since launching mobile phone and internet services in Australia. The company made a net profit of $145 million in the year ending June 30, compared to a loss of $321 million the previous year. 

The turnaround in Optus Communications’ fortunes comes after several years of heavy investment in building its networks and branding. The company now has over 5 million mobile subscribers and more than 1.5 million internet subscribers, making it a strong challenger to market leader Telstra.

“We have reached a significant milestone with our first full year of profitability,” said Optus CEO Allen Lew. “Our continued focus on delivering great value, innovative products and outstanding customer service is winning more and more customers each month.”

Optus Communications is now setting its sights on further expansion. The company today announced plans to raise $2 billion through an initial public offering on the Australian Securities Exchange. The sharemarket float, likely to be one of the largest this year, will help fundOptus Communications’ push into pay television and its rollout of a next-generation 5G mobile network.

“This is an exciting new chapter for our company, and will provide additional financial flexibility to invest in new growth opportunities, particularly in the media and entertainment sectors,” said Mr Lew. The planned IPO is subject to approval from Optus Communications’ current owner, Singapore Telecommunications, which took control of Optus in 2001.

The successful turnaround of Optus Communications reflects the broader revival in Australia’s telecommunications sector, which struggled for years with overcapacity and price wars. With the rollout of faster mobile and broadband networks, and the introduction of more data-hungry smartphones and streaming media services, consumer and business demand for telecom products is at an all-time high.

Optus Communications and Telstra still dominate Australia’s telecom landscape, but face increasing competition from foreign rivals like Vodafone Hutchinson Australia and TPG Telecom. A mooted entry by Canada’s Shaw Communications could spur further price competition and industry consolidation.

Analysts say the outlook for Optus Communications and its peers remains positive, fuelled by new opportunities in e-commerce, digital media, and the “Internet of Things”. For investors, the float of Optus Communications offers a chance to tap into the sector’s growth at an attractive price.
