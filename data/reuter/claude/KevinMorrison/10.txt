Rupert Murdoch grooms next generation to take over his media empire 

Rupert Murdoch, the 88-year old media tycoon who oversees News Corp and 21st Century Fox, is preparing the next generation of Murdochs to eventually take over his vast media holdings according to sources familiar with the family's planning. 

Murdoch has spent decades building up an international media empire that includes properties such as The Wall Street Journal, Fox News, The Times of London and Sky News. However, in recent years he has gradually handed over more control and authority to his two sons Lachlan Murdoch and James Murdoch. Lachlan, 47, is currently co-chairman of News Corp and executive chairman of NOVA Entertainment. James, 46, is chief executive of 21st Century Fox.

The succession plan aims to have Lachlan take over as chairman of News Corp and James as chairman of 21st Century Fox. The two brothers have long competed to succeed their father, though Lachlan was viewed as the heir apparent for many years before quitting News Corp in 2005. James then appeared poised to take over before becoming embroiled in a phone hacking scandal at Murdoch’s British tabloids, causing damage to his reputation. Lachlan returned to the company in 2014 to work with his father and brother.

According to sources, Rupert Murdoch still comes into his office daily but is increasingly delegating key decisions and responsibilities to Lachlan and James to prepare them for leadership roles. “Rupert has set the broad roadmap but the heavy lifting is now being done by the boys,” said one News Corp executive. The sources asked not to be identified discussing private family dynamics.

The succession plan aims for Rupert Murdoch to hand over control of his companies when he turns 90 in 2021. However, he would remain as a senior executive, ensuring he can still influence strategy and mentor his sons. The plan could face complications due to legal or regulatory issues, as well as potential power struggles between Lachlan and James, according to media analysts.

Rupert Murdoch's vast media holdings make his companies influential politically and culturally. His succession plan is thus being closely watched, as his sons may have somewhat different priorities and values that could shape coverage and content in the years to come. For now, according to insiders, Lachlan and James Murdoch are united in following their father’s blueprint for the future of his media properties that he spent so long establishing. The coming years will reveal how well that blueprint withstands the transition to a new generation of Murdochs in control.
