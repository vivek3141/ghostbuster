News Corp's Q1 net profit falls 8.1%, missing market expectations, but 20% profit lift still possible

News Corp reported lower first-quarter net profit today due to weaker advertising revenues amid an ongoing news industry downturn. However, the media giant reaffirmed full-year guidance and said higher revenue and profit gains are still achievable if the company delivers on its goals.  

News Corp posted a net profit of $243 million for the three months ended September 30, down 8.1% from $265 million in the prior year. Revenue declined 2% to $2.34 billion. The results missed analysts' forecasts for profits of $254 million and revenue of $2.38 billion.

The company cited lower advertising revenues across several of its newspapers as well as foreign currency headwinds as factors in the weaker quarterly performance. Advertising revenue dropped 11% in News Corp's news and information services division, which includes The Wall Street Journal and The Australian. Circulation and subscription revenue was flat.

"We faced some specific challenges this quarter, but we're confident we can improve things going forward," said News Corp Chief Executive Robert Thomson. "Our plan for the full year, if fully executed, can still translate to 20% profit growth."

News Corp is aiming to boost profits through further digital subscription growth, cost cuts, and strategic acquisitions. The company now has about 4.2 million subscribers to its news properties, with more than 2.2 million digital-only subscribers. Its HarperCollins book publishing division and cable network Fox Sports Australia also improved earnings in the first quarter.

Investors remain wary, however, about an uncertain outlook for the media industry and News Corp's heavy dependence on traditional print publications. The shares fell 4.3% to $13.15 in after-hours trading following the results announcement. 

Analysts said News Corp's first-quarter profit regression adds to doubts about its relatively optimistic full-year guidance. The company is targeting profit growth of between 15% and 20% in fiscal 2021, despite the ongoing print-advertising slump and regularly predicting more optimistic results than it actually achieves. 

"Achieving their full-year targets is going to be challenging when the first quarter has come in below expectations,” said media analyst Alice McKernan at Allied Investments. “I'm not altogether convinced by News Corp's habit of overpromising and underdelivering."

Analysts will be closely monitoring News Corp's second-quarter results and updated guidance to determine if management's forecasts for profit resurgence are realistic. News Corp is hoping innovation and more aggressive moves into video, podcasts, and other digital initiatives will revive revenue and earnings growth over the next nine months. But with print advertising in a multiyear decline, the path forward remains unclear for one of the world's largest news media empires.
