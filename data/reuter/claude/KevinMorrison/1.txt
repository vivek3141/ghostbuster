Foreign Companies Snap Up Undervalued Australian Oil and Gas Stocks, But Analysts Optimistic About Sector's Future 

Major oil and gas companies from the U.S., Canada, and Asia have been acquiring undervalued Australian oil and gas producers and developers in recent months, taking advantage of low stock prices in the sector. However, industry analysts say the Australian oil and gas market has a bright future ahead due to rising oil prices and the deregulation of Australia's east coast gas market.

U.S.-based ConocoPhillips acquired Conoco Australia for $1.5 billion in March. Canada's Seven Generations Energy purchased half of Australian gas explorer Montney for $400 million in January. PetroChina and Sinopec, two of China's largest state-owned oil and gas companies, have also been actively buying minority stakes in Australian oil and gas companies this year. These acquisitions have given a needed confidence boost to Australia's oil and gas sector, which has struggled in recent years due to low oil prices reducing profit margins and a restrictive gas market policy limiting exports.

Analysts, however, point to several positive factors indicating a stronger outlook for Australian oil and gas companies. Global oil prices have risen more than 50% over the past year as OPEC and non-OPEC countries have curbed production. Higher oil prices will enable more investments in new oil exploration and production, especially in Australia's offshore fields. Australia's government also recently introduced reforms to deregulate the east coast gas market, allowing companies to export more gas overseas. The policy change provides companies incentives to increase gas production and exploration to serve the export market.

The continued deregulation of Australia's gas market and higher global oil prices make its oil and gas sector more attractive to foreign investors and domestic companies alike. While acquisition activity is a sign of the sectorâ€™s current challenges, experts forecast Australian oil and gas stocks could see strong growth over the coming years as market conditions improve and as major new offshore gas fields come online. Overall, Australia's oil and gas industry seems poised to benefit from a brighter future, leaving its struggles in the past.
