Foreign Companies Eyeing Undervalued Australian Oil and Gas Stocks, But Sector Has a Bright Future with Higher Oil Prices and Deregulated Gas Market, Say Analysts  

Major oil and gas companies from around the world have Australian energy companies in their sights as potential takeover targets, according to market analysts. They say Australia's oil and gas sector is undervalued due to a recent downturn, but the long term outlook is bright given rising oil prices and a deregulated gas market.

Oil prices have risen by over 50% in the last year to over $70 per barrel, boosting profit margins for oil producers. At the same time, Australia continues to transition from long-term gas export contracts with high regulated prices to market-based pricing. This is opening up more opportunities for competitive gas retailers to enter the market and offer lower prices to consumers. 

"The fundamentals of Australiaâ€™s oil and gas sector remain strong with plenty of resources still to be developed," said Michael Smith, energy analyst at Refurrence Ltd. "While share prices have lagged, the medium to long term prospects for export volumes and domestic gas use are compelling. This makes Australian oil and gas companies attractive targets, especially with their currencies relatively undervalued."

The sector has been struggling in recent years with cost overruns, project delays, and lower oil and gas prices. This has reduced the value of many ASX-listed energy companies, despite their vast resources. According to Refurrence, the value of Australia's oil and gas reserves is over $2 trillion, yet the combined market capitalization of the sector is under $200 billion.

Some of the most likely takeover targets include Santos, Beach Energy, and Senex Energy, according to analysts. These mid-cap companies have substantial reserves and resources but have seen their share prices lag global peers. Santos in particular operates major liquefied natural gas projects such as Gladstone LNG but has faced high debt levels and an activist investor campaigning for asset sales and board changes.
