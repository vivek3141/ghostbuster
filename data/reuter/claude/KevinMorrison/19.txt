RGC Ltd Doubles Annual Operating Profit on the Back of Strong Demand for Aircraft and Golf Clubs   

RGC Ltd, a manufacturer of precision-engineered components, today reported a 112% increase in operating profit to $42 million for the financial year ended June 30, 2021. The strong result was driven by surging demand for the company's products from the aerospace and golf equipment sectors. 

Revenue rose 63% to $187 million, reflecting higher sales volumes and some recovery in market prices. The company is a leading supplier of aircraft components, including critical engine parts and landing gears, to major commercial and military aircraft manufacturers. It is also a top producer of high-performance golf club heads and shafts for several major sporting brands.

In a statement, RGC CEO Jane Smith attributed the company's success to its strategy of diversifying across sectors while maintaining a focus on highly specialized, mission-critical components. "Over the past decade, we have built leading positions in aerospace and golf by focusing on products that require precision engineering and customization," she said. "This strategy has allowed us to forge long-term partnerships with key customers based on quality, reliability and technical expertise."

The strong demand for new commercial and military aircraft drove a 87% increase in RGC's aerospace division revenue. The company produces several components for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A320 aircraft families, as well as the Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jet program. The surge in aircraft orders as air travel recovers from the pandemic has flowed through to increased demand and higher prices for RGC's components. The company expects the positive trend in the aerospace market to continue for the medium term based on large order backlogs.

RGC's golf division revenue grew 38% as major brands refreshed equipment ranges and capitalized on a rebound in participation after many courses re-opened. The company produces titanium, stainless steel and composite materials used in drivers, irons and putters for brands such as TaylorMade, Callaway and Ping. While there may be some short-term moderation as demand normalizes, sporting equipment companies continue to release innovative new products to keen golfers, indicating ongoing opportunities for suppliers like RGC.

Ms. Smith said the company will continue to invest to expand production capacity and enhance research capabilities to meet future demand growth. "We have proven expertise in high-performance materials and we see potential to apply these capabilities to other sectors such as medical equipment," she said. The company expects higher sales and earnings to continue in the 2022 financial year subject to current market conditions.

RGC shares closed up 14.2% at $8.32, hitting a record high. The company has delivered a 348% total shareholder return over the past three years.
