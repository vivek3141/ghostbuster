Partners in Australia's Largest Gas Project Plan to Double Production in A$6 Billion Investment  

The partners in Australia’s largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) project announced plans today to invest A$6 billion ($4.6 billion) to double production capacity over the next four years. The Ichthys LNG project is a joint venture between Inpex Corporation, Tokyo Gas Co Ltd, and other partners located in the Browse Basin off the northwestern coast of Western Australia.

Inpex, the major partner and operator of the Ichthys LNG project, said the investment would fund the construction of two new liquefaction trains, as well as additional drilling in the offshore gas field that feeds the facility. The expansion is expected to increase the project’s production capacity to approximately 36 million metric tonnes per year (MTPA), more than double the current capacity of 16.8 MTPA.

“This expansion underscores the enormous gas resource we have developed in the Browse Basin and the potential for its ongoing development over the coming decades,” said Inpex President Director Takayuki Shiraki. The Ichthys field contains an estimated 12.8 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves and 500 million barrels of condensate, the light liquid hydrocarbons often produced with natural gas.

The additional capacity is slated to come online in mid-2026, according to the project partners. Most of the LNG produced by the Ichthys project is contracted to customers in Japan and Taiwan, though the partners indicated that some volumes from the expansion may be sold on global spot markets as demand increases worldwide.

The expansion announcement comes amid growing interest in LNG as a transition fuel to help reduce emissions from power generation and transportation. Natural gas produces roughly half the carbon emissions of coal when used for electricity and fuels an increasing number of ships and road vehicles. According to analysts, global demand for LNG could rise by as much as 60% over the next two decades under a scenario consistent with the goals of the Paris climate agreement.

Continued investment in Australia's LNG sector, however, faces risks from trade disputes and growing competition from other suppliers like the United States, which has rapidly increased shale gas production and export capacity. Inpex and its partners said the Ichthys expansion was approved after "careful consideration of various risks." The additional investment is expected to generate up to 6,000 new construction jobs and 200 long-term operational positions in Australia's Northern Territory.
