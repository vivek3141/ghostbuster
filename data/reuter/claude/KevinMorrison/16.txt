News Corp's Net Profit Expected to Meet Chairman Rupert Murdoch's 20 Percent Rise Prediction, Despite First Quarter Results Disappointing Analysts 

News Corporation's quarterly results released today showed a 16 percent increase in net profit over the same period last year. However, analysts had forecast slightly higher growth of 18 percent, leaving investors disappointed. News Corp's share price dipped 3 percent in early trading following the announcement.

The media conglomerate reported net income of $1.23 billion for the quarter ending September 30, up from $1.06 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share rose 15 percent to $0.21. Revenue increased 11 percent to $9.98 billion, driven by strong growth in the company's cable network programming and filmed entertainment divisions.

However, analysts had expected revenue of $10.05 billion and earnings per share of $0.22 based on Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch's prediction of 20 percent growth in News Corp's net profit this fiscal year. Mr. Murdoch said he remained confident the full-year results would meet targets, attributing the lower-than-expected first quarter figures to the timing of new digital product launches and the costs of acquisitions made earlier this year.

"We are poised for another strong year of revenue and profit growth, despite this quarter's results," said Mr. Murdoch in a statement. "The expansion of our video offerings will accelerate in the coming months with new streaming services and the launch of additional channels, which will drive subscription and advertising revenue growth across our properties."  

News Corp's cable network programming division was a bright spot, with operating income up 17 percent to $1.43 billion on higher affiliate and advertising fees for the Fox News Channel and FX Networks. Revenue from the filmed entertainment division grew 12 percent to $2.97 billion due to the theatrical success of blockbusters like Bohemian Rhapsody and The Favourite.   

However, News Corp's print newspaper business continued its long-term decline. Revenue dropped 9 percent to $1.18 billion in the first quarter, largely due to falling print advertising and circulation sales in News Corp's Australian and U.K. mastheads. Mr. Murdoch has repeatedly pledged to stop subsidizing loss-making newspapers, but has so far delayed shuttering The Sun and The Times in Britain.
