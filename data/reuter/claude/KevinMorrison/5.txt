St George Bank and Advance Bank Australia Agree on A$2.65 Billion Merger to Create Fifth Largest Bank in Australia  

Australia's banking sector witnessed a major consolidation today with the announcement that St George Bank and Advance Bank Australia have agreed to merge in a deal worth A$2.65 billion. The merger will create the fifth largest bank in Australia with assets of over A$200 billion and a market capitalization of approximately A$18 billion.  

The boards of both banks have approved an all-stock merger in which St George Bank will acquire all the shares of Advance Bank Australia. Shareholders of Advance Bank Australia will receive 1.33 St George Bank shares for each share they own, which values Advance Bank Australia at A$6.05 per share. This represents a 22% premium over Advance Bank Australia's closing share price yesterday.  

The merger is expected to generate significant cost savings and synergies for the combined bank. St George Bank estimated that the merger will result in cost savings of over A$250 million per year, primarily from integrating technology systems, centralizing operations, and reducing overlapping branch networks. The merged bank will have over 950 branches across Australia and more than 9,000 employees.  

Advance Bank Australia Chairman Peter Scotland said, “This merger delivers outstanding value for our shareholders and will provide greater opportunities for our customers and employees as part of a larger, more diversified banking group. The strategic fit and compatibility of the two banks will ensure a smooth integration.”

St George Bank Chairman Ted Mackay commented, “This merger with Advance Bank Australia accelerates our growth strategy and further strengthens our position in the Australian banking market. Together we will be a more formidable competitor, offering customers a full range of retail banking and wealth management products and services.” 

Subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to be completed in early 2021. The integration process will begin immediately after the merger's completion with a goal of fully combining operations within 18-24 months. The merged bank will continue to trade under the St George Bank brand and be headquartered in Sydney.
