Canadian Media Baron Conrad Black Wants to Increase Stake in Fairfax Holdings to 50%

Media mogul Conrad Black is seeking to increase his stake in Fairfax Financial Holdings to 50%, according to a filing with securities regulators. Black's investment firm, BT (Canada) Holdings Inc., currently owns about 26% of Fairfax's common stock. A spokesman for Black said the move is intended to " stabilize and broaden the ownership base" of Fairfax as well as "deepen Black's long-term strategic commitment" to the insurance company. 

Black founded Fairfax in 1985 but gave up control of the firm as part of a settlement with the Ontario Securities Commission in 2003. The OSC had alleged that Black and associates had illegally diverted funds from public companies they controlled, including Ravelston Corp. As part of the agreement, Black paid CAD$1 million in penalties and gave up his position as Chairman and CEO of Fairfax. However, he remained on the board as a director.

Under the leadership of current CEO and Chairman Prem Watsa, Fairfax has grown into a diversified insurance and reinsurance company with over $70 billion in assets. However, Fairfax’s share price has stagnated in recent years due to perceived overexposure to long-term risks and a pullback by some investors. Black and his associates believe now is an opportune time to increase their stake to provide stability and signal confidence in the company’s long-term strategy.

According to the filing, Black’s firm intends to buy Fairfax shares on the open market to build its position to 29.9% over the next 6-12 months. Canadian regulations would require a formal takeover bid for a controlling interest of 30% or more. Once the 29.9% threshold is reached, Black plans to propose a "strategic partnership" with Fairfax that could include board representation and a path to control of 50% or more over time, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.

Reaction to the news was mixed. Some analysts see value in Black’s track record of long-term investing and turnaround expertise. However, others argue that Black’s checkered regulatory history and ambition to regain control of Fairfax could introduce too much uncertainty. There are also concerns Black’s bid to increase his influence may be intended to shield himself from ongoing litigation related to the collapse of Hollinger International, the former newspaper publishing arm of Hollinger Inc. of which Black was CEO.
