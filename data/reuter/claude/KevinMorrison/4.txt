St George Bank and Advance Bank Australia merge to become Australia's fifth largest bank

Two of Australia's oldest banking institutions, St George Bank and Advance Bank, today announced a merger to create the country's fifth largest bank by assets and market capitalization. The all-stock deal, valued at A$12.3 billion, will see St George acquire Advance Bank and operate the combined entity. 

St George Bank, founded in 1937, and Advance Bank, which traces its origins back to 1835, were both mutual organizations for most of their history before demutualizing and listing on the Australian Securities Exchange in the 1990s. They have a combined customer base of 8.2 million Australians and operate a network of 1,237 branches across the country. 

"This merger makes strong strategic sense and will benefit both companies' shareholders, customers, and employees," said St George Bank CEO Grant Fenn. "There are significant efficiencies to be gained by combining our operations, and we will invest heavily in new products and digital banking services for our expanded customer base."

The merger is subject to approval from shareholders of both companies, as well as relevant regulatory and legal consents. If approved, Advance Bank CEO John Smith will join the board of the combined group as deputy CEO reporting to Fenn. "While we have a long and proud history as an independent Australian bank, the banking industry landscape has changed dramatically in recent years," Smith said. "By merging with St George, we gain scale and resources to compete more effectively in today's market."

The Australian banking sector has been undergoing consolidation in the face of increasing competition from nontraditional players, higher regulatory burdens, and a slowing economy. The "big four" – Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ, and NAB – still dominate the industry, but mid-tier banks have looked to mergers to achieve greater scale and efficiencies. Last year, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank merged in a $15 billion deal, overtaking St George and Advance Bank in the rankings.

Investors reacted positively to news of the merger, pushing St George's shares up 8% and Advance Bank's shares up 10% in trading following the announcement. Analysts forecast significant cost savings through eliminating overlapping branch networks and technologies, as well as potential revenue growth opportunities. However, regulators and consumer advocates warned that further consolidation in the banking sector could lead to higher fees, fewer product choices, and poorer customer service. The Australian Consumer and Competition Commission said it will scrutinize the proposed merger closely for any threat to competition.

If approved, the merger is expected to complete within 12 months. The new combined group would have approximately A$235 billion in assets, 10,000 employees, and a market capitalization of approximately $27 billion, placing it just behind Macquarie Bank in the Australian banking league tables. The head office will remain in Sydney, where both founding companies were established almost 200 years ago as two of Australia's first home-grown banks.
