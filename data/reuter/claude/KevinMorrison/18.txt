Boral Ltd reports poor start to 1996/97 year due to weak Australian housing market

Boral Ltd today reported a disappointing start to the 1996/97 financial year, with profit for the first quarter down 21% compared to the previous corresponding period. The building materials and construction company blamed a weak Australian housing market and increased costs for the slow start.

Boral's managing director Mr. John Marlay said the housing industry in Australia has experienced a “marked slowdown” in the first few months of the financial year. “New home building approvals are down significantly compared to a year ago, and this has flowed through to reduced demand for our products, particularly concrete, bricks, tiles and timber,” he said.

Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for the quarter ended 30 September 1996 were $45.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million or 21.2% from the same quarter last year. Profit after tax was $26.6 million, down 24.0% from $35.0 million previously. Revenue was down slightly at $559.6 million compared to $564.5 million in the first quarter of 1995/96.  

Mr. Marlay said price increases and cost control could not fully offset the impact of lower volumes and higher costs during the quarter. “Cost pressures are evident across all our operations due to increasing charges for raw materials, fuels, transportation and compliance requirements,” he said. 

Boral's Australian operations reported a 32.5% slump in EBIT to $27.8 million, with all major business segments affected by the housing downturn. Revenue declined 4.3% to $417.8 million. 

The company's US and Asian operations provided some offsets, with EBIT up 25.0% to $13.3 million and revenue growth of 10.0% to $109.5 million. However, Boral’s 50%-owned plasterboard joint venture, USG-Boral, reported lower earnings following recent commissioning issues at a new production line.

Looking ahead, Mr. Marlay said Boral does not expect any material improvement in Australian housing activity in the next six to twelve months. “The outlook remains subdued, and we are planning for demand and price pressures to persist at current levels,” he said. “We will maintain tight control of costs and capital expenditure.”

Boral shares fell 20 cents to $4.20 following the announcement, a drop of 4.5% from yesterday’s closing price. The company has seen its share price decline more than 10% over the past year in line with the broader construction materials sector.
