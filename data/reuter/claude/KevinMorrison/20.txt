APEC leaders agree on plan to reduce tariffs for IT&T industry, welcomed by Australia

Leaders from 21 Asia-Pacific nations agreed to a roadmap for reducing tariffs on information technology and telecommunication products and services at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Papua New Guinea on Saturday. The plan envisions tariffs on IT and telecom products dropping to 5% or less by 2025 in participating economies.

The agreement was welcomed by the Australian government as it is expected to boost trade in Australia's burgeoning technology sector. "This is a win for consumers, businesses, and the digital economy across our region," Australian Minister for Trade Simon Birmingham said. "Reducing costs for telecommunications and IT products will boost connectivity and further enhance Australia's economic integration across the Asia-Pacific."

The plan sets out a multi-year process of negotiating lowered tariffs among signatory nations in a series of stages. The first set of tariff concessions is targeted for achieving by 2021 and covers products like mobile phones, network equipment, and keyboards. Subsequent rounds of cuts will be aimed at products such as smart watches, cloud computing services, and software. The tariff cuts are voluntary but signatory nations have committed to "ambitious outcomes" in the agreement. 

While an incremental step, proponents argue reducing IT and telecom tariffs across the region can have a big impact. International Data Corporation estimates that a 10% cut in IT and related tariffs could boost trade in those products by up to $21 billion. Eliminating some telecom tariffs could lower mobile phone costs in Southeast Asia by up to 18% and internet costs by up to 14%, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development found.

Not all APEC members are on board, however. China and Russia have signed on to the concept of tariff reductions but have not committed to the specific targets in the roadmap. They argue that steeper cuts on IT and telecom tariffs, which are already generally low, need to be matched by cuts in other sensitive sectors like agriculture. The omission of China in particular could limit the scale of potential trade gains.

Skeptics also argue that simply eliminating tariffs will not necessarily boost trade and connectivity across the region in the absence of broader economic reforms. Improvements in areas like intellectual property protection, services liberalization, and regulatory coherence are also needed, according to analysts. "Tariff cuts are one small piece of the puzzle, but reductions will be less meaningful if not undertaken in parallel with these deeper, structural changes,‚Äù said Deborah Elms of the Asian Trade Centre.

The agreement to reduce IT and telecom tariffs is a positive step but broader reforms and participation from major APEC members will be needed to significantly transform digital trade in the Asia-Pacific region. All eyes will be on China and Russia moving forward to see if and when they get on board. Regardless, the tariff roadmap is a welcome development for Australia's tech sector and a signal of growing momentum around digital trade in APEC.
