AGL Interested in Buying Tenneco's Australian Assets if They're Put Up for Sale, Says Managing Director 

AGL Energy, Australia's largest electricity generator and retailer, said it is interested in purchasing local assets from auto parts maker Tenneco Inc should they be put up for sale.

"If they were interested in divesting some of their Australian assets, then we would certainly have a look at them," AGL Managing Director Brett Redman said in an interview. "We've got an appetite to grow in Australia and we're looking for the right assets and the right valuations."

Tenneco, based in Lake Forest, Illinois, makes automotive emission control systems and suspension products. The company has 17 manufacturing plants and over 3,500 employees across Australia and New Zealand according to its website.

Mr. Redman said AGL would potentially be interested in some of Tenneco's industrial operations and not their automotive business. Any deal would need to meet AGL's investment criteria around the strategic fit, valuation and risk profile of the assets.

His comments come as AGL looks to transform itself into an integrated energy company offering customers electricity, gas, solar, batteries and other energy products and services. Mr. Redman said acquisitions will form part of the company's growth strategy to support that transition, alongside internal investments in renewable energy and other technologies.

"We're working on about a dozen opportunities at the moment, ranging from small through to very large," Mr. Redman said, without giving further details. "We've got the balance sheet capacity to do sizeable M&A if the right opportunity came along."

AGL reported a 7.5% increase in full-year profit to $1.04 billion in August, helped by cost cuts and higher electricity prices. However, its earnings have been under pressure due to weaker wholesale power prices and increased competition in the retail market.  

Mr. Redman said price pressures have stabilized recently but the market remains highly competitive. "There's clearly a lot of activity aimed at gaining market share, so we're very focused on improving customer experience, service and loyalty."

AGL continues to see progress in transitioning its power generation portfolio away from coal towards renewable energy and storage technologies. It has committed to exiting coal-fired generation by the mid-2040s and sees potential for up to 12 gigawatts of new renewable and firming capacity by then.
