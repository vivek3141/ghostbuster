Analysts Remain Split over Merger as BT Posts Strong Q2 Profits 

BT Group, the British telecommunications giant, reported strong second-quarter profits today, exceeding analysts’ expectations. However, experts remain divided on whether BT should proceed with its planned multi-billion pound merger with EE, the UK’s largest mobile network operator.

BT announced Q2 earnings of £792 million, a 12% increase from the same period last year. Revenue rose 21% to £4.7 billion, helped significantly by the acquisition of mobile operator EE in January. BT Consumer added 99,000 new broadband customers in the quarter, and EE added 201,000 postpaid mobile customers.  

“These are strong results that demonstrate the initial financial benefits of our acquisition of EE,” said Gavin Patterson, BT’s Chief Executive. “Our integration plans are on track, and we are well positioned to deliver the higher free cashflow, earnings and returns that we have promised to our shareholders.”

However, some analysts argue that BT should abandon its planned £12.5 billion takeover of the shares it does not already own in EE. When BT acquired the initial stake in EE, it pledged to buy out the remaining minority shareholders within two years. But with Brexit uncertainty impacting the economy and telecoms market, analysts say the price tag now looks too high.

“While the Q2 numbers are solid, the strategic imperative to wholly own EE has diminished,” said Matthew Howett, an analyst with research firm Assembly. “There are enough cost savings and commercial benefits to be gained from BT's current majority control. A full merger risks significantly overpaying at a time when UK telecom valuations are under pressure.”

Others argue that a full merger remains the right long-term move for BT, given the growing importance of converged fixed and mobile services. Simon Waller, an analyst with JP Morgan, said, "The integration of EE is already unlocking real value for BT, as these results show. There will be further cost and revenue synergies from full ownership that shouldn't be left on the table.” 

With the debate intensifying, the coming months will be crucial in determining whether BT proceeds to buy out the remaining EE shares it does not own. CEO Patterson seemed to indicate that BT remains committed to the takeover but willing to be flexible on timing. "We will continue to evaluate the optimal path forward for our shareholders,” he said in a statement accompanying today's earnings release.
