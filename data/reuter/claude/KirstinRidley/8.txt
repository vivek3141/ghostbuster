BT and MCI Merge in Record-Setting Transatlantic Deal Valued at $20 Billion  

British Telecom and MCI Communications announced today that they have reached an agreement to merge in a deal valued at $20 billion, creating one of the world's largest telecommunications companies. The deal represents the largest merger of telecom firms across the Atlantic and highlights the increasing globalization of the telecommunications industry.

Under the terms of the agreement, British Telecom will acquire MCI for $17 billion in stock and assume $3 billion of MCI's debt. The combined company will continue to operate under the British Telecom name but its corporate headquarters will be in Washington, DC and London. The deal is expected to close in 6 to 9 months, pending regulatory approval.

The merger combines BT's strong position in Europe and Asia with MCI's substantial presence in North America. The new BT will have over 100 million business and residential customers worldwide, with a particularly strong presence in the enterprise market. Revenue for the combined company is projected to be $35 billion this year. 

"This merger creates a powerful global competitor with the scale and reach to truly reshape the competitive landscape of the telecom industry," said Sir Iain Vallance, Chairman of BT. "By combining BT and MCI, we are poised to deliver innovative solutions to multinational businesses and gain new access to high-growth markets around the world."

BT has long sought to expand its presence in the U.S. market, while MCI has been looking for ways to gain scale to compete with larger rivals like AT&T and Verizon Communications. The deal addresses both companies' strategic priorities and positions them to better compete on a global basis in the fast-changing telecom sector.  

However, the merger is likely to face close regulatory scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe given the size of the new company and its potential impact on competition. Consumer groups are already raising concerns about possible price increases, reduced choice, and lack of incentives for infrastructure investment. The deal may require the companies to divest certain assets to win approval.

The merger is the latest example of increasing global consolidation in the telecommunications industry. Other recent deals include Vodafone's takeover of Germany's Mannesmann and Spain's Telefonica's acquisition of the U.K.'s O2. With competition intensifying and technological change accelerating, scale and reach have become increasingly critical to success in the telecom sector. The BT-MCI deal is a strategic response to these forces and a sign of more cross-border tie-ups likely still to come.
