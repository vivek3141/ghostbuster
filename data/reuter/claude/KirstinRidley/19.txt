BT Struggles to Find Growth Prospects in Competitive Market Despite Increased Efficiency   

BT Group, the British telecommunications company, released its latest quarterly results today showing continued stagnant revenue growth despite ongoing cost-cutting efforts. Revenue was up only 1% compared to the same quarter last year while earnings per share edged up 3%. The results highlight the challenging competitive dynamics facing the company in its key markets.

The company's consumer division, which provides broadband, TV and phone services to households, saw revenue decline 1% compared to last year as customers continued to switch to lower-cost bundled packages and competitors offered aggressive discounts to gain market share. BT has focused on bundling multiple services together at lower price points to match competitors but that strategy has squeezed revenue and profits. 

In the enterprise division, revenue from large business and public sector clients was flat as lower demand for legacy voice and data services offset gains from newer IP-based offerings. International revenue from global services also declined 3% due to macroeconomic uncertainty causing some multinational clients to delay new projects.

CEO Philip Jansen said the results were in line with expectations but show why the company needs to move faster to strengthen its competitive position. “Our continued cost transformation is enabling us to offset market headwinds. However, we need to go further and faster,” Jansen said. The company aims to realize £1.3 billion in gross annual cost savings in 2023 through job cuts, process automation and service model redesign.

BT faces intense competition on multiple fronts. In consumer broadband, it is battling not only rival internet providers like Virgin Media but also disruptive new entrants using infrastructure built by Openreach, BT's own network division. Sky, a satellite TV competitor, also has a strong broadband offering. And companies like Netflix and Disney+ pose threats to BT's TV subscriber base as streaming services gain popularity.  

In the enterprise space, competitors range from major carriers like Vodafone and global network service providers to smaller niche players targeting specific customer segments. BT must keep innovating across its portfolio of networking, cloud, security and IoT services to match the pace of change.  

Jansen said the company is making progress on a number of strategic priorities like convergence, where it is bundling mobile service with its traditional landline offerings, and in building a new IT platform to accelerate the delivery of products and services for customers. But in today’s rapidly evolving landscape, that may not be enough.  

 “BT faces significant challenges as it works to turn around years of underinvestment and maneuver through competitive disruption,” said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight. “Undertaking drastic cost cuts while trying to seamlessly execute an ambitious transformation program is extremely difficult.”

The market seems to share in that skepticism. BT's share price was down over 4 percent in midday trading as investors digested the sobering results and outlook. While Jansen and his team work to reshape operations for a new era, growth remains frustratingly difficult to find.
