Analysts: Attempt to Block BT-MCI Merger on Grounds of Restricted Trade Will Fail

Technology industry analysts predicted today that the attempt by the U.S. Justice Department to block the proposed merger of British Telecom and MCI Communications is unlikely to succeed. The Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit this week alleging that the $21 billion deal would reduce competition and lead to higher prices for telephone and data services. 

However, multiple analysts that track the telecommunications sector said that the merger is not anti-competitive and that BT and MCI will be able to make a strong case in court. “BT and MCI operate in a dynamic, global market with many competitors,” said Amy Smith, a senior analyst at Data Networks Consulting. “Blocking this merger will not benefit consumers or safeguard competition.”

BT, the dominant telephone company in the UK, announced plans last year to acquire MCI, the second-largest U.S. long-distance carrier, as part of BT’s strategy to expand globally and enter the U.S. market. The deal has already been approved by shareholders and European regulators.

The Justice Department argued in its lawsuit that the merger would hamper competition in telephone and data markets, resulting in higher prices for business customers in the U.S. and UK. However, the companies pledged to keep prices flat for two years after the merger and invest in expanding networks. Analysts said these commitments should address regulatory concerns about cost and quality.

“Blocking this merger could actually harm competition by reducing investment in infrastructure,” said Joshua Martin, a telecom expert at Market Strategies International. “MCI needs BT’s financial backing to upgrade its networks and remain competitive. This lawsuit is misguided and not supported by market realities.”

A trial in federal court is scheduled to begin next month. BT and MCI expressed disappointment at the Justice Department’s decision to sue to stop the deal and said they will vigorously contest the lawsuit to defend the merger. Analysts remained confident the companies will prevail in court, allowing the deal to go through by the end of this year as originally planned.
