BT Beats Analyst Forecasts With Strong Profits and Growth Despite Competition  

BT, the British telecommunications giant, reported strong profits and revenue growth for the third quarter, beating analyst expectations. The company benefited from increasing broadband subscriptions and mobile users despite facing significant competition in the market.

BT posted a 6% rise in revenue to £5.97 billion for the three months ending December 31, 2019. Pre-tax profits climbed 2% to £2 billion. On an earnings per share basis, BT earned 23.2 pence, ahead of the 21.8 pence forecast by analysts. 

The company added 82,000 new broadband customers, the highest number in more than three years. BT now has over 14 million broadband subscribers, with 60% of those on faster fiber connections. Revenue from consumer broadband services grew 10% from a year earlier.

BT's mobile division, EE, gained 161,000 postpaid mobile subscribers, the most in a quarter since BT acquired EE in 2016. EE now has nearly 32 million total mobile customers. Revenue from mobile services increased 4% from a year ago.

"These are an encouraging set of numbers, especially the growth in broadband and mobile, where competition is intense," said Simon Cooke, analyst at Concrete Analytics. "The results show the success of BT's bundled packages and premium service offers in stabilizing revenue and maintaining its position in those markets."

However, BT faces significant challenges to continue its positive momentum. Competitors like Sky, Virgin Media and a number of broadband and mobile virtual network operators are putting pressure on prices and taking away market share. BT also confronts regulatory issues around the separation of its Openreach broadband division.

To counter these competitive and regulatory headwinds, BT plans to invest billions in network upgrades to provide faster connectivity across the country. The company is accelerating its fiber and 5G wireless rollouts to meet rising data demands and support new digital applications for consumers and businesses. 

BT also aims to cut costs by £2 billion over the next three years through greater efficiencies, automation and job cuts if required. The cost-savings program would help fund the company's network investments and other strategic priorities around cybersecurity and converged network services.

With its strong results this quarter, BT remains on track to meet full-year guidance. But longer-term challenges around competition, regulation and technological change continue to cloud the outlook for Britain's dominant telecom company. Staying ahead of fast-changing market dynamics and customer needs will be crucial for BT to keep winning in the future.
