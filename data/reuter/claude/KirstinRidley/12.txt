Analysts Predict Challenges for Cable and Wireless Following $20 Billion Merger of Anglo-U.S. Concert Plc  

Cable and Wireless Telecommunications Plc today announced it has completed its acquisition of Anglo-U.S. Concert Plc for $20 billion in cash and stock. The merger combines two of the world's largest international telecommunications companies and creates a global powerhouse to compete with the likes of AT&T and Verizon. However, industry analysts warn the merger could face significant challenges as the combined company aims to integrate its networks and reduce costs.

The new Cable and Wireless will have operations in more than 100 countries, serving both business and residential customers. Its network will span Europe, the Americas, Africa, the Middle East and Asia Pacific, carrying billions of voice and data traffic each day. The merger is expected to yield $4 billion in synergies from eliminating duplicate functions and increasing operational efficiencies over the next three years. The company also aims to expand its roster of enterprise clients that operate internationally.  

"This merger establishes Cable and Wireless as a preeminent global communications provider with the scale and reach to competitively serve multinational customers anywhere in the world," said Cable and Wireless CEO John Williamson. "Our networks are highly complementary, positioning us to deliver seamless connectivity and the highest quality services to customers across six continents."

However, analysts point out that merging two companies of this size will be an immense challenge that could disrupt services and alienate customers if not executed properly. "Cable and Wireless will have to integrate legacy networks that were not originally designed to work together, as well as consolidate data centers, offices and staff in hundreds of locations," said Brian Kauffman, telecom analyst at MSI Partners. "There are bound to be technical and operational hurdles that impact service levels as systems are upgraded and networks are stitched together."

There are also concerns the $4 billion in promised cost savings may be difficult to achieve. "Experience shows that lofty synergy projections are often not realized after large mergers," said Edwin Walters, partner at McKinsey & Company. "Integrating cultures, products, and processes is hard, complex work that can take years. Cable and Wireless will have to move fast while being sensitive to maintaining customer experience, employee morale and business partnerships that took decades to build." 

Despite the challenges, Cable and Wireless remains confident the strategic benefits of the merger will make the short-term difficulties worthwhile. The combined scale and reach will allow the company to accelerate investments in next-generation 5G networks and cloud-based services for multinational businesses. With a strong balance sheet and diverse revenue streams across geographies and customer segments, the new Cable and Wireless expects to thrive in the global digital economy for decades to come. Overall, analysts agree the merger makes strategic sense, but the real test will be in flawlessly executing what will be one of the largest integrations in telecommunications history.
