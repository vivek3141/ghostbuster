British Telecom to Acquire Rest of MCI Communications, Creating a Global Telecom Powerhouse

British Telecommunications PLC has agreed to acquire the remaining 48% of MCI Communications Corp. it does not already own, creating one of the world's largest telecommunications companies. BT will pay $5.1 billion in cash for the portion of MCI it does not currently own. MCI will become a wholly owned subsidiary of BT and will continue operating as a separate company under its existing brand. 

The deal combines two of the pioneering companies that helped usher in the era of competition in the telecom industry. MCI challenged AT&T's monopoly in the United States, helping to spur the breakup of Ma Bell in 1982. BT was privatized in 1984, introducing competition in Britain's state-run telecom market. By joining forces, BT and MCI will gain greater scale to compete on a global basis with other integrated telecom giants like AT&T, Verizon Communications Inc., and Vodafone Group PLC.

“This is a pivotal moment for BT,” said Sir Christopher Bland, BT's chairman. “MCI has been an outstanding partner, and now is the time to simplify our relationship while the company is performing strongly.” The deal is the latest example of consolidation in an industry struggling with slowing growth and price competition. Telecom companies are bulking up their capabilities and customer bases to gain advantages.

BT currently owns 52% of MCI, a stake it gained through a series of deals in the 1990s. MCI emerged from bankruptcy in 2003 after suffering from a collapse in Internet-related business and billions in debt. But the company successfully restructured, focusing on large corporate and government clients. MCI posted revenue of $5.2 billion in 2004 and has $18 billion in long-term debt. Integrating the companies aims to reduce expenses by up to $1 billion annually within three years. Thousands of jobs could eventually be cut.  

Consumer advocates worry the deal could reduce choices for customers, especially businesses with global communications needs. "This merger bears close scrutiny to ensure that its potential benefits to BT and MCI do not come at the cost of competition in telecom services," said Gene Kimmelman, director of Consumers Union. However, others argue there is still vibrant competition from wireless carriers, cable TV companies providing phone services, and Internet calling.

The deal requires regulatory approval and is expected to close within 12 months. MCI shareholders and directors have approved the sale. Upon completion, Sir Christopher said the combination with MCI will "fulfill BT's vision to become a truly global communications company." With the future of telecommunications evolving to next-generation Internet and broadband networks, the new BT appears positioned to be at the forefront of innovation on a bigger stage.
