Vodafone Group Announces 21% Rise in Profits and £77 Million Acquisition

Vodafone Group, the British multinational telecommunications company, today announced its financial results for the fiscal year ending March 2020, reporting a 21% increase in profits. The company reported pre-tax profits of €2.83 billion, up from €2.35 billion last year. Revenue rose 6% to €43.6 billion, boosted by strong performance in several major European markets as well as growth in its mobile money transfer service, M-Pesa. 

Nick Read, Vodafone Group CEO, credited the company's "consistent and successful" strategy focused on convergence, gigabit connectivity, and improved customer experience. "We have delivered a good financial performance this year, building on the momentum from last year and underpinned by accelerating service revenue growth in our largest markets," said Read.

As part of its growth strategy, Vodafone also announced today the acquisition of The People's Phone Company, a UK-based mobile virtual network operator, for £77 million. The acquisition will add over 1.5 million customers to Vodafone UK, boosting its customer base to over 23 million subscribers. 

"The People's Phone Company has built a very attractive mobile business and customer base through its innovative aggregation model and focus on delivering great value and service to customers," said Max Taylor, CEO of Vodafone UK. "I am delighted to welcome their talented team and loyal customers to the Vodafone family."

The People's Phone Company, founded in 2017, provides low-cost SIM-only mobile plans to customers in the UK by aggregating multiple mobile networks. The company has achieved rapid growth through an online-only model and social media marketing. However, industry analysts noted that increasing competition from other low-cost carriers likely forced The People's Phone Company to sell, and the deal allows Vodafone to boost subscriber numbers and gain more customers in the value mobile segment.

Nick Read said that acquisitions remain an "an important part" of Vodafone's strategy to gain scale and enhance growth opportunities. The company will look to make additional "bolt-on acquisitions" in its European markets to strengthen its convergence offerings, according to Read. The strong set of financial results and strategic acquisition place Vodafone on solid footing as it enters the new fiscal year despite macroeconomic challenges, including uncertainty fueled by Brexit. Investors reacted positively to the news, with Vodafone's share price rising over 3% in morning trading following the announcements.
