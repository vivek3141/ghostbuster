BT and MCI Corp Announce $20 Billion Merger, Creating One of the World's Largest Telecoms Groups

British Telecom and MCI Communications Corp announced today that they have agreed to merge in a deal worth $20 billion, creating one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. The new company will be called BT MCI and will have a combined market value of over $100 billion, annual revenues of $35 billion, and operations in over 80 countries. 

The merger brings together BT's strength in Europe with MCI's substantial presence in North America and the Asia Pacific region. The deal marks the latest in a wave of mergers and acquisitions sweeping the global telecoms sector as companies look to gain scale and offer integrated voice and data services.

BT Chairman Sir Iain Vallance said: "This merger makes strategic and commercial sense for both companies. Together, BT and MCI will be a powerful global competitor, with unrivalled capabilities and reach. This is a defining moment that will reshape the industry and benefit customers around the world."

MCI President and CEO Bert Roberts commented: "MCI and BT are an excellent strategic and cultural fit. By combining MCI's entrepreneurial spirit and BT's experience, we will accelerate innovation and bring more choice to customers. Together, we will drive rapid growth and shareholder value as we shape the future of the global communications industry."

The deal will merge BT's 21 million business and residential customers with MCI's 20 million customers, strengthening the combined company's ability to invest in networks and technologies. BT MCI will have networks spanning 170 countries and offer mobile, broadband, voice and data services. The merger is expected to yield substantial cost savings and new revenue opportunities, with annual cost synergies of $2 billion expected within three years.

BT and MCI aim to complete the merger within 12 months following regulatory and shareholder approval. While the merger faces scrutiny, particularly in the U.S., analysts expect regulators to approve the deal given the increasing globalization of telecoms markets. The announcement of the blockbuster merger between two of the world's top telecommunications operators sent shares of both companies higher in early trading.
