Stakis Plc Launches Cash Call to Fund 327 Million Pound Acquisition of Lonrho's Five Metropole Hotels

Hotel and gaming group Stakis Plc announced a 327 million pound acquisition of five luxury Metropole hotels from Lonrho Plc, to be funded through a shareholder cash call. Stakis will purchase Metropole hotels in London, Brighton, Eastbourne, Bournemouth, and Torquay from Lonrho, adding upmarket properties to Stakis' portfolio of 60 hotels and expanding into the "under-exploited" luxury market, according to Stakis Chief Executive Ian Patterson.

"We have been keen to move Stakis into the luxury hotel segment and the Metropole brand is a perfect fit, with its heritage and premium positioning, " Patterson said. "This acquisition will grow our presence in prime hotel real estate locations across the UK and diversify our customer base." Stakis will finance the purchase through a 121.8 pence per share open offer to raise 326.2 million pounds, with major shareholders indicating support. 

The Metropole hotels, which achieved an average daily room rate of over 200 pounds and revenue per available room of 134.30 pounds in 2018, span a total of 1,894 rooms. The properties include the prestigious Metropole Hotel on Northumberland Avenue in London, as well as seaside locations. Lonrho, an African investment firm, has aimed to sell non-core assets to reduce debt.

According to industry experts, the luxury hotel market in Britain has strong potential for growth over the next decade based on rising demand from affluent travelers and business guests. While challenges remain around costs, margins for luxury hotels in prime locations are also typically higher. "This looks to be a bold move by Stakis into a segment of the industry that should see very healthy returns over the longer run," said George Sell of Hotelzoom, a hospitality market analysis firm.  

To facilitate the new purchase and open offer, Stakis will suspend its dividend. Subject to shareholder approval, the open offer is expected to be completed by late August. Patterson expressed confidence in gaining the necessary backing. "Our shareholders are very supportive of strategic moves to enhance the company's growth profile and value," he said. The deal remains subject to regulatory approvals but is expected to close by the end of the third quarter, at which time Lonrho will exit its hotel operations. If approved, the Metropole acquisition will mark Stakis' largest purchase since its 820 million pound merger with Pleasurama in 1999.
