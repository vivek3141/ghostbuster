BT's Shares Surge Following Record-Breaking Merger with MCI: Analysts Say True Value Could Reach Up to £4 per Share

BT Group shares soared today following the announcement of a record-breaking merger between the British telecommunications company and MCI Inc, the second-largest telecommunications firm in the United States. The deal, which will see BT acquire MCI for $115 billion, was met with widespread excitement from analysts and investors.

The merger will make BT Group the largest telecommunications company in the world by revenue and creates a transatlantic powerhouse that combines BT's strong position in Europe with MCI's substantial presence across North America. The complementary geographic footprints and product portfolios of the two companies are expected to unlock substantial cost savings and new cross-selling opportunities.

BT shares closed up over 25% at £3.15, a record high, following news of the deal. Analysts upgraded their ratings and price targets for BT stock, with many suggesting the shares remain undervalued and could climb as high as £4 within the next 12 months as the benefits of the merger begin to materialize.

"This merger amounts to a major consolidation within the global telecommunications industry," said Thomas Simpson, an analyst with JPMorgan Equity Research. "By combining BT's leading mobile, broadband and pay-TV operations in the UK and parts of Europe with MCI's competitive position in business networks and cloud services across North America, the new BT Group will have unprecedented capabilities to serve customers on both sides of the Atlantic."

The record-breaking deal eclipses the previous largest ever merger in the telecommunications sector, AT&T's $67 billion acquisition of BellSouth in 2006. It will take up to two years to finalize the necessary regulatory approvals and close the acquisition, though executives at both companies expressed optimism that the deal would be approved given its potential benefits to customers and limited overlap of existing operations. The merger looks set to usher in a new era of transatlantic cooperation and competition within telecommunications.
