Stakis to Purchase Lonrho's Five Metropole Hotels in $530 Million Deal, Funded by Rights Issue

The Mediterranean and British hotelier Stakis Group announced today that it has entered into an agreement to purchase five major London hotels from the Lonrho Group for $530 million. The deal represents one of the largest hotel acquisitions in London's history.

The hotels involved in the transaction include The Metropole in Hyde Park, The Bloomsbury Metropole, The Victoria Metropole, The Chelsea Metropole, and The Kensington Metropole. Together,  the five properties account for over 2,500 hotel rooms in prime central London locations. Stakis said the rationale for the deal is to gain greater scale and expand its already significant presence in the London hotel market.

Stakis will fund the acquisition through a fully underwritten 1 for 4 rights issue to raise $350 million, in addition to bank debt financing of $150 million and available cash reserves of $30 million. The rights issue will allow existing Stakis shareholders to purchase new shares at a price of 540 pence. Stakis shares rose 3% on the news to 612 pence, as investors reacted positively to the deal and the company's growth ambitions.

“This transaction is transformational for Stakis and will firmly establish our position as a leading London hotelier,” said Stakis Group Chairman Sir David Michels. “The Metropole hotels are iconic properties in premier London locations that provide an outstanding platform for future growth.”

The deal comes as Stakis has exhibited strong performance recently, with revenue up 11% and earnings per share increasing 15% over the past fiscal year. The company's portfolio after the acquisition will consist of over 9,000 rooms across 38 hotels, with 22 located in London. Stakis is paying a reported 18 times EBITDA for the Metropole hotels based on their financial performance last year.

“We are delighted to place these landmark London hotels into the capable hands of the Stakis Group,” said Lonrho CEO Jonathan Marland. “This sale will allow Lonrho to focus on our core businesses in Africa while still retaining exposure to the London hotel market through a 25% stake in Stakis.” 

Lonrho is selling the hotels to repay debt and streamline its diverse portfolio of businesses that span mining, agriculture, transportation, and luxury hotels. The company will remain a significant shareholder in Stakis after the deal closes next month. Regulatory approval is not expected to pose any issues, according to both companies.

The Metropole acquisition is the latest example of growing merger and acquisition activity in the hotel industry, as firms seek to gain scale and take advantage of rising demand and room rates, especially in the booming London market. Both companies expect a smooth transfer of operations and no disruption for guests. For Stakis and its investors, though, the future has never looked brighter.
