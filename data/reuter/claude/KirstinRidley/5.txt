BT Secures Leading Position in World's Biggest Telecoms Market with $20 Billion MCI Merger  

British Telecom has agreed to acquire U.S. telecoms giant MCI for $20 billion in cash and stock. The deal will allow BT to gain a strong foothold in the lucrative U.S. telecommunications market, which accounts for nearly half of the global telecoms industry's revenues.

The merger comes amid consolidation in the telecoms sector as companies seek to offer bundled voice, data and video services to business and residential customers. By joining forces, BT and MCI will have greater scale to invest in new technologies and compete with rivals.

BT chief executive Ben Verwaayen said: "This strategic acquisition gives BT access to the world's biggest and most advanced communications market, accelerating our ambitions to become a global leader." MCI chief Michael Capellas added that the deal "creates a new powerful force in technology and communications."

BT has had a long-standing goal to expand in the U.S. market, but its previous attempts were unsuccessful. In 2000, BT's bid to merge with AT&T was blocked by U.S. regulators. The takeover of MCI, the No.2 U.S. long-distance phone company, is a major step forward in BT's U.S. ambitions and turns it into a global challenger to other telecom giants such as Verizon and Vodafone.

BT said it did not expect the deal to face opposition from regulators this time. The transaction is expected to close in early 2007, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. BT's shares rose 4% on news of the deal, while MCI's stock surged 17% to just below the offer price, indicating investors expect the deal to go through.

The merger highlights how telecom companies are seeking to transform themselves into "one-stop shops" for voice and data services to business and residential users. By joining forces, BT and MCI aim to accelerate their push into new wave technologies such as internet telephony, broadband internet and digital TV.
