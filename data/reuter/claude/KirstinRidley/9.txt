BT Shares Surge on $20 Billion Mega-Merger with MCI Communications

British Telecommunications (BT) shares rose 15% today as the company announced plans to acquire US-based telecommunications firm MCI Communications in a $20 billion mega-merger. The deal, the largest in the telecom sector this year, will create a global communications giant to take on industry leaders like AT&T and Verizon.

BT will pay $20.50 per share for MCI, representing a premium of 13% over MCI's average stock price last month. The acquisition is expected to produce cost savings of $2 billion per year starting in 2008, as the companies eliminate redundant facilities and staff. The combined company will have over 300 million business and residential customers worldwide, as well as a strong presence in high-growth areas like mobile, broadband, and IT services.

"This is a transformational deal that will reshape the global communications landscape," said BT Chief Executive Philip Hampton. " Together, BT and MCI will have unparalleled scale and reach to meet customer needs and drive future innovation. " MCI Chief Executive Samuel Jones echoed the sentiment, saying, "This combination of two iconic companies that have been at the forefront of telecom innovation for decades is a logical next step." The deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval but is expected to close within 12 months.

Investors responded enthusiastically to the announcement, sending BT shares up 4 pence to 32 pence in London trading and pushing MCI shares $2.80 higher to $19.50 in New York. Analysts said the spike in share prices reflected confidence in the strategic rationale of the deal and the capacity for significant cost savings and revenue synergies. "There is little overlap between BT and MCI, so they should be able to cut substantial costs by eliminating duplication," said Jennifer Johnson of Credit Suisse. "At the same time, they have very complementary capabilities that should open up new opportunities for revenue growth, especially in cloud services, security and IoT."  

However, others warned that realizing the promised cost savings and benefits could prove challenging given the scale of integrating two companies with over 200,000 employees across more than 50 countries. "Mega-mergers of this size always look great on paper, but the reality is often much more difficult," cautioned Dan Stevens of Barclays Capital. "There are huge risks around integrating IT systems, management processes, and corporate cultures. If not managed properly, those risks could significantly impact the strategic case for the deal."  

If approved, the acquisition of MCI would cap a multi-year transformation for BT under Chief Executive Philip Hampton to focus on the faster-growing parts of its business. In recent years, BT has moved aggressively into mobile, broadband, and business services while spinning off or exiting declining operations like its directory business. The purchase of MCI is seen as accelerating that transformation by giving BT an even larger presence in corporate and government markets on both sides of the Atlantic.
