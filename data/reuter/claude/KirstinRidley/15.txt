Dominion Resources holds initial talks with East Midlands Electricity over takeover bid 

Dominion Resources, one of the largest energy companies in the U.S., has held preliminary discussions about acquiring East Midlands Electricity (EME) Plc, a regional power distribution company in central England, according to people familiar with the matter.

Representatives from Dominion and EME met last week to discuss a potential deal that could value EME at more than £2 billion ($2.6 billion), said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. The talks are ongoing and could still fall apart, the people added.

Dominion sees EME as an attractive takeover target due to its stable base of more than 4 million customers in a region that has been growing faster than the rest of the U.K., the people said. However, there are significant regulatory and political hurdles to cross, including a general election in May. A takeover of EME would be the largest ever for Dominion and would serve to diversify its geographic reach and complement its regulated electric and natural gas utility businesses in parts of the Eastern U.S., the Dominion officials noted.

Dominion Chief Executive Officer Thomas Farrell sees international acquisitions as key to the company’s long-term growth. In recent years, Dominion has looked at potential targets in Europe, including in the U.K. Before Dominion’s interest, EME had not been formally up for sale and has a stable major shareholder base, the people said. EME's majority investors are U.K.-based, while remaining shares are held by retail and institutional shareholders.

EME employs more than 4,300 people and has a market value of about £1.96 billion. It owns and operates electricity distribution networks in central England, including Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Derbyshire, and Lincolnshire.  EME is regulated by the British energy regulator Ofgem, which would have to approve any takeover of the company. EME has delivered stable returns and dividends for shareholders for the past decade.
