BT and MCI Communications Announce $54 Billion Merger, Creating One of the World's Largest Telecoms Groups 

British Telecommunications PLC and MCI Communications Corp have agreed to merge in a deal worth $54 billion, forming one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. The combined company will generate over $33 billion in revenues and have operations in over 65 countries.

The merger will be structured as an acquisition of MCI by BT for about $21 billion in cash and stock. MCI shareholders will receive about 45 percent of the combined company. The merger is expected to produce substantial cost savings through greater efficiencies and economies of scale. The companies estimate that cost synergies of $2 billion can be achieved by cutting duplicate functions, consolidation of offices and technologies, and reduction of suppliers.

The deal represents BT's largest acquisition ever and is a major move by the company into the US and global telecom markets. BT has sought to expand beyond its domestic UK market, where growth has slowed. The acquisition of MCI, the second largest US telecom company after AT&T, will provide BT with a sizable presence in the vast American market as well as greater exposure to multinational corporate clients.  

For MCI, the merger provides financial stability after a turbulent period. MCI experienced declining sales and profits after the collapse of the telecom sector in the early 2000's. The deal with BT is a lifeline that will strengthen MCI's balance sheet and allow for investments in new technologies. MCI chairman Bert Roberts said, â€œThis transaction represents the best path forward for our company and all of our constituencies."

Regulators in the US, UK and other countries still need to approve the merger, but the companies hope to complete the deal by early 2022. BT chairman Sir Christopher Bland said, "By combining BT's network expertise and MCI's extensive US presence, we believe both companies will benefit from broader global reach and product innovation." If approved, the deal would likely face scrutiny over competition concerns, especially in the critical business telecom services segment.  

The merger is the latest sign of consolidation in the telecommunications sector as companies seek to gain greater scale and pricing power. Recent deals include Vodafone's $180 billion takeover of Mannesmann and France Telecom's $50 billion merger with Orange. With its acquisition of MCI, BT aims to join the top ranks of global telecom giants like AT&T, Verizon and Vodafone.
