Analysts Say Attempt to Block British Telecom and MCI $20bn Merger Will Fail  

Regulators in the United Kingdom and the United States are attempting to block the proposed $20 billion merger of British Telecom and MCI Communications citing concerns over reduced competition in the telecommunications sector. However, industry analysts predict the deal will ultimately be approved, possibly with some conditions or concessions from the two companies.

British Telecom, the dominant telecom provider in the UK, announced plans last year to acquire MCI, the second-largest long-distance carrier in the US. The deal would create one of the world’s largest telecommunications companies and allow British Telecom to gain a foothold in the lucrative US market. However, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have voiced opposition to the deal, arguing it could negatively impact competition and lead to higher prices for consumers.  

In the UK, the Office of Communications (Ofcom) said the merger could hamper competition in the British telecom market and reduce choice for customers. Ofcom has the power to block the deal if its concerns are not addressed. In the US, the Justice Department has also raised objections and may file an antitrust lawsuit to stop the acquisition, though experts say a lawsuit is unlikely given the companies’ willingness to make concessions.

While regulators have expressed skepticism, industry analysts are confident the deal will ultimately be approved, possibly with conditions requiring the companies to sell certain assets or agree to price controls. Lawrence Thompson, a telecom analyst at Piper Jaffray, said "Regulatory opposition is not surprising given the scale of the deal, but British Telecom and MCI have a strong incentive to push this through and I expect them to appease regulators by shedding some properties or agreeing to customer protections.” 

British Telecom has said it remains committed to the acquisition and will work with regulators to ensure their concerns are met in a timely manner. If approved, the deal is expected to close by the end of this year. While regulators may delay the process, most analysts think they will eventually give their blessing, allowing British Telecom and MCI to combine and proceed with deeper integration of their operations.
