Computer Associates to Shift Focus to Midrange Software, Expects $500 Million Charge for Acquisition  

Computer Associates International Inc. said today it plans to focus more on midrange business software and services, leading to a charge of up to $500 million to scale back some operations. 

The Islandia, N.Y., company said it aims to divert resources to its fastest-growing business lines, including systems and security management software for midsize companies. As a result, it expects to take a pretax charge of $450 million to $500 million in its fiscal second quarter to curtail some products and services for mainframe computers and restructure some units.

The shift in focus is the first major strategic move by Chief Executive Sanjay Kumar, who took the helm in August after former CEO Charles Wang retired. The changes are designed to boost CA's growth and stock price, which has lagged behind the overall software industry.

CA's stock rose $1.6875 to close at $16.6875 in 4 p.m. Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The company will report results for its second quarter, which ended Sept. 30, on Oct. 23.

The planned charge will decrease earnings in CA's current quarter. However, the changes—including making its various software units more autonomous—are expected to boost earnings starting in the following quarter and yield $75 million in annual cost savings. The moves will involve eliminating some jobs and consolidating some locations, though CA didn't specify numbers.

While the charge is significant, analysts said the moves appear constructive. “These kinds of transformations often involve a lot of pain, but it's the right medicine for CA,” said Richard Williams of Garban Institutional Equities. “In the long run, they have to focus on where the growth is.” 

CA's mainframe software and services business generates more than $2 billion in annual revenue but has been growing slowly. Its midrange software units, focused on network management, security and storage software, generate more than $1.5 billion and have been expanding at double-digit percentage rates.
