Cascade Communications Corp's earnings beat estimates but fall short of Wall Street expectations  

Cascade Communications Corp reported quarterly earnings yesterday that exceeded analysts' estimates but fell short of the more optimistic expectations of some investors, sending the company's shares down over 6% in after-hours trading.

The San Jose-based networking equipment maker posted net income of $145.2 million, or 37 cents a share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30. That was up from $120.4 million, or 31 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 15% to $1.42 billion from $1.24 billion. 

Excluding one-time items, Cascade earned 39 cents a share. On average, analysts polled by Thomson Financial projected earnings of 38 cents a share on revenue of $1.41 billion. The company had matched or slightly beaten expectations for the last four quarters.

However, some investors were betting on stronger results for the company's core business and upbeat guidance. The 39-cent profit fell short of the average Wall Street estimate of 40 cents to 42 cents, according to a survey of analysts. The company's fourth-quarter revenue forecast of $1.43 billion to $1.46 billion was in line with forecasts, but the earnings estimate of 38 cents to 40 cents a share was slightly below some analysts' projections.

Cascade's shares have jumped 38% in the past year as demand surged for its networking equipment, which helps businesses manage communications and Internet traffic. Its equipment helps connect Wi-Fi networks to corporate systems, speed up cloud-computing data centers, and enable other next-generation network functions. Bullish investors have bid up the shares in anticipation of accelerating demand for these new technologies.

In after-hours trading, Cascade shares fell $3.51 to $53.49. During the regular session, the stock rose 34 cents to close at $57. In the past 52 weeks, shares have traded between $34.95 to $62.49.  

Cascade Chief Executive John Chambers said the company is in a strong position for long-term growth as companies upgrade networks and spend more on technologies like cloud computing and Wi-Fi access. However, the company is facing margin pressure and rising competition.

"While we continue to execute well, the challenges of the current macroeconomic environment are impacting our business," Mr. Chambers said on a conference call. He said order rates in the U.S. and Europe have been slower than expected.  

The results demonstrate Cascade's solid execution, but also the struggles high-tech companies face in overcoming difficult year-ago comparisons and volatile spending on technology. The slowing economy adds another layer of uncertainty and suggests Cascade's shares may face further volatility.
