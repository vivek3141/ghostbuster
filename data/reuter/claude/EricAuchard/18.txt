AOL Unveils Strategy to Become a Mass Media Company, Introduces Flat-Rate Internet Pricing, Hires Robert Pittman as Head of Online Service  

America Online today announced a major strategic shift to transform itself into a broad-based media and entertainment company. As part of this new strategy, AOL will move away from its longstanding hourly pricing model and switch to a flat-rate system for unlimited Internet access. The company also named former MTV executive Robert Pittman as the head of its online service.

AOL CEO Steve Case said the moves are designed to position AOL as a "mass media company of the 21st century" that delivers content, community, and e-commerce across multiple platforms. "The Internet is evolving into a mass mediaâ€”and AOL intends to lead that evolution," Case said at a press conference.

The new flat-rate pricing model is a sea change for AOL, which has charged customers on an hourly basis since launching in 1985. Under the new plan, customers will pay a flat monthly fee of $19.95 for unlimited access to AOL's service and the Internet. AOL hopes the predictable monthly charges will spur more frequent usage of its service, especially during evenings and weekends. The company also sees the flat-rate model as important for growth, as many potential new customers have been turned off by unpredictable hourly charges.

The hiring of MTV founder Robert Pittman is also a signal of AOL's media ambitions. As president of AOL Networks, Pittman will oversee AOL's content properties, including its popular web portals. "AOL has an opportunity to become the first 21st century media company, using the Internet to offer consumers a highly personalized and interactive experience across music, news, sports and more," Pittman said. "I've spent my career launching and building media brands, and the chance to help AOL become a leader in the next generation of media was too exciting an opportunity for me to pass up."
