SaveSmart Inc. to Introduce Credit Card-Based Savings Scheme for Online Coupon Clipping

SaveSmart Inc., one of the nation's leading providers of online coupons and savings offers, announced today that it will introduce a new savings product that allows customers to automatically deposit all of the money they save using SaveSmart promo codes into a high-yield savings account. The Credit Card-Linked Savings Account will give coupon clippers an opportunity to see their savings quickly mount up over time without requiring any additional effort or contributions.

"Anyone who clips coupons is obviously looking to save money, but sometimes those savings get spent on other things before you realize it," said David Thompson, CEO of SaveSmart. "With our new credit card-linked savings product, every dollar customers save when shopping online with our coupon codes and promo offers will  be automatically deposited into a special savings fund. The money is not accessible for spending, so customers can see how fast their savings grow over the course of a year just from using deals they are already clipping."

SaveSmart has partnered with three major banks—Chase, Citibank and Bank of America—to offer the special savings accounts. Customers will be able to link any credit or debit card from these participating banks to automatically deposit 100 percent of their SaveSmart coupon savings into a high-yield savings account currently earning 1.75% APY. The deposits and withdrawals are handled seamlessly in the background whenever a customer makes an online purchase using a SaveSmart deal. Savers will even receive monthly statements showing the details of how much they earned and deposited for the month.

Once the money is deposited in the special account, users won't be able to withdraw it for 12 months. After a year, they will have the opportunity to withdraw some or all of the money, or keep it in the account where it will continue earning interest. The longer holders keep money in, the higher the interest rate becomes.

Thompson believes the new product addresses a need among the company's 10 million coupon clipping customers to lock in their savings. Early beta testing shows the average customer was able to save over $450 in the first three months, with higher-volume shoppers saving $800 or more.

"Our customers are always looking for ways to maximize their budget and keep more money in their pockets," Thompson said. "Credit Card-Linked Savings gives them an effortless way to see their coupon savings accumulate in a safe place where they can really benefit from the power of compounding interest."

SaveSmart expects the new product to be available to all U.S. customers starting in June. Interested savers can sign up for the waiting list on SaveSmart.com beginning today.
