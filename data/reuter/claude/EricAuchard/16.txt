MCI Communications Corp. Strikes 10-Year Deal with NextWave Telecom Inc. to Enter Top Tier of U.S. Wireless Providers

MCI Communications Corp. announced today that it has entered into an agreement with NextWave Telecom Inc. to license NextWave’s wireless spectrum for 10 years. The deal will allow MCI to boost its wireless coverage and enter the top tier of U.S. wireless providers. 

Under the terms of the agreement, MCI will pay NextWave $2.5 billion over the 10-year period to use NextWave’s wireless spectrum licenses in the 2.5 gigahertz band. The licenses cover nearly the entire U.S., enabling MCI to expand its wireless network to provide coast-to-coast coverage and roll out new 5G services to its customers.

“This deal is a game changer for MCI that will allow us to compete head-to-head with the largest wireless carriers in the U.S.,” said John Smith, CEO of MCI Communications. “By gaining broad access to prime mid-band spectrum, we can rapidly expand our 5G coverage and offer faster speeds and enhanced mobile services to consumers and businesses across America.”

NextWave holds some of the largest spectrum portfolios available for commercial use in the U.S. The company has been acquiring spectrum through FCC auctions since 2005 but has faced difficulties funding the buildout of its own national wireless network. The deal with MCI represents the first major partnership NextWave has entered to monetize its spectrum assets. 

“We are excited to work with MCI to put this valuable spectrum resource to productive use delivering innovative new services to American consumers,” said Mary Wilson, CEO of NextWave Telecom. “This agreement validates our long-held spectrum position and unlocks value for NextWave shareholders.”

The deal is subject to regulatory approval by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice. MCI expects to take over management of the spectrum licenses from NextWave within four to six months if the deal is approved. MCI plans to move quickly to deploy 5G technology and enhanced network infrastructure to utilize the new spectrum, with the goal of launching expanded wireless services to customers starting in 2021.

The agreement propels MCI into the top tier of wireless carriers in the U.S. alongside Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile. MCI currently ranks as the fourth-largest wireless provider in the U.S. with over 50 million subscribers. Access to NextWave’s spectrum is expected to help MCI boost its coverage, speeds, and service offerings to better compete with larger rivals as demand for 5G connectivity accelerates in the coming years.

Shares of MCI Communications were up 15% on the news, reflecting a boost in investor confidence in MCI’s wireless strategy. NextWave’s stock price jumped over 40%, signaling the market’s approval of the sizable deal. The agreement is a victory for both companies as each aims to solidify its positioning for the 5G era. For wireless customers, the deal means more choice and improved services as another major carrier gains the capacity to challenge the biggest players in telecommunications.
