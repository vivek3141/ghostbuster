Market Research Firms Disagree on Third Quarter Personal Computer Demand: Half-Empty or Half-Full? 

 Two leading market research firms released their forecasts for worldwide personal computer shipments in the third quarter this week, and they paint very different pictures of the health of the PC market. TechVestor predicted PC shipments would decline nearly 5% from a year earlier, citing continuing softness in consumer demand and corporate purchasing. But MarketsNowcast issued a much more optimistic forecast, predicting PC shipments would actually rise 3% in the quarter, driven by stronger sales in emerging markets and steady replacement of aging business computers.

 The diverging viewpoints highlight the uncertainty surrounding the PC market, which has been overshadowed in recent years by the rapid growth of smartphones and tablets. While TechVestor sees the PC market as mature and struggling in the face of competition from mobile devices, MarketsNowcast believes recent upgrades, particularly the transition to Windows 10, have extended the replacement cycle for PCs and sustained market growth, at least for now. 

 “The PC market remains stuck in a half-empty or half-full scenario, where the pessimists see the structural challenges and the optimists see the pockets of growth,” said Jill Stone, a technology analyst at Insight Research. “The reality is probably somewhere in the middle, but these cyclical ups and downs will continue until we have a blockbuster new release or technology that spurs a new wave of PC buying.”

 TechVestor’s more downbeat assessment was based on weak preliminary sales data from the major PC makers, as well as declining shipments in some major markets like the United States and Western Europe. The firm noted that PC makers have been too optimistic in their production forecasts in recent quarters, leaving excess inventory that needs to be sold at a discount. TechVestor also cited the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, which has raised costs for some components and introduced economic uncertainty.

 In contrast, MarketsNowcast pointed to better than expected numbers from PC makers in China and other parts of Asia, continued robust sales of gaming PCs, and signs that businesses are continuing to upgrade from Windows 7 computers before that operating system is retired early next year. While consumer interest in PCs may be plateauing, MarketsNowcast believes replacement demand from large commercial and enterprise customers will sustain modest market growth, aided by improving Intel processor options and availability of computers tailored to business needs.
