AT&T Names Outsider John Walter as Heir to CEO Robert Allen in Bold Gamble for Future Competition  

AT&T rocked the business world today by announcing that John Walter, CEO of satellite TV provider DIRECTV, will succeed Robert Allen as AT&T’s top executive in six months. The surprise move is a bold effort by AT&T to inject new thinking into its leadership ranks as it gears up for intensifying competition.

Allen, 65, has led AT&T for 12 years and was expected to retire within the next two years. But in a hastily called news conference, Allen said the board decided “the time for fresh leadership is now” and chose Walter as AT&T's new CEO and chairman effective January 1.  

The choice of Walter, 53, is a major gamble by AT&T that an outsider can revitalize a culture often seen as ponderous and unimaginative. Walter built DIRECTV into a $24 billion satellite powerhouse in just eight years through aggressive marketing, lavish customer service, and technological innovation. “John Walter understands the future in a way that traditional phone company executives never could,” Allen said. “He is absolutely the right leader to help AT&T compete in the digital age.”

For his part, Walter said he relishes the challenge of running one of the world's premier communications companies with $213 billion in annual revenue and more than 300,000 employees. “AT&T has phenomenal assets and talent, but it needs a transformation for the 21st century,” Walter said. “I plan to challenge every assumption and turn over every rock to improve innovation, service, and performance.”  

Investors applauded the move, pushing AT&T's stock price up $2.75 to $53.50. “This is the shakeup AT&T badly needed,” said analyst Thomas Cole of Credit Suisse First Boston. “John Walter is a visionary who can develop the bold strategies that have been lacking at AT&T.”

The choice of an outsider was a stinging rebuke to AT&T's senior executives, who were the odds-on favorites to succeed Allen. AT&T's president and chief operating officer was seen as the heir apparent, but in recent months AT&T's performance has weakened, and Walter's star has been rising. The board ultimately decided that only a leader from outside AT&T could revamp a tradition-bound culture and aging strategy premised on landline phones and DSL Internet service.

Allen's pending retirement and the surprise move to tap Walter immediately sparked speculation: Did Allen jump or was he pushed? Allen insisted his departure was voluntary and that he and Walter will work closely over the next six months to ensure a smooth leadership transition. Skeptics, however, believe AT&T's eroding position ultimately forced the board's hand.

Whatever the internal dynamics, Allen's departure and Walter's ascendance usher in a new era at the venerable communications giant that traces its roots to Alexander Graham Bell. Walter will have his hands full dragging AT&T into the 21st century, but his track record at DIRECTV suggests he is ready to blaze a bold new trail. For AT&T, it is a brave gamble that innovation and greatness may finally come from outside its halls.
