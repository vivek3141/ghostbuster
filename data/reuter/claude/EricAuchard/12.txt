Technology stocks falter despite healthy earnings reports, sparking concerns over future  growth 

Major technology companies reported strong quarterly earnings this week, topping Wall Street's estimates and demonstrating continued momentum in digital advertising, cloud services, and ecommerce. However, their shares fell in after-hours trading, sparking concerns that future growth may be harder to achieve.

Google parent Alphabet reported a 24% jump in revenue to $65.1 billion, fueled by a surge in search ads and YouTube advertising. Facebook's revenue increased 49% to $29 billion, boosted by online ad spending. Both companies handily beat analysts' expectations. Yet Alphabet shares dropped 3% in after-hours trading while Facebook shares fell 7%. Investors appeared worried about rising costs and the prospect of slowing growth as COVID-19 declines.

Amazon shares declined 2% after the company projected revenue in the current quarter to grow up to 21% but at a slower pace as Prime Day moves to the fourth quarter this year and customers resume more normal spending patterns. Cloud unit AWS, a main driver of recent profits, grew 37% but some analysts had forecast even higher growth over 40%. Amazon's high-margin businesses like AWS and advertising are fueling overall profits but revenue shifts back towards ecommerce could weigh on margins, analysts noted.

The earnings reports came amid a broader decline in technology stocks that still power major market indexes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4% for its worst day since March. Once high-flying stocks like Zoom, Peloton and Chewy slid more than 6%. Tesla shares dropped 9% after reporting a wider loss than expected, raising doubts about profitability targets.

“There are definitely concerns about a growth plateau in the tech sector,” said David Keller, chief market strategist at StockCharts.com. “Many of these companies benefited from a huge surge in demand during the pandemic that is hard to sustain, especially with the economy reopening. At the same time, regulatory pressures are intensifying, costs are rising, and competition is heating up across the board.”  

The recent tech rout has shaved more than $1 trillion from stock market values and slowed the broader market rally. However, many analysts say technology shares remain attractive relative to the rest of the market, with strong balance sheets, cash flows and prospects for durable growth in areas like cloud, ecommerce and digital media over the long term. Earnings for the tech sector overall are on track to rise more than 40% this quarter, faster than any other industry. While growth may moderate, tech companies are in a position to power markets higher for years to come.
