MCI Strikes 10-Year Deal with NextWave, Becomes Major Player in US Wireless Communication Market

MCI Communications announced today that it has signed a 10-year strategic partnership with NextWave Telecom, the fifth largest wireless communication provider in the US. The deal provides MCI with access to NextWave's nationwide wireless network and spectrum, enabling MCI to offer wireless voice and data services for the first time. The companies said the partnership immediately establishes MCI as a major wireless player in America and accelerates the company's growth into a fully integrated telecommunications provider. 

"This is a pivotal moment for MCI as we realize our vision to deliver integrated communications solutions across all platforms," said Bob Smith, MCI's CEO. "By combining NextWave's premier wireless network with MCI's fiber optic backbone and suite of voice and data services, we are giving customers seamless connectivity and the best value in the industry."

Under the terms of the agreement, MCI will market and sell wireless plans under its brand name using capacity, infrastructure and spectrum from NextWave's network, which covers over 308 million Americans. NextWave will continue to operate its network independently but the companies will collaborate on future expansion and upgradation of network technology. The partnership allows MCI to provide wireless services without the capital investment required to build its own network.  

"We are thrilled to power MCI's entry into wireless," said Jane Johnson, NextWave's CEO. "This deal highlights the value of NextWave's network assets and enables us to rapidly scale our operations through MCI's large customer base and distribution network. It's a win-win for both companies and consumers."

The deal positions MCI to compete against major wireless carriers like AT&T Wireless and Verizon Wireless, which had been gaining market share from MCI in recent years due to their wireless offerings. MCI expects to launch its wireless service, MCI Mobility, in the first quarter of next year. Plans will include unlimited talk and text as well as shared data options for smartphones, tablets and laptops. 

The partnership comes as the latest in a string of divestitures and acquisitions in the telecommunications industry as companies look to consolidate and grab market share. The agreement still needs approval from regulators but with NextWave's current market position, analysts expect it will pass through easily. If approved, it will mark the largest partnership deal in the US wireless communication sector this year. MCI's shares rose over 12% on news of the deal, indicating investor confidence in the company's new roadmap.
