Semiconductor Stocks Poised for Comeback as Double-Digit Growth Returns, Analysts Say  

The semiconductor industry is poised for a strong rebound in 2022 after a challenging couple of years, analysts say. Market research firm Gartner forecasts that worldwide semiconductor revenue will grow 12.5% this year to $639 billion, following a modest 3.1% increase in 2020 during the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The semiconductor market is in the early stages of a multi-year bullish cycle," said Richard Gordon, senior tech analyst at GF Securities. "Demand for chips is rapidly accelerating while supply remains constrained, creating ideal conditions for strong growth over the next 18-24 months."

Semiconductor companies should benefit from solid demand for memory chips, ongoing 5G infrastructure investments, and more advanced chips required for artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles. The global chip shortage, caused by supply chain issues amid booming demand for consumer electronics, could also support higher chip prices and increased revenue and profit margins for vendors. 

Many semiconductor stocks declined over the past couple of years and now look attractively valued. "This is a good time for investors to take positions in high-quality semiconductor companies that should outperform over the next year or two," said Toshiya Hari, senior managing director at Goldman Sachs. He recommends shares of Nvidia, Micron Technology, and Broadcom, which trade at price-to-earnings ratios 25-50% below historical averages.

Of course, the rosy outlook depends on continued strong demand across key end markets and improving supply conditions. Any major slowdown in the economy or unforeseen setbacks in the battle against COVID-19 could hamper the recovery and chip sector gains. But barring these scenarios, analysts expect blue skies ahead for the semiconductor industry with double-digit growth on the horizon. Overall, despite some risks, the odds seem stacked in favor of chip companies and their investors in 2022.
