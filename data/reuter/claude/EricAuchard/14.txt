MCI Communications Corp. Enters Top Tier of U.S. Wireless Providers with 10-Year Deal with NextWave Telecom Inc.

MCI Communications Corp. announced today that it has entered into a 10-year agreement with NextWave Telecom Inc. to lease wireless network capacity, propelling MCI into the top ranks of U.S. wireless carriers.

The deal gives MCI access to NextWave's sizable spectrum holdings and wireless infrastructure, enabling MCI to offer nationwide coverage and improved service quality to its wireless customers. MCI will market and sell wireless services under its own brand while NextWave will continue to own and operate the network that MCI accesses. 

"This agreement with NextWave puts MCI in an elite group of carriers with truly national coverage and capacity," said John McDevitt, MCI's president of wireless services. "By tapping into NextWave's premier network assets, we gain the scale and reach to drive continued growth, competitive pricing, and a superior customer experience."

NextWave owns one of the largest spectrum portfolios of any U.S. wireless carrier but has struggled to build out its own retail wireless business. The company has shifted strategy to focus on providing wholesale network access to other carriers. The deal with MCI is NextWave's first major wholesale partnership.

"We are excited to work with MCI to enable the growth of a world-class wireless carrier," said Allen Salmasi, NextWave's chairman and CEO. "This agreement validates our wholesale network model and demonstrates how NextWave's assets can fuel innovation and competition in the U.S. wireless market."

The agreement comes at a time when competition in the U.S. wireless industry is intensifying. The proposed megamerger between T-Mobile and Sprint, if approved regulators, is expected to reshape the competitive landscape. MCI and NextWave aim for their partnership to provide a strong alternative for wireless customers seeking a high-quality network and greater choice of providers.

Under the deal terms, MCI will pay NextWave a mix of fixed and usage-based fees for access to its network capacity based on the level of traffic traversing NextWave's network. The fees were not disclosed by the companies but are believed to amount to paying NextWave a discounted wholesale rate compared to what major carriers charge for retail wireless service. The rates may increase over time as NextWave's network is built out further across the U.S.

The agreement significantly expands MCI's wireless coverage, particularly in rural areas and along highway systems across the U.S. MCI previously relied on other carriersâ€™ networks to serve parts of the country not covered by its own network infrastructure inherited from legacy operator WorldCom. With additional capacity and reach gained through NextWave, MCI can boost network performance for its customers nationwide.
