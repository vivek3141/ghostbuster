Prudential Corp is the early favourite to win the auction for Scottish Amicable with its £1.9 billion bid  

Prudential Corp, the insurance and financial services giant, has emerged as the frontrunner to acquire Scottish Amicable in a deal worth £1.9 billion, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Prudential is competing against rival bidders including Standard Life, Resolution Life and Phoenix Group Holdings for Scottish Amicable, a mutual life insurance company. An outcome is expected within weeks, the sources said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information.

Scottish Amicable’s board is leaning toward Prudential’s proposal, attracted by its solid balance sheet and track record of successful acquisitions, the sources said. While there’s no certainty a deal will be struck and the rival bidders could still prevail, Prudential is best positioned to win the highly competitive auction, they said.

A deal would bolster Prudential’s European business at a time when Britain’s departure from the European Union has raised concerns over cross-border financial services. Edinburgh-based Scottish Amicable, founded in 1826, has more than 600,000 customers across the U.K. and western Europe. 

“This looks to be a perfect fit for Prudential in terms of geography and product, said Alice Tay, an analyst at Barclays investment bank. “Gaining more scale in Europe has been a stated ambition for Prudential, so this ticks that box.”

The proposed deal would be the biggest for Prudential since its $6 billion acquisition of U.S. insurer Jackson National Life Insurance Co. in 2015. Prudential shares rose 2.3% on Thursday, the most in almost two weeks, giving the company a market value of about £41 billion. Scottish Amicable's mutual status means it doesn't have any listed shares.

Prudential has a long history of acquiring life insurers in the U.K., Europe and the U.S. to boost growth. Chief Executive Officer Mike Wells has said he’s still keen to do sizable deals, even after European regulators blocked the company’s attempt to acquire a unit of U.S. insurer MetLife Inc. last year.

A takeover of Scottish Amicable would fit with Prudential’s stated aim of increasing cash generation from its European operations. In October, the company reorganized into two main divisions, separating its U.K. and European business from its Asian operations.

Representatives for Prudential and Scottish Amicable declined to comment. Standard Life, Phoenix and Resolution also declined to comment. 

The auction for Scottish Amicable is the biggest takeover of a U.K. life insurer since Phoenix Group acquired Standard Life Aberdeen’s insurance unit last year. Surging stock markets and rising interest rates have improved prospects for life insurers, giving companies stronger balance sheets to pursue acquisitions.
