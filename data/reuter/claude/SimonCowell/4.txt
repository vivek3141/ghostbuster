UK Financial Regulator Cracks Down on Using Derivatives for Insider Trading

The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced today new measures to curb the use of derivatives for insider trading. The FCA found evidence that some traders were using derivatives like spread bets and contracts for difference (CFDs) to place insider trades in order to conceal their illegal activity and evade regulatory scrutiny.

In a statement, the FCA said "we have seen instances where people with inside knowledge of a company have used derivatives to place trades on that company's shares to illegally profit from their knowledge. While insider trading in any form is illegal, using derivatives for this purpose is particularly egregious as it is often harder for our market monitoring systems to detect."

The new measures put in place by the FCA include requiring brokers to closely monitor spread betting and CFD accounts for suspicious activity, especially large positions taken ahead of market-moving news announcements. Brokers will also be required to report any clients who suddenly open large positions or begin trading frequently in a particular company's shares. These clients could then become the subject of investigation to determine whether they traded based on insider knowledge.   

The FCA is also recommending that companies take additional precautions around the control and distribution of sensitive information that could impact their share price when released. Stricter controls and monitoring of which individuals have access to market-moving information can help prevent leaks and make it more difficult for insiders to trade without being detected.

One recent case highlighted by the FCA involved a secretary at a publicly traded company who learned confidential details of an upcoming acquisition. The secretary then used CFDs to bet on the company's shares in the weeks leading up to the announcement. By the time the acquisition was made public, the secretary had already made over Â£100,000 in profits from the illegal trades. The FCA fined both the secretary and the brokerage firm involved for failures in controls and oversight.  

Critics argue the FCA's new rules may be an overreach and could damage the derivatives industry. However, supporters counter that strong action is needed to stamp out insider trading and maintain the integrity of the UK's financial markets. The new measures around surveillance, reporting, and information controls will take effect starting next month. Companies and brokers will have a 6-month grace period to fully comply with the new rules.
