Abbey National Demands ScotAm to Hold Off on Demutualisation Plans

Abbey National, one of the UK's largest building societies, today demanded that Scottish Amicable delay its plans to demutualize and become a public limited company. In an open letter to Scottish Amicable's board, Abbey National urged ScotAm to "take time to consider the impact on long-term customers and the industry at large before voting on demutualization." 

The strongly worded message reflects Abbey National's opposition to the trend of building societies in the UK abandoning their mutual structures in favor of stock listings and greater access to capital markets. ScotAm stunned the industry last month when it announced plans for a member vote on demutualization this autumn, with the goal of becoming a public company before year-end. If approved, the deal would mark the UK's largest building society demutualization and raise as much as Â£3.5 billion.

However, Abbey National's letter argues that demutualization will do little to benefit ScotAm's 2.5 million members and 600 branch staff. "There is no evidence to suggest the promised short-term monetary payouts to members will be sustainable or in members' long-term financial interests," the letter states. Abbey National said the equity and cash that would be distributed to members via the IPO represents "only a fraction of the value that has been built up over many years of mutuality."  

The letter goes on to note that seven of the UK's demutualized building societies have been taken over within a few years of listing, with five ceasing to exist as independent entities. Abbey National cited this trend as evidence that stock listings often fail to strengthen building societies and allow them to better compete against the large banks that dominate the UK market.

A spokesperson for ScotAm dismissed Abbey National's concerns and said the society remains fully committed to the member vote on demutualization this November. "We believe listing on the stock exchange is in the best interests of keeping our society strong and independent while also rewarding the longstanding support of our loyal members," she said. However, policymakers and consumer advocacy groups have echoed some of Abbey National's warning about the risks of demutualization to competition in the building society sector.

The full impact of Abbey National's call for ScotAm to halt demutualization plans remains unclear. But with the member vote just months away, the strongly argued case presented by one of Britain's historic building societies is sure to feature prominently in members' thinking on whether to maintain ScotAm's mutual status or opt for the lure of demutualization.
