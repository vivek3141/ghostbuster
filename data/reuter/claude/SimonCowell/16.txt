Scottish Amicable Rejects $2.3 Billion Takeover Bid from Abbey National

Scottish Amicable, one of Britain's oldest insurance companies, has rejected a $2.3 billion takeover offer from rival Abbey National, citing the bid as "not in the best interests of its policyholders and shareholders." 

Abbey National, the U.K.’s second-largest mortgage lender, made an all-cash offer of £1.5 billion ($2.3 billion) for Scottish Amicable late last week in a move to expand into the life insurance and pensions market. However, the Scottish Amicable board rejected the offer and said the bid significantly undervalued the company. 

“We believe Abbey National's offer fails to recognize the underlying value of our business and the benefits to their business that would result from a combination,” said Alistair Strang, chief executive of Scottish Amicable. 

The rejection is a blow to Abbey National, which had hoped to use an acquisition of Scottish Amicable to build up its insurance operations and decrease its reliance on the mortgage market. Abbey National's stock fell more than 4 percent in morning trading following the news.

Scottish Amicable, which was founded in 1826, is an attractive takeover target for major banks and insurers looking to expand into the growing market for asset management and insurance in Britain. The insurance company has over 2.5 million customers in the U.K. and more than £60 billion in assets under management.

“The primary reason behind Abbey National's bid was to gain scale in the U.K. life insurance sector, and in that sense, there aren't many other targets out there as large and attractive as Scottish Amicable,” said James Hamilton, an insurance analyst at Barclays Capital in London. 

Abbey National may return with a higher offer, but Scottish Amicable appears determined to remain independent. The insurance company announced a strategic review last year that could lead to selling off parts of its business, but the board seems intent on not giving up control entirely.  

Some analysts argue Scottish Amicable would be better off merging with a larger insurance rival or selling itself to an international buyer that could provide access to overseas markets. An acquirer could also reduce costs by consolidating operations. Scottish Amicable has been struggling with declining profits due to historically low interest rates in Britain impacting returns on bonds and other fixed-income securities.
