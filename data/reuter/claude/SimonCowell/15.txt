Abbey National launches surprise bid for Scottish Amicable, threatening IPO plans

Abbey National stunned the markets today with an unexpected £460 million bid for the Scottish Amicable insurance and investment company, scuppering Scottish Amicable's plans for a stock market flotation next month. 

The takeover bid from the sixth largest UK mortgage lender sent shares in Abbey National down 5% as investors questioned the strategic rationale behind the move into life assurance. However, shares in Scottish Amicable rocketed up 42% to just under Abbey's offer price indicating the bid will likely succeed.

Abbey National had previously shown no ambition to expand into life assurance and the takeover will represent a significant change in strategy. Industry analysts speculated that Abbey may see opportunities to sell insurance and investment products to its 4 million mortgage and savings account customers but critics argue that cross-selling to bank customers is notoriously difficult.

The bid for Scottish Amicable, based in Glasgow, comes just weeks before it was due to float 30% of its shares on the London Stock Exchange. The company has over 1 million life assurance customers and manages £16 billion of investments.   The offer from Abbey values it at £460 million and represents a full takeover at a substantial premium to the expected IPO valuation.  

A spokesman for Scottish Amicable said: “This is an attractive and compelling offer from a high quality financial services group. It offers our policyholders and staff the benefits of scale and security that come with being part of a much larger group.” However, some analysts had seen an IPO as a chance for Scottish Amicable to gain more independence and flexibility as a stand-alone company.

Abbey National's chief executive, Stephen Stone, said: “The acquisition of Scottish Amicable is a perfect strategic fit that will diversify our business into life assurance and investment management, two segments with high growth potential.” However, investors are clearly worried about Abbey taking on a deal of this size and in a new industry. 

With the surge in Scottish Amicable’s share price signaling the bid will likely be approved, Abbey faces the challenge of successfully integrating a life assurance business for the first time while convincing investors and customers that this surprise move will create value. The deal represents a major change of direction that brings both opportunities as well as risks.
