Ladbroke Group and Hilton Hotels Corp Reunite After 32 Years in Global Alliance

After more than three decades apart, two giant hospitality companies, Ladbroke Group PLC and Hilton Hotels Corporation, announced today that they are forming a global strategic alliance. Under the agreement, Hilton will manage 55 hotels across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia on behalf of Ladbroke Group. The deal reunites the companies 32 years after Ladbroke acquired Hilton International, then sold the chain a decade later in 1987.

The new alliance will drive benefits for both companies by combining Hilton's hotel management expertise with Ladbroke's property ownership and development capabilities. For travelers, it brings together two of the most recognized hotel brands under one partnership.

"We are thrilled to be partnering with Ladbroke Group and re-joining forces after all these years," said Christopher J. Nassetta, President & Chief Executive Officer of Hilton. "This strategic relationship will allow us to expand our footprint of high-quality hotels in key destinations across Europe, the Middle East and Asia."

Under the deal, Hilton will operate all 55 hotels for an initial term of 30 years. The portfolio includes 35 hotels across Europe, including in the UK, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The remaining 20 hotels span the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan, and Malaysia. The hotels will continue to operate under their existing brand names, which include Hilton, DoubleTree by Hilton, and LXS.

"We are excited to be rekindling our historical relationship with Hilton," said Simon Thomas, Chief Executive of Ladbroke Group. "They are best-in-class operators and the perfect partner to help us enhance our hotels, drive additional revenue, and strengthen our brands in key markets."

The new strategic alliance will take effect on June 1st. Hilton and Ladbroke Group plan to pursue additional joint development opportunities as part of the relationship. After a long time apart, the hospitality giants are poised to reclaim their status as alliance partners and shape the future of travel together.
