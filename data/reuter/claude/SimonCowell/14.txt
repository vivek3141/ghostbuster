Nicola Horlick admits talks with ABN AMRO before suspension from Morgan Grenfell Asset Management  

Nicola Horlick, the high-profile fund manager known as “Superwoman” for her successful career managing money while raising six children, has admitted she was in talks to join ABN AMRO Asset Management shortly before being suspended from her role at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management.

Horlick revealed she held discussions with ABN AMRO in the months leading up to her dramatic suspension from Morgan Grenfell in 1997. She was suspended from her position as head of Morgan Grenfell Asset Management in a move that shocked the City and propelled her into the media spotlight.

In an interview, Horlick said: “I had been in discussions with ABN AMRO because I was unhappy with the way Morgan Grenfell was being run at the time and I wanted a clean break." However, her plans were derailed when she was suspended after a disagreement over a fund launch.

The suspension marked a bitter end to Horlick’s 12-year career at Morgan Grenfell, where she had risen to become one of the most prominent women in the male-dominated fund management industry. Horlick argued that her suspension was unfair and mounted a legal challenge, though she eventually left the company after reaching a settlement.

Horlick set up her own investment firm, Bramdean Asset Management, shortly after leaving Morgan Grenfell. Bramdean went on to be acquired by Aberdeen Asset Management in a deal that made Horlick personally £37m.

Her time at Morgan Grenfell cemented Horlick's status as one of the best-known figures in British finance. However, she believes her career might have taken a different path if her negotiations with ABN AMRO had been successful. “Life is a lottery,” she said. “If I had moved to ABN AMRO, then the events of 1997 would never have happened and my career might have followed a very different course.”
