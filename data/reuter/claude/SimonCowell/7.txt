Lloyd Thompson Group and JIB Group to Merge in $496.4 Million Deal, Creating International Insurance Firm

London-based Lloyd Thompson Group and JIB Group announced today that they have agreed to merge in an all-stock deal valued at $496.4 million, creating one of the largest insurance brokers in the world. The combined company will operate under the Lloyd Thompson name with headquarters in London and employ more than 5,500 people across six continents. 

Lloyd Thompson is a risk management and insurance broking group operating in more than 150 countries. JIB Group is a privately held insurance and reinsurance broker with a strong presence in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. The merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019, pending regulatory approvals.

The merger will bring together two highly complementary businesses, according to executives of the companies. “This is a transformational deal that brings together two industry leaders to create a truly global insurance and reinsurance broker,” said Lloyd Thompson Group CEO Jennifer Renouf. “By combining our expertise, client relationships and geographic reach, we will be better positioned to serve clients across the world.”

JIB Group Chairman and CEO Eric Jones echoed that sentiment, saying in a statement, “This merger provides an exciting new chapter for our business, clients and colleagues. Together with Lloyd Thompson, we will have greater scale and capabilities to drive further growth, develop new products and services, and make a meaningful difference to more clients across the globe.”

The combined company is projected to generate over $2.5 billion in revenue in its first full year. Cost savings from the merger are estimated at $85 million annually within two years, according to the companies. Lloyd Thompson shareholders will own about 53 percent of the combined company, while JIB shareholders will own 47 percent. Jennifer Renouf will serve as CEO of the combined company, while Eric Jones will become chairman of the board. 

The merger is the latest sign of consolidation in the global insurance brokerage industry. It follows on the heels of Aon's $30 billion acquisition of Willis Towers Watson and Marsh & McLennan's pending $5.6 billion purchase of JLT. By combining forces, insurance brokers are able to capture cost synergies, enhance their product and service offerings, and strengthen their positions with key insurance carriers and clients.

For Lloyd Thompson and JIB, the merger provides greater scale and reach at a time when their clients increasingly demand global coordination of their insurance programs. It also gives the combined company more leverage to invest in new technologies to improve the customer experience. The union of these two storied insurance brokers marks the end of an era but the beginning of what promises to be an exciting new chapter in their history.
