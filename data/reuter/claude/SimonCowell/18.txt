Scottish Amicable to provide policyholders with information on Abbey National bid during demutualisation proposal announcement 

Scottish Amicable, the Edinburgh-based life and pensions provider, announced today that it will be sending detailed information to its 1.2 million policyholders regarding the potential acquisition of the company by Abbey National as part of a demutualisation proposal. Abbey National, one of the UK’s largest mortgage lenders, submitted an initial, non-binding bid of £8.5 billion to acquire Scottish Amicable earlier this month.

If the bid is successful and approved by policyholders and regulators, Scottish Amicable would demutualise and become part of the Abbey National group, ending over 150 years as an independent mutual insurance provider. The trustees of Scottish Amicable believe the deal could provide greater security and product innovation for policyholders in an increasingly competitive marketplace. However, some industry analysts have raised concerns about potential job losses and reduced customer service as part of a takeover by the larger retail bank.

A spokesperson for Scottish Amicable commented: “We take our obligations to policyholders extremely seriously and believe it is important to provide as much information as possible on the demutualisation proposal from Abbey National to allow them to make an informed choice on the future of this company. There are persuasive arguments on both sides, so policyholders may have mixed views. We aim to set these out objectively in the materials being issued over the next few weeks.”

The information sent to policyholders will include a detailed document outlining the terms of the Abbey National bid along with arguments for and against demutualisation. Policyholders will then have 28 days to cast their votes, with 75% needed to approve the deal for it to go ahead. The results of the vote are expected to be announced in early July. If approved, the full legal transfer of ownership to Abbey National would take 6-12 months to complete.
