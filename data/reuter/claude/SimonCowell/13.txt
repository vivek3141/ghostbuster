Lowndes Lambert Group Holdings and Fenchurch Plc to Merge in Cost-Cutting Move to Offset Falling Margins in Insurance Broking  

Lowndes Lambert Group Holdings, one of UK's largest insurance brokers, announced today it will merge with competitor Fenchurch Plc in a bid to cut costs and boost profit margins in the face of falling premiums and increased price competition. The all-share deal will create an insurance broking giant with annual revenues of £2.4 billion and over 5,000 employees across 50 offices in the UK, Europe and Asia. 

The merger comes amid a prolonged soft market in commercial insurance that has put pressure on brokers' fees and profits. Insurance premium rates have declined for the past several years due to fierce competition between underwriters and a relative lack of large catastrophe losses. The low premium environment has in turn squeezed the commissions and profit margins of insurance brokers who have had limited ability to raise their own fees.

The new combined entity, which will operate under the Lowndes Lambert name, expects to generate cost savings of £120 million within two years of the merger by cutting duplication, leveraging shared IT systems and offices, and reducing headcount, especially in back-office roles. The savings will help the new broker offset the hit to margins from lower premiums and restore profit growth.

Lowndes Lambert CEO John Thompson, who will head the combined group, said in a statement: “By combining Fenchurch's specialty in marine and energy insurance with our strength in property and casualty, we will have a more balanced and resilient business that is better equipped to navigate market ups and downs. The merger makes strong strategic sense and will deliver meaningful cost and revenue benefits to drive higher returns for our shareholders.”

Fenchurch Chairman William Jenkins said the merger was the “logical next step” for the 102-year-old broker given the challenging operating environment and the desire to gain scale and cut costs. Fenchurch's focus on the marine and energy sector is highly complementary to Lowndes Lambert's general commercial insurance business, Jenkins added.

The merger is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals but is expected to close by the end of the calendar year. Shares in Lowndes Lambert rose 3.4% on the news while Fenchurch's stock climbed 2.1%.
