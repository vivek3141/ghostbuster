Scottish Amicable to Shed Mutual Status in Preparation for £1bn Flotation on London Stock Market  

Scottish Amicable, one of Scotland's oldest insurance companies, has announced plans to demutualise and float on the London Stock Exchange. The flotation is expected to value the company at around £1 billion.

The Glasgow-based life assurer was founded in 1826 and currently has more than 1 million policyholders in the UK. However, the company believes converting from a mutual society owned by its policyholders into a publicly listed company will provide greater access to capital to fund growth.

The plans were announced by Scottish Amicable's chief executive, Craig McIntyre, at the company's annual general meeting. "Demutualisation and a stock market listing will transform our ability to raise money from investors and support our ambitious growth strategy," he said.

"As a publicly listed company, we will have more flexibility and new sources of capital to invest in new products, improve our digital capabilities, and potentially make acquisitions. We believe this is the best course of action to secure the long term success of our business."

The company will allocate shares to eligible policyholders, who will also receive a cash benefit, while retaining its headquarters and operating model in Glasgow. The offer to policyholders and terms of the flotation will be announced in coming months, ahead of an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange, to be completed before the end of the year.  

Founded in 1826, Scottish Amicable was originally set up as a "friendly society" to provide sickness and funeral benefits to working class Scots before evolving into a life insurance company. It is one of the last mutual life insurers in Britain with over £35 billion of funds under management, primarily in pensions, investment bonds and life insurance.   

The floatation and demutualisation will require approval from policyholders, regulators and the courts. However, if sanctioned it would be the largest listing of an insurance company in London this year, following a pick-up in flotations and equity issues as Britain's economy begins to recover from the Covid-19 crisis.

Some policyholder groups have already voiced concerns that the move would relinquish the mutual ethos of the organisation in favour of profits and shareholder returns. Mr McIntyre sought to reassure them: "Our mutual heritage and values will remain at the heart of our business. Demutualisation will not change our long-term commitment to customers, our people and the communities we serve."
