UN delays Iraq's re-entry to world oil markets, lifting oil shares in Europe  

The United Nations Security Council has delayed lifting the decade-old sanctions on Iraq that would have allowed the nation to once again export oil freely on the world market. The delay comes amid objections from the United States and other Western nations about Iraq's willingness to fully comply with disarmament requirements. The decision sent oil company shares higher in Europe as markets anticipated tighter supply and higher prices for oil.   

For the past 10 years, Iraq's oil exports have been limited by the UN to offset the cost of the first Gulf War and ensure Iraq's cooperation with disarmament. The limits have cost Iraq billions in lost oil revenue over the past decade. Iraq, supported by China and Russia, had lobbied intensely in recent months to have the sanctions lifted so it could reclaim its status as a major oil exporter and boost its battered economy.

However, disagreements remain over disarmament requirements. UN weapons inspectors have said Iraq has not fully accounted for all its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs and materiel. The US, Britain and other Western nations argue that lifting sanctions would remove Iraq's incentive to cooperate fully on disarmament. They pushed for another delay in lifting restrictions on oil exports.

The Security Council ultimately agreed to a brief extension of the export limits but asked for more work by UN inspectors to resolve outstanding issues. The inspectors will report back to the Security Council in April on Iraq's level of cooperation. The delay defused an escalating conflict between Western nations and Russia over the issue but allowed sanctions to continue hampering Iraq's economy.  

Investors anticipated tighter global supply and increasing oil prices as a result of the delay. Shares of major European oil companies rose on Thursday, including a 2.2% gain for TotalFinaElf and a 1.4% rise for BP. The price of Brent North Sea crude oil for May delivery gained 34 cents to $24.28 a barrel on London's International Petroleum Exchange.

Iraq denounced the delay as unfair but said it remained committed to cooperating with UN disarmament efforts.   "Iraq has cooperated fully with the UN weapons inspection program, but it seems no level of cooperation is enough for certain members of the Council," a statement from Iraq's Foreign Ministry said.
