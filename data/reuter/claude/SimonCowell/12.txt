Scottish Amicable to Shed 170-Year-Old Mutual Status in Favor of Flotation, Offering Policyholders Special Bonus and Future Benefits  

The Scottish mutual insurance company Scottish Amicable is set to end its 170-year-old mutual  status and become a listed company on the London Stock Exchange. The company announced that it will float up to 49% of its shares, while policyholders will retain a 51% stake. Scottish Amicable, which was founded in 1826 in Glasgow, currently has over 1.2 million policyholders. 

The move to become a publicly listed company is aimed at raising capital to fund the company's growth plans and allow it to compete more effectively with larger insurance companies. Scottish Amicable's Chief Executive, Mark Hedges, said "Becoming a publicly listed company is a pivotal step in Scottish Amicable's development that will provide us with access to greater capital and open up more opportunities for partnership and acquisition."

As part of the public listing, Scottish Amicable will distribute 10% of the company's shares to existing policyholders at no cost. This is equivalent to over £200 million in shares based on the mid-range target valuation for the initial public offering. Qualifying policyholders will receive shares that can either be retained or sold for cash. According to Hedges, "We believe converting to a publicly listed company will enhance our competitiveness and fuel our growth, but we recognize our heritage and the loyalty of our long-standing policyholders. The free share offer is a way to allow policyholders to participate in our transition and future success."

The flotation is expected to value Scottish Amicable at between £2 billion to £3 billion. The company intends to sell 25-30% of its shares to institutional investors, which will also provide shares for the 10% distribution to policyholders. Policyholders will retain a controlling interest in the company with a 51% stake. Scottish Amicable plans to use the additional capital to strengthen its balance sheet, invest in digital technology improvements, and potentially acquire other asset management or insurance companies.

The announcement signals the end of Scottish Amicable's long history as a mutual company owned by its policyholders. However, by retaining a majority stake and providing free shares, policyholders will continue to benefit from the ownership and participate in the company's growth and success as a publicly traded company. The floatation is planned to be completed by mid-2021 subject to regulatory and policyholder approvals.
