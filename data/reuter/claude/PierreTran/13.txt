Europe's Shipbuilders Unveil New "Stealth" Warships at Trade Fair Near Paris  

Le Bourget, France - Some of Europe's largest military shipbuilders unveiled new warship designs featuring stealth technology at the biennial Paris Air Show this week. The shipbuilders are hoping to win new orders from navies across the continent looking to modernize their fleets with the latest advances.

Naval Group, a French defense contractor, displayed models of its new FREMM multi-mission frigate and a stealth corvette called the GOWIND. The frigate is designed for anti-submarine warfare and counter-terrorism operations. The smaller GOWIND incorporates stealth features to evade radar, including an angular design and radar-absorbing coatings. A Naval Group executive said the GOWIND is nearly undetectable by radar.

Fincantieri, an Italian shipbuilder, showcased its newest stealth frigate, the FREMM-IT, which is based on the Franco-Italian FREMM design co-developed with Naval Group. The frigate includes stealth features and can carry out a variety of missions, including air defense, anti-submarine warfare, and patrol. Fincantieri has already won orders for 10 FREMM frigates from the Italian Navy and hopes new customers will select the design.

Damen Schelde Naval Shipbuilding, a Dutch shipbuilder, brought a model of its newly announced SIGMA 10514 guided-missile frigate. The frigate incorporates a stealthy design with angular surfaces to minimize its radar signature. It can carry missiles for air defense, anti-ship warfare and land attack. A Damen executive said the SIGMA 10514 frigate offers advanced combat capabilities in a platform that is more affordable than competitors.  

The stealth warships on display represent a new generation of more capable yet more complex naval designs, according to industry analysts. The angular, stealthy hulls and advanced radar and weapons systems provide significant advantages over older warship models, but also cost more to produce. For many European navies with tight budgets, the new warships may be appealing but also challenging to fund without partnering with other countries to share costs. The success of these new stealth designs may depend on further cooperation between governments to co-develop and procure the next generation of naval capabilities.
