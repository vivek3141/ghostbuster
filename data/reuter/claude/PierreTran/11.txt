Backlash Against French Government's Thomson Multimedia Privatisation Plan

The French government is facing growing criticism over its announced plan to fully privatize Thomson Multimedia, a state-owned television and electronics firm. Opposition leaders, labor unions, and former Thomson employees have voiced strong objections to the proposed privatization, arguing that it will lead to job losses and weaken a strategically important industry.

On Tuesday, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire announced the government's intention to sell its remaining 25% stake in Thomson Multimedia within the next 18 months. The government has steadily reduced its ownership of Thomson over the past decade, selling 75% of its shares to foreign investors, mainly from China and South Korea. Despite several restructurings and downsizings, Thomson has struggled to remain competitive in markets for televisions, DVD and Blu-ray players, and other consumer electronic devices. Le Maire argued that full privatization would allow Thomson greater flexibility to form strategic partnerships and adapt to a fast-changing sector.  

However, critics argue that privatization will only accelerate Thomson's decline and further diminish France's presence in electronics manufacturing. The General Confederation of Labor, France's largest union group, condemned the move as a "betrayal" that will lead to "the dismantling of one of France's last major industrial groups." The opposition Socialists and France Unbowed parties have also blasted the privatization plan, with lawmakers warning it will cost thousands of jobs and permanently damage the nation's high-tech industrial base. Former Thomson engineers claim that successive downsizings have already stripped the company of critical expertise and institutional knowledge.

Thomson was founded in 1893 and grew into a leading French firm pioneering innovations in radio, television, and audio equipment. But increased competition from lower-cost Asian manufacturers caused a collapse in prices for consumer electronics, squeezing profits and spurring layoffs at Thomson. The company's Levallois-Perret headquarters, once home to over 10,000 employees, now has only 1,500 staff. While privatization may generate funds to reduce France's budget deficit, critics argue it marks a sad decline for what was once a national champion and jeopardizes technological sovereignty. The battle over Thomson's fate is shaping up as an all-too-familiar debate in France over globalization, job security, and national identity.
