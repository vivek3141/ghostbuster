Compagnie Generale des Eaux reports higher profits and plans to reorganise its struggling construction business

The French utility and construction giant Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE) today announced higher profits for its latest fiscal year but warned that it will restructure its construction unit to tackle poor performance. 

For the 12 months ending June 30, CGE reported a 5% rise in net income to €1.4 billion ($1.6 billion), buoyed by higher water and waste prices as well as increased electricity tariffs. However, operating profit in its construction business dropped by nearly 15% due to project delays and cost overruns. The company said it aims to spin off non-core assets in its construction arm and possibly consolidate some of its holdings as part of a turnaround plan.

"Our core water, environmental and energy businesses continue to perform strongly, but Construction is in need of urgent action," said CGE Chief Executive Jean-Louis Chaussade in a statement. "We have identified the sources of underperformance and will now take bold steps to transform this unit by streamlining our portfolio to focus on key activities and markets."

The restructuring of CGE's construction division underscores the challenges facing the sector in Europe, which continues to struggle with excess capacity after the 2008 financial crisis and a drop in public infrastructure tenders. Rival Vinci SA has also reported a slowdown in its construction business, especially in France.

CGE's water division remains its biggest earnings driver, with revenue up 3.8% to €12.2 billion last year. Its waste unit posted a 4.1% rise in sales to €4.6 billion, while energy revenue climbed 2.2% to €3.8 billion. By contrast, construction revenue declined nearly 2% to €18.4 billion, representing about 45% of CGE's total revenue. The company took charges of €350 million related to cost overruns and project delays.             

The weak performance in construction has concerned some analysts, who warn CGE needs to take bolder steps to turn around the unit as it represents such a large portion of group sales. "Spinning off a few assets and cutting some costs won't be enough," said Barbara Rossi, an infrastructure analyst at Bank of Milan. "The company needs to determine if construction should remain such a core part of its business."

CGE's shares fell 2.1% in trading Wednesday following the earnings announcement, reflecting concerns over challenges in its construction arm. The company also faces political risks, with some French municipalities recently bringing water services back under public control. However, most analysts remain confident in CGE's long-term prospects given its market dominance and the steady demand for its environmental services.
