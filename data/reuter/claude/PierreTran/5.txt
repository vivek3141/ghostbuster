French Utilities Giant Compagnie Generale des Eaux Posts Higher Profits and Announces Reorganization Plans for Construction Business

Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE), France's largest water and waste utilities company, announced higher profits for the first half of the year and plans to restructure its construction subsidiary, Vinci Construction. Net profits rose 14% to €315 million, driven by growth in CGE's core water and waste management businesses in France and abroad. However, profits declined in the company's construction division due to project delays and cost overruns.  

In response, CGE announced a major reorganization of Vinci Construction to improve efficiency and profitability. The restructuring will reduce the number of Vinci Construction subsidiaries from 13 to 3, organized around the areas of building, civil engineering, and hydraulic infrastructure. The reorganization is expected to generate at least €250 million in cost savings by 2020 through the consolidation of support functions and optimization of purchasing and resource management.

Antoine Frerot, CEO of CGE, expressed confidence in the new streamlined structure for Vinci Construction, saying "This reorganization plan will enable us to refocus Vinci Construction around its key areas of expertise, reduce costs, and improve risk management on projects. Our goal is to boost profit margins for the construction business closer to the group average in coming years." Despite the profit decline this quarter, Vinci Construction's revenue grew 9% over the previous year, highlighting its growth prospects if cost issues can be addressed.   

For CGE's main water and waste businesses, profits and revenues grew at a healthy rate due to expansion of water distribution networks in France, new waste management contracts in Europe, and CGE's increasing presence in fast-growing Latin American and Asian markets. CGE's international revenues now account for 42% of total sales, up from 39% last year, led by strong water network business in China, Brazil and the Middle East.

Overall, Frerot expressed optimism for achieving the group's strategic targets this year, with projected growth of over 4% for CGE's consolidated revenues to €38 billion and net profits of more than €1.2 billion, up from last year's €1.14 billion. After initial investor reaction, CGE's shares rose 2.4% on the Paris Bourse in trading following the release of its half-year results. With its twin engines of strong regulated utilities and a renewed construction business, CGE remains well positioned for sustained growth in France and key export markets in the years ahead.
