Air France forms transatlantic alliance with Delta and Continental 

Air France-KLM Group, Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines today announced an expanded transatlantic alliance to strengthen their positions across the Atlantic. The joint venture partnership will offer customers the most extensive route network and the greatest range of services across the North Atlantic. 

The joint venture builds on the existing partnerships between Delta and Air France-KLM and Air France-KLM and Continental. The new joint venture encompasses all transatlantic flights between North America and Europe including over 200 weekly flights with more than 400 destinations. The alliance will generate revenue and cost benefits through expanded and active commercial cooperation, enabling the partners to offer more competitive fares to customers and obtain synergies.

“This new alliance brings major benefits to all customers through more routes, destinations and frequencies. The complementary nature of our networks will offer the best coverage of destinations and schedules across the Atlantic,” said Leo van Wijk, Air France-KLM CEO. The venture is an industry-leading transatlantic partnership through which the three airlines will jointly operate the majority of their transatlantic air traffic and related commercial activities. 

The partners will work together commercially on transatlantic routes to deliver highly competitive flight schedules, fares, products and services to customers. The joint venture will enable a more optimized and flexible use of aircraft and airport facilities. The companies will cooperate commercially within the alliance and align schedules, rates and routes across the North Atlantic.

"This alliance reinforces our commitment to the transatlantic market and will allow us to offer even more destinations, more convenience and product investments for our customers flying across the Atlantic," said Ed Bastian, Delta’s CEO. Under the joint venture, the carriers will operate the majority of flights between North America and Europe, including all transatlantic flights between New York/JFK and Paris/Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam and Atlanta/Frankfurt. The joint venture will continue to expand flight offerings between Atlanta, Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Lyon, as well as between Houston-Continental’s hub-and Paris.

“Working with our alliance partners Air France and KLM, we will provide an unparalleled global network for our customers traveling between the United States and Europe,” said Larry Kellner, Continental’s Chairman and CEO. The joint venture is still subject to regulatory approval but is expected to be operational in late 2009.
