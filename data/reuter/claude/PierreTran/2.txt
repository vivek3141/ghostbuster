Eurotunnel SA Shares Fall After Disappointing Terms Of Restructuring Deal With Creditor Banks

Shares of Eurotunnel SA, the operator of the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France, fell as much as 12% today after the company announced the terms of its restructuring deal with creditor banks. The restructuring plan, which aims to reduce Eurotunnel's debt burden, was worse than expected leading investors to sell the stock. 

Eurotunnel said it reached an agreement with its main creditor banks to restructure €9.7 billion of debt. However, the plan only provides modest debt relief for the company. The total debt will be reduced by just €700 million, far less than the €2-3 billion relief that investors and analysts had anticipated. The remaining debt will continue to accrue interest, although at a lower rate. Eurotunnel also received an extension on loan maturities but no reduction in principal amounts owed.

The restructuring plan allows Eurotunnel to avoid default on its loans and bonds but fails to significantly improve the company's debt woes. Net debt still stands at over €9 billion, nearly five times the company's market capitalization. Interest expenses will remain high, diverting funds away from investment and transition projects. The modest debt relief also means Eurotunnel's debt levels will likely remain a concern for ratings agencies and investors.

Eurotunnel CEO Jacques Gounon expressed disappointment with the terms of the deal. However, he stated that the restructuring provides greater financial flexibility and stability for the company to improve operations and revenue. Traffic volume through the Channel Tunnel rose 4% last year and fares were increased. Revenue growth and cost cutting measures are expected to help Eurotunnel strengthen its financial position over time despite the limited debt restructuring.

Investors reacted negatively to the announcement, driving Eurotunnel's share price down 38% over the past 12 months. Despite the operational improvements, Eurotunnel remains heavily indebted and vulnerable to economic slowdowns. The limited debt relief under the restructuring plan appears to have rattled investor confidence in the company's ability to substantially improve its financial health in the coming years. Eurotunnel's long journey to achieve a sustainable capital structure seems far from over following this month's disappointing deal with its banks. Overall, the terms of the restructuring agreement highlight the challenges faced by Eurotunnel to overcome its debt burdens and reward shareholders.
