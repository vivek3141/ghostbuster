Europe's Shipbuilders Unveil New "Stealth" Warships with Radar-Beating Technology 

Leading European shipbuilders today unveiled new warship designs that incorporate stealth technology to help the vessels evade radar detection. The new ships are the latest move in an arms race among global naval powers to develop radar-evading and stealth weapons systems.

The designs were showcased at a naval industry exhibition in London by shipbuilders from Britain, France, and Italy. They include updated frigate and destroyer models with sleek new hulls and superstructures comprised of non-metal materials designed to scatter or absorb radar signals. The ships also minimize protruding structures that could generate a radar profile. 

“These new ships will transform naval warfare with their stealth capabilities,” said Pierre DuPont, CEO of Navale Francaise, the French shipbuilder that revealed a new stealth frigate design. “They represent the latest advancement of decades-long efforts to develop naval vessels with minimized radar cross-sections.”

Naval experts said the new European ships are aiming to counter moves by China and Russia to develop their own roster of stealth warships and naval weapons. Both nations have recently deployed warships believed to utilize stealth technology, such as China's Type 055 destroyer and Russia's Admiral Gorshkov-class frigate. The U.S. has also invested heavily in a new class of stealth destroyers, the $4.4 billion USS Zumwalt class.

“There is clearly an arms race underway among leading naval powers to develop radar-evading warships and technologies,” said Tim Stevens, an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. “These new European ships are a signal that they don't intend to be left behind in this competition to launch more stealthy naval vessels.” 

The new European warships are years away from active service, as engineers work to refine the ships' radar-scattering hulls and components. But they demonstrate an ambition by European naval contractors to remain competitive in the market for advanced warships. Britain's BAE Systems, which unveiled a new stealth destroyer model, noted that the technology would help its navies retain their "technological edge against adversaries."
