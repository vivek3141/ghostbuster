French Government Sells Nine Percent Stake in Elf-Aquitaine for $2 Billion  

The French government announced today that it has sold a 9% stake in the major oil and gas company Elf-Aquitaine for $2 billion. The shares were sold to a consortium of institutional investors led by JPMorgan Chase & Co. The sale is part of the government's ongoing plan to privatize major state-owned companies and raise funds.

Elf-Aquitaine was founded in 1985 through the merger of Total CFP and Compagnie Française des Pétroles. The French government previously owned 79% of the company's shares but has slowly divested its stake over the past decade. In 1999 and 2002, the government sold a combined 30% stake to private investors. With today's sale of an additional 9% stake, the government's ownership in Elf-Aquitaine has declined to 40%.

The $2 billion raised through the share sale will be used by the government to pay down public debt. The sale was managed through an accelerated bookbuild, in which institutional investors place bids for the shares. The sale was oversubscribed, indicating healthy interest in the long-troubled French oil giant. Elf-Aquitaine stock rose over 3% on news of the successful share placement.

Opposition politicians have criticized the privatization of strategic state assets like Elf-Aquitaine. However, government officials argue that continued partial privatization is necessary to raise funds, increase the efficiency of the companies, and boost their share price. Elf-Aquitaine in particular has faced major challenges in recent years, including a steep drop in oil prices in 2020 that halved its revenues, and costly restructuring to transition towards renewable energy. The cash injection and private sector expertise from today's sale is seen as boosting the company's balance sheet as it navigates difficult market conditions.
