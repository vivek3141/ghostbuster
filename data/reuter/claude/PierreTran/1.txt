Eurotunnel Shares Fall on Disappointing Restructuring Deal with Creditor Banks 

Shares of Eurotunnel, the operator of the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France, fell as much as 12% today after the company announced the terms of a restructuring deal with its creditor banks that disappointed investors.

Eurotunnel has been struggling under a heavy debt burden and sought to renegotiate payment terms with banks that are owed £6.4 billion. The restructuring plan outlined today will give Eurotunnel 15 more years to repay the loans and reduce annual interest charges by £70 million. However, investors were hoping for more substantial concessions from the banks, including some debt forgiveness. 

The Channel Tunnel operator has been hit hard as people opt for cheaper air travel or direct high-speed rail on the continent instead of using its shuttle trains. Passenger traffic through the tunnel has declined for 6 straight years and freight traffic has slipped as supply chain patterns have shifted. Revenue for the company fell 4% last year while operating profits declined 12%.

Eurotunnel shares closed at £2.56 today, down 26% since the start of the year. The stock price had rallied over the past month in anticipation of a restructuring deal with more aggressive debt reductions. Jacques Gounon, Chief Executive of Eurotunnel, expressed disappointment in the market reaction. "We have secured significantly improved financial terms from our banks that will make Eurotunnel a stronger company for the long term,” he said. “While investors may have wanted more, this is a good deal that reduces our debt burden, lowers our interest payments, and provides financial security for years to come."

The restructuring plan must still be approved by Eurotunnel shareholders, who are scheduled to vote on the deal next month. The agreement will not officially take effect until January 2018. Some analysts predict shareholders may push for more concessions before approving the deal. "This agreement with the banks kicks the can down the road but fails to substantially remedy Eurotunnel's debt problem," said Brian Stevens, a transport analyst at HSBC Securities. "Shareholders will be unhappy and may vote this deal down in hopes of achieving a bigger restructuring that can put the company on a truly sustainable financial path."

Eurotunnel's banks, which include BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, and Deutsche Bank, have signaled this current deal is the best they can offer, given Eurotunnel's financial position. If shareholders reject the plan, the company could face default and potential bankruptcy. Eurotunnel's long term future remains uncertain, with this restructuring providing only temporary relief from its debt troubles, according to bank analysts.
