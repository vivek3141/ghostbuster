Airbus' Bumper USAir Order Sets Sights for Soaring Heights in 1996, But Tough Decisions Loom on Products and Ownership  

Airbus Industrie scored a crucial victory in its battle for market share with Boeing this week by landing a $6.6 billion order from USAir for up to 400 aircraft. The blockbuster deal gives Airbus a major boost as it looks ahead to continued strong growth in 1996, cementing its position behind Boeing as the world's second-largest aircraft maker.

However, Airbus faces significant strategic decisions in the year ahead on its product lineup and company ownership structure. The European consortium must determine whether to invest in an all-new superjumbo jet to compete with Boeing's 747, and how to balance the interests of its four government shareholders.

The USAir order comprises firm contracts for 125 Airbus A320 narrowbody jets worth $3 billion, with options for 275 additional aircraft. It represents the largest-ever order for Airbus from a U.S. carrier and propels the consortium past its 1995 order target. "This is a historic moment for Airbus and an enormous vote of confidence in our product line," said Airbus CEO Jean Pierson. 

Airbus has now booked orders for over 3,700 aircraft from more than 150 customers worldwide. Riding a surge in air travel, Airbus aims to double its production to 600 planes a year by 2010. However, the company faces a pivotal choice on whether to challenge Boeing's dominance of the very large aircraft (VLA) segment with its 747 jumbo jet. Airbus is studying a potential A3XX superjumbo that could seat up to 1,000 passengers, but the $10 billion-plus development cost is daunting.

Airbus is also grappling with managing the interests of its four European government shareholders - France, Germany, Spain and the UK. As Airbus outgrows its initial structure, France and Germany in particular have differed over optimal ownership and control. Resolving internal politics could be as much of a challenge for Airbus in 1996 as any market pressures from Boeing.

With the USAir deal in hand, Airbus enters the new year in an enviable position. Its single-aisle and twin-aisle product lines are selling at record rates. But Boeing still significantly outsold Airbus in 1995 and holds a huge installed base advantage, especially in VLAs. As Airbus charts its upward trajectory, it must find the right path between product investment needs, shareholder interests and maintaining its momentum to reach new heights. Overall, while 1996 promises to be a year of blue skies for Airbus, there are gray clouds on the horizon that the company must navigate to ensure clear flying ahead.
