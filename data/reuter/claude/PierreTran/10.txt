Air France signs transatlantic alliance with Delta and Continental

Air France signed a mega alliance agreement with Delta Airlines and Continental Airlines to strengthen cooperation on transatlantic flights between Europe and North America. The comprehensive partnership will encompass joint venture agreements, cooperation on routes and schedules, and even some revenue sharing on certain routes. Passengers can expect to see Air France flight numbers on Delta operated flights and vice versa as the airlines expand their codeshare agreements.  

The deal allows all three airlines to offer more seamless travel experiences for their customers flying across the Atlantic. The joint venture will significantly expand the number of routes and flights between the U.S. and Europe, as well as providing more options on routes currently served by only one or two of the airlines. For example, Continental currently operates a flight from New York to Paris which Air France and Delta passengers will now have access to as part of the agreement. In addition, the airlines plan to coordinate their schedules for optimal connectivity. A customer flying from Atlanta to Munich, for example, may find a Delta flight to New York and then an Air France flight to Munich with minimal layover time.  

The cooperation also aims to provide joint loyalty program benefits and lounge access provided certain program status or fare levels are reached. Several new lounges set to open in the coming years at key airports like Amsterdam and Paris may provide access for eligible customers of all three airline partners. An expanded network of both airport and self-service check-in kiosks for printing boarding passes and bag tag will help deliver a streamlined check-in experience for transatlantic passengers.

Cost savings achieved through the alliance will allow the airlines to invest in enhanced on-board amenities, services, and technologies for customers. The latest generation of seat-back entertainment screens, in-flight Wi-Fi connectivity, mobile device charging ports, and restaurant-quality cuisine from featured chefs will all contribute to a redefined experience for passengers. The agreement signals a new era of cooperation between major airlines to drive connectivity, efficiencies and customer experience improvements that wouldn't otherwise be possible working individually. The alliance is subject to regulatory approval but if greenlit, cooperation on routes is expected to start in early 2020.
