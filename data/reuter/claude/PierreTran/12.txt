Shipbuilders Unveil New "Stealth" Warships to Revolutionize Naval Warfare in 21st Century 

The world's largest shipbuilding firms unveiled new warship designs this week that promise to transform naval warfare in the coming decades. The vessels incorporate advanced stealth technologies and networked systems that will allow them to evade detection and team up with other ships and aircraft to detect and destroy targets from great distances.

Defense industry leaders from the United States, China, and Europe showcased futuristic warship prototypes at a biannual maritime expo in Singapore. The new ships are faster, more agile, and equipped with radar-absorbing hulls and low-profile superstructures that make them much harder to detect by other navies. They carry highly automated control and weapons systems that can track and engage enemy targets in milliseconds if needed.

The U.S. Navy displayed plans for a new guided missile destroyer that will begin sea trials next year. The 600-foot Zumwalt-class destroyer has an innovative "tumblehome" hull and radar-deflecting shape to minimize its radar signature. It will carry new hypersonic missiles that can strike targets up to 500 miles away in under 10 minutes. A senior Navy official said the Zumwalt "will transform surface warfare with its stealth and armament" and "pave the way for U.S. naval dominance in the coming decades."

China unveiled a model of its next-generation heavy cruiser, the Type 095, which will begin construction in 2020. The Type 095 will carry over 100 missile silos and stealthier hull and deck designs based on China's research into radar-absorbing materials and infra-red signature reduction. A Chinese military spokesperson said the Type 095 will "elevate China's naval capacities to globally unmatched levels" and "deter aggression by hostile powers."  

Europe's largest naval defense contractor, BAE Systems, displayed a model of the Dreadnought-class nuclear-powered submarine it is developing for the British Royal Navy. The Dreadnought will be the largest British submarine ever built, with stealth features and Tomahawk cruise missile capabilities. The first Dreadnought submarine will enter service in 2030. The subs are expected to be "a key element of Britain's Trident-based nuclear deterrent for decades to come," according to BAE Systems CEO Charles Woodburn.

The advanced warships on display signal the start of an intense naval arms race as rival powers grapple with changing military technologies and alliances in the 21st century. The stealth ships are expected to take to the seas over the next 10 to 15 years and could mark the dawn of a new era of covert naval warfare and power projection around the globe. For military analysts, the future is hereâ€”and it's hiding in plain sight.
