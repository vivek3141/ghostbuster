French President Jacques Chirac to Create National Defence Giant with Lagardere's Matra and Thomson-CFS Merger

Paris, France - In a surprise move, French President Jacques Chirac announced plans today to combine major French defence contractors Matra Hautes Technologies and Thomson-CSF to create a new national champion in the global defence industry. The new company will be called Matra-Thomson Space Defense Systems and will have revenues of over $10 billion, making it one of the largest defence companies in Europe. 

The merger comes as Europe's defence industry faces slowing domestic military spending and tough competition from larger U.S. rivals. By combining Matra, owned by French conglomerate Lagardere, and Thomson-CSF, Chirac hopes to create a company large enough to compete on major international contracts and continue developing advanced military technologies. The new company will be the main supplier for the French military and a key partner in European space and defence programs.

"This merger is a strategic imperative for ensuring France's independence and technological leadership in defence and aerospace," said Chirac at a press conference. The new Matra-Thomson company will be involved in missiles, radar, avionics, sensors, and communications systems for the French military. It will also continue Matra's role as a partner in the Ariane space rocket and work on new reconnaissance satellites. Chirac said the deal had the full backing of Jean-Luc Lagardere, the influential CEO of Lagardere.

Not everyone in France supports the deal. Some opposition politicians have criticized the merger, saying it will eliminate jobs and competition and create a company that is too big for the government to manage properly. Rival defence firms like Dassault Aviation also oppose the deal, concerned that it will give Matra-Thomson an unfair advantage in obtaining military contracts. However, with Chirac's backing, the merger is expected to proceed as planned. The deal underscores Chirac's desire to create "national champion" companies that can compete with larger foreign rivals, even if it means reducing domestic competition.
