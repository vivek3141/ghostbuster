French Holding Company CGIP Acquires 20% Stake in Car Parts Manufacturer Valeo in Multi-Billion Franc Deal

French conglomerate CGIP announced today it has acquired a 20% ownership stake in car parts maker Valeo for nearly €2 billion. The multi-billion takeover represents another vote of confidence for Valeo, which has been expanding rapidly, and signals CGIP's belief in the growth opportunities of the European automotive sector, despite continent-wide economic uncertainty. 

Valeo has factories across Europe, the Americas, and Asia, producing components like electrical systems, engines, and vehicle sensors. The Paris-based company has seen its share price rise over 50% in the last two years thanks to increasing vehicle electrification and automation. Valeo reported over €19 billion in revenue last year and employs more than 100,000 people worldwide.

The investment by CGIP, a diversified holding company also based in Paris, will provide Valeo additional capital to invest in new technologies like advanced driver assistance systems and accelerate the company’s expansion. Valeo CEO Jacques Aschenbroich said the deal "demonstrates the confidence of a major French shareholder in Valeo's strategy and growth prospects.” Aschenbroich has led Valeo since 2009 and will remain chief executive.  

For CGIP, acquiring a significant minority stake in Valeo aligns with the investment firm's goal to take controlling or influential positions in French companies poised for long-term prosperity. CGIP looks to hold assets for decades, not years, and already owns stakes in French luxury groups LVMH and Kering as well as utility giant Engie. However, the Valeo investment marks CGIP's first foray into the automotive sector, which could signal a new strategic priority for the €65 billion group.

CGIP has seen its own shares rise over 30% in the past year, as investors flock to stable, diversified holding companies amid political and economic tensions in Europe. Led by CEO Vincent Marniquet, who took over from longtime leader Patrick De Giovanni last year, CGIP appears open to more bold moves as it deploys cash from a 2019 share offering and seeks new sectors in which to invest.
