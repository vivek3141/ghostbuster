French Aviation Executives Fear Renewed Turbulence with the United States over Airline Market Access

Aviation executives in France are concerned that tensions may arise again with the United States over access to the transatlantic airline market. For decades, Europe and the U.S. have quarreled over “open skies” agreements that govern which airlines can fly routes across the Atlantic and how frequently. 

The latest "open skies" agreement was signed in 2010, allowing EU and U.S. airlines to operate direct flights to each other's territories. However, the agreement has faced ongoing challenges, including disputes over government subsidies for national carriers and access to airport slots. There is worry that negotiations over the next phase of the agreement could reignite tensions.

"The aviation relationship between Europe and America has always been fractious," said Jean-Marc Dufour, CEO of French airline Air Europa. "There are still many unresolved issues around competition, investments, and market access that could flare up again during negotiations."

In particular, French airline executives are concerned about access to slots at Paris Orly Airport. The 2010 agreement gave more slots to U.S. airlines at London Heathrow airport but did not significantly expand access at Orly. "Orly is a critical hub for short-haul European flights, and French carriers want to ensure they maintain control of most slots there,” said Marie Lambert, CEO of Transavia France.

There is also an ongoing dispute over government bailouts and subsidies for national carriers like Air France-KLM. U.S. airlines argue these constitute unfair competition, while EU officials claim U.S. airlines have received subsidies and bankruptcy protections of their own. Resolving these subsidy issues will be key to a new open skies deal, according to industry groups.

Negotiations over a successor agreement are set to begin in mid-2021, as the current terms expire in 2025. French executives hope that with a new U.S. administration, there is an opportunity for compromise. But they are also wary of the hardline stance some on both sides have taken in the past. With the airline industry facing huge losses due to the coronavirus pandemic, the stakes for finally resolving tensions around the open skies relationship have never been higher. Overall, while encouraged by the prospect of new talks, French aviation leaders are preparing for what could be a bumpy road ahead with their U.S. counterparts.
