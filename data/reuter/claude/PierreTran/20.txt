Air France given clearance to buy Boeing and Airbus planes for its long-haul fleet 

Air France-KLM received formal approval from the French government to proceed with a $25.6 billion order for up to 400 wide-body jets split between Boeing and Airbus. The state owns 14.3% of Air France-KLM and has veto rights over strategic decisions.

The board of directors approved the purchase of 160 Boeing 787s and Airbus A350 models, with a first firm order of 28 A350-900s and 787-9s to start replacing the fleet of older Airbus A340 and A380 planes. The new aircraft are around 25% more fuel efficient than the models they replace.

“This fleet renewal will enable Air France-KLM to significantly reduce its environmental footprint, while improving its competitiveness by achieving substantial fuel cost savings," said Ben Smith, CEO of Air France-KLM.

The deal is a boon for the hard-hit aerospace industry after plans were put on ice last year due to the pandemic. Securing the large order provides years of work for Airbus and Boeing factories. Shares of Airbus rose 2% in Paris while Boeing gained 3.7% in New York trading.

For Boeing in particular, the Air France-KLM deal is especially meaningful. The U.S. aerospace giant has ceded ground to Airbus in the single-aisle aircraft market and its 737 Max was grounded for 20 months following two fatal crashes. The 787 deal could spur other carriers to have confidence in Boeing's wide-body jets.

The final breakdown of Boeing versus Airbus planes in the order has not yet been decided, according to Air France-KLM. The choice will depend on availability and operating costs of the two manufacturers in coming years. Air France already operates a fleet of 192 Boeing jets and 108 Airbus aircraft. The first new planes will be delivered in September 2023.

The fleet renewal plan comes amid uncertainty in the aviation industry over how quickly demand will recover from the Covid crisis. Long-haul travel has been impacted heavily by border restrictions and passengers’  health concerns. However, Air France-KLM is betting on a rebound in 2024-2025 and wants to position itself with a more efficient fleet when recovery takes hold.

Analysts said the large jet order signals confidence in the long-term strength of the aviation sector, especially premium long-haul travel and cargo. However, Air France-KLM may face risks if variants of the coronavirus continue to depress international travel for an extended period. The company received €7 billion in state aid last year to help it withstand the near shutdown in air traffic.
