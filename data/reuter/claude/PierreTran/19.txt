French government pressures Air France to stick with Airbus over Boeing for new long-haul fleet 

The French government is urging Air France to choose European planemaker Airbus over U.S. rival Boeing for a multi-billion dollar order of new long-haul jets. Air France is considering renewing its aging fleet of wide-body aircraft for long-distance flights in the coming years. The airline is weighing options from both Airbus and Boeing ahead of a crucial board meeting in mid-October where a decision on potential suppliers is expected.

However, the French government, which owns a 14.3% stake in Air France's parent group, is pushing for Air France to pick Airbus's A350 jet, according to three people familiar with the discussions. The officials argue that going with Airbus would strengthen France's aerospace sector and support jobs. Airbus is headquartered in Toulouse, France and relies heavily on French suppliers.

Air France is leaning more toward Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, the sources said, as it looks for the most competitive offering on price, operational costs and fuel efficiency to renew its fleet profitably. A final decision has not yet been made, but a choice of Boeing could strain Air France's ties with the French government and hurt a historically close partnership with Airbus.

The looming aircraft order has become a battleground in the intensifying competition between Airbus and Boeing. The decision will have major implications for both planemakers and serve as a barometer of Airbus's strategy in its core market, and for Boeing as it tries to expand in Europe. An Air France win for the U.S company could encourage more European carriers to consider Boeing designs, but a loss would represent a setback for its ambitions on the continent.
