French Government Approves Snecma's Acquisition of Rocket Engine Manufacturer SEP

The French government has given the green light to aircraft engine maker Snecma to acquire rocket engine manufacturer SEP. The €2.4 billion deal is expected to be finalized in early  November pending final regulatory approval. The acquisition will continue the French government's ongoing consolidation of its aerospace and defense manufacturers.

Snecma, which is owned by French conglomerate Safran, will take a 70% stake in SEP, a private company based near Marseille in southern France that specializes in manufacturing liquid propellant rockets and space propulsion systems. The remaining 30% will be retained by SEP's founding members and employees. The deal will provide Snecma with expertise and technology in rocket propulsion to complement its own aircraft engine development programs.

France remains eager to strengthen its position in strategic and advanced technologies like aerospace. In recent years, the government has encouraged partnerships and mergers between major aerospace companies like Airbus, Thales, and Dassault Aviation. The Snecma-SEP deal is the latest move to build up larger champions that can compete globally.  

The French space agency CNES has been a long-time customer of SEP and helped facilitate the discussions between the two companies. SEP's rocket engines have been used on various CNES launchers including the Ariane program. CNES President Jean-Yves Le Gall said the agency expects to benefit from Snecma and SEP combining their technical and industrial expertise, which will provide more options for future launcher programs.

Snecma CEO Philippe Couty said the acquisition is a "strategic opportunity" to access unique skills and technology in the field of liquid propellant rocket engines. SEP has unique experience developing the Vulcain engines that power the core stage of the Ariane 5 launcher, a workhorse for delivering commercial satellites to orbit. Vulcain and its next-generation Vulcain 2 engine are also expected to be used on the upcoming Ariane 6 rocket.

For SEP's part, the larger company will provide financial backing and access to resources that will help accelerate its rocket engine development programs according to SEP CEO Marie-Agnès Charie. "Joining the Safran group will open up new growth opportunities for SEP, enabling us to co-operate on more ambitious space endeavors while also continuing to serve our traditional customer base," Charie said.

The deal comes amid a shifting landscape in the global space industry as private launch companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin challenge venerable national space agencies and contractors. Consolidation among smaller players has accelerated as a way to gain economies of scale and compete with Silicon Valley's space upstarts. The Snecma-SEP deal appears aimed at shoring up France's stake in space at a time of transformation in the industry.
