Bouygues and STET team up for joint bid in French telecoms arena 

Paris-based conglomerates Bouygues and STET announced today that they have formed a strategic partnership to jointly bid for French telecommunications licenses in the upcoming spectrum auction. The alliance is an attempt to challenge the dominance of France Telecom in the country's telecoms market.

The French government is auctioning off spectrum in the prized 1700 MHz and 2200 MHz bands in January, which are well-suited for rolling out faster 5G wireless networks. Bouygues, a sprawling industrial group, and STET, a telecommunications infrastructure operator, believe that by combining their resources they stand a better chance of securing some of the available spectrum against the financial might of the state-backed France Telecom.

“This partnership is a game changer that will reshape the landscape of the French telecoms market to the benefit of both businesses and consumers,” said Philippe de Castelbajac, Bouygues Telecom's chief executive. STET’s chairman and CEO, Jacques Veyrat, said the deal would allow them to “challenge the status quo and foster real competition.”

The tie-up is the latest sign of deal-making in Europe’s telecoms industry amid pressure to invest in new technology and infrastructure. Earlier this year, Bouygues explored a possible merger with market rival SFR but talks broke down. Meanwhile, Spain’s Telefonica and Italy’s TIM have also studied ways to combine some operations.

France’s 5G spectrum auction is set to be one of the largest ever in Europe. The scarce radio frequencies on offer will be crucial for developing new ultrafast networks that are up to 100 times faster than today’s 4G technology. The networks will enable new services like autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and remote surgery.

Bouygues is France's third-largest telecom company with over 15 million mobile customers. STET is a privately-held company that owns and operates over 21,000 miles of fiber optic cables across France. By pooling their resources, the two companies believe they will gain the size and financial firepower to splash out at the auction and really take the fight to market leader France Telecom. Whether their new alliance will succeed in denting France Telecom’s dominant position remains to be seen.
