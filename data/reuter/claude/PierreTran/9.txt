Air France partners with Delta and Continental to keep pace with European rivals

Air France announced today that it is forming a major transatlantic joint venture with Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines. The partnership aims to help the airlines better compete with rival airline groups that dominate transatlantic travel, including British Airways and American Airlines.

The joint venture will coordinate the airlines' flight schedules and fares between North America and Europe. The three airlines will jointly operate more than 250 transatlantic flights and offer connections to more than 200 cities in North America and Europe. The new partnership will start in October 2008, pending regulatory approval. 

"This joint venture allows us to compete on an equal footing with the largest alliances and to offer our customers even more choice and convenience," said Air France CEO Jean-Cyril Spinetta. Air France is a member of the SkyTeam alliance, along with Delta and Continental, but transatlantic joint ventures allow for deeper cooperation than traditional alliances.

British Airways and American Airlines have had a successful transatlantic joint venture for over a decade. Lufthansa and United Airlines also have a strong transatlantic partnership within the Star Alliance. Air France has been at a competitive disadvantage without a similar deep partnership across the Atlantic. This new venture with Delta and Continental aims to remedy that.

The joint venture will allow the three airlines to cooperate on scheduling to improve connectivity, allow more flexible rerouting of passengers when flights are disrupted, and enable joint marketing of their transatlantic routes. Passengers will also benefit from improved loyalty programs across the airlines and access to airport lounges. The airlines anticipate $1.5 billion in annual benefits from the enhanced cooperation.

However, the partnership may face scrutiny from regulators concerned about reduced competition on transatlantic routes. When American and British Airways strengthened their joint venture in 2010, the European Union conducted an antitrust investigation to ensure consumer interests were protected. Air France, Delta and Continental aim to avoid such issues by arguing their alliance will counter the power of rival alliances and benefit passengers through improved connectivity and options.

The new partnership represents a major shift in transatlantic alliances for Air France and its SkyTeam partners. By joining forces with Delta and Continental, Air France aims to challenge British Airways and American Airlines for dominance of the lucrative transatlantic market. For passengers, the joint venture could mean more competitive fares, convenience, and options for transatlantic travel.Air France appears to be succeeding in its goal to keep pace with its European rivals.
