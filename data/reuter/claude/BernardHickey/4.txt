News Corp. Reports Disappointing First Quarter, But Maintains 20% Profit Growth Target for the Year, With a More Conservative Approach to Financing New Acquisitions   

Media giant News Corp. reported lackluster results for its fiscal first quarter ended September 30, with revenue falling 5% from a year earlier due to weakness in its book publishing and pay TV businesses. However, the company stood by its target for 20% growth in annual profit, signaling it would take a more disciplined stance toward new acquisitions and cost management.  

News Corp.’s revenue declined to $2.52 billion in the quarter, hurt by lower sales of books in its HarperCollins book publishing unit, especially in its Christian publishing division, as well as declining subscriptions and advertising sales at its Australian pay TV unit Foxtel. Revenue missed Wall Street analysts’ consensus estimate of $2.56 billion, according to FactSet.  

Net income fell 23% to $128 million, or 22 cents a share, from $166 million, or 28 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding some items, profit was 17 cents a share, falling short of analysts’ target of 19 cents.    

The weak start to the fiscal year prompted News Corp. to slightly lower its forecast for revenue growth for the full fiscal year to between 1% and 3%, from 2% to 4% previously. However, the company left its target for growth in annual profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization—a measure closely watched by investors—unchanged at around 20%, indicating cost cuts and more prudent investment would help boost the bottom line.

“While we saw continued top-line pressure at some of our more challenged businesses, I am confident we can achieve our fiscal 2020 profitability targets through our cost and efficiency initiatives,” said Chief Executive Robert Thomson. 

News Corp. has made several acquisitions in recent years to beef up its digital real-estate listings and online-education units, adding to its debt load. The company said it would take a “more conservative” stance toward financing future deals, suggesting a slower pace of acquisitions.  

Investors are keen to see News Corp. address the weight on its earnings from legacy print assets like Australian newspapers and focus more on growing its digital real-estate, book publishing and subscription video units. The company’s news and information services division, which includes the Wall Street Journal and New York Post, reported a 4% rise in revenue, boosted by a 60% jump in digital subscriber numbers at the Journal. 

Shares in News Corp., controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, rose 3.7% in after-hours trading following the release of the results. The stock has gained about 12% so far this year.
