Rupert Murdoch Confirms News Corp's 20% Profit Growth and Rules Out Bid for Fairfax Holdings  

Media mogul Rupert Murdoch today announced News Corp's quarterly results, confirming 20% year-over-year profit growth for the publishing and news giant. Speaking to investors, Murdoch said the company’s digital transition strategy is “gaining real momentum” which helped drive the strong performance. 

News Corp reported profit of $506 million for the quarter ending September 30, up from $421 million in the same period last year. Revenue rose 5% to $2.48 billion, slightly ahead of analyst expectations. The company’s digital real estate and book publishing divisions recorded double-digit profit gains, offsetting continued softness in the print advertising market.

The strong results provide validation for Murdoch’s push to diversify News Corp’s revenue streams and pivot more aggressively into digital. Over the past three years, the company has acquired digital real estate brands like Realtor.com and Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones. It has also pumped investment into The Wall Street Journal’s digital subscription services and HarperCollins’ ebook business.

“Our digital transformation is well underway, generating meaningful revenue and profit growth, providing a very bright future for News Corp,” Murdoch said in a statement. The company now generates over 30% of its revenue from digital and subscription services, compared to less than 10% a decade ago. 

On a call with analysts, Murdoch also confirmed News Corp has ruled out making a bid for Australian media group Fairfax Holdings, amid recent speculation. “We have our hands full at the moment executing our own growth strategy, we will not pursue an acquisition of Fairfax,” Murdoch said. The comments sent Fairfax’s share price down over 4% in afternoon trading following the announcement.

News Corp has long been rumored as a potential buyer of Fairfax, which publishes The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and The Australian Financial Review. A takeover would create a virtual monopoly for News Corp in Australia’s media landscape and likely face tough regulatory scrutiny. Murdoch’s son Lachlan Murdoch previously sat on the Fairfax board but stepped down last year to focus his efforts on News Corp.
