News Corp Announces Conservative Financial Strategy with $2.5 Billion in Cash Reserves

News Corp, the media conglomerate owned by Rupert Murdoch, announced a cautious financial outlook for the next fiscal year with plans to build up $2.5 billion in cash reserves. Speaking at the company's annual meeting with investors, executives said the media landscape remains uncertain due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. 

Chief Financial Officer Susan Panuccio told investors, "These remain challenging times for our industries, and we want to ensure News Corp is in a position of strength. Our balance sheet is very strong, and we want to keep it that way." News Corp currently has over $1.3 billion in cash on hand and plans to boost its reserves through a combination of cost-cutting measures, low capital expenditures, suspension of share buybacks, and other actions.   

News Corp's major properties include The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, HarperCollins book publishers, and Australian pay-TV company Foxtel. Revenue from News Corp's news and information services division declined 12% in the most recent quarter due to lower advertising and circulation. Foxtel revenue also fell due to fewer sports broadcasts and lower commercial subscription revenues. News Corp's book publishing division was a bright spot, with 6% revenue growth.

With the $2.5 billion cash reserve, News Corp will have a substantial financial cushion in case of any further business disruptions. The reserves could also position the company to make strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise. However, building up such a large cash pile during a time of historically low interest rates will negatively impact News Corp's interest income. Ms. Panuccio acknowledged this downside but said, "Protecting the company's financial stability is our top priority at this time."

News Corp class B shares fell 3.2% on the announcement as some investors viewed the cautious stance as detrimental to growth. One media analyst, Carissa Madden from Halcyon Advisors, said "Hoarding this much cash is an overreaction that deprives News Corp of investment opportunities and shareholder returns." However, other analysts praised the conservative approach given the unknown path of the pandemic and digital media transition.

News Corp's annual revenue is projected to drop by between 8 to 13% for the 2021 fiscal year ending June 30, according to the company's latest guidance. However, with cost reductions and a bolstered balance sheet, free cash flow is expected to be roughly on par with the 2020 fiscal year's $1.4 billion. Ms. Panuccio said the company will revisit share buybacks, dividends, and other shareholder benefits once there is more certainty about overall business conditions improving.
