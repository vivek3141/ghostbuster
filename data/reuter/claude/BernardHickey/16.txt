Email Ltd forecasts boost in profits despite lower half year net profit and dividend  

Email Ltd, the digital communications company, forecast a strong rebound in profits and revenue for the second half of the fiscal year despite announcing lower half year net profit and dividend today.

The company reported net profit after tax of $550 million for the six months ending June 30, down 15% from the same period last year. Revenue also declined by 3% to $3.2 billion due to decreased advertising spend from business customers in the first quarter as a result of economic uncertainty.  

However, Email Ltd said it expects profits and revenue to grow by at least 15% in the second half of the fiscal year due to a number of new product launches and services. The company has also signed up several major new enterprise customers to long-term contracts which will boost subscription revenue.

“While conditions were challenging in the first half, we are seeing a strong turnaround in the second half with improving economic sentiment and business confidence,” said Email Ltd CEO Amy Chen. “We have an exciting product roadmap and new customer wins which will drive future growth.”

Due to the lower first half profits, Email Ltd announced an interim dividend of $0.20 per share, down from $0.25 per share last year. However, the company said it expects to maintain full year dividends at $0.50 per share. 

Email Ltd shares rose 3.2% on the profit guidance for the rest of the year. Market analysts said investors were particularly pleased with the forecast uplift in revenue and new customer deals. 

“The first half results were slightly below expectations but the forward guidance is very promising,” said Mark Stevens, senior tech analyst at XYZ Securities. “Email Ltd is poised to rebound strongly and gain market share with strategic moves into new areas like business messaging and marketing automation.”
