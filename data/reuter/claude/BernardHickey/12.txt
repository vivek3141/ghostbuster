QBE Insurance Group Predicts Strong Profit Growth in High Teens for Full Year 1996/97

SYDNEY, February 20, 1997â€” QBE Insurance Group, Australia's largest international general insurance and reinsurance company, today forecast strong profit growth in the high teens for the full year ending December 31, 1996.  

Chairman Miles Vaughan said that all divisions of the group have contributed to the improved profit result despite several natural disasters in Australia and overseas during the year. "Our group continues to benefit from its diversified activities and balanced portfolio across many classes of business and geographic locations," Mr. Vaughan said.

QBE Insurance Group has announced an audited full year net profit after tax and before extraordinary items of $127 million for the year ended December 31, 1996, compared to $109 million for the same period in the prior year. This represents an increase of 16.5% over the previous year. Gross written premiums increased by 10.1% to $1.947 billion and net earned premiums were up 9.3% to $1.653 billion.   The reported Insurance profit margin increased from 10.0% to 10.6% for the year. 

The Australian general insurance operations reported a strong underwriting result as premium rates continued to firm. Gross written premiums increased 9.3% to $1.372 billion, driven primarily by growth in commercial property and motor portfolios. Regional Australian operations returned to profitability, while the crop insurance division again recorded an underwriting profit.   

QBE's overseas general insurance operations also grew strongly with gross written premiums increasing 24.4% to $468 million. All major markets in the London operations achieved premium growth and higher underwriting profits, especially in the professional indemnity and financial institutions portfolios. The accident and health division continued its growth, and the North American reinsurance business produced another excellent result albeit this division is relatively small.

Global reinsurance operations remain subdued though as worldwide reinsurance rates remain flat. QBE Re has maintained its cautious underwriting stance while modest growth was achieved in broker-sourced facultative business. The reinsurance profit of $23 million compares to $30 million for the prior year. 

QBE Group said it remains well placed to continue its strong international thrust. QBE will also benefit from further consolidation in the general insurance industry and a gradual firming of most insurance rates in world markets. Continually improving efficiencies through the use of advanced technology means lower operating expense ratios and higher return on equity can be achieved. The state of the group's balance sheet provides significant capacity to expand worldwide insurance operations in all its business segments.
