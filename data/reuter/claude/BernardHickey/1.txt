Rupert Murdoch Confident of Legal Victory and 20% Profit Surge for News Corp.  

Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch today expressed confidence that News Corporation will prevail in ongoing legal disputes and predicted a 20% rise in annual profits for the global publishing and entertainment conglomerate.

Speaking at News Corp’s annual shareholder meeting, the 89-year old Murdoch said “our legal position is rock solid” regarding multiple lawsuits and investigations surrounding phone hacking and bribery at the company’s now defunct News of the World tabloid newspaper in the UK. “We have admitted our mistakes, made amends where appropriate and significantly revamped our compliance practices. It is time to move on,” Murdoch said. 

News Corp has settled a number of civil lawsuits related to News of the World but still faces possible criminal charges against former editors and reporters. UK media regulators are also considering whether News Corp should face stricter oversight. However, Murdoch insisted that the “worst is behind us” and “there is no evidence of wider wrongdoing at News Corp.”

On the financial front, Murdoch projected News Corp’s net income would rise by 20% in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, fueled by double-digit growth at the Fox News Channel and Wall Street Journal in the U.S. and the recent launch of new talkTV and news.com.au digital media properties in Australia. Revenue from News Corp’s book publishing division is also growing steadily thanks to recent acquisitions in the Christian and children’s books sectors.   

Murdoch highlighted News Corp’s “robust balance sheet” with over $6.5 billion in cash and no debt maturities until 2025. This positions the company well for strategic acquisitions to bolster its news, real estate, and book publishing operations, he said. News Corp’s stock has gained over 12% in the past year, slightly outperforming major equity indexes.

In response to a shareholder question regarding succession planning, Murdoch said his son Lachlan Murdoch, who serves as executive chairman and owns about 8% of News Corp’s shares, is “doing an excellent job leading the company.” However, he declined to comment on whether Lachlan would eventually take over as CEO from Robert Thomson, who has held the position since 2013. 

Rupert Murdoch co-founded News Corp 65 years ago and turned it into one of the world’s largest media conglomerates spanning print, digital publishing, cable network programming, and film production. Even as he approaches his 90th birthday, Murdoch shows no signs of slowing down and remains executive chairman of News Corp. “Retirement is not a word in my lexicon,” Murdoch quipped at the conclusion of today’s 75-minute shareholder meeting. “I’m in good health and enjoying the challenges of this company too much to even consider stepping away."
