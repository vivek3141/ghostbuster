Westpac Banking Corp Ltd faces slower profit growth due to competition in home loan sector  

Westpac Banking Corp Ltd, Australia’s second-largest lender, warned investors today that increasing competition in the home loan market is putting pressure on profit margins. Westpac said net interest margins, the difference between what it pays savers and charges borrowers, narrowed during the first quarter of its fiscal year.

The bank expects the trend to continue due to aggressive competition from smaller lenders chasing market share in the A$1.8 trillion mortgage market. Westpac and its peers have also been cutting interest rates on mortgages in recent months, matching moves by the Reserve Bank of Australia.

“There is no doubt margins have come under pressure in the current environment of record low interest rates and strong competitive intensity in the home loan market,” said Westpac Chief Executive Brian Hartzer. “We are responding to this with a continued focus on productivity and maintaining our disciplined approach to lending.”

Westpac said its mortgage book grew at an annualized 4.8% pace in the three months through December, slightly below the system growth rate. The bank aims to match overall market growth. Business lending declined 2.5% from the same period a year earlier.

While net interest income rose due to volume growth, mortgage pricing changes reduced revenue by about A$90 million in the quarter, Westpac said. Fee and commission income also declined. 

The results suggest Westpac and its peers Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Ltd and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group may struggle to match last year’s profit growth without further cost cutting or increases in other revenue sources like wealth management and insurance.

The warning from Westpac dragged its shares down 2.2% in afternoon trading in Sydney, while the broader market was flat. The decline in Westpac trimmed more than A$3 billion from its market value.
