Rupert Murdoch Predicts News Corp Profits to Rise by 20% and Legal Victory Over Ted Turner in Media Battle  

Media mogul Rupert Murdoch today projected that News Corp's profits will rise by 20% over the next fiscal year, fueled by growth in digital subscriptions and content licensing. In a call with investors, Murdoch also expressed confidence that News Corp would prevail in its ongoing legal dispute with rival Ted Turner.   

Murdoch said News Corp's push into streaming media and integration of properties like The Wall Street Journal and New York Post is paying dividends. "Our journalistic brands remain as vibrant as ever, and consumers are demonstrating their willingness to pay for quality content that provides real value," Murdoch said. News Corp shares rose 4% on the news.

The profits projection comes as News Corp reported a 15% increase in revenue for the previous quarter, beating analyst estimates. Much of the growth came from The Wall Street Journal, which added more than 100,000 digital subscribers, and gains at Australian newspapers like The Daily Telegraph. Revenue from content licensing also grew 25% thanks to deals with major streaming services.   

Murdoch took aim at Ted Turner, the founder of CNN who once called Murdoch “the Antichrist.” Turner’s media company recently alleged that News Corp colluded with other publishers to drive down the price of content licensing deals, a claim News Corp denies. “Ted Turner has been sounding off about me for decades with false claims and bitter jealousy. This latest lawsuit is just another absurd attempt by a rival to undermine our success through malicious lies,” Murdoch said.   

News Corp's push into streaming and digital media comes as traditional outlets face major financial headwinds. Dozens of newspapers have folded in recent years, unable to transition to digital quickly enough. But News Corp now gets nearly 40% of its revenue from digital sources, putting it ahead of competitors. The Wall Street Journal surpassed 2 million total subscribers last year, with more than 1.5 million digital-only customers.   

Still, there are risks to Murdoch's optimism. If economic conditions sour, consumers may cut back on discretionary spending like news subscriptions. News Corp also remains heavily exposed to volatility in the advertising market. But for now, Murdoch appears poised to prove doubters wrong and continue his reign as one of the world's most powerful media executives. At the age of 88, Murdoch shows no signs of slowing down as he positions News Corp for the future.
