Simsmetal Ltd Predicts Lower Profits Due to Bleak Outlook for Scrap Metal Prices 

Simsmetal Ltd, one of the world's largest metal recycling companies, warned investors today that its profits for the fiscal year are likely to be 15-20% lower than previously forecast. The downgrade in guidance came as prices for ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal have declined sharply over the last quarter due to slowing demand from key consumers like steelmakers, copper foundries, and aluminum manufacturers.

In an announcement to the Australian Securities Exchange, Simsmetal CEO Alistair Field cited declining manufacturing activity in China, Europe, and other major markets as the primary driver of the fall in scrap metal prices. “Geopolitical and trade policy uncertainties have led many of our industrial customers to scale back expansion plans, limit new capital expenditures, and reduce inventories. All of these actions have softened demand for recycled metals,” said Mr. Field. 

According to industry data, the price of scrap steel in China has dropped 32% since January, while aluminum and copper scrap prices have fallen 16% and 22% respectively over the same period. The downward trend accelerated into March and April, squeezing profit margins for Simsmetal and other metal recyclers. Mr. Field noted that the company was able to partially offset the impact through an on-going cost reduction program but expects a significant drag on earnings for the rest of the financial year ending June 30th.

Metal recycling has been a challenging industry in recent years due to overcapacity among industrial metal consumers and low barriers to enter the processing and trading of scrap materials. However, many analysts expect the long term outlook for larger recyclers like Simsmetal to remain positive given tightening environmental regulations on mining and increasing demand for recycled content in manufactured goods. The company also has a sizeable presence in higher growth recycling markets such as China, South Korea, and India which are investing heavily in infrastructure.  

Simsmetal’s stock fell over 7% on the news before recovering some of the losses to close down 4.2% in Sydney trading. The share price has declined over 12% from its 2019 high in January. Some investors may see today’s update as an opportunity to buy into a globally diversified business at a more attractive valuation. However, with no quick resolution to the trade disputes and weak manufacturing data in sight, the scrap metal sector looks poised to face strong economic headwinds for the foreseeable future. Overall, the outlook for Simsmetal’s profits and share price will depend on whether slowing global growth crimps demand or equally weakens the supply of recycled metals.
