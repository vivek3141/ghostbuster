News Corp reports lower than expected Q1 results, still aiming for 20% profit rise in 1996/97, says Rupert Murdoch  

News Corp, the global media giant owned by Rupert Murdoch, reported lower than expected profits for the fiscal first quarter ended September 30. However, Murdoch said the company is still aiming to achieve a 20% rise in net income for the full financial year.

News Corp’s net profit for the quarter was $256 million, down 6% from $273 million in the same quarter last year. Revenue grew 2% to $2.08 billion. Analysts had forecast profit of $279 million and revenue of $2.12 billion. 

The lower profit was attributed to higher costs associated with the launch of the Fox News Channel in the US, lower results from UK newspapers due to price competition, and start-up losses from Sky Digital, News Corp’s digital satellite platform in the UK and Ireland.

Murdoch said the results were “solid” given the costs associated with new investments and acquisitions. “News Corp had an active first quarter, launching new products and platforms that strengthen our businesses for the long term,” Murdoch said in a statement. “Even as we invested in these future growth initiatives, our operations delivered revenue and profitability largely in line with our expectations.”

News Corp reaffirmed its forecast for profit growth of around 20% for the full 1996/97 financial year. Murdoch said the company expects earnings to strengthen over the next three quarters, driven by gains in cable network programming, worldwide television operations, and newspapers in Australia.

Murdoch highlighted the successful launch of Fox News Channel in October, which is already reaching more than 20 million homes. He said the channel would become “a major contributor” to News Corp’s cable network division. Murdoch also pointed to continued strong growth at Sky Digital, which now has more than 3.5 million subscribers, up from 2.7 million a year ago.

News Corp’s stock fell 3.2% to $38.50 in after-hours trading following the release of the quarterly results. Over the past year, News Corp shares have climbed 25% as the company continues to benefit from ventures in the hot cable, satellite and pay-TV sectors.

With its vast media and entertainment assets on four continents, News Corp remains well positioned to capitalize on the changing global media landscape. While its traditional print media businesses face challenges, News Corp is successfully building a portfolio of high-growth digital and pay-TV assets that promise to drive future earnings growth. The stable of properties across TV, film, newspapers, books and digital platforms gives News Corp significant leverage to exploit intellectual property and content across divisions.
