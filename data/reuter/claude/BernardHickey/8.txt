Rupert Murdoch Confident In 20% Profit Rise Despite Slow First Quarter for News Corp

Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch said today that he expects News Corp to deliver a 20% increase in annual profits this fiscal year, despite what he characterized as a "soft start" to the year. In an interview, Murdoch said slowing revenue from ads and subscriptions in the first few months of the year were a temporary blip and that he has "no doubt at all" the company will meet its profit targets by the end of the fiscal year in June.  

News Corp, which owns properties including The Wall Street Journal, New York Post and HarperCollins publishers, reported a 2% drop in revenue for the first quarter ended September 30. The decline was driven by lower ad revenue in Murdoch's Australian newspapers as well as lower sales of HarperCollins' print books in the U.S. and U.K. While digital subscriptions continued to rise, the growth was offset by students and businesses canceling print newspaper deliveries, the company said.

Murdoch acknowledged the quarterly performance was "disappointing" but attributed much of it to the timing of key ad campaigns and the release schedule of HarperCollins titles. "We had some bad luck, that's all," Murdoch told reporters. He pointed to a strong lineup of titles releasing later this fiscal year, as well as "brand new ad products" the company will roll out across its properties.    

The company's cable network segment, which includes Fox News Channel and Fox Sports, delivered a 9% increase in profit for the quarter, boosted by higher affiliate and retransmission fees. But Murdoch was bullish on the growth potential for the company's streaming services and digital properties. He said News Corp's Dow Jones risk and compliance products as well as its digital real estate listings were achieving "spectacular" growth.  

While analysts agreed with Murdoch's long-term vision, some questioned whether the one-quarter results pointed to deeper issues. "Soft starts can turn into hard landings," noted Matthew Heyes, an analyst with AllianceInvest. "If they're seeing widespread pressure on print ads and print products across geographies, it may signal an acceleration of the decline of that business model." However, others said one quarter alone does not make a trend and that Murdoch has defied naysayers for decades. 

Overall, Murdoch said he expects the company to meet its target of $1 billion in annual profit for the fiscal year, up 20% year over year, fueled by gains in its digital, cable, and book publishing segments. With his trademark confidence, Murdoch concluded, "I've been in this business a long time and I'm not wrong very often."
