Rupert Murdoch Predicts 20 Percent Profit Rise Despite Below-Expectation Q1 Performance

Media mogul Rupert Murdoch issued a statement today predicting a 20 percent increase in net profit for News Corp this fiscal year, despite first quarter results that fell short of analyst expectations.

News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, HarperCollins, and the Fox News Channel, reported total revenue of $2.6 billion for the quarter ending September 30, up 4 percent from the same period last year. Profits rose 2 percent to $263 million. Though revenue and profit were up year over year, the figures came in below the $2.7 billion in revenue and $280 million in net income that analysts had forecast.

The lower-than-expected results were attributed to declines in News Corp's book publishing and Australian newspapers divisions. Revenue for the book publishing unit, which includes powerhouse HarperCollins, fell 7 percent due to lower print book sales. In Australia, currency fluctuations and softness in the print advertising market impacted profits.

However, Murdoch, who serves as News Corp's chairman and CEO, brushed off the quarterly disappointments and maintained his optimistic view of the company's prospects. In a statement, Murdoch said, "I have great confidence in the future. News Corp is poised for further organic growth and our latest results highlight the momentum building across our businesses." 

Murdoch specifically called out growth in the company's online real estate listings business, recent acquisitions of two television stations, and stronger cable network results. He also noted the Wall Street Journal's continued subscriber growth, with digital subscriptions up 12 percent over the previous year.

While the short-term Q1 results demonstrate some of the ongoing challenges in parts of News Corp's portfolio, Murdoch's prediction of 20 percent profit growth for the full fiscal year signals that the company's pivot to new opportunities in television, digital media, and online services is paying off. If achieved, a 20 percent net profit increase would significantly outpace the 2 percent profit rise in 2017. Given Murdoch's decades of leadership, investors are betting his vision of News Corp's future prospects will win out despite ups and downs from quarter to quarter.
