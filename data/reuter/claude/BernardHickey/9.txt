News Corp CEO Rupert Murdoch reports disappointing Q1 performance but maintains 20% profit target for the year

News Corp, the media conglomerate owned by billionaire Rupert Murdoch, reported lackluster financial results for its fiscal first quarter ending September 30. Revenue declined 5% to $2.5 billion compared to the same quarter last year, while net income dropped over 40% to $87 million. 

The weaker performance was attributed to declining print advertising revenue for the company’s newspaper division as well as lower cable subscription fees for its pay-TV businesses. News Corp's flagship properties include The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, and HarperCollins book publisher. The company also owns cable networks like Fox News and Fox Sports as well as a stake in real estate websites REA Group and Move.

On an earnings call with analysts, Murdoch acknowledged the disappointing results but said he remains confident News Corp can still achieve its target of 20% growth in profits for the full fiscal year. “Our first quarter results were below our expectations due to a few temporary headwinds, but we are already seeing signs of improvement and have a strong slate of new initiatives and product launches planned for the coming months,” Murdoch said.

The cable and book publishing divisions were relative bright spots, registering modest revenue and profit gains. At HarperCollins, sales of fiction books were up thanks to multiple bestsellers, helping offset slower nonfiction sales. Revenue at the cable network programming segment grew thanks to higher affiliate and advertising fees.

However, News Corp’s other divisions struggled. At Dow Jones, revenue declined 8% due to lower print advertising and risk management product sales. The company’s newspaper unit saw the steepest drop, with revenue falling 13% on an adjusted basis, hurt by decreases in print advertising at titles like The Australian and the New York Post.

In response, Murdoch emphasized that News Corp is accelerating its shift away from traditional print media toward digital platforms and new revenue streams. In the coming months, The Wall Street Journal will launch a major redesign of its website and mobile apps, providing subscribers with an “enhanced, personalized experience,” Murdoch said. The Post will also be launching new subscriber-only mobile apps and newsletters to drive digital subscriptions.
