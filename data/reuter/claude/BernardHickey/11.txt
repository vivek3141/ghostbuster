Niugini Mining Ltd Considers Return of Lihir Gold Shares to Shareholders 

Niugini Mining Ltd, the Australian-based gold mining company, announced today that it is considering returning shares in its Lihir gold mine subsidiary to Niugini shareholders. The Lihir gold mine, located on Niolam Island in Papua New Guinea, is one of the largest gold mines in the world.

Niugini Mining acquired full ownership of the Lihir mine in 2005. However, with gold prices depressed for much of the past decade, the costs of running the mine have cut into Niugini's profits and share price. The company is now exploring options to unlock value for shareholders, including spinning off part or all of the Lihir mine into a separately listed company.

“We recognize that the significant value of the Lihir asset is not being reflected in our current share price,” said Niugini CEO Michaela Browne. “Returning the Lihir mine to shareholders would allow them to fully benefit from the value and upside potential of this world-class asset.”

According to analysts, the Lihir mine could be worth between $5 billion to $10 billion as a stand-alone company. Niugini's current market capitalization is only $3.2 billion. Spinning off Lihir could also improve Niugini's own share price as it shifts focus back to its base metals operations.

However, some shareholders argue that selling or demerging Lihir could deprive Niugini of its biggest growth asset just as gold prices start to recover. There are also concerns about the loss of diversification by separating the companies.

Niugini's management said the evaluation of strategic options for Lihir is still at an early stage and that there is no certainty a demerger or sale will proceed. The company plans to undertake a thorough analysis of all options before making a final determination on the optimal path forward. Shareholders and analysts will be watching closely for the conclusions of that analysis.
