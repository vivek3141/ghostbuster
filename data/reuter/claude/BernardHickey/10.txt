ANZ denies investigating $24 billion merger with Standard Chartered 

Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) today denied reports that it is exploring a potential A$24 billion ($18 billion) merger with Standard Chartered, the British bank focused on emerging markets. 

Shares of ANZ jumped 3.5% following a report in The Australian Financial Review that ANZ Chairman David Gonski had held preliminary discussions with Standard Chartered about a merger. However, a spokesperson for ANZ rejected the report, saying “There have been no discussions with Standard Chartered regarding a potential merger.”

Standard Chartered also denied the report in a statement, saying “We are not engaged in any discussions regarding a potential merger.”

Speculation about consolidation in the banking sector has been rife due to sluggish economic growth and tighter regulation since the global financial crisis. Low interest rates around the world have also put pressure on bank profit margins.

A tie-up between ANZ and Standard Chartered would create an institution with over $700 billion in assets and a focus on fast-growing Asian markets. However, analysts expressed skepticism about the mooted deal. “We believe a full merger between the two banks could be difficult given their different geographic focuses and business models,” said James Ellis, banking analyst at Morningstar. 

Shayne Elliott, who took over as ANZ CEO in 2016, has sought to focus the bank more tightly on its core markets in Australia, New Zealand and parts of Asia. ANZ has pulled out of several Asian countries and has tried to simplify its operations under Elliott. In contrast, Standard Chartered makes most of its profit in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.

While dismissing this particular report, ANZ's Elliot has said the bank would consider "sensible" acquisition opportunities. However, he stated, “we are focused on organic growth rather than any big bang M&A.”

The speculation comes at a difficult time for many Australian banks as they grapple with fallout from an inquiry into misconduct in the financial sector. ANZ and Standard Chartered also face economic uncertainties as growth slows, particularly in Australia and key Asian markets like China and Hong Kong.
