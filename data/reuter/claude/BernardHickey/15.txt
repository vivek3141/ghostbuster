News Corp Expected to Benefit from MCI-BT Merger, Analysts Say

Media conglomerate News Corp is poised to reap financial benefits from the recently announced $97 billion merger between telecommunications giants MCI and British Telecom, according to industry analysts. The blockbuster deal, the largest in the history of the technology and telecom sector, will combine MCI’s expertise in business communications and networking with BT’s strength in consumer broadband, content delivery and cloud services. 

The merger is expected to boost News Corp’s media and entertainment businesses in two key ways. First, the combined company will likely increase spending on advertising across News Corp’s media properties, which include The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, and HarperCollins book publishing. MCI and BT together spent over $5 billion on global advertising and marketing last year. With expanded scale and reach, the merged entity’s ad budget is projected to grow substantially over the next 3-5 years, allowing News Corp to capture a bigger share of that spending.

Second, the deal could accelerate News Corp’s ambitions in streaming media and over-the-top (OTT) video services. MCI owns significant internet backbone and undersea cable infrastructure that delivers high-speed connectivity around the world. BT brings expertise in engineering ultra-low latency networks ideal for streaming media. News Corp has been investing heavily in digital media and streaming in recent years and the MCI-BT infrastructure and technology platform could help globalize its video offerings.

However, the merger also brings risks and uncertainty for News Corp. Combining two complex organizations will be challenging and could result in management distraction, staff turnover, and reduced investment in new partnerships or initiatives while the integration takes place. There is also a possibility of redundancy in some business units that could lead to cost cutting. And broader industry changes from the deal may impact News Corp in uncertain ways.

Analyst Kenneth Clarke of KCM Media Advisors notes, “The sheer scale of MCI and BT will shake up the tech and telecom landscape and send ripple effects across the media industry. On balance, News Corp is well positioned to benefit from their coming together, but will need to monitor the situation closely and remain nimble in its strategy.”  

With its vast array of media, news and entertainment assets, News Corp is set to gain from the increased digital media activity and advertising that should result from this telecom mega-merger. However, an undertaking of this magnitude also brings risks that News Corp will need to watch out for in the coming months as the deal is finalized and the difficult work of integration begins. Overall, analysts are optimistic that News Corp will emerge as a winner from this historic MCI-BT tie-up.
