Ridley Corp Ltd predicts flat first half profit due to slow demand and margin pressures but expects grain price slump to boost full-year profits

Feed and grain processor Ridley Corp Ltd forecast flat first-half profit on Tuesday due to slowing demand from flood-affected beef cattle farmers and squeezed margins. However, the company expects profits for the full year to climb due to declining grain costs after a bumper wheat and barley harvest.  

Ridley projected statutory net profit before tax for fiscal 2020 to remain steady at around $75 million for the six months through December. That comes despite a slide in beef cattle volumes and feed demand following widespread flooding across parts of Queensland and New South Wales. The company also cited pressure on margins from higher supplement costs and subdued consumer spending.

“While first half result are expected to be softer due to challenging weather and market conditions, the recent fall in grain prices and recovery in key commodity categories provides optimism for an improved performance in the second half,” said Ridley CEO Tim Hart.

Shares in Ridley climbed 4.2% to $1.23 in early trade as investors seized on the prospect of healthier profits in the fiscal second half if current operating conditions prevail. Ridley derives around 65% of earnings from ruminant feed for beef cattle and diary production, making its fortunes closely tied to the broader agricultural sector.   

The company pointed to declining grain costs - a key input in stock feed - as a tailwind for profits in the six months from January. Wheat and barley prices have plunged this year following a record harvest, reducing costs for Ridley and lifting profit margins. A recovery in dairy prices and the prospect of restocking on cattle farms as pastures regenerate from flooding also buoy hopes for stronger feed demand.

Ridley retained guidance for full-year net profit to increase between 3 to 8% from last year's $143.6 million. First-half results are due on February 25.

“While uncertainty remains, assuming average seasonal and market conditions for the remainder of FY20, the underlying strength of our categories and resilience of our business gives us confidence in delivering full year guidance,” Mr Hart said.  

Ridley shares have surged 60% from a five-year low in December 2018 but remain well below a record high of $2.04 in May 2017. The stock is up 30% in 2019, slightly underperforming a 35% gain for the benchmark S&P/ASX 200.
