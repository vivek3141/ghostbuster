National Mutual Holdings Ltd forecasts strong earnings for 1996/97 year due to strong investment market 

National Mutual Holdings Ltd, one of the country's leading financial services companies, announced today that it expects earnings for the 1996/97 fiscal year to exceed earlier forecasts due to favorable conditions in investment markets over the past six months.

In a statement released this morning, National Mutual's CEO David Smith said that continuing growth in the stock market, as well as gains in commercial real estate and fixed-income investments, will drive earnings growth for the year above the 10-12% range predicted at the start of the fiscal year. "Our investment portfolios have benefited significantly from the extended bull market run in equities over the past two quarters in particular," Mr. Smith said. "We have also seen good returns on select commercial real estate assets and fixed-income securities."

The company did not provide a specific revised earnings forecast but said more details would be provided when National Mutual releases its half-year results on October 24. Analysts, however, said earnings growth for the full year is likely to be in the 15-20% range based on the strength of investment markets. "The updated guidance is not surprising given the performance of their key investment segments," said Andrew Taylor, an analyst with JB Were Investments. "National Mutual has a very well-diversified investment book so they are well positioned to benefit in times like these when most asset classes are rising."

National Mutual, one of the top-five financial institutions in the country by market capitalization, has over A$200 billion in funds under management across its life insurance, wealth management, and retail banking divisions. The company has benefited from rising profits across all of its operating units due to strong equity markets, increased financial wealth in Australia, and rising interest rates.
