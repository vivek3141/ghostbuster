News Corp set to benefit from MCI-BT merger, analysts say

News Corporation looks poised to benefit from the recently announced proposed merger between BT Group and MCI Communications, according to media and telecommunications analysts. The $94 billion merger, announced last week, would give BT control of MCI's global internet network and enterprise services in more than 65 countries. This expansion of BT's telecommunications infrastructure and reach is expected to be a boon for News Corp.

 News Corp, the international media conglomerate headed by Rupert Murdoch, has a 39 percent stake in British Sky Broadcasting, or BSkyB, which is partly owned by BT Group. The merger is expected to provide additional revenue and infrastructure opportunities to BSkyB, in which News Corp would share financially as the largest shareholder.

 "The combination of BT and MCI would significantly expand BT's scale and capabilities as a global networking and communications powerhouse, " said Michael Nathanson, senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson, an independent research firm. "This deal would clearly benefit BSkyB and News Corp as BT shareholders and commercial partners."

 The proposed merger requires approval from regulators in the United States as well as the European Commission's competition authority. If approved, the deal is expected to close in mid-2023. News Corp's shares rose 4 percent on the initial announcement of the deal, reflecting the market's view on the benefits to News Corp. 

 As BT's capabilities expand globally following the merger, analysts expect BSkyB and News Corp to leverage those capabilities to enhance their own global media platforms, especially in streaming and over-the-top content delivery. BSkyB Now, the company's streaming service which offers live sports, news and entertainment channels, could see distribution into more markets via BT's network. 

 News UK, another News Corp holding company which publishes The Times and The Sun newspapers, could also make use of an enlarged BT network to distribute content and potentially boost subscriptions. News Corp's HarperCollins book publishing division may also benefit from a larger BT in facilitating ebook downloads and improving discoverability of its titles.

 To be sure, the merger is not without risks for News Corp. There remains uncertainty around regulators' potential conditions on the deal, which could hamper some of the opportunities for News Corp and BSkyB. In addition, News Corp would remain a minority shareholder in the enlarged BT, limiting some control and influence over company strategy.

 However, analysts point out that News Corp and CEO Murdoch have enjoyed a long and productive relationship with BT. And functionally, BT's larger size and scope post-merger would inherently benefit its shareholders like BSkyB and News Corp. If approved, this mega-merger in telecommunications stands to provide material upside for Murdoch's formidable media empire around the globe.
