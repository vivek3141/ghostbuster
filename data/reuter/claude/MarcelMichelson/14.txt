Air France Ready to Take on British Airways' Foray into French Market 

British Airways announced this week that it will launch new routes from London to two cities in southern France starting next summer. The British carrier will begin direct flights from London Heathrow to Marseille and Nice in July 2020, a move that international analysts see as a competitive challenge to Air France in its home market.

Air France, however, says it is ready for the competition. The French flagship carrier currently dominates air travel between London and cities within mainland France. "We welcome competition that gives customers more choice and better service," said an Air France spokesperson. "Air France will continue providing the highest quality travel experience for our customers flying between London and France."
 
While British Airways is framing the new routes as an expansion of options for UK travelers seeking sun destinations, industry experts view the foray into France as a bold move to take on Air France on its home turf. The French carrier serves over 20 destinations throughout France from London Heathrow and dominates the market. By launching routes to Marseille and Nice, two of France's most popular cities for beach holidays, British Airways could put a dent in Air France's passenger numbers and revenue on these core routes.

Competition has been heating up between major European carriers in recent years amid slowing growth in passenger demand. British Airways and Air France are both part of large airline groups—International Airlines Group and Air France-KLM Group, respectively—that are working to gain market share across the continent. British Airways’ push into France could be seen as a reciprocal response to Air France-KLM's launch of Transavia, a low-cost carrier, to compete on flights within western Europe.

Air France, however, argues that its network and premium product give it a competitive advantage that will withstand new entrants into the London-France market. The carrier serves over 320 destinations worldwide from its hub at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport. It also continues to invest in new business class seats, lounges, and other amenities designed to attract high-paying business travelers. While competition may heat up on some routes, Air France appears confident in its ability to compete for passengers across its broad network. Overall, additional capacity and more choice for consumers are a win.
