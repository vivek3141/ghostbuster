Air Liberte staff demand to see takeover bids amidst fears of liquidation 

Staff at the struggling French regional airline Air Liberte have demanded that management share details of any takeover bids with employees, amidst growing fears that the company could face liquidation if it fails to find a buyer.

Air Liberte, which operates short-haul flights from its bases in Lyon, Nantes and Toulouse, has been seeking new investment or a potential buyer for the past six months after accumulating over â‚¬200 million in debt. However, employees claim they have been "left in the dark" about the sales process and potential suitors for the airline. 

Jean-Marc Dupont, a spokesman for the Air Liberte Workers' Union, said "Staff morale has hit rock bottom. We have made huge sacrifices to save costs during this difficult time but we feel like we are the last to know anything about the future of our company. We are calling on management and the board to be fully transparent about takeover discussions so we have some hope that jobs can be saved."

According to industry sources, Air Liberte has received expressions of interest from three European airlines and two private equity firms, but concrete bids have yet to materialize. The company's precarious financial situation means any successful takeover is likely to involve a substantial restructuring, including potential job losses and cuts to Air Liberte's fleet of 25 aircraft. The airline currently employs 1,200 staff across France.

However, time is running out to broker a deal. Auditors are set to review Air Liberte's accounts again in early September and unless there are credible takeover proposals on the table that can significantly reduce debts, the board may have to take the unfortunate decision to cease trading and enter receivership. 

A spokesperson for Air Liberte said, "We understand staff concerns in the absence of firm news about the sales process. However, disclosing details of commercial negotiations is not appropriate at this sensitive stage. Be assured that we are working tirelessly to explore all opportunities to secure the future of Air Liberte, with the aim of finding a solution that safeguards as many jobs as possible."

Continued challenges from low-cost carriers, high fuel costs and overcapacity in the regional aviation market have made Air Liberte's financial position increasingly precarious. The airline has failed to report an annual profit since 2015, despite efforts to restructure. Air Liberte now hopes a new owner with greater scale and resources can turn around its fortunes where management has so far struggled. Staff and passengers will eagerly await updates in the coming weeks on whether such an outcome can be achieved.
