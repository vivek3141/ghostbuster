France to Merge State-Owned Thomson SA with Lagardere Groupe to Create Leading Force in World Defence Industry  

The French government announced today that it will merge its state-owned defence electronics company Thomson SA with the media conglomerate Lagardere Groupe in a bid to create a leading player in the global defence industry. The deal is the largest consolidation of French defence contractors in over a decade and is designed to better position French companies to compete for major international contracts.

Under the all-share deal, Thomson SA will absorb Lagardere’s defence assets, including its stake in major missile maker MBDA, while Lagardere will take full control of Thomson. The new combined group, to be called Lagardere Defense, will have annual revenues of over €15 billion, making it the third-largest aerospace and defence company in Europe after Airbus and BAE Systems.

"This merger makes sense strategically and will allow us to achieve critical mass to compete in export markets, especially in the Middle East and Asia," said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. The deal requires regulatory approval but is expected to close within six months. Shares of both Thomson SA and Lagardere rose over 5% on news of the merger.

The merger highlights the rapid consolidation of the global defence industry, where a handful of massive companies now dominate. It also underscores the importance of scale for winning major international contracts like the upcoming competition to supply fighter jets to India and warships to Brazil. By combining Lagardere's expertise in missiles, space technology and military electronics with Thomson's strengths in radar, avionics and drones, the new group aims to offer integrated "hybrid" systems that countries are increasingly demanding.

However, the tie-up of two major French defence companies is likely to draw scrutiny from competitors who argue it will limit choice and push up prices for military hardware. There are also concerns about job losses from integrating the companies, which together employ over 45,000 people across France. Union leaders have already called on the government to ensure current jobs and workers’ rights are protected.

The deal continues the Macron government’s push to create European industrial champions that can take on global players, especially from the United States and China. Lagardere Defense would join aircraft maker Airbus, train-maker Alstom and chip company STMicroelectronics as French companies supported by the state to compete on the world stage. However, critics argue too much government intervention distorts the free market and rarely achieves the goal of building commercially successful global leaders.

The merger of Thomson SA and Lagardere Groupe is a bold move that could shape the global defence industry, but also brings risks. While scale and cutting-edge technology are indispensable, commercial success will ultimately depend on how the new French champion performs in the open market. Government backing can only go so far.
