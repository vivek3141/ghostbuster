Daewoo Electronics Chairman Promises Jobs and Investments in Thomson Multimedia Acquisition 

Seoul, South Korea - Daewoo Electronics Chairman Kim Woo-Choong today announced the acquisition of Thomson Multimedia for $7.5 billion, marking Daewoo's largest ever foreign acquisition. Speaking at a press conference, Chairman Kim promised the deal would lead to job creation and new investments in both South Korea and France, where Thomson Multimedia is headquartered.

"This acquisition will allow Daewoo to gain valuable technological expertise in the fast-growing digital electronics and home entertainment sector," said Chairman Kim. "It will also give us a strong foothold in European and North American markets, in addition to our current strength in Asia."

The acquisition is the latest in a series of moves by South Korean companies to gain global scale and technological capabilities through foreign acquisitions. Last year, Samsung acquired British home appliance maker Dyson for $10 billion, while Hyundai took over Volvo's commercial vehicles division in 2019.

Thomson Multimedia is a leading manufacturer of televisions, set-top boxes, and DVD and Blu-ray players. The company has 38,000 employees worldwide and owns popular brands like RCA and Technicolor. Thomson shareholders approved the deal last week.

Chairman Kim pledged there would be no job losses in France for at least two years following the takeover. He also promised investments of $500 million over five years to upgrade Thomson's R&D centers and manufacturing facilities across Europe. In return, the French government offered attractive tax incentives and subsidies for the deal.

In South Korea, Chairman Kim said Daewoo will establish a European headquarters for consumer electronics, creating up to 2,000 new high-skilled jobs. The move is seen as a boost for the country's ambitions to become an international innovation hub.

While analysts view the acquisition as a strategic win, investors are wary of the large debt Daewoo is taking on to finance the purchase. Moody's downgraded Daewoo's credit rating following the announcement due to "risks associated with the integration of Thomson's operations and the overall increase in debt." Daewoo's stock price also dropped 8% as shareholders voiced concerns over whether the benefits of the deal would outweigh the costs.

The acquisition still requires final regulatory approval in South Korea and France. If approved, it would be effective from January 1 next year. Chairman Kim expressed confidence the deal poses "no major regulatory hurdles" and that he looks forward to working with European regulators to complete the takeover as swiftly as possible.
