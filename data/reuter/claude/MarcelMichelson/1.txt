Fate of Air Liberte still uncertain as deadline for bids passes 

The fate of regional French airline Air Liberte remained unclear today after an initial deadline for bids to acquire the struggling carrier passed without any firm offers. Air Liberte, which serves destinations across Western Europe from its hub in Lyon, entered bankruptcy protection last month and its court-appointed administrators have been seeking a buyer to rescue the airline.

Multiple airlines, including Air France-KLM, EasyJet, and a group of Air Liberte's own pilots, have expressed interest  in acquiring parts or all of the airline over the past few weeks. However, as of the initial bid deadline yesterday, the administrators have not received any concrete purchase offers. The administrators announced they will keep the bidding process open for at least another week in hopes of securing a viable bid to save Air Liberte.

"We remain optimistic that a deal can be reached to secure Air Liberte's future and the jobs of its over 200 employees," the administrators said in a statement. "Negotiations with some interested parties are still ongoing, so we felt it prudent to keep the door open to new potential offers for a few more days." 

Air Liberte, founded in 1988, operates a fleet of 15 twin-engine craft on routes to cities including Barcelona, Rome, Venice and Prague. The Lyon-based airline has struggled financially in recent years amid rising fuel costs, competition from low-cost carriers, and reduced demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The airline ceased all flights and entered bankruptcy proceedings last month, putting its future in doubt absent a rescue deal.

Employees remained on edge as negotiations drag on without a resolution in sight. "Every day that passes without an offer makes us more concerned that a deal may not materialize," said Marc Dubois, a spokesman for Air Liberte's pilots union. "But the administrators say discussions are ongoing, so we remain hopeful. We all want to keep this airline flying."

The prolonged uncertainty around Air Liberte's fate is also causing headaches for airports and tourism-dependent businesses across the routes Air Liberte serves. "We very much value the connectivity and economic activity that Air Liberte provides," said Hélène Fourcade, a spokeswoman for the tourist bureau of Provence. "Their presence is important for our region, so we hope a solution can be found to preserve their operations."

With the bidding set to remain open for at least another week, the coming days will prove crucial in determining whether Air Liberte can be saved from liquidation. All parties involved will be hoping potential buyers step forward to provide lifeline for the struggling airline. But unless a deal is reached soon, Air Liberte risks running out of time and options, placing the airline's future in further jeopardy.
