Air France ready to take on competition from British Airways in domestic market 

Air France announced today an aggressive plan to challenge British Airways’ dominance in the domestic French air travel market. The flagship carrier of France is launching new routes between major cities, increasing flight frequencies, and lowering fares to gain more domestic customers.

For years, British Airways has led the market for short-haul flights within France through its subsidiary airline called BA CityFlyer. BA CityFlyer operates 50% of all  domestic flights in France, but Air France is looking to change that by expanding its domestic routes, especially between Paris and other big cities like Lyon, Marseille, and Nice.

"The domestic air travel market in France has been underserved for too long, with limited options and high fares for customers," said François Boivin, Air France's head of domestic operations. "We are launching an ambitious plan to become the number one airline for intra-France flights through more competitive pricing, convenience, and service."

As part of the plan, Air France will add over 100 additional weekly flights between Paris and other cities starting in June. It is also eliminating change fees for domestic flights and offering checked baggage allowances, amenities that have given British Airways a competitive advantage in recent years.

The move by Air France to bolster its domestic service comes as France's economy has been slowing, and the airline has faced financial pressure from budget carriers like EasyJet that have also expanded operations domestically. By gaining more of the lucrative short-haul market, Air France aims to increase revenue and better compete on both domestic and international routes. 

However, British Airways has operated in France for over 30 years and has a loyal customer base as well as established operations at key airports like Paris Orly. The competition for domestic air travel in France is set to intensify, giving consumers more options and lower fares, which could put pressure on both airlines' profit margins. The coming months will be crucial as the two rivals go head-to-head for passengers flying within France.
