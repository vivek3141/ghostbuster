French Government to Decide Between Alcatel-Alsthom and Lagardere Groupe for Purchase of Thomson SA

The French government is reviewing two competing offers for the purchase of Thomson SA, a major electronics and media conglomerate. Alcatel-Alsthom, a leading French telecommunications equipment maker, has offered $6.4 billion to acquire Thomson. At the same time, Lagardere Groupe, a French media company, has bid $6.7 billion. The government, which owns a 30% stake in Thomson, is trying to determine which bid is in the best interest of the company and its stakeholders.

Thomson is an important player in strategic industries for France, including defense, aerospace, and multimedia. The company employs over 50,000 people worldwide and generates annual revenue of more than $12 billion. The French government considers Thomson to be a “national champion” and wants to see the company remain largely in French hands. Both Alcatel-Alsthom and Lagardere Groupe have promised to keep the headquarters and key operations of Thomson in France if their bids are successful.

However, there are important differences between the two bidders. Alcatel-Alsthom would likely focus Thomson more on technologies like communications equipment, broadband connections, and other digital services. Lagardere Groupe, on the other hand, is primarily a media company involved in publishing, radio, and television. It would probably put more emphasis on Thomson’s media, broadcasting, and entertainment divisions. The two companies also have different levels of experience with large acquisitions, as Alcatel-Alsthom has made many sizable purchases in recent years while Lagardere Groupe is newer to major corporate takeovers. 

Some analysts argue that Alcatel-Alsthom may be in a better position to turn Thomson around and restore growth, given its deeper experience with mergers and success in the technology sector.  However, others contend that Lagardere Groupe is a more natural fit with Thomson’s key media properties and would face fewer challenges integrating such businesses. The French government is studying submissions from both bidders on their strategy, financing, management team, and commitments to French operations before determining which option is optimal. A final decision is expected within the next 4 to 6 weeks according to government officials.

Whichever company is selected, the purchase of Thomson will be one of the largest ever acquisitions within France. The deal will significantly reshape the country’s telecommunications, aerospace, and media landscape. All sides hope the outcome will ensure a bright future for Thomson and strengthen key strategic industries for France. The decision is an important one, and the government aims to choose the right buyer to take over this industrial icon.
