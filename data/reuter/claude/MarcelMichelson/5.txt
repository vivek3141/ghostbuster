Lagardere-Electronics Deal Ensures Jobs, Digital TV Know-How Will Remain in French Hands  

Paris  — The French conglomerate Lagardere SCA announced today that it has reached an agreement to acquire a majority stake in France's No. 2 consumer electronics maker, Thomson Multimedia, in a deal that values the company at €5.3 billion ($6.6 billion). 

The deal comes as France tries to build up national champions in industries like telecom equipment and consumer electronics. Lagardere, a media and aerospace group that has diversified into telecommunications, said the deal would create a leader in digital television and help preserve jobs in France.

Under the terms of the agreement, Lagardere will purchase a 51% stake in Thomson from France's state-owned utility, Electricite de France. Lagardere will merge its consumer electronics unit with Thomson to create a company with around $6.5 billion in revenue and operations in more than 100 countries.

The new company, to be called Lagardere Active Broadcast, will be a leader in set-top boxes, digital TVs and home networks. It will have 12 research and development centers employing more than 5,000 engineers and will be well positioned to benefit from the global transition to high-definition and digital television.

“This deal will allow us to reach critical mass and to join the first rank of world leaders in multimedia and home networks,” said Arnaud Lagardere, the managing partner of Lagardere SCA. “We wanted to build a true French champion in this sector, and that is what we have done.”

The French government, which still owns a minority stake in Thomson, pushed for a deal with a French partner to avoid a foreign takeover of the company and a loss of jobs and technological expertise. The cultural ministry said it welcomes the deal, "which confirms the dynamism of major French groups and the excellence of our engineers in the fields of multimedia and digital TV.”

Lagardere said the new unit's headquarters would remain in Paris and that it would not close any sites in France. But some Thomson operations may eventually be integrated into Lagardere's existing electronics facilities to cut costs. The companies said they expect to generate cost savings and other "industrial synergies" of €500 million within three years.

The deal caps a tumultuous decade for Thomson, which struggled with losses, job cuts and a failed merger attempt before restructuring in recent years around more promising digital television technologies. For Lagardere, the acquisition is the latest in a series of deals aimed at turning the primarily media and defense group into a major force in telecommunications and multimedia.
