British Airways and Groupe Rivaud Team Up for Bid on Ailing French Airline Air Liberte

British Airways and French transportation conglomerate Groupe Rivaud announced today a joint bid to acquire struggling French airline Air Liberte. The bid, if successful, would divide ownership of Air Liberte between the two companies, with British Airways taking a 51% stake and Groupe Rivaud acquiring 49%. 

Air Liberte, France's third-largest airline, has been battling financial difficulties for the past several years. The airline has struggled with high costs, debt obligations, and increased competition from low-cost carriers. Air Liberte filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019 and has been searching for a buyer or investor to inject capital into the company.

The joint British Airways-Groupe Rivaud bid offers a path for Air Liberte to emerge from bankruptcy under new ownership and with a stronger financial footing. British Airways would gain access to coveted takeoff and landing slots at Paris Orly Airport currently controlled by Air Liberte. Groupe Rivaud, a French company with holdings in airports, seaports, railways, and infrastructure, views the acquisition as an opportunity to strengthen its foothold in the air travel market.

The bid still faces regulatory scrutiny and must be approved by bankruptcy courts and competition authorities before being finalized. But if approved, the deal would be the largest foreign acquisition of a French company in the past decade and a sign of confidence in a company that was on the brink of collapse just a year ago.

"We have long admired Air Liberte and see enormous untapped potential in this airline," said Alex Cruz, CEO of British Airways. "This deal would allow British Airways to better serve our customers in Paris and throughout France, while also ensuring the survival and growth of an iconic French brand."

Not all observers view the bid favorably. Some analysts argue that dividing ownership between two large companies would create complexity and management challenges for Air Liberte. Pilot unions at Air Liberte also oppose foreign ownership and have threatened to strike if a deal is approved. The unions argue that a takeover by British Airways could threaten jobs, working conditions, and the distinctly French culture of Air Liberte.
