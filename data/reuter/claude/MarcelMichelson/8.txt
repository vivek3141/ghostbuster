France Telecom Plans to Expand Internationally due to Competition in France 

France Telecom, the largest telecommunications company in France, announced plans today to aggressively expand into new international markets in the coming years. The move is aimed at driving new subscriber and revenue growth as competition intensifies in the company's home market.

In a press conference, France Telecom CEO Stephane Richard said, "The telecom market in France has become increasingly saturated, with four major network operators fighting for a fixed number of customers. To spur new growth, we need to look beyond our borders and tap into new subscriber bases internationally."

France Telecom currently operates subsidiaries and partnerships in more than 30 countries, but the bulk of its revenue and subscribers still come from its operations in France. However, in recent years, competition from rivals like Bouygues Telecom and Free Mobile has cut into France Telecom's market share. In 2018, France Telecom lost more than 500,000 mobile subscribers and saw its revenue decline by 2 percent.  

To turn the tide, France Telecom plans to enter up to 10 new countries over the next three years, with a focus on Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. The company will use a combination of joint ventures, franchises, and wholly owned subsidiaries to establish its presence in these new markets. France Telecom also plans to aggressively market more bundled offers of fixed and mobile services to customers in the countries where it currently operates.

Some analysts are optimistic this new international growth strategy will benefit France Telecom. "Expanding into emerging markets with less advanced telecom infrastructure presents an opportunity for subscriber and revenue growth," said Jean-Michel Delaveau, a telecom analyst with IDC France. "If executed well, the international push could help offset challenges France Telecom faces at home."

However, other analysts and investors worry that entering new and unfamiliar countries could be an expensive gamble that diverts resources and management attention from the core domestic market. France Telecom's stock price fell 3 percent on the announcement, indicating the strategy still needs to be proven. With 5 million subscribers and annual revenue exceeding â‚¬25 billion, the success or failure of France Telecom's international ambitions could have major implications for telecom markets across Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe.
