Air Liberte staff demand to see takeover bids in full-page newspaper advert

Employees of French regional airline Air Liberte have taken the dramatic step of publishing a full-page newspaper advertisement  demanding that the company's board discloses details of competing takeover bids. The staff of the airline, which is up for sale, say they fear job losses and service cuts unless they can evaluate the seriousness and merits of different offers.

In an open letter addressed to Air Liberte's majority owner, shipping magnate Jacques Dumont, the employees express "deep concern" over the future of the airline as Dumont seeks to sell his 62% stake. They state that "persistent rumors and speculation" over three potential takeover bids from rival airlines have created " anxiety and distress" among staff. The employees demand to see detailed plans from the bidding airlines outlining their strategies and visions for Air Liberte before any sale goes through.

The three rumored bidders are said to be French national carrier Air France, budget airline EasyFly, and regional carrier TwinJet. Air France is thought to want to buy Air Liberte to strengthen its domestic network outside of Paris. EasyFly is looking to expand into the regional market, while TwinJet wants to eliminate a competitor to grow its operations in southern France. However, none of the airlines have publicly confirmed their interest and details of any offers are unknown. 

Air Liberte operates a fleet of 25 ATR 72 turboprop aircraft on routes across France and parts of Italy, Spain and Switzerland. It employs over 1,400 staff, most of whom are based in Marseille, Lyon, and Toulouse. The airline was founded in 1986 but has struggled financially in recent years amid rising fuel costs and competition from high-speed trains.  

The employees' letter expresses support for a takeover by Air France, arguing it would provide the "stability and security" needed for Air Liberte to invest and expand. A deal with EasyFly or TwinJet, on the other hand, would likely mean "broken promises, job cuts, and diminished service to regional communities that depend on us". The staff urge Dumont to "do the responsible and moral thing, be transparent about the options, and consider the human impact of your business decisions".

Dumont has not yet responded publicly to the employees' demands. The fate of Air Liberte remains uncertain until a buyer for Dumont's stake emerges and concludes a deal. For the 1,400 staff, the wait continues with jobs and livelihoods hanging in the balance.
