British Airways and Groupe Rivaud make bid for French regional airline Air Liberte

British Airways and Groupe Rivaud, a French aviation holding company, announced a joint bid today to acquire Air Liberte, a regional carrier based in France. If successful, the acquisition would expand British Airways' operations within France and provide Groupe Rivaud a stake in a major international airline. 

Air Liberte operates a fleet of 25 aircraft, primarily serving domestic routes within France and select European destinations. The airline has faced financial difficulties in recent years due to the economic downturn and increased competition from low-cost carriers. British Airways sees an opportunity to increase its market share for both leisure and business travel within France through a partnership with Air Liberte. For Groupe Rivaud, an investment in British Airways would diversify its portfolio and open up new connections for its passengers.

The bid has been rumored to value Air Liberte at around 200 million euros, a fraction of its valuation just a decade ago. If accepted, British Airways would control 60% of the airline with Groupe Rivaud holding the remaining 40% stake. Air Liberte's management team and operations are expected to stay largely intact, at least for the near term. British Airways has pledged to maintain Air Liberte as an independent carrier focused on the French market while also exploring opportunities to feed more traffic onto British Airways' international network.

Regulatory approval is still needed for the deal to progress. The bid may face scrutiny given British Airways' and Air France's dominance at Paris-Orly and Paris-Charles de Gaulle airports. However, British Airways stressed this move would benefit consumers by preserving a competitor in France's aviation market which has seen substantial consolidation in recent times. An announcement on the outcome of the bid and next steps is anticipated within weeks according to statements from both bidders.

The move reflects the significant challenges regional airlines face in today's competitive environment. Air Liberte would follow other small carriers in Europe that have been absorbed by larger airlines through acquisitions or alliances. For British Airways and Groupe Rivaud, the Air Liberte bid represents a chance to gain greater influence over France's aviation sector and the potential benefits of an expanded partnership should the deal receive clearance to proceed. Overall, the announcement signals further changes ahead for France's airline industry in the coming months and years.
