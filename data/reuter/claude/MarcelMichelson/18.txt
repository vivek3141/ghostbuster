Air France ready to take on competition from British Airways in French domestic market 

Air France has signaled that it intends to defend its dominant position in the French domestic airline market in the face of new competition from British Airways. British Airways recently announced plans to launch six new routes within France, connecting Paris to major cities including Lyon, Marseille, and Nice. The move is seen as a direct challenge to Air France, which currently controls over 60% of the French domestic market.

In response, Air France CEO Anne Rigail said the national carrier is “ready for the competition” and will adjust schedules and fares as needed to match British Airways. “We know the French market better than any other airline,” Rigail said in an interview. “We have a robust domestic network, loyal customers, and competitive fares. We do not take this competition lightly but we are confident in our ability to compete.”  

Air France operates over 200 domestic flights each day within France, providing service to all major cities as well as secondary markets. The airline offers three fare categories on domestic routes to cater to business travelers, vacationers, and budget-conscious passengers. In anticipation of British Airways’ entry into the French market, Air France recently announced fare sales and promotions offering up to 50% off select domestic flights. The company also plans to increase capacity on routes where it will face direct competition from British Airways.

British Airways sees an opportunity to capture market share in France as customers seek alternatives to Air France. The British carrier is hoping to attract both French customers as well as transit passengers connecting via London. British Airways will operate its French domestic routes under the airline’s BA CityFlyer subsidiary, using smaller Embraer E190 aircraft configured with both business and economy class cabins.

“France is one of the biggest travel markets in Europe, yet choice on domestic routes has been limited,” said Luke Hayhoe, general manager of BA CityFlyer. “We believe customers will welcome another option, and our flights will appeal to both business and leisure travelers looking for BA’s premium service at competitive fares.”  

Air France’s Rigail argues that British Airways will struggle to gain traction in France given Air France’s brand recognition and established base of frequent flyers. “While competition typically benefits customers, Air France has significant competitive advantages from our decades of service within France,” Rigail said. The contest between Air France and British Airways in the French domestic market is likely to intensify over the coming months as both airlines battle for customers and a greater share of the lucrative business travel segment.
