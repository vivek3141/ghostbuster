Daewoo Tries to Calm French Concerns Over Planned Purchase of Thomson Multimedia

South Korean conglomerate Daewoo moved to reassure French political and labor leaders over its bid for Thomson Multimedia, a major French electronics manufacturer. Daewoo announced plans last month to acquire a controlling stake in Thomson for $6.5 billion, pending regulatory approval. 

The proposed takeover has stoked concerns in France over job security and the impact on Thomson's strategic position in fields like defense electronics. Thomson is a major supplier to the French military and employs over 54,000 people worldwide, with half of its workforce based in France.

Officials at Daewoo held a series of meetings this week with French presidential candidates, union representatives, and Thomson executives to outline their intentions. Daewoo pledged to maintain Thomson's headquarters and R&D centers in France, protect local jobs, and keep Thomson listed on the Paris stock exchange.

"We want to keep Thomson French," said Park Chung-hoon, President of Daewoo International, the firm's trading arm that would control Thomson. "This is an industrial partnership, not just a financial investment. Thomson's identity, locations, and employees are key to our interest in this acquisition."

Daewoo is one of South Korea's largest chaebols, or family-controlled conglomerates, with 350 subsidiaries worldwide and over $95 billion in annual revenue. While Daewoo pledged to expand Thomson's consumer electronics and multimedia divisions, especially in fast-growing markets like China and India, the deal has sparked concerns that key Thomson defense and aerospace technologies could be moved out of France.

"While Daewoo's promises on jobs are welcome, we have strategic interests to defend," said Michel Destot, a French National Assembly member, and senior member of the Socialist Party. "Guarantees are needed that sensitive military technology and know-how will remain securely in French hands."

Thomson executives, while acknowledging the concerns, said the Daewoo deal represented Thompson's best path for growth amid cutthroat competition and industry consolidation. "This partnership will reinforce our capacity to innovate and strengthen our technological lead," said Thierry Breton, Thompson's Chairman and CEO. 

Analysts say both sides have incentives to reassure the French government and public. For Daewoo, failing to win political and popular support could scuttle the deal or lead to protracted regulatory delays. For Thomson, appearing to give away key strategic assets could weaken the company's position in future French military and aerospace contracts.

Ultimately, analysts expect the deal will likely be approved, as Daewoo has shown willingness to accommodate French demands and the French government wants to avoid being seen as hostile to foreign investment. But the level of concern over corporate national champions like Thomson highlights the unseen barriers that exist in some cross-border mergers, even in an era of increasing global openness. Both companies will have to tread carefully to achieve a successful integration across both business and cultural lines.
