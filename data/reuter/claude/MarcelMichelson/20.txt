Rhone-Poulenc SA Reports Better Than Expected Q3 Profits Despite Product Recall Impact  

The French pharmaceutical giant Rhone- Poulenc SA reported quarterly profits of €152 million, beating analysts' expectations despite a recent recall of its diabetes drug Levisprin. The Q3 results were up 12% from the same period last year, even as  Rhone-Poulenc continues to feel the effects of pausing sales of Levisprin, one of its top-selling drugs.

Revenue was down slightly at €1.8 billion compared with €1.9 billion for Q3 of last year. However, robust sales of Rhone-Poulenc’s cancer drugs and rare disease medicines helped offset the Levisprin impact. The company also cut costs during the quarter by 5% compared to the previous year, improving operating margins.  

The Levisprin recall was announced in early August after some batches of the popular diabetes medication were found to be contaminated. Rhone-Poulenc halted production and recalled the drug from pharmacies and hospitals in 47 countries. The company estimated the recall would reduce full-year earnings by up to €500 million. However, Rhone-Poulenc now says the financial hit will be at the lower end of that range, amid a faster than expected resumption of Levisprin sales.

"The third quarter demonstrated the resilience of our business model with broad-based growth across regions and therapies, even with the ongoing temporary impact of the Levisprin recall," said Rhone-Poulenc CEO Claire Dumont. "We have now addressed the issue, resumed production, and are shipping fresh supplies of Levisprin to markets worldwide. We are well positioned to return to strong, sustainable growth."  

Rhone-Poulenc reaffirmed its full-year guidance and expects 2019 revenues of between €7.2 billion and €7.4 billion, with earnings per share of €5.90 to €6.20. The company's stock was up 3% in early trading on news of the better-than-expected Q3 results. Analysts were encouraged by the company's ability to navigate the challenges from the product recall and the evident strong demand for its key medicines, especially in oncology and rare diseases.
