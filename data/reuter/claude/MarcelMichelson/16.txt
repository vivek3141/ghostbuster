Nouvelles Frontieres Chairman Jacques Maillot Plans to Buy AOM Airlines in Growing Private French Company 

Nouvelles Frontieres, France's leading tour operator, announced today that its Chairman Jacques Maillot plans to purchase struggling French airline AOM. The acquisition of AOM would make Nouvelles Frontieres the second largest air carrier in France after Air France. The move is part of Maillot's strategy to build Nouvelles Frontieres into a major vertically integrated leisure travel and tourism company.

AOM, formerly known as Air Outre-Mer, has faced significant financial difficulties in recent years, accumulating over €200 million in debt. The airline was placed in receivership in August. Maillot sees an opportunity to acquire AOM's assets and network at a substantial discount. By folding AOM into Nouvelles Frontieres, Maillot believes he can cut costs and return the airline to profitability, leveraging the tour operator's existing relationships with travel agencies and customer base.

Nouvelles Frontieres was founded in 1971 by Maillot as a student travel agency. It has since grown into one of Europe's most successful tour operators, booking over 4 million hotel nights and serving over 2 million customers annually across its brands. The company operates outgoing and incoming tours in the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Middle East and Asia. In recent years, Maillot has accelerated the company's expansion into adjacent areas of the travel industry, including the launch of its own hotel brands and cruise line. The purchase of AOM would represent Nouvelles Frontieres' first foray into air travel.

Maillot sees the acquisition of AOM as a pivotal stepping stone towards his goal of building an integrated travel company to rival major conglomerates like TUI Group and Thomas Cook. "By controlling both air travel and ground operations, we will have a key competitive advantage to optimize the customer experience across the entire journey," said Maillot in a statement. However, some analysts warn that Nouvelles Frontieres may be overextending itself by entering the notoriously difficult airline industry, especially as AOM requires a massive financial turnaround.

Subject to regulatory approval, the deal is expected to close by the end of the year. Maillot, who currently owns 52% of Nouvelles Frontieres, will finance the purchase of AOM through a mix of additional bank loans and a €100 million capital increase, reducing his stake to just over 44%. Maillot has pledged to return to his previous ownership level over the next three years as part of his commitment to the company. With the future of AOM now assured, Nouvelles Frontieres seems poised to become a dominant player across the leisure travel sector under the visionary leadership of Jacques Maillot.
