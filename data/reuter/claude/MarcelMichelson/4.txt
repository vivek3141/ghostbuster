France Sells State-Owned Defence & Consumer Electronics Group Thomson SA for Symbolic Franc, Creating Major New Force in World Defence Industry  

The French government announced today that it has sold its long-time state-owned defence and consumer electronics company Thomson SA for the symbolic price of 1 Franc. The buyer is a consortium of major defence contractors from the United States, Germany, and Italy that plans to merge Thomson into a new pan-European defence giant to compete with the largest US defence companies.

The sale of Thomson for a nominal fee marks the end of decades of French government ownership and control of the company, which traces its roots back to the 19th century. Thomson started as an electronics and appliance maker but transitioned into defence and aerospace in the mid-20th century. It has long been a staple of French industrial policy and a symbol of domestic high-tech manufacturing. However, repeated losses, declining sales, and mounting pension liabilities led the French government to seek a buyer in recent years. 

The new owners, calling the new merged company EuroDefence Corp, pledged to maintain and even increase Thomson's 60,000 jobs, most of which are in France. They will invest over €3 billion to modernize facilities, boost R&D spending, and win new contracts. Thomson's existing major defence programmes, like the Rafale fighter jet and the Mistral-class amphibious assault ships, will continue uninterrupted.

EuroDefence will combine Thomson, Germany's KraussMaffei, and Italy's Leonardo Finmeccanica. This new company will be a €35 billion global aerospace, security and defence corporation, eclipsing major British and Israeli competitors and positioning it to pursue larger US contracts. CEOs from the three merging companies said the new entity will able to afford huge investments in next-generation capabilities like hypersonic weapons, autonomous drones, cybersecurity and space-based systems. 

Continued control of strategic French defence assets was a prerequisite for the government approving the sale. EuroDefence pledged to keep sensitive military technology, software, and systems architecture exclusively under French oversight and housed within France. French officials said the merger provides an opportunity to sustain strategic capabilities through shared financial burdens with European partners. For domestic economic security, the investments pledged in new R&D and modernized facilities were also a key factor.

While many question if EuroDefence can successfully merge these complex defence groups across borders, the deal has been hailed as a victory for the long-sought goal of European defence integration and a counter to US dominance of Western arms sales. If successful, this prototype could be a model for future defence industry consolidation at a continental level. For France, it marks both an end of an era but also the start of a new chapter in sustaining national defence aims through European cooperation. Overall, this surprise €1 sale of Thomson may yield a huge payoff for France down the line.
