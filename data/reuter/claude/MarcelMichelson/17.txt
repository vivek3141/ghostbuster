Air France Prepares to Battle British Airways in Domestic Market

Air France announced plans this week to expand its domestic flight offerings within France, in a move seen as directly challenging British Airways’ dominance of short-haul routes in Western Europe. 

Starting in October, Air France will add 18 new destinations within France to its schedule, increasing the number of domestic destinations it serves by over 20 percent. The new routes include service between Paris and smaller regional destinations like Limoges, Pau, and Quimper, which currently have service only from British Airways or its budget carrier Level.

The expansion is a bold step for Air France, which has struggled in recent years with labor unrest and financial losses. But executives believe the time is right to make a power play for the domestic market. “We see an opportunity to boost connections between Paris and some of the underserved markets within our own borders,” said Jérôme Nanty, Air France’s executive vice president for commercial. “At the same time, we want to send a message to our chief European competitor that we intend to vigorously defend our home market.”

British Airways has targeted France as a key market for its low-cost Level planes, and now offers service to 12 destinations within mainland France, in addition to continuing to serve major cities like Marseille, Nice, and Toulouse under its British Airways brand. The aggressive expansion has weakened Air France, which has not kept up with demand for domestic routes beyond Paris. But its new slate of routes will help the airline regain ground. 

The domestic expansion also reflects Air France’s broader turnaround plan under new CEO Anne Rigail, who took over in December 2018 with a mandate to return the airline to profitability. In addition to adding more domestic service, Rigail has restructured Air France’s operations, cut costs, and boosted partnerships with other airlines. The airline posted a strong first-quarter earnings report this year, renewing confidence in its recovery.

Industry analysts welcomed the news of Air France’s domestic push, saying it will strengthen the airline’s footing at home and allow it to better compete with British Airways across Western Europe. “This expansion has been a long time coming for Air France,” said Vaughn Cordle, an airline analyst at Cogo Capital. “Giving up market share on domestic routes has hurt them. These new routes are critical to helping them build back their base.” 

The new domestic routes are available for booking now, with promotional fares starting at 49 euros one-way. Air France hopes bargain fares and the convenience of new direct flights will lure travelers away from British Airways and help their national carrier soar again within France’s borders. Overall, the move places the two rival airlines on course for tense competition in the coming months on both domestic and international fronts.
