Nouvelles Frontieres Chairman Talks Acquisition of AOM After Dropping Out of Air Liberte Deal

Nouvelles Frontieres Group Chairman NG Bruno Saunier announced today that the travel and tourism company has acquired 100% of the shares of French airline AOM. The EUR300 million deal comes just days after Nouvelles Frontieres dropped out of exclusive talks to acquire rival Air Liberte. 

"AOM has a highly complementary route network and customer base to our existing transport and distribution businesses," said Saunier in a press conference. "This acquisition will allow us to vertically integrate our operations, gain valuable aviation expertise, and boost our margins through synergies and cost savings."

Privately-held AOM is France's second largest airline, operating a fleet of 54 aircraft and serving over 80 destinations in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia from its hub at Paris Orly airport. The airline has 3,500 employees and in 2018 generated revenues of EUR2.2 billion, although it reported net losses of EUR125 million.

Nouvelles Frontieres, a listed company with a market capitalization of EUR1.5 billion, owns travel agencies, tour operators and charter airlines across Europe. However, it has lacked a major scheduled airline. Talks to acquire Air Liberte fell apart last week due to a failure to agree on a fair valuation and concerns that doubling down in the low-margin, capital-intensive airline sector carried substantial risks.

According to analysts, acquiring AOM addresses these issues by providing network and aviation expertise at a discount to Air Liberte, while still allowing substantial cost savings and revenue synergies with Nouvelles Frontieres’ existing divisions. “AOM’s loses were mainly due to poor management, inefficient operations, and too little differentiation from competitors,” said Jean-Louis Girerd, transportation analyst at Investisseurs Conseils, a Paris advisory firm. “Under Nouvelles Frontieres, it has a real chance of turning profitable within two to three years.”

Saunier stated that there were no planned job losses from the acquisition and that AOM would continue to operate under its own brand. However, many analysts expect some reduction in headcount and streamlining of AOM's fleet as part of the restructuring. Nouvelles Frontieres' shares rose 3.2% on news of the takeover, which is still subject to regulatory approval. The deal is expected to be finalized by the end of this year.
