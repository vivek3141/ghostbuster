British Airways and French bank Rivaud join forces to bid for Air Liberte 

British Airways, the UK's national carrier, announced today that it has formed an alliance with French investment bank Rivaud to make a joint bid for struggling French airline Air Liberte. The two companies released a statement saying they have made a formal offer to acquire 100% of Air Liberte for an undisclosed amount. 

Air Liberte, France's second largest airline which operates domestic and short-haul routes in Europe, has been looking for a buyer for the past several months. The airline's financial situation has worsened due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air travel. Air Liberte's long-haul expansion plans had also further strained its balance sheet prior to the crisis.

The bid from British Airways and Rivaud is a lifeline for Air Liberte which was at risk of bankruptcy without new investment. The deal would allow Air Liberte to recapitalize its balance sheet and provide it access to British Airways' wider network to funnel more passengers into its European routes. British Airways would gain valuable take-off and landing slots at Paris Orly airport currently used by Air Liberte.

British Airways and Rivaud have not yet provided details on how they would integrate Air Liberte's operations with its own or the corporate governance structure of the proposed deal. Air France, France's national carrier and largest airline, is likely to oppose the transaction to prevent further consolidation of market share by its competitors. The French government, which currently owns 15% of Air France, will also have a say in any deal for Air Liberte given its importance in the French aviation sector.

The bid follows British Airways' takeover of German carrier Lufthansa's subsidiary Eurowings last year for $325 million. British Airways is looking to expand in Europe's short-haul market to take advantage of the growth in budget travel after it has refocused on long-haul routes on larger, more fuel-efficient aircraft in its mainline fleet. Rivaud, meanwhile, aims to expand its luxury and leisure airline investments. The bank previously acquired troubled operators BMI and Flybe before selling them on to International Airlines Group and Virgin Atlantic, respectively.
