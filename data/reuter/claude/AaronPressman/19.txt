Federal Reserve Votes to Allow Banks to Expand into Securities Industry 

The Federal Reserve voted today to approve changes that will allow major U.S. banks to expand into the securities and trading business. The move rolls back key parts of the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era law that separated commercial and investment banking for decades.

The vote was 3 to 2, along party lines, with the Federal Reserve's three Republican-appointed governors in favor and two Democrat-appointed governors opposed. The changes will allow banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup to engage in trading, underwriting, and market-making for stocks, bonds, and other financial products.

Supporters argue that allowing banks back into the securities business will boost competition and benefit consumers. "Banks will be able to offer more comprehensive services at a lower cost," said Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chairman appointed by President Trump. Critics counter that mixing commercial and investment banking again could lead to risky behavior and conflicts of interest, and ultimately put taxpayers at risk of having to fund a bailout during a crisis.

The Glass-Steagall provisions were put in place in 1933 to separate commercial banks, which take consumer deposits, from investment banks that engage in more speculative activities like trading stocks and bonds. The restrictions were eased in 1999 during the Clinton administration, and today only a few remaining parts of Glass-Steagall still stand. The vote today essentially eliminates most of what was left.

Banking industry groups praised the move, saying U.S. banks will now be on an even playing field with foreign competitors. Consumer advocacy groups condemned the changes, arguing that repealing more of Glass-Steagall opens the door to fraud and predatory practices, just a decade after abusive behavior by big banks fueled the financial crisis. But Fed Chairman Powell said regulators now have stronger rules to prevent risky lending and protect consumers.

The policy change is a major win for the large banks that will now have more freedom to generate profits from trading and other investment banking activities. It also achieves a key goal of the Trump administration to deregulate the financial industry. The new rules will take effect in 180 days.
