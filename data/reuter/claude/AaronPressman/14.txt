U.S. District Court Judge Bars New Federal Regulations Allowing for Credit Union Membership Expansion

Yesterday, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued an injunction barring the regulations recently passed by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) that would expand the ability of credit unions to increase their membership. The new regulations, approved by the NCUA in October, would have allowed credit unions to base membership on  affiliations such as employment at a college or hospital, or membership in an association.  

In issuing the injunction, Judge Jackson sided with the American Bankers Association and other banking groups who have opposed the new regulations on credit union membership expansion. The groups argued that the NCUA had overstepped its statutory authority by approving such a broad expansion of membership criteria. Under the Federal Credit Union Act, credit unions are limited to members who have a common bond, such as working for the same employer or belonging to the same association.

Credit unions had argued that the new membership criteria simply reflect the realities of modern communities and connections in the 21st century. However, bankers associations contended that the expansion threatened the original mission of credit unions to serve specific groups that lacked access to traditional banking services. They argue that broad credit union membership access would threaten community banks in particular. 

In her ruling, Judge Jackson wrote that the new NCUA regulations "stretch the meaning of common bond membership beyond recognition." She said the associations and groups that could qualify for membership were too loosely connected to meet the common bond requirement set in law. Her injunction prevents the NCUA from implementing the new rules pending the resolution of the legal challenges against them.

Reaction from credit union groups was swift and disappointed. The National Association of Federal Credit Unions called the decision "a significant setback" that deprives consumers of more choices in their banking relationships. The Credit Union National Association said it would appeal the injunction to defend the ability of credit unions to adapt to changes in communities and technology.

Banking groups hailed the decision as protecting the integrity of the credit union system and defending community banks from unfair competition. The American Bankers Association praised the court for "recognizing these changes were unlawful and not consistent with the Federal Credit Union Act." Community bankers have argued the new membership rules threaten the viability of local banks by allowing credit unions to become major competitors without the same oversight and regulations as traditional banks.

No immediate comments were available from the NCUA on potential responses or next steps to the injunction barring their new membership rules. Unless overturned on appeal, Judge Jackson's ruling prevents the expansion of credit union membership through associations and groups that do not meet the traditional common bond requirement. The legal process is expected to continue for months and potentially years before a final resolution is reached.
