Federal Reserve's Vote to Expand Bank Activities Heightens Drive to Overhaul U.S. Banking Regulations, According to Analysts and Industry Officials  

The Federal Reserve's approval this week to allow large banks to engage in a wider set of commercial activities is fueling calls by analysts and industry groups to overhaul U.S. banking laws.

On Monday, the Fed voted to expand the list of permitted activities for financial holding companies under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. The change allows major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America to engage in a broader set of investment banking, insurance, and commercial activities that were previously prohibited.

Advocates argue this provides more flexibility for large banks to serve clients and boost revenue, but critics counter it increases risks to the financial system only a decade after the global financial crisis. In response, groups representing community banks and regional lenders are urging Congress to revise the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to create a "tiered system" with more restrictions on the largest banks.

"The biggest banks are getting bigger while community banks are disappearing," said Paul Merski, chief economist at the Independent Community Bankers of America. "We need guardrails to rein in the excessive risks from mega banks to protect taxpayers."

The Fed's move highlights the ongoing debate over the influence of major financial institutions on the broader economy. Despite stricter capital requirements imposed after the crisis, the assets of the six largest U.S. banks have soared to nearly $11 trillion, controlling more than 50% of U.S. banking assets.  

Industry groups argue existing rules are unnecessarily limiting growth and U.S. competitiveness versus foreign banks with fewer restrictions. They are advocating for changes to soften regulations from the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.

"The U.S. banking system remains stuck in a post-crisis mindset with an outdated regulatory framework," said Rob Nichols, CEO of the American Bankers Association. "Congress needs to refine the reforms to unleash the ability of banks to support economic growth."

The debate is unfolding while regulators are reviewing public comments on ways to simplify capital rules that could further boost lending by large banks. Significant changes may prove challenging, though, with a divided Congress and 2020 elections on the horizon.
