Internet Society Forms Committee to Study Proposal for Dramatic Expansion of Addresses  

The Internet Society, a nonprofit organization devoted to advancements in online technologies, announced today the formation of a special committee to study a proposal to dramatically expand the number of available Internet addresses. For decades, Internet addresses have relied on the IPv4 standard which provides about 4.3 billion unique addresses. With the growth of the Internet of Things, more connected devices and global Internet access, IPv4 addresses are nearly exhausted.

A new standard called IPv6 was created to expand the number of available addresses to over 340 undecillion (a number with 36 zeroes). However, adoption of IPv6 has been slow as it requires updates to networking equipment, software and devices. If adopted more widely, IPv6 could provide enough addresses for the exponential growth of connected devices and expanded global Internet access for many years to come.

The new committee will evaluate the current state of IPv6 adoption and whether accelerating the transition to IPv6 addressing should become an urgent priority for the Internet Society and the global technology community. "IPv6 provides a solution to accommodate the future of the Internet," said Internet Society Board Chairman Andrew Sullivan. "But more needs to be done to drive adoption and ensure a smooth transition from IPv4. This committee will help us determine if we need to mount a largescale advocacy campaign to avoid disruption as IPv4 addresses run out."

Some experts argue that with additional technology innovations like network address translation (NAT), the remaining IPv4 addresses can meet demand for the next 5 to 10 years, giving more time for a gradual IPv6 adoption. However, others warn that continuing to rely on IPv4 risks fragmenting parts of the Internet as some new devices and networks are cut off from full Internet access without sufficient IPv4 addresses.

The 16-member committee will review these arguments and various adoption scenarios before making a recommendation to the Internet Society leadership on whether to lead a coordinated, global effort to spur faster adoption of IPv6 address technology across public and private networks, equipment and connected devices. The committee will issue its recommendations in a final report expected in early 2020.
