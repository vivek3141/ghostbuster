Trademark experts take action to reduce internet address disputes

Trademark groups and domain name registrars are working together to implement new procedures aimed at reducing trademark disputes over internet addresses. The new processes will allow companies and organizations to register domain names that match or contain their trademarks and brand names.

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which oversees internet addresses, has approved recommendations from an intellectual property constituency group to streamline the domain name registration process for trademark holders. The recommendations will allow companies to obtain website addresses that precisely match their company or product names. The previous system made it difficult for companies to get domain names that were an exact match or included their trademarks.

Under the new rules, companies and organizations can preregister website addresses based on their legally protected trademarks and brand names. Once the domain names become available, the trademark holders will have first rights to obtain them. This will help curb the practice of “cybersquatting,” where individuals register internet addresses that contain well-known trademarks to try and sell them for a profit.

The changes will make it much more straightforward for companies to get the web addresses they want and need for their digital presence,” said intellectual property attorney Kevin Hickey. “By preregistering trademark-related domain names, organizations will reclaim control over their online brands.”

The new rules will be implemented gradually over the next 12 months for several top-level domain names, including .com, .net., and .org. Trademark holders are advised to review a list of newly available internet address extensions to determine which are relevant to their brands. The new procedures are seen as an important step toward enhancing trust and security in digital commerce.
