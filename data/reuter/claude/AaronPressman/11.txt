Internet Usage Continues to Grow While Online Services Struggle to Add New Customers, Survey Finds  

A new survey of internet usage and online service adoption shows that while more people than ever are accessing the internet, many major tech companies are finding it challenging to attract new customers. The Pew Research Center report found that 96% of Americans now use the internet in some form, up from 90% in 2015. However, growth in new customers for services like social media, streaming media, and ecommerce has slowed significantly.  

Facebook, the world's largest social network, added only 10 million new monthly users in the last year, its smallest gain in company history. Netflix, the popular video streaming service, added only 2.2 million new subscribers in the first quarter of 2020, well below the over 7 million new subscribers it averaged per quarter over the last 2 years. And Amazon, the ecommerce and tech giant, saw its slowest revenue growth in over 3 years during the first quarter of 2020.

While near saturation of key demographics like younger, more affluent populations with smartphones contributes to the slowing growth, competition from smaller upstarts is also a factor, according to analysts. "There are only so many hours in the day for people to spend on new internet services," said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. "The major players now have to take customers away from others rather than expanding the pie."   

Some companies have turned to new products and offerings to drive growth. Facebook is investing heavily in virtual and augmented reality. Netflix continues to expand its library of original films and shows. And Amazon has moved into new areas like healthcare, gaming, and cloud computing services for businesses.   
  
The overall growth in internet adoption means a larger addressable market for all companies. However, the days of rapid, exponential growth may be over for the biggest online services. Customer acquisition and retention are poised to become much bigger challenges, and competition for people's time and attention will only intensify. Standing out from the crowd and continually improving services to keep existing customers engaged will be key to success in this next phase of the internet.
