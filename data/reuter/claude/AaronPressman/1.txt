US Postal Service Announces Plan to Enhance Security and Reliability of E-Commerce 

The US Postal Service (USPS) today announced a new strategic plan to strengthen the security of mail and packages, especially those containing goods purchased online. The three-year "Delivering the Future" plan includes $25 billion in investments to modernize USPS operations, including the rollout of new scanners, sorting equipment, vehicles, and carrier handheld devices.

"The boom in e-commerce has put huge volume pressure on our system," said Postmaster General Megan J. Brennan. "These investments will help us enhance our efficiency, improve customer experiences, and maintain the highest delivery standards, while also equipping us to handle the continued growth of e-commerce in the years to come."

A key part of the plan is the deployment of over 200 new high-tech mail and package sorting machines across the country. These machines use advanced scanning technology to detect items that could contain suspicious or hazardous materials. They will also enable faster processing and sorting of the huge volume of parcels moving through the USPS system, especially important during peak holiday periods. 

The plan also calls for an additional 50,000 carrier handheld mobile devices to be deployed over the next three years. These devices will give mail carriers real-time visibility into package delivery updates, reducing the need for paper tracking slips and speeding up the overall delivery process. The USPS is also testing pilot programs with GPS and geofencing technologies to enable more dynamic routing of carriers during their daily rounds.

A new fleet of over 50,000 delivery vehicles, including more than 10,000 new mail trucks, will be rolled out to replace the aging vehicles currently in use. The new trucks are ergonomically designed to make package loading and unloading more efficient. They will also be equipped with on-board package scanning and sorting equipment that provides delivery data in real time.  

Critics argue that the USPS should focus on paring down operating costs rather than investing in new infrastructure. However, others counter that the innovations in the new strategic plan are critical for the USPS to keep up with the rapid pace of change in e-commerce and ensure the ongoing viability of its operations. The full plan will be implemented over the next three years, with most new scanners, sorting machines, handheld devices, and delivery vehicles deployed by the end of 2021.
