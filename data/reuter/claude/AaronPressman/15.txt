Clinton Advisers Call for "Free Market" Policies to Boost Internet Economy 

Key economic advisers to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have recommended that she embrace "free market" oriented policies to boost growth in the internet sector in order to stimulate the economy. In a policy memo obtained by The Washington Post, three economists who have advised Clinton in the past argue that reducing regulations on technology companies, limiting taxation of internet firms, and protecting net neutrality could help spur innovation and job growth over the next decade.

The recommendations come as Clinton ramps up her policy platform during the early stages of her presidential campaign. While Clinton has long been an ally of Silicon Valley and supported net neutrality rules as Secretary of State, she has recently voiced concerns over issues like privacy and market concentration in the tech industry. The memo signals an effort by her advisers to nudge Clinton to the center on tech policy and reaffirm her free market instincts.

Specifically, the economists recommend avoiding new regulations on issues like data privacy where possible, arguing that strict rules could "stifle growth." They also call for limiting taxes on internet companies by avoiding an increase in capital gains taxes and new tariffs. While Clinton has proposed raising capital gains taxes on short-term trading to fund her infrastructure plan, the memo suggests she exempt internet companies. 

On net neutrality, the memo argues for legislation to make the FCC's rules permanent and enforceable to provide more certainty to tech companies. FCC Chairman Tom Wheelerâ€™s rules, passed in 2015, barred internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic or offering paid fast lanes. The future of the rules remains in doubt, however, following a court challenge from major broadband companies. 

Notably absent from the recommendations are policies touted by liberal activists and some of Clinton's primary opponents like breaking up major tech companies, taxing robots, or implementing a universal basic income. The memo's authors contend such policies could negatively impact growth in a fast-changing sector. 

A Clinton campaign spokesperson said the memo reflects only the views of the authors and that Clinton's official policy positions on tech issues will be shaped by a wider range of advisers. Still, the memo provides an early sign that Clinton's centrist allies want her to avoid antagonizing the powerful internet industry and instead embrace a deregulatory, lightly-taxed approach to the digital economy. For Clinton, adopting such a stance risks criticism from both the left and the right but could also appeal to moderate voters who favor market-based policies.
