Software Industry Group Withdraws Support for Clinton’s Encryption Export Policy  

The Software Alliance, an industry trade group representing many of the world’s largest software companies, announced today that it is withdrawing its support for the Clinton administration’s policy on exporting encryption technologies. The group had initially backed the administration’s efforts to restrict the export of strong encryption software and supported the concept of key escrow, in which the government would maintain copies of encryption keys to allow lawful access to encrypted data.

However, in a letter today to Commerce Secretary William Daley, the Software Alliance said that its members can no longer endorse the administration’s approach in light of widespread opposition from customers and concerns that escrowed encryption would present vulnerabilities. “It is now clear that the policy does not have the support of the software industry or our customers,” said Robert Holleyman, president and CEO of the Software Alliance. 

The group, which represents companies such as Microsoft, IBM, and Adobe, had been an important ally of the administration in crafting its encryption export policy. Its withdrawal of support deals a significant blow to the administration as it considers revisions to the policy in the face of multiple court challenges. A federal judge recently ruled that restrictions on the export of encryption source code violated free speech rights.

Administration officials expressed disappointment at the announcement. “We have worked closely with the software industry to develop a balanced policy that protects both privacy and national security,” said Commerce Department spokesperson Sheila McCann. “We hope to continue that partnership as we update the rules to address the court's concerns.” However, with the opposition of its former allies as well as civil liberties groups, the administration may have to significantly overhaul its approach to pass legal muster.

Human rights organizations applauded the Software Alliance's reversal. "This is a watershed moment in the debate over encryption policy," said Rebecca Green, policy analyst at the Digital Rights Coalition. "The Clinton administration can no longer claim that its unworkable scheme has the support of industry."

The Software Alliance's announcement suggests that technology companies are responding to the concerns of their customers, who overwhelmingly oppose government-mandated backdoors in encryption systems. A recent survey found that over 80% of businesses would not purchase encryption software if it contained key escrow. Congress is also weighing in, with legislation proposed to limit the administration's authority over encryption exports.

Between the court rulings, opposition from industry and customers, and actions by Congress, the Clinton administration faces mounting pressure to abandon its encryption policy. Its next move will have significant implications for privacy, security, and civil liberties in the digital age. For now, its policy that sought to balance these competing interests appears increasingly unbalanced. The software industry has spoken, and governments around the world hoping to regulate encryption are on notice.
