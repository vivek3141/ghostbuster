Access to Internet Boosts Learning: Study Shows Elementary Students with Internet Access Perform Better in School 

A new study finds that elementary school students with access to high-speed Internet at home have higher academic performance and test scores. The research, conducted by economists at University of California, Berkeley and University of Munich, looked at broadband access and academic achievement of over 300,000 students attending California public schools.

The study found that students in households with broadband Internet scored higher on standardized tests in reading and math, even when controlling for other factors like family income, parental education, and ethnicity. The performance boost was most significant for students in lower-income households and communities. 

“Broadband access is pivotal for education in the 21st century,” said co-author Professor Markus Mobius. “The Internet has become crucial for accessing new knowledge, doing research, and learning technical skills that are vital across many occupations and careers. Our findings show that affordable broadband access should be considered as important for children's education as factors like income, family background, and quality of schools.”

The researchers analyzed student scores on California's standardized Smarter Balanced tests between 2015 to 2017. They found that students with home Internet access scored 7.5 percentage points higher in reading and 8.9 percentage points higher in math compared to students without broadband connectivity at home. For lower-income students, the impact was even greater—13.1 percentage points higher in reading and 15.3 percentage points higher in math. 

The findings highlight the importance of ensuring all students have equal access to tools that boost learning, especially for those in lower-income areas. “Broadband Internet has become such an essential part of education today,” added Mobius. “Students without access are at a major disadvantage for developing skills that will be crucial for their success and opportunity in the future.” Overall, the study provides further evidence that Internet access should be considered a basic necessity and policymakers must do more to provide affordable high-speed connectivity for all students.
