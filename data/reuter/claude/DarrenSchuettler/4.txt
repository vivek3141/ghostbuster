Jack Kemp's Son Finds Football Success and Anonymity in Canada

Jeff Kemp, son of the late NFL star and congressman Jack Kemp, has found success and relative anonymity as a quarterback and coach in the Canadian Football League. Jeff Kemp recently completed his ninth season as the starting quarterback for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, leading the team to the playoffs for the fifth straight year.

Despite his accomplished football career and famous NFL lineage, Jeff Kemp has managed to fly largely under the radar north of the border. "In Canada, I'm just another quarterback," Kemp said. "The name recognition isn't there like it was for my dad in the States. I can focus on my job and being part of the team."

Kemp was a star quarterback at Dartmouth College, where he still holds several passing records, before short stints with four NFL teams. He struggled to get much playing time in the NFL, however, proving to be more successful in Canada where the game has some key differences. The CFL field is larger, teams only have 3 downs to gain 10 yards instead of 4, and there are 12 players per side instead of 11. "The wider field and extra guy have suited my style well," Kemp said. "I've been able to utilize my passing and mobility."

Since joining Winnipeg in 2012, Kemp has thrived. He was named the CFL's Most Outstanding Player in 2015 when he passed for a career-high 5,453 yards and 32 touchdowns. But individual accolades have meant less to Kemp than team success. "My goal every year is to give us the best chance to compete for a Grey Cup," he said, referring to the CFL's championship trophy. The Blue Bombers came close again this year, losing in the Western Conference Finals.   

Off the field, Kemp lives a quiet life with his wife and two children outside Winnipeg. His father Jack was a leader in the Republican party, serving 18 years in Congress representing Buffalo, NY as well as running for Vice President on Bob Dole's 1996 ticket. "My dad and I shared a love of football but had different passions beyond that," Kemp said. "I've always just wanted to be the best quarterback and teammate I could."

At age 43, Kemp acknowledges he is likely in his final years as a pro quarterback. But he hopes to remain in the CFL as a coach to help develop the next generation. "I love this game and want to give back," Kemp said. For the son of an NFL legend, helping players in Canada unlock their potential could prove another worthy success and help extend the Kemp football legacy in a place where his name is simply another part of the game.
