Canada's Big Six banks set to report another round of buoyant profits for Q3 

Canada's largest banks are poised to announce strong profits for the third quarter, extending a steady rebound from the economic turmoil sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic last year.

The Big Six banks – Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada – are scheduled to release their latest quarterly results this week. Analysts expect the banks will report healthy loan growth and net interest income, aided by Canada's red-hot housing market and recovering economy.

"We anticipate another strong quarter for the Canadian banks with good loan growth, stable margins, and improving fee income," Barclays analyst John Aiken said in a note. The banks also continue to benefit from provisions set aside last year in anticipation of bad loans that have failed to materialize in large numbers, allowing them to record gains from the release of those reserves.

RBC, Canada's largest lender, kicked off the reporting season Tuesday, announcing third-quarter net income of $4.3-billion, up 34 per cent from the same quarter last year. The bank saw strong growth in its capital markets, insurance and wealth management divisions, even as its retail banking operations slowed from the highs of earlier in the pandemic. 

"As the recovery took hold, we maintained our disciplined approach to risk and cost management and continued to invest in our strategic priorities," RBC chief executive Dave McKay said in a statement.

TD, Scotiabank and BMO report on Wednesday, followed by CIBC on Thursday. National Bank closes out the results on Friday. 

Collectively, the Big Six banks are expected to report $11.3-billion in adjusted earnings for the third quarter, up 52 per cent from the same period in 2020, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue is forecast to climb 6.4 per cent to $31.9-billion.

The banks' strong performance in recent months has led analysts at Credit Suisse to raise their price targets and ratings on the sector. "We see further upward pressure on estimates, reflecting continued macro outperformance, potential reserve releases, and revenue synergies," Credit Suisse analyst Joo Ho Kim said in a report. The analysts upgraded RBC, BMO, Scotia and National Bank to "outperform" and hiked their targets for all six banks.

Canada's robust economic activity has provided ideal conditions for the banks to thrive. The housing market posted its fifth straight month of record sales in September, while employment has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and loosening of public health restrictions have spurred strong consumer and business spending.  

Still, the spread of the Delta variant and the prospect of rising interest rates pose risks. The Bank of Canada signaled this month that it could raise rates earlier than expected in 2022 to curb inflation. Higher rates benefit banks by allowing them to charge more for loans, but they also slow down mortgage lending and squeeze consumer borrowing.  

"While we remain constructive on the group, we believe that current valuation and risks around the economic reopening warrant some caution," Aiken said. The banks may struggle to match their blockbuster results from the past two quarters, making their outlooks for the remainder of the year highly anticipated by investors along with this week's results.
