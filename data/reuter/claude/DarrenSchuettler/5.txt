Molson Breweries loses right to brew top-selling Coors Light beer: shares sink 

Molson Coors Brewing Company's stock plunged nearly 20% today after the company announced it will no longer be brewing and distributing Coors Light beer in Canada, its top-selling brand. The Coors Brewing Company, owned by Molson Coors, owns the rights to brew and distribute Coors Light globally but had licensed the Canadian rights to Molson Breweries. That licensing agreement will expire at the end of this year and will not be renewed, Coors Brewing Company announced today. 

The decision is a blow to Molson Breweries, which relies on Coors Light for over 25% of its total sales in Canada. Coors Light is the best-selling beer in Canada, generating over $1 billion in annual revenue for Molson Breweries. Without the rights to the brand, Molson Breweries faces a major hit to its sales, profits and market share in the country.

In a statement, Molson Breweries called the move "surprising and disappointing." The company said it had operated under the assumption that its Canadian licensing rights to Coors Light would be extended, as they have numerous times in the past. However, Coors Brewing Company now believes it can better grow the Coors Light brand in Canada by handling its own distribution and marketing.

For consumers, little is expected to change. Coors Light will still be available at bars, restaurants, and liquor stores across Canada. However, Coors Brewing Company will now handle the brewing, distribution, and marketing efforts internally rather than relying on Molson Breweries as a licensed partner. 

Coors Brewing Company said it will work to ensure a "smooth transition" of the Coors Light brand in Canada to minimize disruption. However, industry analysts expect Molson Breweries will struggle to fill the sizable hole in revenue, market share, and growth that the loss of Coors Light creates. The company's share price is expected to face sustained pressure as the Canadian beer market becomes even more competitive.

The surprise move highlights the ongoing battle between large global brewers in a market that is seeing consumption of traditional beers decline. As major brands fight for market dominance, licensing deals and distribution rights have become key leverage points, even threatening the operations of market leaders like Molson Breweries. For beer drinkers, it means an increasingly fragmented and complex landscape of who owns the rights to which brands in their country or region.
