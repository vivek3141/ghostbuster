Toronto Stocks End Weaker Amid Profit Taking After Record Highs

Toronto stocks closed lower as investors locked in profits from record highs the day before, in the face of broadly weaker markets across North America. 

The S&P/TSX Composite Index fell 116.75 points, or 0.7%, to 16,305.21. The decline snapped a two-day winning streak  that saw the key benchmark set a new closing record twice this week. The TSX was coming off an up-month in February, during which it gained 2.1%.

"After hitting a record high, it's not surprising to see the market pause or pull back as some investors decide to book profits," said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. "Markets don't go straight up."

All sectors finished in the red, with energy and materials leading the retreat as commodities came off highs amid a stronger U.S. dollar. The energy group, which accounts for around 18% of the TSX's weight, sank 2.7% while materials, home to gold and copper producers, lost 1.7%.

Encana Corp shares tumbled 3.9% and Canadian Natural Resources declined 3.6% as U.S. crude oil prices dropped over 3% to around $45.50 a barrel.  Sealed deals also weighed on the energy sector, with Enbridge Inc shares losing 3.3%. 

Teck Resources fell 2.9% and First Quantum Minerals declined 2.6% to put pressure on materials. Gold futures pulled back from recent highs, falling 0.7% to $1,309.20 an ounce. 

Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar weakened 0.2% to 75.01 U.S. cents as the greenback broadly gained ground against major currencies. 

Still, markets on both sides of the border remain upbeat about economic growth prospects this year based on planned tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation under U.S. President Donald Trump. 

"The trend is still up heading into the U.S. earnings season," Mr. Cieszynski said. "We still anticipate more gains over the balance of the year with any setback likely to be short-term in nature."
