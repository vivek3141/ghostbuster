Sale Rumors Surround Montreal Canadiens Franchise, Molson Cos. Ltd. Denies Involvement 

Rumors are swirling this week that the storied Montreal Canadiens hockey franchise may be up for sale. Anonymous sources have suggested that ownership group Molson Coors Brewing Company is exploring a potential sale of the team that could fetch over $1.5 billion USD. However, Molson Coors has denied these rumors and says there are no plans to sell the Canadiens at this time.

The Canadiens are one of the most successful and valuable franchises in the National Hockey League. They have won 24 Stanley Cup championships, more than any other team. The Canadiens also remain an extraordinarily profitable team, with Forbes recently valuing the franchise at $1.34 billion USD, third highest in the NHL. The team plays at the Bell Centre in Montreal, which they also own, and the venue is renowned for its electric atmosphere. 

With the prospects of a significant return on investment and rising franchise values across sports, selling the Canadiens could be an appealing option for ownership. However, the Molson family has deep ties to both the city of Montreal and the Canadiens specifically. The Molson family has owned the majority of the team since 1957 and has shown no desire to sell in the past. The current chairman of Molson Coors, Andrew Molson, reacted strongly against this week's rumors.

"The Montreal Canadiens are a key part of Molson Coors sports and entertainment portfolio and an iconic institution with a rich history in Quebec and across Canada," said Molson in a statement. "Our company has absolutely no plans to sell the team. The Canadiens are an integral part of our company's identity and growth strategy."
