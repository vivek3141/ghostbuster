Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Index Breaks 5600 Barrier, Sets 50th Record Close of 1996 

The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 index of top Canadian shares closed at a record high for the 50th time this year on Tuesday. Strong gains in the mining, communications, and manufacturing sectors pushed the TSE 300 to close at 5624.12 points, up 0.6% and breaking through the 5600 barrier for the first time. 

The mining sector led the rally, boosted by rising gold prices and strong earnings reports. Barrick Gold, the world's largest gold producer, reported third quarter profits that beat analyst expectations and raised its dividend, sending its shares up 7.5%. Vancouver-based Teck Resources also beat earnings forecasts and gained 3.7%.

The technology and communications sector was lifted by BlackBerry maker Research in Motion, which jumped 4.4% after announcing a stock repurchase plan. Automotive parts maker Magna International climbed 2.9% on higher profits.

The energy sector declined as oil prices fell due to oversupply concerns. Canadian Natural Resources dropped 2.2% and Encana Corp fell 1.4%. Pipeline operators Enbridge and TransCanada Corp also slipped.

Banks were mixed, with TD Bank gaining 0.8% while Bank of Montreal lost 0.4%. Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce were little changed.

Most economists expect solid economic growth in Canada to continue boosting corporate profits and supporting equity markets. However, trade tensions with the U.S. and a slowing global economy pose risks. 

Craig Fehr, investment strategist at Edward Jones, said the TSE 300's milestone shows that "equity markets and investor sentiment have remained quite resilient." However, he warned that markets may be "susceptible to bouts of volatility" if economic data starts to deteriorate.

The loonie strengthened slightly against the U.S. dollar, gaining 0.2 cents to 74.49 cents as investors bet on another interest rate increase from the Bank of Canada in December. Bond yields were flat as the Canadian 10-year held steady at 2.35%.

Overall, 281 million shares traded hands on the exchange, above the monthly average.
