Fidelity Investments Star Manager Under Investigation by Canadian Regulator 

The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) is investigating star Fidelity Investments portfolio manager Gavin Stone over his trading activities and disclosures regarding a Canadian small-cap fund. The OSC started its investigation earlier this year to determine whether Stone’s trading in thinly traded stocks and disclosure of those trades comply with rules around conflict of interest and insider trading.

Stone oversees more than $5 billion in assets for Fidelity Investments Canada, including the Fidelity Special Situations Fund. That fund focuses on investing in riskier small and mid-size Canadian companies. Some of those holdings are lightly traded penny stocks, where a large buy or sell order can significantly impact the stock price. The OSC is probing occasions where Stone sold or bought stocks and whether he properly disclosed those trades to avoid benefiting at the expense of other investors. 

The investigation into Stone’s trading was triggered in part by a whistleblower complaint, according to sources familiar with the matter. The complaint alleged that Stone used his position as a portfolio manager to time trades in a way that artificially boosted the value of holdings within the Special Situations Fund. By buying or selling large positions, Stone could move the share price in his favor. The whistleblower claimed this allowed Stone to generate higher returns and performance fees.

Fidelity Investments Canada said in a statement that the company is cooperating fully with the OSC investigation. “We have strict controls and oversight in place to ensure our employees comply with all applicable regulations and corporate policies,” the statement said. However, Fidelity declined to comment specifically on the investigation into Stone’s trading activities and disclosures. Stone did not respond to requests for comment.

If the OSC determines Stone violated securities rules around conflict of interest or insider trading, it could levy significant fines against Fidelity Investments Canada and Stone. The OSC also has the power to ban Stone from trading or managing investment funds in Ontario. Fidelity would likely face legal claims from investors in the Special Situations Fund if Stone’s trading is found to have inappropriately benefited the firm and portfolio manager at the expense of clients.

The investigation creates a cloud over Stone, one of Fidelity’s most successful portfolio managers. He has earned a reputation for strong returns, helped attract substantial client money into Fidelity’s funds, and was promoted last year to lead more investment strategies at the firm. News of the OSC probe suggests Fidelity's controls and compliance standards may have failed to detect or prevent improper trading by Stone, potentially exposing both the manager and the firm to legal trouble.
