Molson loses rights to brew Coors Light, shares sink on Toronto Stock Exchange 

Molson Coors Beverage Company saw its shares drop over 12% today on the Toronto Stock Exchange after the company announced it will no longer be brewing Coors Light beer in Canada as of January 1, 2021. Coors Light is currently the best-selling beer in Canada, representing over 30% of Molson Coors' total Canadian beer sales.

Molson has brewed and distributed Coors Light in Canada for the past 35 years under a licensing agreement with SABMiller, which was acquired by Anheuser-Busch InBev in 2016. That licensing agreement is set to expire at the end of this year and will not be renewed. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, will take over brewing and distribution of Coors Light in Canada starting in 2021. 

"We are extremely disappointed that our licensing agreement for Coors Light will not be extended in Canada," said Frederic Landtmeters, President and CEO of Molson Coors Canada. "Coors Light has been an important part of our product portfolio and success over the past three decades. Not being able to brew and sell this iconic brand in Canada will have significant impact on our business and financial results going forward."

The loss of the Coors Light brand is a major blow to Molson Coors as the company struggles with declining beer consumption in Canada. According to recent surveys, Canadian per capita beer consumption declined 3% in 2019 and 8% over the past five years. The beer market in Canada is also increasingly competitive, with more options for consumers from craft brewers and wine and spirits producers.

In response to the news, shares of Molson Coors were down over 12% to $45.05 in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company's shares have declined nearly 25% in value over the past two years. Molson Coors says it remain focused on its key priorities, including revitalizing its core brands, premiumizing its portfolio, and accelerating growth of craft and specialty brands. However, the loss of a massive brand like Coors Light will make those efforts much more challenging in the coming years for this iconic Canadian brewer.
