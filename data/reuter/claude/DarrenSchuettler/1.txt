Canadian Banks Poised for Another Round of Strong Profits in Q3  

Canada's big banks are expected to report another quarter of solid earnings growth when they announce their third-quarter financial results over the next couple of weeks. Despite slowing economic growth and global trade tensions, analysts predict Canada's largest lenders will continue to benefit from rising interest rates, loan growth, and cost-cutting measures.  

The six largest banks—Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, and National Bank of Canada—are forecast to deliver average earnings-per-share growth of around 5% in the quarter ended July 31, according to analysts. That would mark the 13th straight quarter of year-over-year earnings increases for the group.  

The banks have benefited from five interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada since July 2017, which have helped boost their key lending margins. The central bank has signaled it may raise rates again later this year depending on economic developments. Analysts also expect the big banks to report solid loan growth, especially in residential mortgages and commercial loans.  

"Business conditions remain quite positive for the Canadian banks," said Mario Mendonca, an analyst at TD Securities. "Loan growth should again be a key driver of earnings."

On the downside, consumer loan growth may continue to slow amid high household debt levels and economic uncertainty. As well, the banks could face higher provisions for credit losses as some borrowers struggle with higher interest rates, though overall loan losses remain low. The banks also face headwinds from legislation that tightens mortgage lending rules, as well as competitive pressure in the mortgage market from smaller lenders. 

To offset revenue pressures, the banks have been cutting costs through automation, branch consolidation, and workforce reductions. Analysts expect that trend to continue in the third quarter. " expense control should ... be a focus and support earnings," said Gabriel Dechaine, an analyst at National Bank Financial.  

The big banks begin reporting their fiscal third-quarter results on Aug. 21, when RBC, Canada's largest lender by assets, discloses its numbers.  Analysts expect RBC to deliver the strongest profit and earnings growth among peers. The other big banks report results in the following weeks.  Based on analyst estimates, this quarter could mark another set of solid results for Canada's banking leaders as they continue to generate steady growth despite a more challenging environment.
