Fidelity's Canadian Expansion Efforts Take a Hit as 'Fund Diva' Veronika Hirsch Removed from Portfolio Amid Regulatory Probe

Fidelity Investments' efforts to expand its presence in the Canadian investment fund market hit an unexpected roadblock this week. The firm announced that it is removing star portfolio manager Veronika Hirsch from its lineup of funds available to Canadian investors. Hirsch, who has earned the nickname 'Fund Diva' due to her popular investment advice columns and television appearances, has been removed from all portfolio management responsibilities effective immediately.

The move comes amid an ongoing regulatory investigation by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) into Hirsch's investment practices and potential compliance violations. The OSC has been investigating Hirsch and her team at Fidelity since last fall but few details of the probe have been made public. Fidelity stated that while Hirsch denies any wrongdoing, her removal from fund management was "in the best interests of investors and to avoid potential distraction."  

Hirsch's departure deals a blow to Fidelity's expansion plans in Canada. The Boston-based investment giant has been making a push to increase its presence north of the border over the past two years. It has launched several new mutual funds and ETFs aimed at Canadian investors and has been running an aggressive marketing campaign highlighting its low-cost, index-based investment options. Hirsch had been an instrumental part of Fidelity's messaging, frequently appearing in advertising and educating investors about Fidelity's offerings.

Regulatory experts say that while removing a fund manager amid an investigation is not an admission of wrongdoing, it suggests Fidelity wants to avoid further scrutiny of its practices during the expansion drive. "The timing of this is not ideal for Fidelity as they try to build up their brand in Canada," said Janet Swan, a lawyer focused on investment regulations. However, Swan noted that if the OSC's investigation uncovered serious rule violations, Fidelity had little choice but to remove Hirsch to demonstrate its commitment to compliance. 

Fidelity stated that Hirsch's portfolios and funds will be taken over by other managers within the firm, though it did not specify who would be assuming responsibility. The company also said it remains fully committed to its expansion in Canada and that Hirsch's departure would not impact any of its plans. Despite Fidelity's reassurances, some industry analysts predict that Hirsch's sudden removal amid regulatory scrutiny may lead risk-averse investors to turn to competitors. The coming months will reveal whether Fidelity can move past this turbulent period and continue gaining ground in the competitive Canadian market.
