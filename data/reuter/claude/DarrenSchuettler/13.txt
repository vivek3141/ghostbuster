Montreal Canadiens Owner Denies Sale Rumours Amidst Consortium Bid Reports 

The owner of the Montreal Canadiens hockey club denied reports that he is considering selling the historic franchise. In a statement released today, Geoff Molson said “the Canadiens are not for sale.” However, reports surfaced last week that a consortium led by Quebec businessmen Pierre Dion and Jacques Drouin made an unsolicited bid to acquire ownership of the Canadiens. 

The Canadiens are one of the most storied franchises in the National Hockey League. Founded in 1909, the team has won 24 Stanley Cup championships. The potential sale of the team has stoked passion from fans and stirred political debate. The Canadiens are the only remaining major professional sports team based in Quebec after the Montreal Expos baseball team relocated to Washington D.C. in 2004. 

Dion and Drouin's consortium reportedly values the Canadiens at over $1 billion USD. While Molson did not disclose details of the bid, he said that “like many businesses, we receive interest and expressions of interest from time to time. However, the club is not actively seeking new ownership.” The Molson family has owned the Canadiens for over 60 years, making them one of the longest owners of a professional sports team in North America.

Political leaders in Quebec have opposed the potential sale of the team to foreign or U.S.-based owners. The provincial government may block such a sale under laws restricting foreign ownership of culturally significant businesses. However, Dion is a telecommunications executive based in Montreal and Drouin co-founded Quebec-based advertising firm Cossette. The consortium's bid may be viewed more favorably if seen as a way to keep ownership within the province.

The bid also highlights the increasing value of professional sports teams, especially in major markets like Montreal. While the Canadiens' revenue and franchise value have steadily grown over decades, the potential sale price would far surpass recent NHL team transactions. The consortium's $1 billion-plus bid suggests strong interest and confidence in pro sports as an asset class, even amidst economic uncertainty from COVID-19.  

For now, Molson remains adamant that the Canadiens are not on the market. However, the unsolicited offer gives the team significant leverage to demand a high sale price if Molson's position changes. Canadiens fans may need to reckon with new ownership at some point, even if that day is not today. One thing is certain: whoever owns the Montreal Canadiens will be buying more than just a hockey team. They will own a Quebec institution and an enduring symbol of Canadian pride.
