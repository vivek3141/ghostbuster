Fidelity Investments Star Manager Under Investigation for Trades in Vancouver-Based Firm 

Tom Phillips, a star fund manager at Fidelity Investments, is under investigation by securities regulators over suspicious trading activity in shares of Vancouver-based biotech firm AcmeGen Inc. According to sources familiar with the matter, Phillips made a series of large trades in AcmeGen stock last year that saw the share price spike dramatically within a two-week period.

Phillips manages Fidelity's flagship Canadian equity fund, which has over $5 billion in assets under management. The fund took a significant position in AcmeGen in the fall of last year, accumulating over 2 million shares representing 5% of the company. Just days after Fidelity finished acquiring its position, AcmeGen announced that its flagship drug candidate received fast track approval from Health Canada to treat Alzheimer's disease. The stock price jumped nearly 200% following the announcement, resulting in substantial gains for Fidelity's fund. 

Securities regulators are examining whether Phillips had access to material non-public information about AcmeGen's drug approval before other investors. Insider trading based on confidential information is illegal and could result in severe penalties for Phillips and Fidelity. Regulators are analyzing trading records to determine who else may have bought or sold AcmeGen shares in the days leading up to the announcement. They are also interviewing Phillips and executives at AcmeGen to understand the timeline of events.

A spokesman for Fidelity said the firm has strict policies forbidding insider trading and is conducting its own internal investigation. Phillips has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the regulatory investigation. AcmeGen claims it did not share any confidential information and is cooperating fully with authorities. Regardless of the outcome, the investigation is an embarrassing development for Fidelity, which promotes its fund managers as expert stock pickers, not traders benefitting from privileged access to information. Phillips' other funds remain operational but investors will likely monitor developments closely. Regulators declined to comment on the active investigation.
