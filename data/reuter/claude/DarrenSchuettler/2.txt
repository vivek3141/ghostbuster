Virtual banks challenge Canada's big six banks' dominance 

Canada's banking landscape is poised for a shakeup as virtual banks start launching and attracting customers looking for lower fees and slick digital services. The "big six" Canadian banks - Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada - have long dominated the country's banking sector. But in recent years, smaller virtual banks have launched and are quickly gaining customers, especially younger tech-savvy consumers.

In 2019, Canada's first fully digital bank, Tangerine (owned by Scotiabank), had over 2 million clients. Newer entrants like Motusbank and Oaken Financial have also entered the market and attracted hundreds of thousands of customers within a year by offering no-fee banking and competitive interest rates. The newcomers are also leveraging technology to provide a seamless online and mobile banking experience.

The rapid rise of virtual banks is a concern for Canada's established banks. In a survey by EY, 73% of Canadian banking executives said they were worried about competition from virtual banks and fintech upstarts. The big six banks are now investing heavily in technology and rethinking their fees and product offerings to avoid losing significant market share.

With more virtual banks launching soon, including Wealth One Bank of Canada and UNI Financial, Canada's banking landscape looks primed for substantial changes that could see the established players lose their long-held dominance. "The competitive environment for Canadian banks is intensifying,” says James Shanahan, a financial services expert with Deloitte Canada. “Virtual banks are reshaping customer expectations and putting pressure on traditional banks."

The response from Canada's major banks has been mixed so far. Some like RBC and BMO have partnered with virtual banks and fintech companies to gain digital expertise. Others like TD and CIBC have revamped their online and mobile banking services and waived certain account fees to match virtual rivals. But the big six still charge higher average monthly fees according to a rate study by Ratehub.ca.

The rise of virtual banks gives Canadians more choice and lower-cost options, which financial advocates argue is a positive trend that could force much-needed changes in how traditional banks operate. While Canada's banking oligopoly is still firmly entrenched, virtual banks are poised to gain a bigger slice of the pie by appealing to younger and more digitally savvy customers seeking an alternative to the status quo. The coming years will prove pivotal as upstart virtual banks seek to disrupt Canada's long-established banking order.
