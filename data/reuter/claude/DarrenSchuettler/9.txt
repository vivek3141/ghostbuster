Anti-government protests in Toronto disrupt transit, businesses, and stock exchange

Large protests against government corruption and income inequality snarled traffic and disrupted businesses in downtown Toronto today. The demonstrations started early this morning at Toronto's city hall and Nathan Phillips Square, with protesters railing against government mismanagement, corporate greed, and policies that they say favor the wealthy over the middle class.   

The protests grew throughout the day and spread to other parts of downtown, including the Eaton Centre shopping mall and Bay Street, home to Canada's major banks and the Toronto Stock Exchange. Police estimate the crowd swelling to over 10,000 people at its largest. The protests were mirrored in several other major Canadian cities, including Montreal and Vancouver.

The disruptions were felt across Toronto's downtown core. Most subway stops and routes near the protests were shut down due to overcrowding, forcing transit officials to reroute service. Major department stores and office buildings were also closed, including the Eaton Centre, Hudson's Bay department store, and several bank headquarters. The Toronto Stock Exchange delayed its opening by two hours due to protests outside its offices, the first delayed opening since 2011.

The scale of the protests appears to have taken government officials and businesses by surprise. Toronto Mayor John Tory urged protesters to remain peaceful and lawful in a statement, but also acknowledged their "right to protest government decisions they disagree with." However, he criticized disruptions to transit and businesses, saying "Toronto is open for business and we want to keep it that way."

Many protesters argue that government policies and corporate practices have made life increasingly difficult for Toronto's middle and working class. "The government keeps giving tax breaks and bailouts to the rich while the rest of us struggle," said Maya Singh, 35, who took time off work to join the protests. "They need to start listening to average Canadians and not just big businesses." The protests get to the heart of a debate that has emerged about inequality and political discontent in Canada recently, raising questions about the role of large corporations in society and frustration over economic pressures on the middle class.

The article describes the scope and scale of the protests in Toronto including disruption to transit, shopping, businesses, and the stock exchange. It highlights some of the key frustrations voiced by protesters around inequality and government policies that favor corporations.
