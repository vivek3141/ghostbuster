Associated British Foods Reports 15% Increase in Profits, Chairman Cautious about Year Ahead due to Political Uncertainties

Associated British Foods, the conglomerate behind brands like Primark and Twinings, reported a 15% increase in half-year profits today. For the six months ending March 3, the company's adjusted operating profit rose to £647m from £564m in the same period last year. Revenue also rose 2% to £7.4bn. 

The company attributed the strong performance to its discount fashion chain Primark, where sales rose 4% and profit increased 17%. Primark benefited from expansion into new markets like Germany and France as well as the continued success of its budget-friendly clothing in the UK. The food businesses, which include brands like Twinings tea, Ovaltine, and Jordans cereals, also contributed to the profit growth. However, AB Foods' sugar business struggled, with profits down due to lower EU sugar prices.

Looking ahead, AB Foods chairman Michael McLintock struck a cautious tone. "The outlook for the group in the second half is mixed," he said. "We expect further progress in Primark, increasing contributions from our food businesses and some recovery in UK sugar, but the medium term prospects for EU sugar remain challenging given ongoing political uncertainty."

The political uncertainty McLintock referred to includes Brexit as well as reform of the EU sugar regime. The UK is scheduled to leave the European Union in March 2019, though much uncertainty remains about the form Brexit will take. AB Foods also faces challenges from planned changes to EU rules around sugar that could lower prices.

While McLintock expects continued strong performance from Primark and improvements in the company's food brands and UK sugar business in the coming months, the political and regulatory headwinds pose risks to profits in the long run. Still, analysts note that AB Foods' diversified portfolio of businesses leaves the company well-positioned to handle economic shifts or changes in any one market. With solid results for the first half of the year and strategic advantages, AB Foods remains optimistic about performance over the full 2018 financial year.
