Associated British Foods Reports 15% Increase in Profits, but Chairman Cautious about Future due to Political Uncertainty

Associated British Foods, the owner of British retailer Primark and grocery brand Twinings, announced a 15% increase in half-year profits today. However, the company warned that continued political uncertainty could pose challenges in the coming months. 

For the 24 weeks ended March 2, pre-tax profits rose to £734 million from £640 million in the same period last year. Revenue also climbed 2% to £7.5 billion. The company benefited from strong sales at Primark, especially over the holiday season, as well as growth in its grocery, agriculture, and ingredients businesses.

The company said Primark's UK sales were up 4.5% in the first half, while sales in continental Europe rose 5.8%.  Primark has been expanding rapidly across Europe, with new store openings in France, Germany, and Spain. The low-cost fashion chain now has over 370 stores across Europe and the U.S., up from just over 200 five years ago.  

However, Associated British Foods Chairman Michael McLintock warned that the current period of political uncertainty, especially surrounding the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, is making it difficult for companies to plan ahead. "There are a number of uncertainties in the external environment and the macroeconomic outlook remains unclear," McLintock said in a statement. 

The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on March 29, but Parliament has yet to approve a withdrawal agreement. There are concerns that a "no-deal" Brexit could lead to higher tariffs and border delays that damage British businesses.

Associated British Foods derives over half of its revenue from Britain and also owns major British brands like Kingsmill bread, Patak's curry paste, and Ovaltine. However, the company is also well diversified internationally, with major businesses in Australia, southern Africa, Europe, and the Americas.

Looking ahead, the company expects "progress" in the full year, despite the political headwinds. It forecasts another year of profit growth for Primark in both the UK and Europe. It also expects its grocery, agriculture, and ingredients units to continue their solid performance. 

While the next few months remain uncertain, Associated British Foods' diverse mix of strong brands in resilient categories like value fashion, groceries, and internationally traded commodities leave it well positioned to navigate both the challenges and opportunities ahead. Overall, the company remains cautiously optimistic in its outlook.
