Highland Distilleries' Profits Dip 14% on Falling Famous Grouse Sales in the UK  

Highland Distilleries PLC, one of Scotland's largest whisky makers, reported a 14% drop in half-year profits due to declining sales of its Famous Grouse blend in the UK. The company said pretax profits fell to £123 million from £143 million in the same period a year earlier. Revenue declined 7% to £599 million.   

The results reflect a sluggish market for blended Scotch whiskies in the UK, Highland Distilleries' largest market. Sales of Famous Grouse, the company's flagship blend, fell 8% in the UK as consumer tastes shift to single malt whiskies. Famous Grouse remains the bestselling Scotch whisky blend in Scotland but is losing market share to competitors like Diageo's Bell's and Pernod Ricard's Chivas Regal.

"The whisky market in the UK has been challenging this year, particularly for blended Scotch whiskies," said Highland Distilleries CEO John McLellan. "Consumers are increasingly interested in single malts, and that trend has impacted sales of Famous Grouse despite our best marketing efforts." 

The company reported stronger results outside the UK, with profit and revenue up 5% and 12% respectively in its Americas division and 4% and 8% higher in Asia. Highland Distilleries gains two-thirds of its profits from overseas markets.

To reinvigorate sales, Highland Distilleries plans to launch Famous Grouse flavored whiskies, including a smoked whisky and a whisky aged in rum casks. It will also boost marketing spending by 10% to promote the brand in the UK. 

"We are confident the actions we are taking will return Famous Grouse to growth in our home market," McLellan said. "At the same time, international markets continue to offer opportunities for our premium single malts and blends."

The company left its interim dividend unchanged at 15 pence per share. Highland Distilleries' shares fell 2.3% in early trading to £19.82.
