Ice Cream Industry Suffers Major Losses Due to Dull Summer in Europe, Prompting Big Players to Turn to Winter Marketing Strategies 

The ice cream industry in Europe is scrambling to recoup major losses from a lackluster summer season this year. Unseasonably cool and rainy weather across much of Northern and Western Europe led to a sharp drop in ice cream sales over the normally busy summer months. Sales of ice cream and related frozen desserts fell 12% in June and July compared to the same period last year, according to market research firm Kantar. 

The biggest players in the European ice cream market are turning to winter marketing campaigns to try to make up some of the shortfall. Unilever, owner of popular ice cream brands like Magnum, Ben & Jerry's, and Solero, reported its ice cream division's profits dropped 22% in the first half of the year. A spokesperson for Unilever said the company is relying more on promotional pricing, limited batch seasonal flavors, and partnerships with European cafes and bakeries to market ice cream during the fall and winter.

Nestle, another dominant player that owns brands like Haagen-Dazs and Skinny Cow, said their ice cream profits fell 18% this summer. They are also pivoting to target ice cream sales in colder months. "We recognize that ice cream is not just a summer treat anymore," said Beatrice Guillaume-Grabisch, head of Nestle's global ice cream division. "Consumers want to indulge year-round, so we are creating more demand during winter by releasing popular seasonal flavors earlier, bundling smaller sizes at lower price points, and increasing our advertising in the winter months."

Other companies are following suit with their own winter campaigns to boost falling ice cream revenues. Mars Wrigley, maker of brands like Snickers and Twix ice cream bars, is offering promotions like holiday gift boxes and limited Christmas flavors. Various local and craft ice cream makers across Europe are holding special "winter wonderland" sampling events and ice cream socials. A few brands are experimenting with warm-inspired flavors like spiced pumpkin, cinnamon, and nut mixes to resonate more with cold weather cravings.

While winter marketing may help soften the blow, most industry experts expect significant long-term impacts from this summer's losses. "There's only so much these companies can do to counteract abysmal summer numbers." said Carlos Dominguez, an analyst specializing in the European frozen foods sector. "A dull summer in a normally hot weather country has massive consequences that will likely continue hampering ice cream profits into next year and beyond." The ice cream industry is hoping for sunnier, warmer weather next summer to melt away the current cold front on their balance sheets.
