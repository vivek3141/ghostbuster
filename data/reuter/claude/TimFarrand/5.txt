Matthew Clark's Premium Cider Sales Slump 30% Due to Surge in Popularity of Alcopops

Premium cider sales for Matthew Clark, the UK's largest independent drinks distributor, have slumped by nearly a third over the past year due to the growing popularity of alcopops and ready-to-drink beverages. The company reported that sales of premium craft ciders dropped 30% by volume in 2020 compared with the previous year. The decline in cider sales offset growth in other categories like premium spirits, craft beer, and organic wine. 

The fall in cider sales reflects a wider trend in the UK alcohol market. Alcopops and ready-to-drink cocktails, like hard seltzers and pre-made gin and tonics, have become hugely popular, especially among younger generations. These sweeter, fruit-flavored beverages are taking market share from more traditional alcoholic drinks like cider, ales and wines. Supermarkets and off-licenses have also ramped up their range of alcopops and ready-to-drink options to cater to this demand.

“The cider market has fundamentally changed. The growing taste for alcopops and ‘Instagrammable’ cocktails among Millennial and Gen Z consumers has clearly come at the expense of more traditional cider,” said James Clark, managing director of Matthew Clark. “Our craft cider range thrived when the market was buoyant a few years ago but has suffered as a result of these changing tastes.”

In response, Matthew Clark is overhauling its cider portfolio to focus more on lower-alcohol, fruit-flavored options that can compete directly with alcopops. It has also launched a new range of canned cocktails and hard seltzers under the Goodwood & Co. brand to capture growth in the ready-to-drink market.  The company hopes diversifying into these faster-growing categories will offset the decline in cider and return to overall sales growth.

Industry experts expect the cider market to stabilize over the coming years as the initial surge in alcopop popularity slows. However, competition in the UK alcohol market is set to intensify with more product innovation, competition from overseas, and pressure on pricing. Matthew Clark faces significant challenges to restore momentum after this year’s sharp drop in cider volumes.
