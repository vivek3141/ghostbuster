Unilever's Q3 results likely impacted by North American restructuring and weak European ice cream sales 

Consumer goods giant Unilever is set to report its third quarter results on October 25th. Analysts expect the quarterly results to be impacted by Unilever's ongoing restructuring efforts in North America as well as weak ice cream sales in Europe due to unseasonably cold weather.

Unilever announced an organizational restructuring in North America in June to consolidate its food and refreshment units into a single business group. The restructuring is aimed at cutting costs by reducing management layers and maximizing efficiencies. However, the transition is anticipated to result in one-time expenses that may dent Unilever's bottom line in the third quarter. The reorganization of the North American business comes as Unilever aims to accelerate growth in the region, its largest market. 

In Europe, unseasonably cold and rainy weather during the summer months reduced demand for ice cream, impacting sales for Unilever brands like Magnum, Cornetto, and Ben & Jerry's. Unilever's refreshments unit, which includes ice cream sales, posted just 0.4% growth in the second quarter, dragging down overall performance. With summer accounting for a significant portion of annual ice cream sales, the weak European summer is expected to negatively impact Unilever's third quarter results.

Despite these headwinds, Unilever's emerging market operations are forecast to continue their strong growth. The company's personal care brands also continue to gain market share, which may help offset pressures in other areas. Cost savings from Unilever's multi-year â‚¬6 billion cost efficiency program should also continue to drive margins.

Unilever, which owns brands like Dove, Lipton, and Hellmann's, maintained its full-year guidance when it reported first-half results in July. For 2019, Unilever expects underlying sales growth in the lower half of a multi-year 3-5% range and improved margins. The Q3 results will provide an update on Unilever's progress toward these targets as it works to boost growth and profitability amid a competitive consumer landscape.
