Lloyds Chemists unable to advise shareholders on bid offers until hearing from rival suitor Gehe AG  

Lloyds Chemists PLC announced today that it is unable to make a recommendation to shareholders regarding competing takeover bids from McKesson Corp and AmerisourceBergen Corp until it hears from rival German pharmaceutical wholesaler Gehe AG.

Gehe AG, a privately held company that is Europe's largest drug distributor, made an unexpected bid of £8.7 billion for Lloyds Chemists last week, topping offers from the two U.S. healthcare companies. Lloyds Chemists said it has granted Gehe access to its books to conduct due diligence, but has not yet received a formal offer.  

The announcement throws the bidding war for the UK's second-largest pharmacy chain into disarray. Lloyds Chemists had previously recommended that shareholders accept McKesson's bid of £8.3 billion over AmerisourceBergen's lower offer of £7.8 billion. But Gehe's surprise bid, which values Lloyds Chemists at nearly £9 billion, is now the highest on the table.

Lloyds Chemists Chairman Sir Nigel Follett said the company "will not be in a position to make a recommendation to shareholders until we have clarity from all parties, including Gehe, on the binding offers they may make for the company." He said Lloyds Chemists "remains focused on maximizing value for shareholders" but that no decision will be made until the completion of Gehe's due diligence and the receipt of a formal proposal.

Shares of Lloyds Chemists rose 4% in London trading on the news that it is engaging with Gehe AG, reflecting investors' optimism of an even higher bid for the company. McKesson and AmerisourceBergen's offers, made in July, had already valued Lloyds Chemists at a premium of more than 30% over its share price at the time.   

Analysts said Gehe likely views Lloyds Chemists as an attractive acquisition target to expand its operations beyond continental Europe. By buying Lloyds Chemists, Gehe would gain a substantial wholesale and retail pharmacy presence in the UK, Ireland and Scandinavia. However, some analysts questioned whether Gehe can ultimately match or top the bids from the larger U.S. companies. 

McKesson and AmerisourceBergen are the two largest drug distributors in North America, with a combined annual revenue of more than $520 billion. Privately-held Gehe, though a powerhouse in Europe, is smaller in scale with estimated annual sales of approximately $70 billion. The bidding war for Lloyds Chemists is a test of how far Gehe is willing to stretch to acquire an entry point into the UK market, analysts said.

Lloyds Chemists operates more than 1,500 pharmacies across Britain, Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Whichever suitor prevails in the takeover battle will gain a foothold in European pharmacy markets and benefit from the increased scale. Lloyds Chemists has yet to set a deadline for the final bids, saying only that it aims to "resolve the situation as expeditiously as possible." The protracted takeover saga has already run for more than six months, leaving shareholders and employees in limbo over the company's future ownership.
