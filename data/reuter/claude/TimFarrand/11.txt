Whitbread Plc reports 10 percent rise in first half earnings, driven by strong consumer spending on the high street

Whitbread Plc, the owner of hotel and restaurant chains including Premier Inn, Beefeater and Brewers Fayre, today reported a 10 percent rise in first half earnings as strong consumer spending on the high street boosted demand for its services.

The UK's largest hotel and restaurant company said profit before tax jumped to £219 million in the 26 weeks to August 31 from £199 million a year earlier. Total revenue was up 7 percent at £1.6 billion.

Whitbread reported strong growth across all its brands as lower inflation and real wage growth boosted consumer discretionary spending. The company also benefited from business customers upgrading to higher-priced hotel rooms. 

Premier Inn, its budget hotel chain, delivered a "good" performance with like-for-like sales up 4.1 percent and total accommodation sales rising 6.2 percent as more business and leisure travelers opted to stay in its hotels. Revenue per available room increased 1.9 percent.Whitbread plans to open 4,000 new Premier Inn rooms this year as part of plans to reach 100,000 rooms over the next five years to meet rising demand.

The restaurant division also performed well with like-for-like sales up 5.6 percent across Beefeater, Brewers Fayre, Table Table and Taybarns. The growth reflected an improving casual dining market following several years of weak performance as consumers spent more dining out.

Whitbread chief executive Alison Brittain said: "We have delivered a good first half performance with revenue and profit growth across all our business segments. The UK consumer environment is stable and the increase in employment levels and real wage growth is supporting consumer discretionary spend," she said.

Ms. Brittain said the World Cup and warm weather over the summer also provided a boost, though she cautioned that Brexit uncertainty still poses risks to consumer confidence and the economy in the coming years.

Whitbread kept its full year guidance unchanged. The company currently expects total revenue growth of 2 to 3 per cent and profit before tax to rise 5 to 7 per cent for the full-year ending February 28, 2019. The forecast assumes no significant deterioration in market conditions and steadier consumer confidence levels prevail in the run-up to and after Brexit.

Shares of Whitbread rose 4.2% to 4,914 pence in early trading following the results. The shares have risen 15% over the past year, valuing the company at £6.2 billion.
