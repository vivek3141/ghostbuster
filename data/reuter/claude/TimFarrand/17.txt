Grand Metropolitan Predicts Return of Cash to Shareholders in 1998

Grand Metropolitan PLC, one of Britain's leading food, drinks and retailing groups, has predicted a bumper year of profits and cash flow in 1998 that will enable the company to return money to shareholders through increased dividends and share buybacks.

In a trading statement issued today ahead of its annual meeting, Grand Met said profits before tax and exceptional items are expected to reach £2.5 billion this year, up 10% from last year. The sales profit growth will come from higher volumes and productivity gains across all divisions of the company, which owns brands such as Smirnoff vodka, Guinness beer, Burger King fast food, and the hypermarket chain ASDA.

The robust performance means Grand Met expects net cash inflow to reach £1.75 billion this year, an increase of 25% that will give the company flexibility to invest in growing its brands and retail businesses organically and through acquisitions. Grand Met Chief Executive George Bull said: "With our business performing strongly and substantial cash generation, we have capacity to increase returns to shareholders and will consider the options around year-end."

Analysts said the healthy results and cash flow forecast were ahead of market expectations and demonstrate the success of a broad restructuring program undertaken by Grand Met over the past several years to diversify into new areas and cut costs. "Grand Met looks well placed to outperform over the next 12-18 months given these figures and should benefit from any pick-up in consumer spending," said Tom Stevens, an analyst at WestLB Securities in London. He predicted Grand Met's shares could rise as much as 15% over the next year.

Shares in Grand Metropolitan rose 3.2% in morning trading in London following the announcement. The company will report full-year results for the 12 months ending June 30 in September. Grand Metropolitan employs 210,000 people in over 2,000 stores and offices around the world.
