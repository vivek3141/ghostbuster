Associated British Foods expected to report sharp rise in profits from retail and textile business

Associated British Foods PLC, the British multinational food processing and retailing company, is expected to report significantly higher profits for the first half of its financial year on Tuesday. Analysts predict profits from its retail and textile businesses to increase by over 25% from the same period last year. 

The company's retail arm, Primark, is forecasted to be the main driver of growth. Primark, which sells budget clothing and homeware, has benefited from consumers seeking value and bargains as the cost of living rises in the UK. Primark's sales are expected to top £5 billion for the first time, representing an increase of over 10% from last year. Profit margins at Primark are also predicted to expand due to lower costs.

AB Foods' grocery business, which includes well-known household brands like Twinings, Ryvita, and Kingsmill, is expected to report steady growth. However, profits from its sugar division are likely to decline again due to historically low sugar prices. The company's agriculture business is also anticipated to see lower profits due to poor harvests.

AB Foods reiterated full-year guidance in September for "progress" in both revenue and adjusted operating profit. However, the company also cautioned that input cost inflation is beginning to impact some areas of the business. Analysts will be closely monitoring the company's outlook for rising costs when it reports results on Tuesday.

Shares in AB Foods have risen over 25% so far this year, giving the company a market value of £21 billion. The stock has been buoyed by the strong performance of Primark which now accounts for over half of the group's total revenue and profit. Investors will be hoping the retailer's recent momentum has continued into next year to sustain AB Foods' upwards trajectory. Overall, analysts predict a robust set of first-half results which should give confidence that full-year expectations will be met.
