B.A.T Industries Reports Nine Percent Rise in Profits Despite U.S. Tobacco Litigation, Rules Out Demerger 

British American Tobacco Industries plc (B.A.T Industries) today reported a nine percent rise in annual profits to £6.87 billion, despite multibillion-dollar litigation costs in the U.S. The company remains confident in its position and has ruled out plans to demerge its U.S. division.

B.A.T Industries is facing multiple legal challenges over the health effects of smoking in the U.S., including accusations that it conspired to hide the dangers of tobacco use. However, the London-based company was boosted by rising demand for vaping and tobacco alternatives, especially in emerging markets. Revenue climbed eight percent to £25.76 billion in 2019, which the company attributed to new product ranges and price increases. 

Nicandro Durante, chief executive of B.A.T Industries, said the results highlighted the resilience of the business in the face of regulatory pressures and changing consumer tastes. “Our multi-category portfolio of tobacco and nicotine products continues to deliver a strong performance globally,” he said. “Despite the ongoing U.S. litigation, our results demonstrate the strength and sustainability of our business.”

Shares in B.A.T Industries rose four percent in early trading, as investors reacted positively to the stronger-than-expected results. However, some analysts warned that the U.S. litigation remained an overhang and threatened future profits. The company has spent more than $4 billion in litigation costs over the past decade and still faces thousands of outstanding legal claims.

Responding to speculation about plans to spin off or demerge its U.S. subsidiary, B.A.T Industries said this was not on the cards. “We have no current intention of demerging our U.S. assets,” Mr. Durante said. “While the U.S. market remains challenging from a regulatory and litigation perspective, our operations there remain an important part of the overall B.A.T. group.”

B.A.T Industries expects continued litigation costs in 2020 but said profits should grow between three to five percent, assuming stable exchange rates and no significant impacts from the coronavirus outbreak. The company declared a final dividend of 215.6 pence, an increase of 3.2 percent, bringing the total payout for the year to 267.6 pence, up 3.5 percent.

Mr. Durante said B.A.T Industries was well positioned for future growth despite an increasingly complex trading environment. The company would continue to focus on innovation in its “new categories” of products such as vaping as well as traditional tobacco products like cigarettes. “We start 2020 with good momentum and remain confident in delivering continued high single-digit earnings growth over the next few years,” he said.
