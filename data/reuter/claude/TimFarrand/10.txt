Unilever's Q3 results impacted by Diversey restructuring and weak ice cream sales in Europe 

Consumer goods giant Unilever reported third quarter results today that were impacted by ongoing restructuring at its Diversey professional cleaning division as well as weak ice cream sales in Europe due to poor summer weather. Overall revenue grew 2.9% to 13.49 billion euros, below analysts' estimates of 3.3% growth.

Unilever has been restructuring its Diversey division over the past year to focus on higher-growth segments and optimize its portfolio. The restructuring resulted in rationalizing several product lines and consolidating manufacturing facilities. While the efforts aim to improve long term profitability, they weighed on Diversey's Q3 sales which declined 1%. Unilever expects the restructuring to complete by the end of this year.

Unilever's ice cream segment, which includes popular brands like Magnum, Solero, Carte D’Or and Ben & Jerry’s, reported flat sales in Q3. Poor weather in key European markets like the UK, Netherlands and Germany impacted ice cream demand during the summer season. Unilever CFO Graeme Pitkethly acknowledged the weather challenges, saying “Our ice cream performance was quite disappointing, due to the very weak ice cream season, particularly in Northern and Western Europe.”

The company's home and personal care divisions delivered strong gains, with beauty and personal care up 3.9% and home care rising 6.2%. Growth was broad-based across geographies, with emerging markets up 4.2% and developed markets gaining 2.3%. Unilever highlighted double-digit growth in its premium beauty brands like Dove, Rexona and TRESemmé which resonate well with eco-conscious millennial consumers.  

CEO Alan Jope commented, "We are making good progress in transforming Unilever into a purpose-led, future-fit business. Our focus is on accelerating quality growth, driven by our portfolio investments, innovations and in-market execution. We expect our profit and margin growth to improve over the coming quarters." The company retained its forecast for full-year underlying sales growth of 3-3.5% with improved margins and cash flow.

Unilever's shares fell 1.2% in early London trading as the Q3 results came in below expectations and indicated challenges in two key segments, Diversey and ice cream. Investors will be keen to see evidence of progress in the restructuring and growth acceleration as Unilever aims to boost investor confidence under new CEO Alan Jope. The coming quarters will be critical for the company to get back on a stronger growth footing.
