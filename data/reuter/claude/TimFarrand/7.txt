B.A.T Industries Reports Nine Percent Profit Rise Despite U.S. Tobacco Litigation Dominating Share Price

B.A.T Industries, the British tobacco giant, reported a nine percent rise in pre-tax profits for 2021 despite facing major litigation challenges in the U.S. over the health effects of smoking. The company said pre-tax profits climbed to £8.9 billion from £8.2 billion a year earlier. Revenue grew four percent to £25.4 billion.  

The profit and revenue gains were driven by higher cigarette prices in many markets as well as increased sales of the company’s cigarette alternatives like vaping products. However, B.A.T faces ongoing legal battles in the U.S. over the health impacts of tobacco use, which has significantly impacted its share price over the past year. Shares in B.A.T have declined more than 15 percent from a year ago amid fears that litigation may result in major future settlements.

In a statement, B.A.T CEO Jack Bowles said “While the operating environment remained complex, I am pleased with the progress we made in accelerating growth in our priority markets and product categories. We continue to strengthen our portfolio by offering consumers greater choice and innovative products with reduced risk potential.” The company now generates over 15% of its revenue from non-combustible products as more smokers switch to alternative products. 

However, headwinds remain. The legal landscape in the U.S. poses challenges as nearly 50 states have sued B.A.T and other tobacco companies to recover health care costs associated with smoking-related illnesses. Several verdicts have already gone against B.A.T, resulting in billions of dollars in damage awards. While many verdicts have been appealed, legal analysts expect major settlements may still occur, putting significant pressure on B.A.T’s future earnings and stock price.

Overall, investors reacted cautiously to the latest earnings report.While profits were ahead of expectations, the lingering uncertainty from U.S. litigation indicates more volatility is likely ahead for the tobacco maker. B.A.T shares declined 2% in early trading as the legal overhang continues to obscure an otherwise solid underlying business performance. With both opportunities and challenges in plentiful supply, the coming year looks set to be another pivotal one for the tobacco giant.
