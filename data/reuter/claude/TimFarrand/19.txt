Kwik Save Group to Close 107 Shops, Face Job Losses and Restructure in Response to Fierce Competition 

Britain's third-largest grocery chain, Kwik Save Group, announced today that it will be closing 107 stores across the country in response to intensifying competition from discount retailers Aldi and Lidl. The closures are expected to put up to 1,200 jobs at risk.

In a statement, Kwik Save Group CEO Jonathan Thompson said "the extremely competitive grocery market and rapid growth of the discount retailers have severely impacted our business. We have to make some difficult decisions to ensure the long-term sustainability of our company." 

The 107 shops set to close are mostly smaller stores that have been losing money. The closures are part of a large restructuring effort by Kwik Save Group to refocus its operations around larger stores that offer a wider range of goods and services. The company said it will try to redeploy affected staff where possible. It expects to make a loss of £50-£70 million from the restructuring in the current financial year.

Kwik Save Group has been hit hard by the success of Aldi and Lidl, both of which have attracted more British shoppers with their discounted prices in recent years. The German retailers now have over 1,300 stores in Britain combined and are continuing to open more. They have taken considerable market share from Kwik Save Group and other established supermarkets like Tesco, Sainsbury's, and Asda.

In response, Kwik Save Group has slashed prices and launched more private label discount brands to compete. But its profits have continued to decline due to falling margins. The company's pre-tax profits were down 63% last year to £145 million. Its shares have dropped over 40% in the past 12 months.

Analysts said the restructuring was "long overdue" and "essential for stemming further losses" but expressed concern about the impacts on jobs and communities. The store closures are expected to affect locations across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Kwik Save Group operates over 2,300 stores throughout the UK and employs around 75,000 people.

Union leaders warned that more needs to be done to support workers who will lose their jobs. Iain Wright of the GMB Union said "this will be an anxious time for our members. We will push Kwik Save Group to ensure all options are explored to avoid compulsory redundancies." The company said it will work with unions on redundancy packages and help staff find new roles.

The radical overhaul of Kwik Save Group's operations is the biggest in over 20 years and a sign of the seismic shift occurring in the grocery sector. It highlights the enormous pressures traditional supermarkets are now under to cut costs and lower prices in the face of intense competition from the fast-growing discount chains. Kwik Save Group hopes the painful restructuring will stabilize the business after a difficult period and enable future growth. But the road ahead remains challenging.
