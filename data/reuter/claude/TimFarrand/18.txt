Whitbread CEO Predicts Continued Growth in British Consumer Spending for at Least Two More Years

The chief executive of Whitbread, the British hospitality company that owns Costa Coffee and Premier Inn, said today that consumer spending in the U.K. will continue to grow steadily over the next couple of years despite broader economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit. 

Speaking to investors at the company’s annual general meeting, CEO Alison Brittain said “We remain confident in the resilience of the U.K. economy and consumer spending.” She cited recent strong economic data, including rising wages, low unemployment, and steady GDP growth. “The British consumer has defied expectations before and will likely continue doing so,” Brittain added.

Whitbread reported strong sales growth across its operations in the U.K. last year, with sales at Premier Inn up 8% and Costa Coffee up 6% from the previous year. The company plans to continue expanding in the coming years, despite some fears that Brexit may ultimately weaken the British economy and consumer confidence.

Brittain acknowledged there are risks related to the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union, scheduled to take place at the end of January 2020, but said Whitbread is well-positioned to weather any potential downturn. The company sources most of its ingredients and labor within the U.K., insulating it from the impact of any new trade barriers with the E.U. Brittain also noted the company’s budget-friendly offerings may benefit in times of economic anxiety.

“In times of uncertainty, consumers flock to trusted, value-oriented brands,” Brittain said. “That is good news for Whitbread’s core value propositions.”

The positive outlook was welcomed by investors, who have been concerned about the impact of Brexit on one of Britain’s largest hospitality groups. Whitbread’s share price rose 2% on the news.

Some analysts warn that Whitbread’s optimism may be premature. “There are real risks of a Brexit-related slowdown that could significantly dampen consumer spending, especially in 2020 as new trade rules take effect,” said John Stevens, an economist at Oxford Economics. “While value brands may hold up better, nobody will be completely insulated if economic confidence erodes and people have less money in their wallets.”

However, others believe that as long as Brexit proceeds in an orderly fashion, the effect on consumer spending and the hospitality sector will be modest. “As Brexit uncertainty finally lifts in January 2020, we think consumers and businesses will adapt to the new rules and spending should continue to grow,” said Samuel Tombs, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Solid household income growth and savings rates suggest British consumers have the capacity to increase spending at a steady, if unspectacular, pace in 2020 and 2021.”

For now, Whitbread remains optimistic that it can deliver on its goal to reach 70,000 Premier Inn rooms and 3,000 Costa Coffee outlets in the U.K. Brittain said the company will continue investing to achieve its expansion plans over the next two years. “Our brands are clearly resonating with customers,” she said, “so we see many more opportunities for growth.”
