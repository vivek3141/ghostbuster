Grand Metropolitan Plc to focus on cost-cutting by unshackling from production, says CEO 

Grand Metropolitan Plc's CEO Roger Kent announced today that the company will embark on an aggressive cost-cutting drive by reducing its dependence on in-house production. In a statement, Kent said "For too long, Grand Metropolitan has been weighed down by the shackles of maintaining our own production facilities and supply chain. This has led to significant cost overruns and stifled innovation."

Under the new strategy, Grand Metropolitan will outsource a majority of its production to third-party contractors and suppliers. "We will be freed from the costs and responsibilities of operating factories and a large workforce. This will allow us to improve profit margins through lower costs while focusing our key resources on design, marketing and sales," said Kent. The company aims to reduce costs by over $250 million annually through production outsourcing and job cuts. 

The announcement was met with alarm by unions who fear massive layoffs as a result of the outsourcing. "This short-sighted strategy will axe thousands of jobs and devastate families and communities that have depended on Grand Metropolitan for generations," said David Reynolds, President of the Allied Food and Commercial Workers Union. However, investors responded positively to the news and Grand Metropolitan's shares rose over 4% on the prospect of higher profits and cost savings.

Kent acknowledged the planned changes would not be easy but were necessary for Grand Metropolitan to remain competitive. "The consumer products landscape has changed dramatically and if we do not change with it, we will be left behind. By transforming into an asset-light organization focused on marketing and new product development, we will be in a much stronger position to drive future growth," he said. The outsourcing strategy is a bold move for the iconic British company that has produced goods from its UK home base for over 200 years. However, Kent insisted that quality and brand integrity will not be compromised by the changes. 

Grand Metropolitan produces a range of consumer goods and FMCG products including packaged foods, household cleaners, toiletries and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. The company has over 12,000 employees across 23 production facilities in the UK. The proposed restructuring is scheduled to begin from next month with full implementation over the next 18-24 months. Grand Metropolitan joins a growing list of companies moving to an "asset-light" model with lower fixed costs and greater flexibility. The company's future direction will be closely watched by analysts as a test case for this model in the consumer goods industry.
