B.A.T Industries to face tough questions on US litigation as scientific evidence mounts on smoking and lung cancer link

British American Tobacco Industries (B.A.T), one of the largest tobacco companies in the world, is facing renewed questions about the health impacts of smoking as new scientific studies have strengthened the link between cigarettes and lung cancer. B.A.T executives speaking at the company’s annual general meeting today are expected to be grilled by shareholders and health advocates on the company’s legal strategies to fight off litigation in the U.S. related to smoking and health.

New studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine provide the strongest evidence yet that smoking cigarettes directly causes lung cancer. The studies, involving more than 200,000 individuals over multiple decades, found that smokers are up to 30 times more likely to get lung cancer than non-smokers. The risk of death from lung cancer also increased with the number of cigarettes smoked per day. 

Despite this mounting scientific evidence, B.A.T continues to deny that smoking is an inherent risk factor for severe health conditions like lung cancer and emphysema. The company faces more than $100 billion in lawsuits from U.S. states and individuals seeking to recoup healthcare costs related to smoking. Legal experts say B.A.T’s defense relies on casting doubt on the evidence to avoid taking responsibility, a tactic used by the tobacco industry for decades.

“The evidence that smoking kills people and causes diseases like lung cancer is irrefutable,” said Dr. Margaret Foster, Director of Respiratory Medicine at St. Jude’s Hospital. “For tobacco companies to deny this link is extremely unethical and harmful. Thousands of lives could be saved if people didn't smoke.”

B.A.T executives are expected to reassure shareholders that legal tactics to fight anti-smoking litigation will continue despite the mounting evidence. Industry analysts predict litigation could drag on for decades and ultimately cost tobacco companies hundreds of billions but that the slow grind of the legal process allows plenty of room for obfuscation.  Anti-smoking advocates argue litigation and regulation are the only way to curb the political influence of tobacco companies and force them to take responsibility for the damage caused by their products.
