British brewer Whitbread Plc doubles hotel profits, sees growth in leisure market continuing

The British leisure company Whitbread Plc reported strong first-half results today, buoyed by surging domestic travel spending as Covid-19 restrictions in the UK eased. 

Whitbread, which owns brands including Premier Inn hotels and Beefeater and Brewers Fayre pub restaurants, said profit in the six months to the end of August more than doubled from a year earlier. Revenue rose 71% from a year earlier, though remained 18% below pre-pandemic levels.

The results showed “strong growth” and a “good recovery,” said Chief Executive Alison Brittain. She suggested the resurgence in U.K. domestic tourism and “staycations” over the summer boded well for the company’s largest business, the budget hotel chain Premier Inn.

Premier Inn profit nearly trebled to £237 million as revenue per available room, a key industry metric, climbed 11% from 2019 levels. Demand is “holding up well” for the autumn season so far, Brittain said. She predicted a “return to strong levels of leisure demand” over the next 12-18 months if Covid-19 infection rates remain under control.

Still, the pandemic continues to weigh on parts of Whitbread’s business, especially in city centers and other business-focused locations. Occupancy at Premier Inn hotels in London and other urban areas remained 35 percentage points lower than in 2019. The company’s pubs and restaurants also saw slower recoveries outside of vacation destinations.

To cope with the uneven rebound, Whitbread has taken steps to cut costs, redeploy staff and temporarily close some locations. The company didn’t provide a profit forecast for the full year, citing uncertainty around potential new Covid-19 restrictions this winter.

Brittain said the easing of most remaining Covid rules for hospitality in July, combined with the half-price ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ meal-subsidy scheme, had provided a “real catalyst” for people to start going out and socializing again: “There was a mood shift, and people wanted to go out and start making up for lost time.”

The big question now is whether that mood will endure into the colder months when outdoor dining and activities become less appealing. So far, Brittain said, people seem to be remaining keen to continue meeting up in restaurants, bars and hotels despite the approach of winter.

Whitbread’s shares rose 4% in early London trading as investors welcomed the results, which Brittain said put the company “in a good position to emerge strongly from this crisis.” The leisure and hospitality sectors were among the hardest hit by the pandemic but appear poised to lead the economic recovery—as long as new restrictions don’t derail peoples’ enthusiasm for socializing again. For now at least, staycations and nights out appear here to stay.
