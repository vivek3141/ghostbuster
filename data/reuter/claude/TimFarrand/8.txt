Bass-Carlsberg-Tetley Merger Likely to Face Scrutiny from British Competition Authorities  

The proposed merger of Bass Brewers, Carlsberg UK, and Tetley Brewers into a single company is likely to face significant scrutiny from British competition authorities, according to industry experts. The three companies announced plans last week to combine into a joint venture called British Beer Company that would control around 40 percent of the UK beer market.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Britain's competition regulator, is almost certain to launch an in-depth investigation into the merger. The CMA will evaluate whether the deal could negatively impact competition and lead to higher prices, reduced choice or quality for consumers. The sheer size of the combined entity and its potential market dominance is likely to raise red flags, analysts said.

"A merger of this scale in the beer industry would warrant very close examination by the CMA," said Mark Jamieson, a competition lawyer at the London firm Bristows. "When you have three major players coming together to form such a large market share, that is typically going to lead to concerns about restricting competition." 

The companies argue the merger will generate substantial cost savings and efficiencies that will benefit both consumers and taxpayers. They also say the British beer market remains very competitive, with many craft brewers gaining market share. But consumer advocates counter that the deal could limit options for beer drinkers if large pub chains feel compelled to favor the mega-brewer's products.

"There is a real risk that the merged company, with its massive market power, could engage in anti-competitive practices like predatory pricing, locking out competitors from pub space, or forcing unfair terms on pub tenants and customers," said Andrea Fletcher, director of the Consumers' Association. "The CMA needs to take a very close look at how this merger could undermine competition and consumer choice."

The CMA review is likely to take six months. If the regulator is not satisfied with concessions offered by the companies, it could block the deal or require the sale of assets before the merger can proceed. The companies hope to complete the merger by the end of the year, but that timeline now looks increasingly optimistic given the scrutiny ahead from competition authorities.
