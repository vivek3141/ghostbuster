General Motors reports $1.3 billion third-quarter profit despite Canadian worker strike  

General Motors reported a $1.3 billion net profit in the third quarter, beating Wall Street estimates despite a costly strike at its Canadian operations. The month-long walkout by nearly 3,000 workers at Canadian auto parts supplier AP&C significantly disrupted production of highly profitable pickup trucks at GM's American plants.  

The strike started on September 16 and ended October 15 after the union and company reached a new labor agreement. During the work stoppage, GM had to idle its pickup truck plants in Fort Wayne, Indiana and Flint, Michigan. The company said the strike reduced pre-tax earnings by up to $1 billion in the third quarter.  

Despite the hits to its production and profits, GM posted net income of $1.3 billion, or 89 cents a share, down 7% from $1.4 billion, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, GM earned $1.5 billion, or $1.07 a share, above analysts' expectations of 94 cents a share. Revenue declined slightly to $35.8 billion.

"The strike at AP&C had a significant negative impact on our financial results, but with the strike now settled, we expect to restore full production levels at our U.S. pick-up plants and recover lost production in the fourth quarter," said GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara.

GM shares rose 2% to $36.65 in early trading Tuesday following the earnings announcement. Despite some operational challenges, GM has reported steady profits and made progress in restructuring its business to focus on more profitable ventures like large pickups, SUVs and new technologies like electric and self-driving vehicles. 

For the first nine months of 2019, GM earned a net profit of $5.3 billion, up 17% from $4.5 billion in the same period last year. Revenue increased slightly to $114 billion. GM reaffirmed its full-year guidance for adjusted earnings in the $6.50 to $7 per share range.

The strike in Canada was the first major work stoppage GM has faced in years and highlighted the company's dependence on suppliers and Just-in-Time manufacturing processes. The AP&C facility produces plates, brackets and other key parts for GM's large pickups like the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. The work stoppage caused GM to halt production at its pickup truck assembly plants, costing the company an estimated 15,000 units of lost production in October alone.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra credited the company's resilience in overcoming the strike's impact and meeting customer demand for its popular truck models. "We remain focused on strengthening our core automotive operations, improving efficiency and competitively positioning our company for the future," Barra said.
