GM Idles Lordstown Plant for Two Weeks Due to Canadian Autoworker Strike Effects

General Motors announced today that it will idle its Lordstown Assembly plant in Ohio for the next two weeks due to a strike by Canadian autoworkers that has disrupted  GM's supply chain. The United Auto Workers has been on strike against GM at plants in Ontario, Canada since September 16, impacting the production of the Chevrolet Impala and Cadillac XTS sedan, which are built at the Lordstown plant. 

The Lordstown complex employs about 1,400 hourly and salaried workers who build the Impala and  XTS for GM. While the plant has faced recent cutbacks and layoffs due to decreasing small car sales, GM had planned to continue operations at the current level into 2020. However, the strike by Canadian UAW workers has caused component shortages that now make that production schedule impossible.

"The UAW strike has strained our supply chain and caused a parts shortage that will force us to idle the Lordstown plant for the next two weeks," said GM spokesman Dan Flores. "We regret the impact this will have on our workforce and suppliers, but this reflects the harsh reality of labor disputes on integrated supply chains."

The Lordstown idling is the latest ripple effect of the ongoing strike by about 3,000 UAW workers in Ontario that has cut production of the Chevrolet Equinox, Terrain, and Impala, as well as the Cadillac XTS. The Canadian UAW launched its first nationwide strike in over two decades after talks with GM broke down over issues like wages, health care, and job security. The strike is set to surpass two weeks this weekend, with no timeframe for resolution.

While the move is not permanent, the temporary closure of Lordstown highlights the vulnerability of GM's manufacturing operations to supply chain disruptions. The closure will also renew economic anxieties in a community that has already faced substantial hits to its manufacturing base. GM has cut several thousand jobs at the once-thriving Ohio plant over the last two years due to decreasing small car demand. The impending idling serves as another warning for the Lordstown area about the precariousness of its auto manufacturing livelihood. Overall, the effects of the Canadian strike threaten to multiply across GM's North American plants the longer the work stoppage lasts.
