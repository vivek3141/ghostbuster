GM Idles 5,000 Ohio Workers Due to Canadian Autoworker Strike Effects on Parts Supply

General Motors announced today that it will idle 5,000 workers at two of its Ohio assembly plants this week due to the ongoing United Auto Workers strike at GM's Canadian parts supplier. The strike at ZP International, which makes key components for GM vehicles like seats, cockpit modules and front end parts, has disrupted the supply chain and caused parts shortages at GM factories in the U.S. 

The GM Moraine Assembly plant, which produces the Chevy Cruze sedan, and the Toledo Transmission plant will shut down beginning Monday due to the parts shortage from ZP International. The strike by 3,400 ZP International autoworkers demanding higher wages and better working conditions entered its third week today with no resolution in sight. As the strike continues, GM assembly plants across the U.S. are in jeopardy of halting production due to lack of parts from the supplier.

"The Canadian strike against GM's parts supplier is now directly impacting production and jobs in Ohio. We continue to encourage both sides to resolve this matter as quickly as possible and have our workers return to their jobs building the vehicles and components for customers," said GM spokesman Jim Peters. The idled Ohio workers will receive most of their pay during the shutdown thanks to provisions in their UAW union contract. However, economists warn that sustained supply chain issues could impact GM's bottom line and share prices.

GM's vehicle inventory levels were already on the lower end of targets going into this labor dispute, so analysts predict showroom vehicle shortages and reduced customer options could materialize within weeks if ZP International's Canadian plant remains offline much longer. The shutdowns also come at a bad time, as consumer demand for vehicles like the Chevy Cruze usually rise in the fall. 

GM and the UAW are urging ZP International and Canadian union leaders to expedite negotiations and end the costly strike. But the Canadian autoworkers union argues its members deserve wage increases after years of concessions, especially given ZP International's rising profits and GM's overall financial health in North America. With no talks currently scheduled, GM will have to wait and see if more U.S. factories will go idle, threatening jobs and a precarious supply chain.
