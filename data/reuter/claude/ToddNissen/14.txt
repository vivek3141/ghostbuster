ITT Automotive Inc's Workers to Be Paid Less than $10 an Hour by 2000, CEO Says

ITT Automotive Inc., one of the world's largest automotive parts suppliers, plans to cut hourly wages for its U.S. factory workers to less than $10 over the next two years, according to the company's chief executive. 

In an interview, CEO Frank Johnson said the wage cuts are necessary to keep ITT Automotive competitive with low-cost suppliers from Mexico and Asia that pay workers far less. "To remain a viable business, we have to cut costs and align compensation with the realities of the global parts marketplace," Johnson said. 

The wage cuts would affect more than 3,000 hourly workers at ITT Automotive's 15 U.S. factories that make components such as brake pads, air filters, and windshield wipers for major automakers including Ford, General Motors, and Fiat Chrysler. ITT Automotive's U.S. workers currently earn an average of $17 an hour, according to the company.

The move is certain to provoke strong opposition from the United Auto Workers union, which represents ITT Automotive's factory employees. "Reducing wages to below poverty-level would be an attack on working families and is unjustified based on the huge profits this company has made," said Bob Smith, director of the UAW's parts supplier division. "We will fight them every step of the way."

However, Johnson said lower labor costs are necessary for ITT Automotive's long-term survival. The company faces increasing price pressure from auto parts suppliers in Mexico, China, Vietnam and other low-wage countries that now dominate the industry. ITT Automotive's revenue and market share have declined over the past decade due to competition from these overseas suppliers.   

"If we can't close the cost gap with our competitors, we won't have a viable business in the U.S. within the next few years," Johnson said. "We have to act now to save jobs." He said the company hopes to avoid layoffs through a combination of wage cuts, improved efficiency and investments in automation. 

The wage cuts would take effect gradually over 24 months as part of a new contract the company is negotiating with the UAW. Existing workers would see their pay drop by no more than $3 an hour by 2021, while new hires would start at less than $10 an hour. ITT Automotive currently employs around 6,500 U.S. workers, including salaried staff, with 15,000 worldwide.
