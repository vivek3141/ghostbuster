Auto Supplier Predicts Increasing Number of Workers Earning Less Than $10 an Hour, Posing Long-Term Challenge for GM and Union Negotiations

A major automotive supplier warned this week that an increasing number of factory workers are earning salaries below $10 an hour, a trend that could pose challenges for General Motors and the United Auto Workers union in upcoming contract negotiations. 

Lear Corp., which supplies seats, electrical systems and other components to GM and other automakers, said in a quarterly filing that nearly a third of its U.S. production employees earned less than $10 an hour. The percentage of Lear's U.S. workers earning under $10 an hour has doubled over the last five years as the company has hired more temporary workers and outsourced more manufacturing work to lower-cost countries.

The disclosure from Lear highlights a broader trend in the auto industry as companies face pressure to cut costs to fund investments in electric and self-driving vehicles. Automakers and suppliers are relying more on temporary workers, outsourcing work abroad and implementing more two-tiered wage systems to reduce expenses. The increased use of lower-wage temporary and contract workers has been a point of contention with the UAW, which represents workers at GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler's U.S. factories.

UAW leaders argue the increased use of temporary workers threatens job security and livable wages for union members. But auto executives counter that the companies need flexibility to remain competitive as the industry transforms, and temporary workers provide a way to quickly adjust staffing levels based on demand.

"There is a convergence of forces putting downward pressure on wages in certain sectors of the auto industry," said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research. "The competitive forces are pushing companies to reduce costs, especially for work that is viewed as non-core."
