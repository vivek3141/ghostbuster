Union workers threaten second strike at General Motors Corp as contract negotiations continue

The union representing General Motors' 48,000 hourly workers threatened a second strike against the automaker on Tuesday as contentious contract negotiations continued. The United Auto Workers said its members will walk off the job at midnight Monday if a deal isn't reached by then. 

The threat comes as a nationwide strike of GM's U.S. plants enters its second week. The strike has brought GM's U.S. factories to a halt, shut down work at companies that supply GM parts and components, and threatens to disrupt the wider auto sector in the face of slowing demand.

Talks were continuing Tuesday but the two sides remained far apart on key issues like health care costs, use of temporary workers, and production of new vehicles.  "Significant differences remain between the parties on wages, health care benefits, job security and other issues," the union said Tuesday.

The prospect of prolonged strikes will weigh on GM at a time when the automaker is facing declining sales in the U.S. and overseas. Workers are seeking a bigger slice of the money GM is making after years of belt-tightening. The standoff already has cost GM $250 million, according to a research note from Credit Suisse.

GM spokeswoman Kim Carpenter said the company is "committed to continuing discussions around the clock to reach a resolution."
GM shares fell as much as 2.4% to $36.56 on Tuesday, erasing earlier gains. The stock is down about 7% this year.
The UAW launched its first nationwide strike against GM in 12 years on Sept. 16, digging in for a fight that may test the political clout of an industry that President Donald Trump has vowed to revive and support. For now, GM plants in Mexico and Canada are operating normally but the company is warning dealers that inventories of some models may run short if the walkout is prolonged.

The strike has magnified scrutiny of GMâ€™s long-term strategy for U.S. facilities. Already this year, the company has faced blowback over plans to potentially close a handful of U.S. factories. In March, GM shuttered its sprawling Lordstown Assembly plant in northeast Ohio after 52 years. The UAW has accused GM of shifting production to Mexico to save costs. GM says the claim is untrue, noting that most of its Mexican output is sold in other countries and that U.S. union jobs grew over the lifetime of the current contract.

The negotiations are being closely watched as an indicator of labor relations in a transforming auto industry. The UAW's more combative stance under President Gary Jones, who took over last year, has set the stage for a bruising fight with GM as both sides dig in. The union is looking to make up ground lost over the last two decades as membership has declined from a 1979 peak of 1.5 million to around 400,000 today. Both sides are expected back at the bargaining table Wednesday.
