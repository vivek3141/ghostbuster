General Motors Corp Hopes for Labor Agreement to Avoid Second Strike 

General Motors Corp is hoping to reach an agreement with the United Auto Workers union to avoid a second nationwide strike. Contract negotiations are set to resume today as the current labor deal between the Detroit automaker and the UAW expires at midnight.

A nationwide strike could cost GM over $50 million per day and slow down production of hot-selling vehicles like the Chevy Silverado pickup truck and GMC Sierra. The UAW represents about 46,000 GM workers in plants across the U.S. In the 2015 contract negotiations, factory workers went on a two-week nationwide strike, the first against GM in 12 years.

GM CEO Mary Barra said the company wants to reach an agreement to provide "job security, safe working conditions, and a strong economic future for UAW members." The UAW's top negotiator said they are "committed to standing up for fair wages, affordable healthcare, and job security." However, the two sides remain apart on key issues in negotiations like future wage growth, use of temporary workers, and the closure of four U.S. factories.

GM has proposed wage increases of 2% in the first and third years of the four-year contract and 2% lump sum payments in the second and fourth years. However, the UAW wants higher pay increases and opposes the proposed caps on wage growth. The union also wants GM to hire temporary workers as full-time employees and reverse the closure of assembly plants in Lordstown, Ohio; Detroit-Hamtramck, Michigan; Baltimore and Warren, Michigan. 

GM argues that its offers are fair and that cost cuts from plant closures and lower healthcare expenses are necessary to keep manufacturing jobs in the U.S. as the auto industry reinvents itself to focus on electric and autonomous vehicles. The union counters that workers deserve better pay and job security after years of concessions and GM's $8.1 billion in net profits last year.

Negotiators for both sides said there was still a long way to go to reach a deal ahead of the contract expiration at midnight. But they remain cautiously optimistic as pressure mounts to avoid another damaging nationwide strike. GM's stock price and sales could take a hit if factory workers walk off the job again. The UAW would have to get the support of rank-and-file members to authorize another strike, which may prove challenging.

All eyes will be on GM and the UAW negotiators today to see if they can hash out their differences and agree to a new four-year contract before the deadline. Achieving a deal would be a win for factory workers, the automaker and the overall economy. Failure may lead to the first nationwide strike at GM since the last economic recession.
