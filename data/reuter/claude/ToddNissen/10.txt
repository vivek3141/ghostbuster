United Auto Workers Union Continues Bargaining with GM as Contract Deadline Approaches 

The United Auto Workers union and General Motors continue to negotiate  over a new four-year contract as the current agreement is set to expire on Saturday. UAW leadership and GM representatives have been meeting daily to discuss wages, health care benefits, profit sharing, and job security provisions for nearly 50,000 union members.

Sources close to the talks say the negotiations have been productive but the two sides remain apart on several key issues. The UAW is pushing GM to agree to wage increases to offset years of small raises and cost-of-living adjustments. The union also wants the company to reduce health insurance costs for workers and limit the use of temporary workers.

For its part, GM is seeking more flexibility in operations to better compete with foreign-owned automakers operating non-union plants in the U.S. The company also wants workers to pay a larger portion of health insurance premiums to offset rising costs. GM has emphasized that any deal must allow the company to continue to be sustainable and profitable for the long term.  

The negotiations are pivotal for the UAW and GM. The UAW is under pressure to deliver solid gains for members after years of concessions to help the automaker recover from its 2009 bankruptcy and 2010 federal bailout. GM wants to avoid a costly strike that could harm its bottom line and sales momentum. The previous four-year agreement in 2015 followed a two-week strike that impacted GM's production.

UAW and GM officials have declined to provide details on the talks but remain optimistic a deal can be reached before the deadline. However, the union has informed members to prepare in case a walkout is called. The two sides are expected to negotiate through the weekend in an effort to reach an agreement ahead of the expiration. If a tentative deal is struck, UAW leaders will hold a ratification vote by members that could take a week or more to complete.
