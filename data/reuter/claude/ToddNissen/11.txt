Analysts Predict Unlikely Protracted Strike by United Auto Workers Against General Motors

Contract negotiations between the United Auto Workers union and General Motors have stalled in recent days, raising the possibility of the first nationwide UAW strike against GM in over a decade. However, industry analysts say a protracted work stoppage that significantly impacts GM's operations is unlikely. 

The UAW's four-year contract with GM expired on Saturday at midnight. Despite ongoing talks, the two sides remain far apart on key issues like pay raises, health care costs, and the use of temporary workers. The union has over 48,000 members at dozens of GM factories and parts depots across the US.

A strike by the UAW would disrupt GM's vehicle production and cost the company millions of dollars per day in lost profits. However, analysts point out that the UAW faces pressure to avoid a long strike that could hurt both GM's business and workers' paychecks. 

"Neither side wants a long, painful strike that causes economic harm," said Kristin Dziczek, an economist at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan. "The costs would be too high for both GM and UAW members who lose wages and benefits during a strike."

Most experts predict that if the union were to initiate a strike, it would likely be a short-term action meant to force GM back to the negotiating table. Even a brief strike could slow or stop production at some US plants, cutting off supply lines and affecting GM's Canadian and Mexican operations. But within days, the two sides would probably renew talks and come to an agreement, analysts say. 

"A strike threat is a common negotiating tactic, but once workers actually walk out, both sides start losing money immediately," said Arthur Wheaton, an auto industry professor at Cornell University. "There's strong motivation to settle as quickly as possible." Wheaton expects a final deal within 1-2 weeks at most if a brief strike were to take place.

GM and the UAW have been down this road before, with strikes in 1970, 1972, and 1992, along with a 54-day shutdown of American Axle & Manufacturing, a major GM supplier, in 2008. But much has changed, and GM cannot afford a long-term work stoppage that delays new vehicle launches and sales. For its part, the UAW is under pressure to protect union jobs as the auto industry continues evolving. Both sides want an agreement, not a protracted standoff, experts say. Barring a major breakdown in talks, analysts expect a typical eleventh-hour deal and workers remaining on the job.
