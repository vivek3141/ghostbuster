Auto Supplier CEO Predicts Increasing Number of Workers Earning Less Than $10/Hour

The CEO of a major auto parts supplier predicted that an increasing number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. will pay less than $10 per hour over the next decade. In a speech to investors today, John Thompson, CEO of Midwest Motors, said that wage pressures and global competition will force many companies to cut costs by reducing wages for entry-level positions.

"The era of $15 to $20 per hour assembly line jobs is coming to an end," Thompson said. "Automation, globalization, and oversupply of low-skill workers will make those wages unsustainable for many companies." 

Thompson argued that U.S. policymakers and workers need to accept lower wages if they want manufacturing jobs to return and stay in the U.S. Midwest Motors, which supplies brake pads, air filters, and other components to major auto companies, has 60 manufacturing facilities and over 100,000 employees worldwide, including 20,000 in the U.S. The company has come under frequent criticism for its low wages, especially at its foreign plants in Mexico and China.

Independent analysts said Thompson's prediction of $10 per hour or lower wages was realistic but troubling. "Wage stagnation is already a major economic problem, and reducing wages for manufacturing workers will only make income inequality worse," said Amanda Wilson, an economist at the Brookings Institution. However, she noted that in a global economy, companies often have little choice but to cut costs to compete. "If policymakers and workers want to maintain mid-wage jobs, we need to find ways to boost skills and productivity to justify higher wages," Wilson said.

Union leaders blasted Thompson's comments and said they have already been battling company efforts to reduce wages and benefits. "Midwest Motors made over $2 billion in profit last year but wants to pay workers even less," said United Auto Workers President Bill Franklin. "That is unacceptable. Workers deserve a living wage and dignity on the job." The UAW has attempted for years to organize Midwest Motors' U.S. plants but has faced fierce resistance from the company.  

In his speech, Thompson said Midwest Motors will invest over $500 million to further automate its U.S. factories over the next 3-4 years, a move that he said would improve productivity by over 20% and reduce the need for higher-skilled, higher-wage workers. The company opened a highly automated brake pad factory in Tennessee last year where wages range from $8 to $11 per hour. Thompson sees that model as the template for future manufacturing facilities.  

While Thompson's comments may have alarmed worker advocates, investors appear to approve of Midwest Motors' cost-cutting vision. The company's stock price rose over 4% on the day following the CEO's speech. Whether Thompson's prediction of $10 per hour manufacturing wages comes to pass will depend on the ongoing tension between companies fighting to cut costs in a competitive global economy and the efforts of policymakers and workers to demand higher pay and better working conditions. For now, at least in some industries like auto parts, the race to find the lowest wage to produce goods for the global market remains ongoing.
