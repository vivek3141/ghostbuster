Ford's Third-Quarter Profit Almost Doubles, But European Losses Cause Alarm Among Analysts  

Ford Motor Co. nearly doubled its third-quarter profit, announcing it exceeded analysts' expectations thanks to strong sales of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in North America. However, continued losses in Europe have dampened investor enthusiasm and prompted analysts to question Ford's ability to execute a turnaround in that critical market. 

Ford said Wednesday it earned $1.63 billion, or 41 cents a share, compared with $878 million, or 22 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding one-time items, Ford's earnings were 45 cents a share, beating analysts' forecast of 30 cents. Revenue increased 2% to $36.7 billion.

Investors appeared to focus on the continued struggles in Europe, where Ford recorded a pretax loss of $468 million. Ford has lost money in Europe for 12 consecutive quarters as the economic turmoil in the region has decimated the auto market. Ford's sales in Europe declined 9.5% in the third quarter.

"While a solid quarter overall, continued losses in Europe remain a concern,” said David Kudla, CEO of Mainstay Capital Management LLC. “The European auto market continues to deteriorate, and a near-term turnaround looks unlikely."

In North America, Ford's biggest market, the company earned a pretax profit of $2.3 billion, up nearly 7% from a year ago. Ford reported higher sales of Escape small SUVs, F-Series pickups and Fusion midsize sedans. In Asia, Ford earned a record quarterly profit of $45 million on the strength of new models. And in South America, Ford earned $9 million.

Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks reiterated the company's forecast that it remains on track for higher pretax profit and market share in 2016. But Shanks acknowledged headwinds in Europe, saying it will take more cost cutting and new product introductions to return the region to profitability. Ford expects to lose about $3 billion in Europe over the next two years.

The results come as Ford CEO Alan Mulally prepares to retire at the end of 2014 and hand the reins to Chief Operating Officer Mark Fields. Mulally, 68, is credited with turning around Ford after joining the company in 2006, securing a $23 billion loan to help Ford survive the industry downturn and forging the company's "One Ford" global product development plan.

"Ford's results show that Fields is inheriting a company in very good shape, but Europe remains an urgent challenge,” said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with AutoTrader.com. “Fields needs to find fixes for Europe quickly and make some bold moves if a turnaround is possible.” 

Ford's shares fell 6% to close at $16.19 Wednesday. The stock is up nearly 29% so far this year.
