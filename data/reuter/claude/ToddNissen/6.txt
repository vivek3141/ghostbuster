Ford Profits Soar, Driven by Pickup Trucks and SUVs, but Losses in Europe Raise Concerns  

Ford Motor Company reported a major increase in profits for the third quarter of 
2019 on Tuesday, fueled by strong sales of highly profitable pickup trucks and SUVs 
in the United States. However, the automaker's struggles in Europe continued, 
raising questions about Ford's global competitiveness.

Ford said its net income rose 57 percent from a year ago to $2.1 billion, handily beating Wall Street's expectations. The company's North American operations, propelled 
by models like the F-150 pickup and Explorer SUV, generated $2.4 billion in pretax 
profit. Revenue also rose 2 percent to $37.1 billion.

"We had an outstanding quarter," Jim Hackett, Ford's chief executive, told analysts during a conference call. The solid financial results were "proof that our redesign is working."

Ford's shares jumped nearly 4 percent in early trading as investors cheered the 
quarterly report, which provided the most concrete evidence yet that Mr. Hackett's 
turnaround effort was gaining momentum. Since taking over in 2017, he has cut costs, streamlined Ford's unwieldy management structure and begun allocating capital to new technologies like electric and self-driving vehicles.

But Ford lost $179 million in Europe, its second quarterly loss in a region that is crucial for global carmakers. The company's overreliance on sales of passenger cars that are falling out of favor, combined with Brexit-related uncertainty, has battered its business in Europe. Ford plans to close or sell six of its 24 European plants and lay off 12,000 workers to reduce costs. But a major restructuring will take time and continued losses seem likely, analysts said.
