Ford Motor Co. Promotes Two Executives in Race to Succeed CEO Alex Trotman

Ford Motor Company announced the promotions of two top executives today, positioning them as potential successors to Chairman and Chief Executive Alex Trotman, who plans to retire in April 1999.

The auto maker appointed Jac Nasser, currently head of its worldwide customer service division, as president and chief operating officer. Nasser, 52, will report directly to Trotman. Ford also promoted Allan Gilmour, 57, vice chairman of finance, to the post of vice chairman and chief financial officer. Gilmour will continue to oversee Ford's financial operations.  

The promotions are aimed at strengthening Ford's senior management team before Trotman, 65, steps down after nearly 10 years at the helm. "We have a strong management team and organization in place to build on the success Alex has led over the past decade," said William Clay Ford Jr., chairman of Ford's board of directors and the great-grandson of founder Henry Ford.

Nasser is now widely seen as the leading candidate to eventually replace Trotman, although Ford Jr. indicated that other candidates remain under consideration and no timetable has been set for a final decision. As chief operating officer, Nasser will oversee Ford's worldwide automotive operations, with responsibility for the company's car and truck divisions in North America, Europe, South America, and the Asia Pacific region. 

"Jac Nasser is an exceptionally capable global business leader with a proven track record of results in our company," Trotman said. Analysts said that Nasser's new role gives him the scope of responsibility that would prepare him for the top job. "All the signs point to Nasser as the heir apparent," said David Healy of Burnham Securities.

Gilmour's promotion also strengthens his position as a leading contender for the CEO position, although he is still seen as a long-shot compared to Nasser. In his new role, Gilmour will continue to lead key strategic initiatives like Ford's e-commerce activities in addition to overseeing finance and accounting, treasury, and risk management.

The jockeying for the top job comes at a critical time for Ford, which faces slowing demand for its vehicles in the U.S., pricing pressures from Japanese competitors, and a complex set of long-term strategic challenges. But with no final decision on Trotman's successor yet made, Ford's direction after April 1999 remains an open question. The coming year will shed more light on whether an insider like Nasser or Gilmour emerges on top, or whether Ford looks beyond its existing ranks for new leadership.
