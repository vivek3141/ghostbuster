GM Sales Slip Nearly 8 Percent in October; Chrysler Corp. Posts Double-Digit Jump 

General Motors reported a 7.8 percent decline in U.S. auto sales for October compared to the same month a year ago. The drop in sales highlights the challenges facing the nation's largest automaker as it struggles with a declining market share and overdependence on less profitable vehicle segments.

GM sold 237,280 vehicles in October, down from 256,393 in the prior year. Declines were spread across GM's brands, including an 11 percent drop for Chevrolet, 3 percent for GMC, and 21 percent for Buick. Only the Cadillac brand posted a gain, up 5 percent. The results fell short of analysts' expectations for a smaller 4.5 percent decline. 

"We faced some stiff headwinds in October, but we feel very positive about our product lineup heading into the end of this year and 2020," said GM spokesman Jim Cain. "When you look at industry sales over the past couple months, the overall pie is shrinking. We're focused on sustaining our more profitable sales and continuing to grow transaction prices."

In contrast, Fiat Chrysler posted a 16 percent surge in sales to just over 194,000 vehicles. Sales of Jeeps rose 8 percent while Ram truck sales jumped 26 percent. The Chrysler brand, aided by strong Pacifica minivan sales, saw sales rise 46 percent. Fiat was the only brand down, falling 15 percent. The October results are welcome news for Fiat Chrysler as it seeks to reassure investors amid questions about the future of the company in its current form.

Ford Motor Co. sales slipped 6 percent to just under 170,000 units. Ford's best-selling F-Series pickups were down 9 percent at a time when sales of light trucks and SUVs continue to grow as a percentage of total U.S. sales.

The U.S. auto market continues to weaken from a historic peak of over 17 million new vehicles in 2016. Analysts forecast sales this year will fall to around 16.8 million units, still a healthy level but contracting for the fourth time in the last five years. Slowing sales, rising consumer interest in used vehicles, and affordability challenges are among the factors contributing to what experts say is an inevitable cyclical cooldown for the auto sector.

GM's stock price fell over 4 percent on the October sales news, suggesting investors were disappointed in the larger-than-expected decline. Year-to-date, GM shares are up just 2 percent compared to more than 20 percent for Ford and the overall S&P 500 index. Chrysler is not publicly traded. Automakers will be closely watching November and December results to determine if the fourth quarter rebounds or extends the recent softening trend.
