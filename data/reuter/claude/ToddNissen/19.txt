Ford Launches New Computer-Aided Design Project to Revolutionize Vehicle Development 

Ford Motor Company announced today a new initiative focused on computer-aided design that aims to dramatically accelerate the development of new vehicle models. Dubbed "CAD 2.0," the project will apply advanced simulation and virtual reality technologies to streamline Ford's design and engineering processes.

"This initiative has the potential to reduce the design and development of new Ford vehicles by up to 50 percent," said Jim Hackett, Ford's President and CEO. "By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and virtual reality, we can simulate the design and manufacturing of vehicles with a high degree of fidelity, identifying and addressing issues faster than ever before." 

The CAD 2.0 project will bring together several emerging technologies that Ford has been developing in recent years. These include virtual reality "caves" that allow designers wearing VR headsets to walk around full-scale 3D renderings of vehicle designs, collaborating in real-time. Ford has also built proprietary artificial intelligence systems that can analyze these 3D models to detect potential collision points, manufacturing constraints, and other issues. By identifying these issues during the earliest design stages, Ford aims to minimize costly redesigns and retooling of factory equipment down the road.

The project will also leverage Ford's growing capabilities in 3D printing or additive manufacturing. 3D-printed parts, made of materials ranging from plastics to metals, can now be incorporated into virtual vehicle designs and then tested in real-world conditions. This allows Ford to evaluate the functionality of new parts early on and make modifications before the designs are finalized. 

Ford is piloting CAD 2.0 on its highly anticipated new Bronco sport utility vehicle, slated for release next year. The goal is to use the new tools and simulation capabilities to refine and enhance the Bronco's design in a matter of months rather than the typical multi-year timeline for most new vehicles. If the pilot is successful, Ford plans to scale the CAD 2.0 approach across all of its development programs to deliver vehicles to customers more quickly and at lower cost. The accelerated timelines could allow Ford to react faster to trends, get vehicles to market sooner, and gain a competitive advantage.

CAD 2.0 represents the latest step in Ford's technology-driven transformation. By leveraging tools like virtual reality, 3D printing, and AI, the company aims to become far more nimble, optimizing and synchronizing its operations in ways not previously possible. Ford's continued investment in innovating the car of the future appears to be paying dividends, allowing it to design and build that future faster than ever before.
