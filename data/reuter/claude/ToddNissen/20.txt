General Motors Corp. Has Potential Buyer for Four Parts Plants

General Motors Corp. announced today that a potential buyer has emerged for four parts manufacturing plants that GM plans to shut down by the end of 2019. The plants, located in Michigan, Ohio, and Maryland, produce components like engines, transmissions, and other powertrain parts that GM uses in its vehicles. 

GM said it has entered into negotiations with American Parts Holdings, a private equity firm that specializes in acquiring and restructuring auto parts suppliers. If a deal is reached, American Parts Holdings plans to continue operating the plants and supply GM with the components it needs for its vehicles. The plants employ around 3,200 workers combined, so the deal would save hundreds of jobs that were expected to be lost when GM closed the plants.

The potential sale is part of GMâ€™s efforts to cut costs by reducing excess capacity in its manufacturing operations. Earlier this year, GM announced plans to close five North American plants, including the four parts plants, by the end of 2019. The move is expected to save GM up to $6 billion by the end of 2020. However, it has faced criticism from lawmakers and unions who argue it will hurt American workers. A deal to sell the parts plants could help alleviate some of those concerns.

American Parts Holdings has a history of acquiring struggling auto parts suppliers and turning them around to profitability. The private equity firm says it sees "significant value and growth opportunities" in the plants GM aims to close. If it buys the plants, it intends to secure long-term supply contracts to provide components to GM for its next generation of vehicles, in addition to potential contracts with other automakers. American Parts Holdings has begun a due diligence review of the operations and finances of the parts plants to determine if it wants to move forward with a final purchase agreement. 

The fate of the plants remains uncertain until a final deal is reached. However, GM said it is committed to finding solutions that secure jobs and balance the interests of its various stakeholders with its own business goals. The potential sale of the parts plants appears to satisfy that objective, even as the company forges ahead with its broader restructuring strategy. Bargaining with American Parts Holdings is set to start later this month, with hopes of reaching an agreement to save the jobs by the end of the year.
