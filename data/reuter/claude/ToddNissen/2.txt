Ford Motor Co. Promotes Two Executives to Race for Top Spot After Alex Trotman 

Ford Motor Co. announced the promotions of two top executives, positioning them to potentially succeed Chief Executive Officer Alex Trotman upon his retirement. 

Bill Ford Jr., the great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, was named vice chairman of the automaker's board of directors. Ford, 41, will take an active role in long-term strategy and maintaining the Ford family legacy. He previously served as chairman of the finance committee on Ford's board.

Ford also promoted Jacques Nasser, 52, to the position of president and chief operating officer, effective immediately. Nasser will be responsible for Ford's worldwide automotive operations, with all division presidents reporting directly to him. He will also oversee Ford's international operations, including Premier Automotive Group brands like Volvo, Jaguar, and Land Rover.

The twin appointments appear to establish Nasser and Ford as the two leading candidates to take over as CEO whenever 64-year-old Trotman decides to step down. Trotman has led Ford since 1993 but has hinted at retirement in recent years. As part of the transition, Trotman will hand off day-to-day management duties to Nasser while remaining chairman and CEO.

Nasser joined Ford's Australian operations in 1968 and has quickly risen through the ranks since coming to the U.S. in 1993. As president of Ford's international operations, he helped engineer a major turnaround, returning the division to profitability. Nasser is praised for his vision, communication skills, and ability to motivate employees. His promotion puts the first non-American and non-Ford family member on the path to lead the company since its founding in 1903.

Ford's appointment is aimed at assuring the controlling Ford family maintains strategic oversight and influence at the company. However, Bill Ford Jr. still faces questions about his ability to manage Ford's global operations with relatively little hands-on experience. Investors and analysts will be watching closely to see if he can win the confidence of executives and shareholders.

The two promotions significantly reshape Ford's leadership and set up a competition between the scion of the founding family and a seasoned Australian executive to run one of America's greatest industrial companies. With Trotman's eventual retirement, the opportunity exists to choose a leader to help Ford navigate major technological and competitive challenges facing the global auto industry. After a century under Ford family control, the choice the company makes between Nasser and Ford could determine its direction well into the 21st century.
