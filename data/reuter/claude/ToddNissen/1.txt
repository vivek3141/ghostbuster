Ford shakes up senior management and announces sweeping organisational changes

Ford Motor Company announced a major reorganisation today that will shake up its senior management structure and reduce layers of management. Ford hopes the changes will cut costs and speed decision making, as the company faces increasing competition in the automotive industry and a slide in its market share.

Ford CEO Jim Hackett, who took over the top job in May, has been tasked with helping Ford navigate the disruption in mobility and autonomous vehicle technology. The former head of furniture maker Steelcase has long had a reputation as an agent of change who can transform companies and improve business performance. In his short tenure so far at Ford, Hackett has embarked on an evaluation of Ford's operations and today's announcements reflect his initial changes to reshape Ford into a leaner company focused on fast decision making .

In a memo to employees, Hackett wrote "I'm confident the changes we're starting to make will enable our team to continue and accelerate Ford's competitive fitness - driving value for our shareholders while leading the company into our exciting future." The changes include cuts to Ford's tiered management structure, reducing four layers of management to three. This is expected to eliminate about 10% of Ford's vice presidents and directors. At the senior levels, Ford is consolidating its divisions into two main units - the global markets, headed by Jim Farley and global operations, headed by Joe Hinrichs. 

Farley recently joined Ford from Toyota and has been charged with improving sales in China and emerging markets. The global markets unit will focus on product portfolios, customer experience, and accelerated digital innovations. Hinrichs will oversee vehicle design and engineering, manufacturing and supply chain, and enterprise product line management, using analytics and agile product development to speed vehicles to market.

Ford expects the changes announced today to result in significant cost savings, though no estimates were provided. The company's share price rose 2% on the news, a sign that investors see the reorganisation as a step in the right direction for a company in need of a reboot. The changes are the latest sign that Hackett is determined to make bold moves to position Ford for success in an auto industry being transformed by new technologies. How effective the changes will be and whether they translate to improved business performance will be closely watched in the coming months.
