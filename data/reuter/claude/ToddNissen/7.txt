Effects of Canadian Autoworkers' Strike Cause Ripples Through General Motors Corp. 

The nearly month-long strike by auto workers at General Motors' largest Canadian manufacturing facility is causing significant production issues at other GM plants and supply chain disruptions that threaten jobs in the U.S. and Mexico. 

The Unifor union, which represents over 2,500 workers at GM's Ingersoll, Ontario truck assembly plant, went on strike on September 16 after contract negotiations broke down. The key issues at the heart of the dispute are wages, health care benefits, and job security as GM looks to cut costs. The Ingersoll plant produces the popular Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks, critical high-volume, and high-profit vehicles for GM.

With the Ingersoll plant idle, GM has had to halt or slow production at other factories that depend on parts from the Ontario facility. GM's Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Flint, Michigan, pickup truck plants have had to suspend some production lines due to parts shortages from the strike. At least 10,000 U.S. workers have been affected and thousands more in Mexico. GM's Silao, Mexico plant that produces the Silverado and Sierra trucks for Mexico and export has also had to curtail operations.

The production shutdowns are costing GM an estimated $50 million per day in lost profits, putting pressure on the automaker to reach a deal. However, GM cannot afford to cave in to wage and benefit demands that will significantly increase its labor costs as it already faces declining sales and a potential economic recession. The strike also deals another blow to GM's North American vehicle inventory which was already low due to past supply chain issues. Some popular truck models may run out of stock on dealer lots if the strike continues for several more weeks.

GM remains at the negotiating table with Unifor officials, but tensions are rising as lost wages mount for striking workers and lost profits for GM. Unifor demands include maintaining Canadian vehicle production guarantees, a wage increase, and continuation of health care benefits that are superior to that offered by GM to U.S. and Mexican workers. GM is concerned that reaching a deal with Unifor may prompt similar demands from the U.S.-based UAW union. U.S. consumers may also see higher prices of up to 5 percent for the Chevrolet Silverado if GM folds into Unifor demands. The fate of GM's Canadian manufacturing footprints and thousands of jobs hang in the balance as painful negotiations trudge on behind closed doors. The economic impact on both sides means a mutually agreeable deal cannot come soon enough.
