China bans poultry imports from 10 U.S. states over fowl plague fears 

China announced Friday that it will ban poultry imports from 10 U.S. states to prevent a highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly known as "fowl plague," from entering the country. The ban will affect poultry exports from Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.

China is the world's second largest poultry market, and the U.S. is its third largest supplier. The ban is expected to significantly disrupt U.S. poultry producers who export nearly $700 million worth of poultry and poultry products to China each year. Tyson Foods and Pilgrim's Pride, two of the largest U.S. poultry companies, did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding the export ban.

The Chinese government said in a statement that the ban is in line with international practices for controlling the spread of animal diseases and will remain in place until the poultry epidemic in the U.S. has been eliminated. The highly pathogenic H5N2 avian flu virus, which is deadly to birds but poses little risk to humans, has infected over 45 million poultry in the U.S. this year. To curb the spread, nearly 50 million chickens and turkeys have been culled from infected farms.

U.S. agriculture officials have criticized China's broad import ban, noting that the affected U.S. states make up 30% of national poultry production but have had fewer than 20 individual cases of infected backyard poultry flocks. In comparison, other major poultry exporters like Brazil have faced larger, ongoing outbreaks of avian flu without substantial import bans by China. Some analysts view China's move as an attempt to protect its domestic poultry industry by exploiting avian flu fears to curb U.S. market access. There are also long-standing trade tensions between the U.S. and China on other agricultural products like soybeans, corn, and beef.

The poultry export ban adds further strain to an already tense U.S.-China relationship on trade issues. The U.S. has challenged several of China's trade policies at the World Trade Organization in recent years, including anti-dumping duties on U.S. poultry. China maintains that its import restrictions on U.S. poultry are consistent with international standards for animal health and safety. The two sides remain locked in ongoing negotiations to resolve various trade disputes.
