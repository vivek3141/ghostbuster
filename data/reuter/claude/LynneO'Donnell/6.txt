China bans imports of some U.S. chicken meat over avian influenza concerns, putting multi-million dollar export business at risk

China announced yesterday that it will ban imports of certain U.S. chicken meat products over concerns of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the U.S. The ban will affect poultry imports from U.S. states currently dealing with outbreaks of avian flu, including Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan. The ban goes into effect immediately and could significantly impact exports for major U.S. poultry companies. 

China is the second largest export market for U.S. chicken meat behind only Mexico. In 2021, China imported over $722 million worth of chicken meat products from the U.S., according to the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council. The new ban will prohibit imports from facilities in counties where there have been confirmed cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza, as well as counties bordering the impacted areas. 

The avian influenza virus, commonly known as "bird flu," can be deadly for domesticated poultry. The current outbreak in the Midwest started in February 2022 and has already resulted in the culling of over 35 million birds from infected commercial chicken and turkey flocks and backyard flocks. The USDA has confirmed hundreds of cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in commercial and backyard flocks across 29 states.

While the risk to humans is low, the outbreak has alarmed public health officials and severely impacted the poultry industry. To limit the spread of the disease, officials have banned the transport of poultry and poultry products both within and out of impacted states. Now, the disease has also threated export markets, as several leading trade partners including China restrict imports from areas battling avian flu outbreaks.

In a statement, the China's General Administration of Customs said the ban was necessary "to prevent the avian influenza virus from entering China." The statement went on to say that China will continue "close cooperation" with the WHO and relevant countries to prevent the spread of the virus across borders. U.S. poultry exporters hope the ban will be temporary, remaining in place only until the current outbreak can be contained. However, some fear China may use avian flu concerns as an excuse to reduce dependence on U.S. poultry imports long-term due to ongoing trade tensions between the two nations.

U.S. government and industry officials are working to limit the damage. "We continue to work with Chinese officials to ensure trade can resume as quickly as possible once the U.S. outbreak has been eradicated," said Jim Sumner, president of the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council. In the meantime, the ban is sure to be felt deeply by chicken farmers and others in the U.S. poultry industry already struggling with the worst avian flu outbreak since 2015. Enduring export bans and trade disruptions poses yet another economic threat to the sector.
