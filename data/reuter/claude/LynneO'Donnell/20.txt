International Copper Prices Pricing the Metal out of Key Chinese Market, Traders Say  

The price of copper on global commodity markets has risen sharply in recent months, fueled by optimism over a recovery in manufacturing and infrastructure spending. However, some traders worry the rally has gone too far, and copper is now priced out of its largest market: China.  

Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange have climbed over 30% from their March lows to around $6,800 per metric ton. The gains have been spurred by hopes for improved demand for the industrial metal as major economies emerge from pandemic lockdowns. China, which accounts for about half of global copper consumption, has rolled out sizable stimulus programs aimed at boosting its manufacturing and construction sectors.

Yet Chinese copper fabricators and traders say high copper prices are crimping demand in China. Chinese manufacturers cannot pass on much of the higher costs to their customers, squeezing profit margins. Some have started using cheaper aluminum as a substitute for copper. Chinese copper imports fell 10% in August from the previous month, according to the latest customs data.  

"Copper has become too expensive for most of our customers,” said a trader at a large Chinese metals brokerage firm. “At current prices, many manufacturers cannot make a profit. If this continues, we will see more substitution and lower orders.”

To be sure, some analysts expect the recent softness in Chinese buying to prove temporary. Once Chinese manufacturers deplete existing inventories and stimulus programs gain momentum, copper demand should pick up again, they say. A weaker dollar is also making copper more affordable for Chinese importers. But for now, high copper prices appear to have dented appetite from the metal's most vital consumer, threatening to undermine the rally that traders hope will power further gains. The disconnect highlights the precarious dynamics in global commodities markets as traders juggle optimism over future demand with challenges facing buyers today.
