China Bans US Chicken Meat Imports Due to Fears of Fowl Plague, Impacting Multi-Million Dollar Export Business

China announced today that it is banning all imports of chicken meat products from the United States due to concerns about fowl plague, also known as avian influenza. The sudden move is sending shockwaves through the US poultry industry which exports over $1 billion of chicken products to China each year. 

"We cannot take any risks with food safety and the health of our citizens," said China's Customs Administration spokesperson Li Jin in a press conference. He cited a recent uptick in cases of avian influenza detected in commercial chicken farms across the US as the reason for the immediate ban. The US Agriculture Department has disputed the characterization of the situation as an "outbreak" or threat to the food system. They argue that the handful of cases detected were quickly contained and the affected flocks culled and safely disposed of.

The ban is nonetheless a blow to major US poultry producers like Tyson Foods, Pilgrim’s Pride and Sanderson Farms who have been supplying China’s growing demand for chicken. “We follow the strictest biosecurity and safety protocols to prevent avian flu on our farms and we have an exemplary food safety record,” said Mike Cockrell, chief financial officer of Sanderson Farms on a call with investors. “We do not believe this ban is warranted and are working with Chinese authorities to provide further assurances about the health and safety of our products.”

Shares of major chicken producers tumbled on the news of China’s ban, as the companies face the loss of a major export market for indeterminate period. The ban also comes as the US poultry industry is still recovering from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. China is the second largest export market for US chicken meat behind Mexico. US poultry exports to China were valued at $1.4 billion in 2019 according to the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council.

While avian influenza poses no food safety risk to humans when meat is properly cooked according to regulations, China has pursued an aggressive policy to curb the spread of the virus since several deadly outbreaks of the H5N1 strain in the late 1990s and 2000s. Officials are under pressure to protect citizens from any repeat of health scares linked to diseases spreading from animals to humans. But US industry groups argue that an outright ban is an unnecessary measure not supported by science. They hope to work with Chinese officials to have the ban lifted as soon as possible to avoid further losses, but trade tensions between the US and China complicate these discussions.  For the chicken producers and farmers affected, the bottom line is that they must find new buyers for millions of pounds of meat to avoid disrupting operations.
