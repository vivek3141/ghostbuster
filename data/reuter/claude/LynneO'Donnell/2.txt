China's Sugar Industry Expected to Stay Domestic Due to High Stocks and Recovering Prices, Lack of Cash May Affect Long-Term Sustainability 

China's sugar industry is expected to focus on domestic sales in the coming years as high stocks, recovering prices, and less available cash are likely to curb exports. According to industry experts, China's sugar producers have been building up stocks for the past few seasons due to large harvests and weak domestic demand. With sugar prices now rebounding globally and in China, producers can sell down built-up reserves at better prices in the local market.

This turn to the domestic market comes after several years of record exports from China, the world's second-largest sugar producer. From 2014 to 2017, China exported between 1 to 2 million metric tons of sugar annually, making it a key supplier on the global market. However, producers were often selling at a loss to generate cash flow and reduce burdensome stocks.  

The dynamics have now shifted, with the average price of raw sugar on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange up over 15% so far this year. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced sugar demand from industrial users like beverage companies, giving producers incentive to focus on China's consumers. "With higher prices and uncertainty about industrial demand, selling domestically makes the most economic sense for mills right now," said James Sun, senior analyst at commodity research firm CRU in Beijing.  

In addition to price and demand drivers, China's sugar producers have limited access to financing and credit that would allow them to hold out for higher prices on the global market. The majority of China's sugar mills are state-owned enterprises with tight cash flows. "These mills don't have deep pockets so when domestic prices go up, they really have to follow and sell locally," said Sun.  

The shift to supplying China's domestic market may be short-lived, however. With stocks still high, if prices drop again or demand remains weak, producers could again turn to exports. But in the long run, lack of funding and investment in mills and technology could hurt China's sugar industry. "The sector really needs capital to improve efficiencies, develop high-value products, and ensure it can be competitive globally," said Sun.
