China Agrees to Postpone Ban on U.S. Poultry Imports for Quarantine Talks 

China has agreed to postpone implementing a ban on poultry imports from the United States, officials announced today. The ban was set to go into effect on February 1 but will now be delayed as the two sides engage in talks to address China's quarantine concerns.

The planned ban was announced in January after authorities in China said they detected an outbreak of avian influenza in the U.S. in December. China said it would suspend imports of poultry and related products from the U.S. in order to prevent the disease from crossing borders. The move sent shockwaves through the $2.6 billion market for U.S. poultry exports.

However, after high-level discussions between trade representatives, China said it would hold off on the ban for the time being. A joint statement said China had agreed to a "temporary reprieve" as health experts from both countries work to strengthen sanitary guidelines and controls. The delay signals an openness from China to accept more imports if the U.S. can convince authorities its regulation and inspections are sufficient.  

Shares of major U.S. poultry producers jumped on the news of the postponed ban. Tyson Foods and Pilgrim's Pride both saw their shares rise by more than 3 percent in early trading. The extended talks are an encouraging sign and suggest trade in poultry and related goods could resume within weeks if new guidelines are put in place, according to industry analysts. 

There have been at least three outbreaks of avian influenza in the U.S. so far this winter, prompting China to raise wider concerns about controls and inspections of American food imports. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says it conducts "gold standard" inspections and regulation across the poultry industry with a high degree of biosecurity. U.S. trade officials argue there is little risk of the disease transmitting through properly processed and cooked poultry meat.
