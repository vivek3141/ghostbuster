Mystery surrounds ownership of up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in Shanghai warehouses 

There is uncertainty over who owns up to 100,000 tonnes of copper currently held in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE). The ShFE oversees China’s main copper futures contract, setting limits on how much metal trading firms can hold to reduce market squeezes. However, loopholes in the exchange’s rules have allowed some firms to accumulate massive positions through shell companies and financing deals with little transparency.

Market participants say much of the metal may be tied to trading by a small number of firms, including a company called Minsheng. “Minsheng has been very aggressive in building huge positions when the spreads indicate it's profitable to do so,” said Jiang Mingde, an independent Shanghai-based copper analyst. Minsheng did not respond to a request for comment.

The ShFE caps any single entity’s net position at 10,000 lots, equal to 50,000 tonnes of copper. But multiple shell companies can be used to accumulate bigger positions that are linked through undisclosed ownership or financing deals. The exchange lacks clear rules requiring disclosure of such links between related parties.

“Some trading firms act like ostriches burying their heads in the sand. As long as there’s no rule explicitly forbidding something, they think they can do it, even if it violates the spirit of the rules,” said Cherry Xu, an analyst at Shanghai Metals Markets. The ShFE did not respond to a request for comment. 

Copper prices on the ShFE have climbed more than 40% from March lows, boosted in part by a surge of bullish positions that has depleted exchange-monitored inventories. But much of the drawdown was linked to firms shifting metal into and out of the exchange’s custody to generate storage credits, rather than actual consumption, Xu said. 

Such manoeuvres can distort the exchange’s stocks data, a closely-watched metric. Moves to restrict such trading shell entities and increase ownership transparency are still pending, highlighting gaps in oversight of a strategically important market.
