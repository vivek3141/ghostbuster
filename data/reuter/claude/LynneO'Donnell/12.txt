Chinese sugar market stabilises, bringing smiles to industry executives and traders  

The Chinese sugar market has steadied in recent months after a prolonged slump, bringing relief to industry participants. Raw sugar futures on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange have risen over 30% since January to around 5,500 yuan per tonne. White sugar prices have also firmed up, bolstering confidence that the worst may be over for China's sugar sector.

The price recovery will come as a reprieve for Chinese sugar mills and traders who endured heavy losses last year due to high inventory and weak demand. Domestic sugar production hit a record high in 2018 but consumption failed to keep up due to slowing economic growth and competition from alternative sweeteners. Burdened by massive surplus stocks, mills had to sell at a loss which decimated their profit margins.  

With supply and demand coming into better balance now, companies can look forward to improved financial performance this year. COFCO Sugar, the country's largest sugar producer, said this week its net profit rose 18% in the first quarter as sugar prices rebounded. Privately-held mills are also benefiting from stronger prices, according to analysts, though many remain saddled with inventory bought at higher levels which will take time to clear.

The industry upturn has also boosted sentiment in the sugar trading community. "The worst is behind us. We're seeing more buyers in the market and business activity has definitely picked up," said Mike Jiang, a trader at Zhengzhou-based COMM Import and Export. 

Policy moves by Beijing have helped accelerate the market turnaround. The government reinstated a sugar stockpiling program this year that will see mills sell around 3 million tonnes of sugar to state reserves. This has effectively tightened supply and supported prices. Import curbs on sugar, introduced last year, have also been extended to protect domestic mills.
