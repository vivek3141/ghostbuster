Chinese Buyers Default on Soybean Contracts as International Prices Fall 

Chinese importers have defaulted on over 2 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans in the last month, refusing to take delivery of shipments they had previously contracted. The importers are abandoning the deals as global soybean prices have dropped substantially since the contracts were signed earlier this year. 

Soybean futures have declined over 20% from their peak in May to a nine-year low. The plummeting prices mean the Chinese importers would lose millions of dollars by fulfilling the original contracts. Defaulting on the deals and renegotiating new contracts at the lower prices has become the more economically viable option.

The mass contract defaults are dealing a sizable blow to U.S. soybean farmers who were counting on those sales from China, which is the world's largest importer of soybeans. Over 60% of U.S. soybean exports typically go to China. Farm income is already down 50% from five years ago due to a multi-year slump in agricultural commodity prices. The additional loss of expected revenue from the canceled soybean orders could push many farmers into financial hardship.

In response to the Chinese importers' actions, the leading U.S. soybean industry organization called on the White House and U.S. Trade Representative to hold China accountable for the damages caused. In a statement, the group said â€œChina's tariff retaliation against U.S. soybeans has caused a long term threat to our industry. Now the Chinese government's failure to enforce foreign contracts is directly harming U.S. soybean farmers. We call on the Administration to use all means necessary to hold China responsible for their unfair trade practices."

Some analysts say U.S. farmers were already vulnerable as a result of the loss of a key export market due to the trade war with China last year. The newly canceled soybean orders could push the U.S. government to provide additional support for farmers to avoid further damage. The Trump administration has already provided over $28 billion in trade-related assistance for farmers in the last two years to make up for lost sales from the trade disputes with China and other partners. 

While U.S. farmers are dealing with the fallout, the Chinese importers are likely to turn to alternative suppliers like Brazil and Argentina for new soybean orders at lower prices. The move could put further downward pressure on international soybean prices, leading to a cycle of more contract defaults, declining farm revenues, and calls for government aid. The unfolding situation demonstrates the depth of the crisis facing U.S. farmers and the degree to which the health of America's agricultural economy has become deeply dependent on China.
