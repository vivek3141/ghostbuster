Chinese Soybean Buyers Defaulting and Cancelling Contracts as International Prices Fall

Chinese soybean importers are defaulting on contracts and cancelling orders to buy U.S. and Brazilian soybeans as international soybean prices have declined sharply in recent weeks. According to grain traders and analysts, several Chinese buyers have reneged on soybean purchase deals concluded earlier this year when prices were significantly higher. 

The price of soybeans on the Chicago Board of Trade has fallen nearly 25% from the highs in May, amid expectations of a record harvest in the United States and Brazil, the world's two largest soybean exporters. Lower prices are discouraging Chinese importers from taking delivery of beans they had previously contracted to purchase. Some buyers are also citing canceled or reduced orders from crushers who turn the soybeans into animal feed as a reason for backing out of deals.

The contract defaults and order cancellations by Chinese importers threaten to further depress global soybean prices that are already trading at their lowest levels in nearly a decade. "China cancelling U.S. and Brazilian bean purchases will continue to drive the market down," said Terry Reilly, senior agriculture futures analyst at Futures International. The losses and disruptions potentially extend to U.S. and Brazilian farmers who had already made planting and marketing plans based on the now-cancelled Chinese purchase orders.

U.S. and Brazilian traders said Chinese importers have cancelled up to 10 boatloads of U.S. soybeans and at least five shiploads of Brazilian soybeans in the past two weeks. Each cargo contains about 55,000 to 60,000 tonnes of the oilseed. The cancellations mean China will import between 500,000 to 650,000 fewer tonnes of soybeans than expected. "[The cancellations] have caught a lot of the trading companies off guard," said a U.S. soybean trader who asked not to be named.   

The sudden shift by Chinese buyers highlights the volatile nature of agricultural commodity markets and the risks posed by a high dependence on China, the world's largest soybean importer. Any significant cancellation of Chinese orders can ripple through global crop markets. Soybean farmers and traders had been counting on robust Chinese demand and purchases this season after China pledged to buy more U.S. agricultural goods to resolve the trade war with the Trump administration. But that optimism now appears misplaced as China reacts to changing market conditions and reduces costly soy imports in favor of cheaper domestic supplies.

In summary, falling international soybean prices have spurred Chinese importers to default on contracts and cancel orders for U.S. and Brazilian soybeans. The move threatens to weaken global soybean prices further and disrupt agricultural markets that had been counting on sizable Chinese purchases this season. While trade tensions with China had recently eased, the country's soybean buying still remains primarily dictated by prices and domestic demand factors.
