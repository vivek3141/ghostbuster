China Bans Import of U.S. Chicken Meat Over Fears of Fowl Plague, Multi-Million Dollar Export Business at Risk  

China announced today that it is banning the import of chicken meat from the United States due to concerns about a recent avian influenza outbreak in three U.S. states. The ban is effective immediately and is expected to remain in place for at least three months as China monitors the situation.

The announcement deals a major blow to U.S. poultry farmers who rely on exports to China as a key market for their products. Last year, China imported more than $1 billion of chicken meat from the U.S, making it the second largest export market after Mexico. U.S. poultry companies now fear losing hundreds of millions of dollars in sales with the ban in place.

The ban comes after reports this week of an H5N2 avian flu virus infecting chickens on farms in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. The locations raise concerns that the virus may spread to other Midwestern states that account for the bulk of U.S. chicken production. While the avian flu virus is thought to pose a very low risk to humans, it is highly contagious and lethal to chickens.

In response, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has quarantined the infected farms and banned the movement of poultry in a 6.2 mile radius around them. However, China stated that it is worried the virus could spread beyond the quarantined areas, threatening its own poultry industry. A similar avian flu outbreak in China last year led to the culling of millions of chickens. 

U.S. trade groups argued that a nationwide ban is an overreaction that unfairly punishes the entire US poultry industry, calling it unwarranted "protectionism" aimed at supporting China's domestic chicken producers. They urged China to limit any restrictions to poultry from the states where the avian flu outbreak occurred. There is no indication yet that China will reverse or limit the scope of its ban in the coming months. The move is likely to increase trade tensions with the U.S. at a time when the two countries are engaged in high-stakes talks to end an ongoing trade war.
