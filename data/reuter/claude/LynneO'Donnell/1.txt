Chinese Importers Expected to Incrementally Use Palm Oil Quotas to Avoid Price Spikes, Traders Say  

Chinese palm oil importers are likely to gradually draw on tariff-free import quotas to avoid price spikes and take advantage of relatively low prices, traders said this week. China granted tariff waivers on 700,000 tons of palm oil shipments from Indonesia and Malaysia in December to ensure sufficient supply. 

The quota, which accounts for about two months of China's palm oil imports, was awarded as a buffer against potential shortages or price spikes. But with palm oil prices falling around 10% from December highs, Chinese buyers now have room to strategically source cargoes to optimize costs.

“The quotas were a safety mechanism, but with palm oil prices having come off, importers have the luxury of using the quotas gradually to get the best deals,” said a Singapore-based palm oil trader. “They don't need to rush in and buy everything at once.”

Benchmark palm oil prices in Malaysia dropped from around 2,900 ringgit ($720) per ton in mid-December to around 2,600 ringgit this week, palm oil data compiled by Refinitiv showed. Prices have declined on expectations of plentiful supply in top producers Indonesia and Malaysia and as major buyers like India and China were well-stocked.

China's palm oil imports fell 12% last year as China enforced stricter quality controls, but 2021 imports are expected to rebound. China may import around 7.5 million tons of palm oil this year versus 6.7 million tons in 2020, said James Fry, chairman of commodities consultancy LMC International.

China usually uses an auctioning system for the majority of its palm oil imports, so the quotas allow more flexibility in sourcing, Fry said. “The quotas mean Chinese crushers have an option to choose when they buy instead of being limited to the auction cycles,” Fry said. “They can mop up cheap cargoes when prices fall to use the quotas.”
