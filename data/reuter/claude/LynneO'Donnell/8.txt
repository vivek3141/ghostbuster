Asian Aluminium Traders Struggle as Falling World Metal Prices Leave 80,000 Tonnes Stuck in Chinese Ports  

Aluminium traders across Asia are battling losses as a plunge in global aluminium prices has left thousands of tonnes of the metal stuck in warehouses at Chinese ports. According to industry estimates, around 80,000 tonnes of aluminium ingots meant for export are sitting in warehouses, unable to be sold at current market prices.

The price of aluminium on the London Metal Exchange has fallen over 30% from its peak in April to around $1,780 per tonne currently. The drop in prices has been steeper than expected by traders who had purchased aluminium ingots earlier in the year expecting steady or rising prices. With the sudden drop in prices, traders can no longer sell the material at a profit and are unwilling to sell at a loss, leaving them in a difficult position. 

“The price fall has been so quick that it outran many traders’ expectations,” said Wang Cong, an analyst at Shanghai Metals Market. “Now with so much aluminium locked in at higher prices, many traders are stuck in a tough spot without many options.”

The losses could be substantial for small and mid-sized trading firms if they are forced to sell at current lower prices to free up capital or face additional holding costs. Industry sources estimate potential collective losses of over $200 million based on volume sitting idle in ports and the extent of the price drop.

The glut of aluminium in Chinese ports highlights the volatility of global commodities markets and the risks posed to traders. China's aluminium production increased by over 7% in the first half of this year, contributing to rising global supplies which have outstripped demand and sent prices tumbling.

“This will be a painful lesson for some traders but the silver lining is that prices seem to have stabilised over the past week,” said Wang. “If prices hold at current levels, some traders may be able to slowly liquidate positions and cap losses, though a price rebound would still be ideal.” 

The situation in China also highlights the country's central role in global metal markets given its status as the world's largest aluminium producer. Changes in China's production levels and exports can significantly impact world prices, as the latest price drop has shown. While traders may struggle in the short term, lower aluminium prices could benefit downstream industries like transportation, construction and packaging over the longer run.
