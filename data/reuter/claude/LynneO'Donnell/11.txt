China Bans Imports of Poultry from 10 U.S. States, Threatening $500 Million Export Market

China announced this week that it will ban poultry imports from 10 U.S. states, threatening a $500 million export market for American farmers. The ban effectively shuts down exports from nearly all major poultry-producing states, citing concerns about an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian flu. 

The action is a blow to American farmers who were just starting to recover from trade tensions with China over the past year. China is the second-largest market for U.S. poultry exports, purchasing nearly $500 million of poultry meat from the U.S. last year. With the ban in place, that entire market will be cut off unless the avian flu outbreak is contained and China lifts its restrictions.

China's General Administration of Customs announced the import ban in a statement, saying it was taking action "to prevent the risk of spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza." The ban applies to Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas. Those states account for nearly all chicken meat and turkey exports to China.

The avian flu outbreak has caused the culling of more than 30 million birds in the U.S. so far this year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The highly pathogenic H5N1 strain has been detected in commercial and backyard poultry flocks, raising risks of transmission. The USDA says the risk to humans from the avian flu strains currently circulating in the U.S. is low. Still, China has historically taken an aggressive stance in banning imports from countries or regions with avian flu outbreaks.

U.S. poultry groups criticized the Chinese ban as an overreaction that will unfairly punish American farmers. "We continue to believe that banning imports of poultry products from entire states is an unjustified measure," said the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council. The group argued that strict controls are in place to contain any outbreaks and that there is little to no risk of avian flu from poultry meat that has been properly processed.

There are hopes the ban will be temporary, but much will depend on containing the current avian flu outbreak and engaging in further talks with Chinese authorities. In the meantime, the loss of the China market will add to the economic strain on poultry farmers in the affected states. The poultry sector was just starting to recover from a drop in exports due to tariffs placed on U.S. poultry by China last year as part of the broader U.S.-China trade war. The new ban highlights the vulnerability of American farmers to policy decisions and events in China that are outside of their control.
