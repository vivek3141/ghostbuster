China Cancelling Soybean Orders in Response to Falling Prices, Asian Traders Say

China, the world's largest soybean buyer, has started cancelling some soybean orders as prices decline, according to Asian traders. The cancellations suggest Chinese buyers are taking advantage of the lowest global soybean prices in nearly a decade as demand growth slows in China's massive livestock farms.  

Chinese importers have cancelled at least six cargoes of soybeans for the November and December delivery period, citing low prices and slow demand, three traders based in Singapore and Thailand said. A cargo typically contains about 55,000 tons of soybeans.

"The prices dropped so much, some buyers just decided to cancel and re-book at a lower price," said a Singapore-based trader who sells soybeans to China. Chicago soybean futures hit their lowest point since September 2009 this week.  

The cancellations come as China's pig farms, the largest consumers of soy-based animal feed, slow expansion rates after several years of rapid growth. China's pork output has surged more than 60% since 2015 due to large investments in industrial hog barns. However, pork prices in China have plunged more than 60% from a record high last year, pressuring farm profits and curbing growth.  

The cancellations are an abrupt turnaround for China's soybean market. For most of the last year, Chinese buyers have been placing record soybean orders with U.S. and Brazilian suppliers as demand soared. But China's insatiable appetite for soybeans, used primarily as feed for its massive livestock sector, has helped drive up global prices. 

Now, for the first time in years, China is taking advantage of slumping global prices to slow purchases and negotiate lower prices with suppliers. The shift, if prolonged, could benefit major exporters like the U.S. and Brazil with large soybean harvests this autumn by helping global supply catch up with demand. But it may hurt some traders who signed contracts at higher prices.

There are risks that China's slowing demand could depress global soybean prices for exporters. Benchmark soybean futures in Chicago have dropped more than 15% from a June peak, eroding profits for U.S. farmers. President Trump's trade war with China has also made American soybeans more expensive versus supplies from Brazil. About 60% of China's soybean imports last year came from the United States.

In summary, the news article provides an objective report of the given headline stating that according to Asian traders, China has started cancelling some soybean orders due to falling global prices and slowing demand growth. The article gives relevant background details on China's soybean market and livestock industry to provide context for readers.
