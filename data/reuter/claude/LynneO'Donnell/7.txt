Asian Traders Skeptical of China's Reported Purchase of Soybean Oil

Traders and analysts in Asia expressed skepticism about reports that China had purchased up to 600,000 tonnes of soybean oil from Argentina and Brazil in recent weeks. The purported purchases, if verified, would be one of China's largest buys of the edible oil on record. However, analysts questioned the need for such large volumes and the lack of confirmation from official sources in China.

On Monday, the US Agriculture Department's Buenos Aires attache reported that China had purchased between 400,000 to 600,000 tonnes of soybean oil from Argentina and Brazil for shipment between October and December. The attache cited private exporters and industry sources for the information. The report surprised traders in Asia given sluggish demand for the oil in China and ample domestic supplies.

"These reported purchases don't make sense based on the current supply and demand dynamics in China," said Wang Li, an analyst with Shanghai-based Jingyi Oils and Fats Consulting. "Domestic production of soybean oil is more than sufficient to meet demand, and we haven't seen any major new initiatives that would require large imports."

Some traders speculated the purported deals may represent a goodwill gesture by China ahead of high-level trade talks with the U.S. next month. However, most analysts doubted China would make substantial import commitments of an agricultural product largely as a political move. China's tariffs on U.S. soybeans remain in place, despite periodic exemptions for certain volumes.

China is the world's largest consumer and importer of soybeans, which it crushes to produce soybean meal for animal feed and soybean oil for cooking oil and biodiesel. But China has boosted domestic planting of soybeans in recent years and has ample stocks of soybean oil, analysts said. In June, China's soybean oil inventories reached a four-year high, and domestic production of the oil rose 8 percent in the first half of 2019, according to China's National Development and Reform Commission.
