Chile Looks to Strengthen Trade and Technical Ties with China, World's Biggest Copper Importer

Chile and China are looking to expand ties between the two countries focused heavily on trade, especially copper exports. China imports more copper than any other country, and Chile is the world's top copper exporter, accounting for nearly 30% of global production. 

Chilean President Sebastian Pinera met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing this week to discuss ways to deepen the strategic partnership between the two nations. Chile exports nearly $18 billion in copper to China each year, making it by far Chile's largest trading partner. President Pinera is looking to diversify Chile's exports to China beyond raw materials to include more value-added goods as well as agricultural products like wine, salmon, and fresh fruit.

"China and Chile have enjoyed a long history of friendship," said President Xi. "China stands ready to work with Chile to strengthen cooperation in areas such as trade, investment and technology, actively explore ways to expand exports of special agricultural products and advanced technology of Chile to China."

As part of the visit, the two leaders witnessed the signing of several bilateral agreements on economic and technical cooperation, especially in the mining sector. State-owned Chinese mining company China Minmetals has had business dealings with Chile for over 30 years and is looking to expand investment in Chile's copper industry. The two sides also signed a memorandum of understanding to cooperate on China's ambitious Belt and Road infrastructure initiative that aims to expand China's economic ties across the globe.

Chile was the first South American country to sign a free trade agreement with China in 2005. Bilateral trade has since grown eightfold, with China becoming Chile's largest trading partner in 2007. Chilean officials see further cooperation with China as essential for the country's future economic growth and stability. "Chile-China ties have become a role model for South-South cooperation,‚Äù said President Pinera.  

However, some experts warn that Chile should be cautious about becoming too economically dependent on China and should look to diversify its trading partnerships. Chile also exports large amounts of copper to other Asian countries, including Japan and South Korea, as well as to the United States and several European countries. Strengthening trade ties with China is an economic opportunity, they say, but should be balanced and not come at the expense of other relationships. Overall though, this visit signals both countries' interest in further deepening cooperation well into the 21st century.
