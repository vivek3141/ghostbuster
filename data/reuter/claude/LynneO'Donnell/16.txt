China Delays Ban on U.S. Poultry Imports for Quarantine Talks 

China has delayed a ban on poultry imports from the United States that was scheduled to start on January 1, 2020 as the two sides negotiate new quarantine rules. The delay comes as the U.S. and China work to resolve various trade disputes and negotiate a phase one trade deal.

China announced in November 2019 that it would halt imports of U.S. poultry and poultry products starting January 1 due to concerns that they do not meet China's strict quality and hygiene standards. However, with trade talks progressing in December, China has agreed to temporarily postpone the ban as new rules are discussed. 

U.S. poultry exports to China were valued at $892 million in 2018 and China is the second largest market for U.S. poultry abroad. The potential ban had raised concerns among American farmers who have already been hit by Chinese tariffs on agricultural goods as part of the ongoing trade war.

According to China's customs administration, imports of U.S. poultry will be allowed to continue as normal during negotiations on a new protocol for shipments. “We will evaluate and determine a timeline for implementation of new inspection standards,” said a spokesperson for China's General Administration of Customs.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) welcomed the news, saying it demonstrated China's willingness to negotiate international standards. “This is a constructive development,” said a USDA spokesperson, “and we will work closely with Chinese authorities to ensure U.S. poultry maintains high food safety standards and has continued access to the Chinese market.”

Negotiations are expected to continue into early 2020, but sources on both sides expressed optimism that a new agreement could be reached before China's Lunar New Year holiday later in January. A new deal would provide relief for American farmers who have struggled with loss of sales to China over the past two years. For China, continued access to high-quality imported poultry is important for food security.

The delay in China's poultry ban is the latest sign of easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China as they work toward phase one of a broader trade agreement. Securing continued access to the Chinese market for American farmers and addressing longstanding structural issues remain priorities for the U.S. in ongoing talks. For China, finding alternative sources for agricultural and meat imports is challenging, increasing incentives to resolve disputes with the U.S. But many issues still remain unresolved, and the trade war is not over yet.
