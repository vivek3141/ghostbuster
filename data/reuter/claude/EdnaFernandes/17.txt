Eco-terrorism Strikes at British Construction Giants: Activists Target Profit Margins in New Form of Business Risk  

In a startling new escalation of activism targeting major corporations, a previously unknown group calling itself "Earth's Vengeance" has claimed responsibility for a series of coordinated direct actions against two of the largest construction and engineering firms in Britain. The activist group said its actions were designed to damage the companies' profit margins and "force a  reckoning for their destructive impact on the planet."

The actions began just after midnight early this morning as explosives were remotely detonated at three active work sites of ConstructionMegaCorp PLC, destroying several bulldozers, cranes, and other heavy equipment worth an estimated Â£2.5 million. Less than an hour later, the offices of another construction giant, BuildBig Ltd, were broken into and vandalized. The intruders spray painted radical environmental slogans on walls, destroyed computers and office furniture, and stole various documents before setting a fire that caused significant damage. Total costs for BuildBig are still being assessed but expected to be substantial. 

In messages sent to media outlets, Earth's Vengeance claimed responsibility for the attacks and said they were just the first in an ongoing campaign to dismantle the "toxic operations" of major corporations that are "pillaging the Earth for profit." The group claims that the targeted companies have an outsized carbon footprint due to emissions from their heavy equipment and the scale of their operations. The statement also condemned the companies for building infrastructure for oil extraction, industrialized agriculture, and roadways.

Security experts said this appears to be the first time eco-terrorists have explicitly targeted corporate balance sheets and shareholder value. "They want to introduce a whole new set of risks and costs to these kinds of companies," said Magnus Sheard, a specialist in environmental security threats at the Royal Institute for Strategic Studies. However, Sheard noted that actually inflicting long-term financial damage would require "a systematic campaign over time" given the scale of the targeted companies.
