Rover and Vauxhall unveil big investments to ramp up exports in the British motor industry  

British automakers Rover and Vauxhall announced major new investments today aimed at boosting vehicle exports and supporting growth in the UK's motor industry. Rover committed £500 million to expand its plant in Birmingham that produces the popular Range Rover Velar SUV. The investment will increase production capacity by 50% at the plant, enabling Rover to export up to 50,000 more vehicles per year once completed.

Vauxhall pledged £250 million to upgrade its factory in Luton that makes the Vivaro van. The investment will make the plant more efficient and flexible so that Vauxhall can better adjust output to meet demand from customers across Europe. Vauxhall expects exports of the Vivaro to rise by at least 35% within two years following the completion of the upgrade project.

The announcements from Rover and Vauxhall demonstrate the strength and potential of Britain's auto manufacturing sector despite the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit. The investments will support thousands of skilled jobs across the Midlands and are a vote of confidence in the UK as a competitive location for global vehicle makers.

Secretary of State for Business Greg Clark welcomed the news, saying, "Our automotive industry is a British success story and a vital part of our economy. Today's announcements by Rover and Vauxhall are a signal to the world that the UK remains absolutely open for business." The auto industry directly employs over 850,000 people in Britain and accounted for 14.4% of total UK goods exports in 2018. 

While Rover and Vauxhall are targeting increased sales in Europe and other overseas markets, both companies also called on the UK government to protect free and frictionless trade with the European Union after Brexit. "Continued tariff-free access to EU markets will be crucial for British auto companies to remain competitive and sustain our exports and investments in the coming years," said Rover chief executive Mark Greville.

The announcements demonstrate the pivotal role of exports in the health and future growth of UK vehicle manufacturing. By ramping up production for foreign customers, Rover, Vauxhall and the broader British motor industry can continue to drive economic activity, support thousands of jobs, and boost the post-Brexit economy. Overall, today's news is a very positive sign for the future of Britain's automakers and factories.
