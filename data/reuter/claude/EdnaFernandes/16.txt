Millennium Chemicals faces takeover interest as it prepares for October flotation, CEO warns of tight dividend policy  

Millennium Chemicals, the British specialty chemicals group, said it has received expressions of interest from rival companies as it gears up for its £350m stock market listing next month. 

However, Charles Miller, chief executive, warned the City that Millennium would pursue a tight dividend policy in the years immediately after the October flotation as it seeks to reduce debts accumulated during a management buyout three years ago. 

Mr Miller said Millennium had rebuffed the takeover approaches so far and remained committed to its plans to list 25% of its shares on the London Stock Exchange. But he admitted that the approaches highlighted the potential for consolidation in the fragmented chemicals industry.  

“There are only a few specialty chemical companies of our size and stature, so we can see the strategic interest,” said Mr Miller. “However, we believe we can create more value for shareholders by remaining independent at this stage of our development.”

Millennium, which produces additives used in products ranging from cosmetics to industrial coatings, hopes to achieve a market capitalisation of more than £1bn. The flotation is designed to allow BC Partners, the private equity group, to recoup most of its investment while still retaining a 75% stake.  

The company has forecast earnings of about £50m in the year to next March, giving it a prospective price to earnings ratio of 20 at the mid-point of its 220p to 260p share price range.  

While that multiple is in line with larger peers, analysts said the lack of free float and dividend restrictions might deter some investors, especially institutions seeking income. The dividend payout will be just 20% next year, rising to 30% in the longer term.

“The dividend yield will be fairly minimal at the outset, so the attraction will be more about growth prospects than income,” said one analyst. BC Partners invested £250m in 2007 to back a £518m buyout of Millennium. The private equity group took on substantial debts to finance the deal but has paid down a large portion of it over the past three years through cash generation and the £22m disposal of a non-core business.

Net debt stood at £195m at the end of March – more than twice annual EBITDA of £91m but still a sizeable reduction from the £375m borrowing at the time of the buyout. The flotation and further selldowns by BC Partners should help cut leverage towards a target of 1.5 times EBITDA.
