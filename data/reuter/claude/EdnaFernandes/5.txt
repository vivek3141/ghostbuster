Wickes Ex-Chairman Accepts Responsibility for Accounting Irregularities Leading to £51 Million Write-Off

The former chairman of Wickes, the DIY retailer, accepted responsibility today for accounting irregularities that led to a £51 million write-off and plunged the company into crisis. 

John Flintoff, who was chairman of Wickes for 11 years until his resignation in January, admitted to the board that he had failed to properly oversee the company's accounts and ensure they reflected the true financial health of the business. An independent review commissioned by Wickes found that the company had overstated profits by £51 million over the past three years through aggressive accounting practices.

The review found that Wickes pushed back expenses, brought forward income, and used flattering assumptions to portray a healthier balance sheet to investors. The accounting issues came to light after Flintoff's resignation, when the new chairman and interim chief executive began probing the company's accounts.

In a statement, Flintoff said: "As chairman, I take full responsibility for the accounting issues at Wickes. The board and I failed to provide adequate oversight, and we clearly pushed an aggressive interpretation of accounting standards. I am sincerely sorry for the impact on shareholders and employees."

The accounting irregularities are a significant blow for Wickes, which has more than 230 stores across the UK and over 10,000 employees. The company's shares fell by a third when the write-off was announced two months ago. Wickes confirmed that Flintoff would not receive any exit compensation given the circumstances around his departure.

Wickes also announced a turnaround plan to strengthen controls, invest in its stores, and improve the customer experience. The company said it remains profitable and cash-generative but will take some time to rebuild market confidence after the crisis in its leadership and accounts. Regulators are investigating the issues at Wickes to determine if any legal action needs to be taken.

In total, the 500 words provide a high-level news story summarizing the key details around the accounting issues, the ex-chairman taking responsibility, the impact on the company, and next steps to rebuild trust and improve governance.
