Wickes Plc Reveals £51 Million Write-Off and Plans Refinancing Rights Issue

Home improvement retailer Wickes Plc announced it is writing down the value of its struggling German subsidiary by £51 million and launching a rights issue to raise £150 million to pay down debt. 

The company said the non-cash impairment charge for Wickes Germany reflects difficult trading conditions, including falling retail sales across the DIY sector in Germany over the last 18 months. Wickes acquired the German business in 2015 for £68 million but it has failed to gain traction. The write-down leaves the division valued at just £17 million.

Wickes CEO Simon Wheeler acknowledged the German deal had "not worked out as planned" but said the company remains committed to its turnaround plan for the business, including revamping its product range, refreshing the brand, and improving its online offer. However, analysts voiced skepticism about the prospects for a meaningful recovery in the German division.

To bolster its balance sheet, Wickes announced plans for a fully underwritten 1-for-3 rights issue to raise about £150 million. The company will issue 463 million new shares at a price of 35 pence each, a 38% discount to the previous closing share price. Major shareholders have committed to take up their rights in the issue.

Wickes said the capital raised will be used to pay down debt and strengthen its balance sheet, providing a "robust footing" for the company and flexibility to continue investing in its turnaround. Net debt currently stands at £263 million, including lease liabilities, and the rights issue will help reduce leverage to below 1 times EBITDA.

The announcements came as Wickes reported a 4.2% rise in like-for-like sales for the first half of the year, driven by a strong performance in the UK home improvement division. However, pre-tax profit dropped 17% to £33 million due to weaker margins, higher costs, and losses at the German business. The group maintained its guidance for full year pre-tax profit to be moderately above last year.

Investors reacted positively to the news, with Wickes shares jumping 7% in early trading. Joe Rundle, head of retail equity research at Equinox Advisory, said: "The rights issue removes concerns about Wickes’ balance sheet and provides much-needed financial flexibility. With a lower debt burden and hopefully an end to losses in Germany, Wickes can focus on realizing the potential of its core UK operations."

The turnaround efforts in the UK include opening smaller format stores, revitalizing ranges, and improving digital services. These initiatives seem to be gaining traction, suggesting the core business is in ruder health than the headline numbers suggest. If the UK recovery continues and Germany at least stabilizes, prospects look brighter for Wickes heading into 2020. However, if either of those conditions prove elusive, another tricky year could lie ahead.
