Imperial Tobacco Group Plc poised for growth with dual policy of debt reduction and overseas expansion 

Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, the British multinational tobacco company, unveiled plans for continued growth built on a balanced strategy of reducing debt while expanding into new overseas markets. 

In its annual investor update, Imperial Tobacco announced it aims to cut net debt by £3 billion over the next three years while diversifying its revenue streams internationally to reduce reliance on its core UK market. The company expects revenue growth of 2 to 4 percent annually over the medium term, with profits growing at a slightly faster rate.

“Our goal is sustainable long-term growth that rewards shareholders and meets our debt obligations, while adapting to evolving market conditions,” said CEO Alison Cooper. She pointed to “exciting opportunities” in the U.S., Asia, Africa and Middle East where demand for tobacco products is still growing in some demographic groups.

Imperial Tobacco’s plan will see the company introduce next-generation tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and tobacco heating devices, tailored to preferences in local markets. It will also strengthen its ‘mass market’ and ‘premium’ brands, with a continued focus on cost control and operational efficiency. 

However, the strategy is not without risks. Proposed bans on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars in the U.S. and the continued tightening of regulations in the UK market could curb future growth if enacted. Revenue gains from e-cigarettes and similar products also remain uncertain as the category evolves. 

The company will aim to keep capital expenditure below £500 million annually while paring debt through strong cash flow and the potential sale of surplus assets. Imperial Tobacco had net debt of £14.1 billion in September 2018, according to its annual report.

In the latest fiscal year, Imperial Tobacco increased net revenue 3.7 percent to £30.5 billion, with operating profit up 6.6 percent to £3.74 billion. Growth came from cigarette sales in emerging markets, including Iran, Iraq, Russia and Ukraine in Eastern Europe, the company said. Sales of traditional cigarettes in Western Europe, including the UK, continued to decline in line with historical trends.

The progress update provides “encouraging guidance for the future,” said equity analyst Owen Bennet at Jefferies International in London. “If management can execute on both international expansion and debt reduction, Imperial Tobacco stock could have significant upside over our 18-month time horizon.”

Imperial Tobacco shares rose 4.2 percent to £20.185 in early London trading on the strategy outline. The company's stock has gained 13 percent over the past 12 months.
