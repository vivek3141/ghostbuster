Wolseley Plc Reports 1% Dip in Yearly Pretax Profits, Despite Sales Increase and Dividend Raise, Amidst Poor Outlook for Mainland Europe Shares

Wolseley Plc, the world's largest distributor of plumbing and building materials, reported on Tuesday a 1% fall in yearly pretax profits for its fiscal year ended July 31. Profits came in at $1.27 billion, down from $1.28 billion the previous year. Despite increased sales and a higher annual dividend, shares fell due to a bleak outlook for mainland European performance.  

Revenue for the full year rose 3.5% to $21.10 billion, driven by demand in the U.S. and Britain. Trading was less successful in mainland Europe, however, where economic and political uncertainty weighed on the housing sector. The company announced an interim dividend of 34.8 cents per share, up 6.5% from last year. Despite the profit dip and forecasts of mainland Europe struggles, Wolseley believes its financial position remains solid.

Wolseley's shares closed down 2.3% in London. The results and outlook prompted Investec analysts to cut their recommendation to "hold" from "buy." Although U.S. and U.K. housing markets remained supportive, Investec said profits were "slightly softer than expected" and reduced its target share price.

The pretax profit decline reflected restructuring costs and increased expenses from acquired businesses. Underlying operating profit, stripping out items like acquisitions and currency swings, rose 7% to $1.50 billion. Cash generation also increased, and net debt fell.  

Chief Executive John Martin said the company had made a good start to its new fiscal year, with positive momentum in the U.S. and Britain offsetting remaining pressures in mainland Europe. He said the company is well placed to gain from improving markets over the medium term.

Wolseley's business in the U.S., which accounts for 42% of revenue and where housing demand continues to strengthen, reported an 11% rise in trading profit to $564 million. Its U.K. operations also turned in a strong performance, with trading profit up 9% to $210 million, as Britain's housing market stayed resilient after a slowdown in 2014.

In mainland Europe, however, where Wolseley generates 27% of its revenue, trading profit declined 7% to about $350 million amid "tough market conditions." This region is struggling with a sluggish economy and weak consumer confidence. Wolseley said France was particularly challenging.

The results highlight Wolseley's dependence on the strength of the construction sector in its main markets of North America and Europe. While the company believes it is making progress toward improving group-wide performance, a prolonged housing slump in mainland Europe could continue to weigh on profits. Overall, despite headwinds, Wolseley remains in a stable position to weather near-term volatility and benefit over the longer run.
