AMEC Plc Explores Investment in France's Spie Batignolle's Electrical and Construction Businesses to Expand International Exposure 

AMEC Plc, a London-based engineering and construction consulting firm, announced today it is in discussions with French construction company Spie Batignolles to potentially acquire or invest in Spie's electrical contracting and construction businesses. The deal could position AMEC to expand its presence in France and other parts of continental Europe.

Spie Batignolles, founded in 1880, provides a range of engineering and construction services across France, including the installation and maintenance of electrical systems and the construction of residential and commercial buildings. The company is headquartered in Paris and has annual revenues of nearly €5 billion. 

Under the proposed deal, AMEC would invest in or buy three of Spie Batignolles' subsidiaries focused on electrical contracting, facilities management, and building construction. These units generate more than €1.5 billion in combined annual revenue and employ over 10,000 people across France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Scotland. AMEC would gain valuable new capabilities, skilled workforces, and customer relationships through the deal, which the companies value at between €500 million and €700 million.

"This potential investment represents a unique opportunity for AMEC to strengthen our continental European footprint and lead in the attractive and fragmented French infrastructure market," said AMEC CEO Jon Lewis. "The deal would diversify our capabilities, client exposure, and end market participation to drive further growth."

For Spie Batignolle, selling or spinning off parts of its business could provide capital to invest in higher growth areas like renewable energy while streamlining its operations. The company is aiming to generate over 20% of its revenue from renewable energy projects within five years.  

AMEC, which has a market capitalization of over £4 billion, has been expanding aggressively in international markets in recent years, including a string of acquisitions across Australia, Asia, South America, and North America. The company has a strong presence in the UK, but its business in continental Europe remains limited. An investment in Spie Batignolles' units could vault AMEC into a leadership position in the French market and provide a platform for broader expansion across Europe.

The potential deal is still under discussion, and there is no certainty an agreement will be reached. Both companies declined to comment further on the discussions. If a deal is agreed and approved by regulators, AMEC aims to complete the investment or acquisition within the next 6-12 months.
