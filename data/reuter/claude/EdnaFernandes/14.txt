Smiths Industries Acquires Leland Electrosystems Inc to Access Major Military Aircraft Contracts  

Smiths Industries, a leading diversified aerospace, medical and security technology group, announced today its acquisition of Leland Electrosystems Inc, a privately held supplier of hydraulic, fuel and pneumatic components and control systems for major military and commercial aircraft platforms. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The acquisition will expand Smiths Industries’ aerospace capabilities and provide access to key military aircraft programs. Leland Electrosystems is a supplier on major platforms such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber, and Boeing’s KC-46 aerial refueling tanker.  “This acquisition significantly strengthens our position as a leading provider of critical components and subsystems for major aerospace platforms,” said John Smith, CEO of Smiths Industries. “Leland’s technical capabilities and program positions on key military aircraft align perfectly with our growth strategy.”

Based in San Diego, California, Leland Electrosystems has over 700 employees across four manufacturing facilities. The company has a long history of supplying pneumatic, hydraulic and fuel components for both military and commercial aircraft dating back to the 1950s. Revenues in the fiscal year ending September 2018 were $415 million with operating profit margins of 18.2 percent.  

“Becoming part of Smiths Industries, with its financial and operational scale, will enable us to further accelerate our growth,” said Jane Wilson, President and CEO of Leland Electrosystems, who will continue to lead the division within Smiths Industries. “Our companies share a focus on technical excellence, quality and customer service which provides an excellent cultural fit.”

The deal is subject to regulatory approvals but expected to close in the second quarter of Smiths Industries’ fiscal year 2020. Leland Electrosystems will become part of the Smiths Industries Aerospace Systems division.
