Wickes Plc Plans Another Charge Against Results Following Accounting Discrepancies 

Wickes Plc, the home improvement retailer, announced today that it will take another charge against its financial results following the discovery of accounting discrepancies. The company said it expects to reduce its full-year earnings by £15 million to £20 million as it corrects issues with how it booked supplier rebates and discounts.

Wickes had previously warned investors in October that it would restate its results for 2019 and 2020 to correct how it accounted for commercial income. The company now says the required adjustments are larger than initially estimated after a rigorous review and will impact its full-year results for 2021.

The latest charge is another setback for Wickes which has struggled with supply chain and cost inflation issues over the past year. The company’s CEO, Mark Davis, said “We regret having to make another adjustment to our results. We have identified some legacy processes which fell short of the standards we expect. We have taken action to address the root causes and strengthen our controls and finance team.”

Wickes said the corrections were “not related to the trading performance of the business” but were due to “previous accounting practices and systems around supplier income recognition”. The issues primarily relate to the timing of when the company should have recognized discounts and rebates from suppliers, impacting both revenue and cost of sales.

Investors reacted negatively to the news, with Wickes shares falling over 12% in morning trading. The trading update casts a shadow over what has otherwise been a solid year of recovery for Wickes after lockdown restrictions eased. Analysts said the financial restatements damage management credibility and investor trust, even as the underlying business continues to make progress. Wickes pledged to enhance financial oversight and commercial controls to avoid similar issues going forward. Regulators are also reviewing the company’s market disclosures to assess if any further action is needed.
