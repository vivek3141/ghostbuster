Cowie Group approached by defence vehicle manufacturer for leasing joint venture with Ministry of Defence 

The Cowie Group, one of the UK’s largest commercial vehicle leasing companies, has been approached by the defence vehicle manufacturer Hill & Crowther Ltd to jointly bid for a major contract with the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Sources close to Cowie Group say Hill & Crowther wants to partner with Cowie to provide fleet management and leasing services for over 2,000 tactical support vehicles used by the British Army.  

The MoD is looking to outsource the management of its fleet of logistical and support vehicles to cut costs and increase efficiency. Hill & Crowther believes that teaming up with an experienced fleet management company like Cowie Group will strengthen their bid for the estimated £450 million, 10-year contract. The deal would see Hill & Crowther build and supply the armoured and unarmoured vehicles while Cowie Group would provide financing, maintenance, and life-cycle management services.

The news comes just weeks after Cowie Group announced a major restructuring to focus on high-growth areas such as fleet outsourcing for public sector organisations. The company has shed underperforming divisions and made hundreds of redundancies in the last year to reduce costs by over £50 million per annum. The changes have divided analysts, with some arguing Cowie Group can now compete more aggressively for large public sector contracts, while others believe the restructuring has been poorly managed and left the company with insufficient resources to handle more complex projects.

A spokesperson for Cowie Group said they do not comment on commercial discussions ongoing with potential customers and partners. However, the company is understood to be keen to expand its outsourcing services for UK government clients to make up for revenue lost in other parts of the business. The deal with Hill & Crowther and the MoD would provide a flagship reference customer for Cowie’s fleet management abilities and help cement its position as a key partner for public sector fleet outsourcing. 

Hill & Crowther and the MoD also refused to comment on any ongoing contracting processes. A final decision on the tactical support vehicle fleet management tender is expected within the next four to six months according to industry experts. Cowie Group’s shares rose 3% on the news, reflecting investor optimism over the potential deal.
