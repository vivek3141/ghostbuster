Imperial Tobacco Group to split from Hanson Plc amid threat of litigation against tobacco firms

Imperial Tobacco Group, one of the world's largest tobacco companies, announced today that it will split from its parent company Hanson Plc and become an independent company amid growing legal and financial pressures on the tobacco industry. Imperial Tobacco has been a subsidiary of Hanson Plc, a British conglomerate, since a 1990 merger. However, the tobacco giant has faced significant threats in recent years due to rising litigation against cigarette makers and declining smoking rates in many developed countries.

"As an independent company, Imperial Tobacco will be better positioned to focus on the challenges facing the tobacco industry," said Mark Williamson, Chief Executive of Imperial Tobacco. The split is expected to be complete within the next 12 months, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. Once spun off, Imperial Tobacco will be listed as an independent company on the London Stock Exchange. Hanson Plc will retain ownership of its building materials and logistics businesses. 

Imperial Tobacco is the fourth-largest cigarette maker in the world with popular brands including Winston, Glamour, and Pall Mall. However, the company faces declining demand and tightening restrictions on smoking in many countries. In the U.S., Imperial Tobacco is also facing mounting legal costs due to ongoing litigation against tobacco firms to recoup health care costs related to smoking. In recent years, Imperial Tobacco has expanded into new markets in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa to offset declines in the West.

The split from Hanson is seen by analysts as a move to shield the conglomerate from future legal and reputational risks posed by the tobacco industry. "Hanson likely sees the writing on the wall that tobacco will face an even rockier road ahead," said Jane Ellison, a London-based business analyst. Imperial Tobacco had previously contributed over 40% of Hanson's total operating profit. However, tobacco is seen as an industry with little growth potential and facing regulatory pressures, according to Ellison.

The planned split was well received by investors, with shares of Hanson Plc rising over 3% following the announcement. By separating Imperial Tobacco, Hanson can now focus on its building materials and logistics units, which are higher-growth sectors. For its part, Imperial Tobacco believes it will have more flexibility as an independent company to navigate challenges particular to the tobacco industry even as its legacy business faces an uncertain future.
