Private Finance Initiative faces crisis of confidence over delays in awarding contracts  

The Private Finance Initiative (PFI), a policy that uses private sector funding and expertise to deliver public infrastructure projects, is facing a crisis of confidence due to significant delays in awarding contracts for several major projects. The PFI model, introduced in 1992, has been used to finance and construct over 700 public infrastructure projects with a capital value of £60 billion.

However, the model has come under scrutiny in recent months as the government has failed to award contracts for three flagship PFI projects: two new hospitals and a major road improvement scheme. The bidding process for a new £1.2 billion hospital in the Midlands has already been delayed by over 18 months, forcing the existing hospital trust to scrap expansion plans in the interim. Local patient groups have voiced “serious concerns over mounting delays which are impacting patient care.”

Delays have also hit plans for a £450 million bypass road scheme and a £800 million hospital in the south of England. The chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge MP, has warned that “unacceptable hold-ups in allocating PFI contracts risk value for taxpayers’ money and essential public services.” She has called for a review of PFI to determine whether alternative funding models may provide better outcomes.

Industry experts have blamed an over-reliance on a small pool of large contractors, onerous tendering processes, and budget uncertainty stemming from last year’s Comprehensive Spending Review for delays in allocating contracts. “There is a bottleneck at the procurement stage, with too few experienced PFI bidders chasing too many complex contracts,” said Andrew Cartland, Infrastructure Finance specialist at consultancy RM Global Partners. 

However, the Treasury has defended the PFI model, stating that it “remains the best option for delivering major infrastructure renewal” and that delays have been caused by “a thorough evaluation process to get the best deal for taxpayers.” A spokesperson said the Treasury is working with departments to speed up procurement in the coming months. 

The delays call into question whether PFI can effectively deliver large-scale public projects, particularly given constrained departmental budgets. With more than £3 billion worth of contracts due to be awarded next year, the government must act quickly to restore confidence in a policy that has revolutionised the delivery of public infrastructure over the past 25 years. Addressing inefficiencies in the tendering process, providing greater budget certainty for departments and expanding the pool of experienced PFI bidders will be critical to achieving this aim.
