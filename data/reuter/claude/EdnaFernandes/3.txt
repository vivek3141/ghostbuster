Ford UK Expects Flat Sales in 1997 as Consumers Feel Cautious, Says Chairman and Managing Director Ian McAllister 

Ford UK expects its new vehicle sales to remain flat in 1997 due to economic uncertainty and weak consumer confidence, according to Ian McAllister, Chairman and Managing Director of Ford of Britain. Speaking at the annual Ford Dealer Conference, McAllister said he anticipates Ford UK's sales will be roughly in line with 1996's total of around 323,000 units.

"The UK economy continues to grow at a steady pace, but customers remain cautious given concerns over interest rates and the strength of the pound," McAllister said. "Consumer confidence has dipped in recent months, and the used car market also remains weak. So, we think the overall new car market in 1997 will be on par with last year."

Ford holds a market share of around 16% in the UK and has seen sales rise for three consecutive years. However, McAllister said those gains will level off this year unless the economy strengthens or consumer confidence improves. "We have a strong product lineup for 1997 including the all-new Ford Puma sports coupe and are ready to take advantage if the market improves," he said. "But like the overall industry, we expect a plateauing of demand from retail customers in the year ahead."

McAllister said fleet and commercial vehicle sales should continue to rise as companies replace older vehicles. Demand from business and corporate customers now represents about half of Ford's UK sales. Ford also expects to maintain its leading market share in the commercial vehicle segments.

The cautious outlook comes despite a 4.2% increase in UK new car registrations last year to a record 2.5 million units. Economic growth was 2.5% in 1996 and analysts forecast 2-3% GDP growth for the UK economy this year. However, consumer confidence declined over the last year, and the Bank of England has warned it may raise interest rates if wages start to rise too quickly.
