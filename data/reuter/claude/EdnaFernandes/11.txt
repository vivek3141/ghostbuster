Wolseley Plc to Report Slight Drop in Profits, But Rise in Dividend Payout Expected  

Wolseley Plc, the world's largest distributor of plumbing and heating products, is expected to report a small drop in profits for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 when it announces its full-year results on Tuesday. However, analysts predict the company will increase its dividend payout to shareholders for the 47th consecutive year.

Profits are forecast to decline around 3% from the prior year to approximately £580 million. Revenue is projected to remain flat at around £18.1 billion, according to consensus estimates. The slight dip in profits comes amid ongoing economic uncertainty, including slowing growth in the U.S. and U.K. markets which generate the bulk of Wolseley's business. 

However, Wolseley's share price has held up well, rising nearly 15% over the past year, as investors continue to value the strength and stability of its business model. The company operates more than 5,000 branches across North America, U.K., Nordic countries and central Europe. By focusing on trade customers like plumbers, electricians and builders, Wolseley has built up a loyal base of clients. Its massive scale and efficient operations have also enabled strong cash flow generation over time.

Given its stable financial position and consistent track record of dividend increases, analysts forecast Wolseley will lift its total dividend for the full year by around 5% to 97 pence per share. The board has raised the dividend every year since the company listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1972. The steady dividend, which currently yields around 3.2%, is an important part of Wolseley's appeal to long-term investors.

While Wolseley faces some external challenges, the company is well positioned to continue increasing revenues and returns over the medium to long run based on its leadership position in large and fragmented markets. Barring a severe economic downturn, Wolseley looks set to extend its streak of annual dividend hikes for many more years to come. Overall, despite a predicted small drop in profits for 2019, Wolseley remains in strong shape with a dependable business model and the potential for future growth.
