Nissan to Decide on Building New Vehicle for European Market in Spring 1997  

TOKYOâ€”Nissan Motor Co. said today it will decide in the spring whether to build a new compact vehicle aimed at the competitive European car market. 

"We are considering adding a new model in the compact segment for Europe," said Yoshikazu Hanawa, Nissan's executive vice president for product planning and marketing. "We will make a final decision around March or April next year."

Mr. Hanawa said Nissan wants to increase its presence in the compact segment, which accounts for about one-third of all vehicle sales in Western Europe. The new model would likely go on sale in 1999 if given the green light, he said. 

Nissan's current compact model for Europe is the Sunny, but sales have faltered in recent years amid intense competition and a weak image. A new model could help reinvigorate Nissan in this crucial market segment.

The Japanese auto maker is recovering from a slump that started around the time of the Gulf War in 1991 and continued through 1993. Although its U.S. operations remained profitable, Nissan lost money in Europe for six straight years. Under the direction of President Yoshikazu Hanawa, Nissan cut costs, reduced production capacity, and introduced new models.  

The company posted a net profit of $1.3 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1996. Global vehicle sales rose 5.4% to 2.47 million units in the same period. Mr. Hanawa's goal is to boost Nissan's market share in Western Europe to 3% by 2000 from 1.9% currently.

Industry analysts said a new compact vehicle targeted at European drivers could significantly aid Nissan's turnaround in that market. "Europe is a key battleground right now and compact cars are critical for success there," said Mamoru Kato, an auto analyst at Sanwa Bank in Tokyo. "If Nissan builds an attractive new compact model, it should help them gain traction against rivals like Volkswagen, Peugeot and Fiat."

Mr. Hanawa said the new vehicle is being developed specifically for European markets, although it may eventually be also sold in other countries. He declined to disclose further details. Nissan's product development teams in Europe will play a key role in designing the new compact should it get approved, Mr. Hanawa added.

Nissan's manufacturing capacity in Europe can accommodate building 100,000 more vehicles per year, Mr. Hanawa said. The company operates vehicle assembly plants in the U.K. and Spain. No decision has been made on where the new compact model may be produced.
