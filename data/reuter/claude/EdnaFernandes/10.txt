AMEC Plc Expected to Announce Investment in Spie Batignolle by November  

AMEC Plc, a leading engineering and project management company based in the UK, is expected to announce an investment in Spie Batignolle, a French infrastructure company, by November of this year. Sources close to the deal say AMEC Plc is looking to acquire a minority stake of up to 20% in Spie Batignolle to gain a foothold in the growing infrastructure and energy markets in France and Western Europe.

An investment in Spie Batignolle would be consistent with AMEC's strategy to diversify its operations and expand its presence in continental Europe. Earlier this year, AMEC completed the $2.8 billion acquisition of Foster Wheeler, a Swiss engineering firm. AMEC has experienced slowing revenue growth from its core oil and gas operations due to weak energy prices and is looking to infrastructure and renewable energy sectors for new opportunities. 

Spie Batignolle would benefit from an infusion of capital from AMEC to fund new projects and strengthen its balance sheet. The company has a project backlog of over $5 billion in road, rail, and energy infrastructure work but has struggled at times to finance larger projects. An alliance with AMEC could also help Spie Batignolle win additional contracts by touting AMEC's technical and project expertise.

The two sides have been in discussions for the past four months, working through valuation and management issues. According to analysts, AMEC is likely to pay between $400 to $500 million for a 20% stake in Spie Batignolle based on the company's current market capitalization. An announcement is expected within the next month, possibly in conjunction with AMEC's quarterly earnings report on November 12. While not confirmed, a seat on Spie Batignolle's board of directors may be granted to AMEC as part of the deal.

Overall, an investment in Spie Batignolle appears to satisfy AMEC's key strategic priorities and would give it a platform for further expansion in Western Europe's infrastructure sector. For Spie Batignolle, AMEC's backing could propel it to the next level in France and internationally. Both companies seem poised to benefit if a deal can be successfully concluded in the coming weeks.
