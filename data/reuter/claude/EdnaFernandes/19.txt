Hanson Companies Receive Takeover Approaches for Multiple Sectors During Demerger Process 

Hanson PLC, the FTSE 100 diversified industrial conglomerate, has received multiple takeover approaches for various business units as it progresses with plans to split into three separate companies, according to sources close to the situation.

Hanson announced last month that it would pursue a demerger of its mining, building materials, and transport and logistics divisions into independent, publicly traded companies with the goal of maximizing value for shareholders. The company has received strong interest from strategic acquirers and private equity firms for some of the standalone businesses, the sources said.

The building materials unit, which produces cement, aggregates, and concrete, is seen as an attractive target given its stable cash flows and leading market positions. HeidelbergCement and LafargeHolcim, two major European cement makers, are rumored to be interested in acquiring the business. The transport and logistics division could also lure bids from infrastructure funds and logistics companies looking to expand their portfolios.  

The mining unit is viewed as riskier by some due to commodity price volatility but could appeal to mining companies focused on diversification. BHP and Anglo American, two of the world's largest miners, may consider partnering with another firm to make a joint bid for the business, according to analysts.

While Hanson could realize higher valuations by selling the divisions separately, the company would prefer to complete the demerger as planned to provide shareholders stakes in three distinct companies, each with its own compelling growth prospects, the sources noted. However, Hanson may be open to selling a minority stake in one of the businesses to an investor ahead of a demerger.

The demerger is on track to be completed within 12 to 18 months, the company stated. The process is complex, requiring the separation of business units that have been together for decades. However, Hanson is motivated to streamline its portfolio to ensure each division has the flexibility and capital support to pursue new opportunities that drive shareholder value.
