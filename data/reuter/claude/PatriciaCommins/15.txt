McDonald's Reports 10% Rise in Net Income Despite Weak US Operating Environment 

McDonald's Corp reported a 10% increase in net income for the fourth quarter despite facing a weak operating environment in the United States, its largest market. Net income rose to $1.83 billion, or $2.48 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from $1.67 billion, or $2.21 per share, a year earlier.

Revenue fell 3% to $6.05 billion, hurt mainly by refranchising some of its restaurants. However, sales rose 4.9% globally and 4% in the United States on strong demand for promotions and new menu options like all-day breakfast. The results beat analysts' average estimate of net income of $1.80 billion and revenue of $6.06 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

McDonald's shares rose 3.2% to $134 in premarket trading as investors cheered resilient U.S. demand and stronger-than-expected global sales. The stock has gained 11% in the past 12 months, lagging the 17% rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

McDonald's said comparable sales increased 4.9% in 2018, on par with the prior year and the highest growth in six years. Global comparable sales rose 5.4%, with nearly all of McDonald's markets posting gains. In the United States, comparable sales growth held at 2.3% even as restaurants battled labor shortages and price pressures. 

Comparable sales are sales at restaurants open at least 13 months and are a key metric of performance.

"While we're not happy with our performance, we are making progress," said Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook on a call with analysts. McDonald's is trying to win back U.S. customers by remodeling stores, tweaking its menu and ramping up delivery options through its mobile app and Uber Eats.

McDonald's plans to spend about $2.4 billion opening around 1,000 new restaurants across the world in 2019. About 75% of those openings will be operated by independent business owners under the company's franchise model. McDonald's gets rent, royalties and fees from franchisees, which account for about 93% of the total restaurants.

In international markets, strong demand in Australia and South Korea drove sales while business was volatile in China, McDonald's said. Operating income for McDonald's international operations unit, which contributes about two-thirds to total revenue, increased 7% in the quarter. 

McDonald's said it expects foreign exchange to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on its 2019 results. The company forecast a higher effective tax rate for the full year in the mid-20 percent range, due to last year's U.S. tax overhaul. McDonald's lowered prices on some menu items and invested heavily in technology to speed up service and boost sales in its fight to win back customers. The burger chain also tied up with Uber Eats to start home delivery from over 5,000 of its outlets across the U.S.
