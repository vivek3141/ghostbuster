ADM under fire from shareholders seeking board reform after price-fixing guilty plea 

Archer Daniels Midland Co. is facing pressure from activist shareholders to overhaul its board of directors in the wake of the company's guilty plea for price-fixing. ADM pled guilty in 2013 to criminal charges of conspiring to fix prices of animal feed additive lysine and paid a $101 million fine to settle U.S. Department of Justice allegations.   

Now, activist investment funds Legion Partners Asset Management LLC and Ancora Advisors LLC are calling for ADM to replace four of its 12 directors to add new independent voices to the board. In a letter to shareholders last week, the funds argued “ADM’s board has repeatedly failed shareholders” by overseeing compliance and risk failures over many years, including the criminal price-fixing charges.

The funds, which combined own roughly 1% of ADM's shares, are seeking to replace directors with candidates that have governance, risk management, and corporate compliance expertise. “Shareholders deserve a board with fresh perspectives, relevant experience, and independence from a management team that has failed shareholders for too long,” the letter states.

ADM has dismissed the campaign as “an attempt to boost the own funds’ profiles” and defended its current directors. In a statement, ADM Chairman and CEO Juan Luciano said, "Our board of directors is composed of highly qualified leaders with a diverse range of experiences, and they are providing effective independent oversight and guidance to management.”

However, corporate governance experts argue that ADM would benefit from new, independent voices on its board following such a significant compliance failure and penalty. “In a case where a company has admitted to criminal wrongdoing and paid a substantial fine, shareholders reasonably expect a board response that signifies recognition of the seriousness and a commitment to addressing root causes,” said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.
