Shareholders to Criticize ADM's Board at Annual Meeting After Price-Fixing Guilty Plea 

Archer Daniels Midland Co. shareholders are gearing up to voice concerns about governance and oversight at the company's annual meeting this Thursday in Chicago, IL. Several major shareholders plan to speak out against the board of directors in the wake of ADM's guilty plea last week to charges of price-fixing and anti-competitive behavior.

Last Tuesday, ADM agreed to pay a $100 million fine after pleading guilty to criminal charges of conspiring to fix prices of food additives between 2002 to 2009. The Justice Department alleged that ADM executives met with competitors to fix the prices of citric acid and lysine, costing customers and consumers hundreds of millions of dollars. The criminal behavior has already resulted in several civil lawsuits seeking damages from the company.

Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, two leading shareholder advisory firms, have recommended that investors vote against two incumbent board members who served during the time of the illegal activity. Some shareholders argue the board should be held responsible for failing to prevent the price-fixing and anti-competitive practices from happening under their oversight. 

ADM's board has been criticized before over governance issues but has not seen widespread shareholder dissent at its annual meetings. However, in the aftermath of the price-fixing revelations, shareholders appear ready to demand changes to the board. John Doe of Citizens for Corporate Responsibility said, “ADM’s board clearly failed in its duty to curb unethical and harmful behavior in the pursuit of profits. We need directors who will hold executives accountable and help change the company’s problematic culture.”

ADM has stated that new compliance controls have been put in place and that unethical practices are a thing of the past. However, shareholders remain skeptical and believe a shake-up of the board is warranted given their failure to prevent years of collusion and fraud. The shareholder meeting later this week is expected to be a turbulent one for ADM's directors. Calls for board changes may well dominate the proceedings, putting ADM's directors on the defensive regarding their oversight responsibilities.
