U.S. Food Companies Face Tough Q3 as Competition and Ingredient Costs Weigh on Earnings

Major U.S. food companies reported lackluster third-quarter earnings this week as increased competition and rising ingredient costs put pressure on profits. Overall, the results point to a challenging environment for the packaged food industry as companies struggle to boost sales and cut costs.

Kellogg Co., the maker of Frosted Flakes and Eggo waffles, reported that quarterly sales declined 3% from a year earlier. Higher costs for ingredients like wheat, sugar, and cocoa squeezed the company's profit margins. Kellogg lowered its full-year guidance, citing "ongoing pressures on sales and profitability." The company's stock dropped over 5% following the announcement. 

Kraft Heinz Co. also reported disappointing results with a 3% drop in quarterly sales. The maker of Heinz ketchup and Kraft macaroni and cheese has been struggling since its merger four years ago to generate growth as consumers shift to more natural and organic options. Intense price competition from private-label brands has made it difficult for Kraft Heinz to raise prices, putting pressure on profits. The company's new CEO Miguel Patricio, who took over in July, acknowledged, “There is no silver bullet. This is going to be a long-term fix.”

Sales growth was more robust at General Mills, increasing 3% from a year ago, boosted by launches of new products and marketing partnerships with entertainment brands like Marvel and Lucasfilm. However, profit margins declined as the maker of Cheerios cereal and Yoplait yogurt had to increase ad spending to drive sales growth. CEO Jeff Harmening noted that he expects the challenging industry backdrop to continue but remains confident General Mills can meet its full-year targets.

Mondelez International, which makes Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers, reported 1% sales growth in the quarter, below analysts’ expectations. Chairman and CEO Dirk Van de Put stated that sales were “soft in Western Europe and Latin America” but strong in North America and emerging markets. Cost increases and weakening demand in Europe have created what Van de Put called a “volatile environment.” The company maintained its full-year outlook but tightened the range of its sales and profitability guidance.   

In summary, major U.S. food companies faced significant headwinds in the third quarter from intensifying competition, higher costs, and weakening demand in some markets. While some firms have new product launches and cost cuts in place to boost growth, the challenging industry environment is likely to persist. Food companies will have to adapt to evolving consumer tastes and shopping habits to thrive in the long run.
