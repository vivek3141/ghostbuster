Federal Judge Orders Archer Daniels Midland Co. to Pay $100 Million in Price-Fixing Case, Investigation Continues  

A federal judge ordered agricultural giant Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM) to pay $100 million in damages for manipulating price of lycopene, a common food additive. The ruling comes as part of an ongoing antitrust case against several producers for allegedly colluding to fix prices of lycopene, a compound found in tomatoes that is used as a coloring agent in foods, beverages, and cosmetics.

In a decision issued yesterday, U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin sided with plaintiff Kraft Heinz Co., which filed a lawsuit against ADM, Cargill Inc., and several other companies in 2016 alleging a criminal conspiracy to fix lycopene prices. Judge Durkin found "clear and convincing evidence" that ADM executives participated in anti-competitive behavior that violated federal antitrust laws. The $100 million in damages is intended to compensate Kraft Heinz for overpaying for lycopene due to the price manipulation.

The ruling deals a blow to ADM, one of the world's largest grain processors and a major supplier of agricultural commodities and food additives. However, it still faces separate criminal charges from the Department of Justice related to the lycopene price fixing scheme. DOJ's investigation is ongoing and more indictments against individuals and companies are expected, according to a DOJ spokesperson.

ADM said in a statement that it is "disappointed" in the judge's ruling and plans to appeal the decision. The company maintains that "the allegations of improper communication with competitors are untrue." However, text messages and emails revealed in court filings show that ADM executives coordinated with competitors to drive up prices for lycopene between 2008 to 2013, during which time the price of lycopene paste rose more than 50 percent.

The case highlights the incentives for agricultural companies to illegally coordinate prices in highly concentrated markets. The lycopene market has only a few suppliers, including major companies like ADM, Cargill, and Chinese company BGG, making it prone to anti-competitive behavior, analysts say. The DOJ criminal probe aims to uncover the full extent of collusion in the food additives industry and could bring further legal trouble for ADM and others.

In summary, the $100 million in damages against ADM is the first ruling in a sprawling antitrust case focused on price fixing for lycopene and possibly other agricultural commodities. The judge's decision and ongoing DOJ investigation suggest that more penalties and charges may be forthcoming against major food companies found to have violated competition laws. The case is a warning for companies and executives in concentrated agricultural markets where collaboration can easily cross the line into illegal price manipulation.
