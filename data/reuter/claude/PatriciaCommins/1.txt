McDonald's aims to fix U.S. market issues with new chairman of domestic business position   

McDonald's Corp announced this week the appointment of Joe Erlinger as the new president of McDonald's USA, a newly created position aimed at turning around sluggish sales and operations in the company's largest market. Erlinger, a 21-year veteran of the fast-food giant, will take over responsibility for the company's domestic market effective immediately.

The creation of a U.S.-focused leadership role is the latest in a series of moves by McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski to reorganize leadership and streamline operations in the chain's domestic market. McDonald's has faced challenges in recent years, including shifts in consumer tastes toward fresher and healthier food options as well as competition from rival fast-food chains like Burger King and Wendy's expanding delivery and digital operations.

In his new role, Erlinger will aim to simplify McDonald's operations, improve service and communication between corporate leadership and individual restaurant owners and boost investment in employee training and restaurant technology. "There is a huge opportunity to bring focus and responsibility to the largest part of our business," said Kempczinski in a call with analysts. Erlinger previously served as president of McDonald's high-growth international operational segment, called International Operated Markets.

Same-store sales at McDonald's U.S. restaurants have lagged in recent quarters due to a combination of weakened customer traffic and a competitive promotional environment. Kempczinski said turning around the U.S. market was his "top priority" for 2020. New products, menu simplification and delivery partnerships with Uber Eats and DoorDash are some of the strategies aimed at growing U.S. sales. McDonald's is also testing new employee training programs, digital menu boards and licensing deals to bring fresh chicken sandwiches and spicy chicken McNuggets to its U.S. stores.

The new leadership changes mark the completion of a larger management restructuring initiated by Kempczinski upon taking over as CEO last November. The aim has been to make the global fast-food leader, with over 38,000 locations in more than 100 countries, a more nimble organization able to respond quickly to changes in the market and consumer demands. Investors have been supportive of McDonald's turnaround plans so far, with shares rising over 10 percent in the last six months, ahead of broader market gains.
