Monsanto Co Considers Shedding Chemical Businesses for High-Growth Life Sciences Area 

Monsanto Co, the world's largest seed company, is exploring strategic options for its chemical businesses that could include a sale or spin-off, according to people familiar with the matter. The company is aiming to focus on high-growth life sciences areas like biotech seeds and digital agriculture.

The chemical operations, which produce herbicides, pesticides, and other agricultural chemicals, represent over 25% of Monsanto's revenue but growth has been slowing in recent years. The potential sale or spin-off of these older product lines could allow Monsanto to become a pure-play agricultural biotech company. The move would follow competitors like DuPont that have shed slower-growing chemical units to focus on more profitable biotech and agricultural businesses.

Monsanto has hired advisers to evaluate options for the chemical operations, the sources said. A final decision on pursuing a split, sale or maintaining the status quo has not yet been made, the sources said. There is no guarantee Monsanto will move ahead with a disposal of the chemical units.

Monsanto's crop protection chemicals include herbicides like Roundup, which is used on corn and soybeans genetically engineered to resist the herbicide. However, Roundup has faced increasing restrictions and the patent on its main ingredient, glyphosate, expired in 2000. Monsanto's biotech and digital seed businesses, including data science platforms and DNA-based tools, offer more compelling growth opportunities, according to analysts.

Shares of Monsanto have risen 23 percent over the past year, giving it a market value of $50 billion, as investors have bought into its vision for next-generation agriculture technologies. 

Separating or selling the chemical operations could unlock that value and clarify Monsanto's growth narrative for investors, according to Hugh Grant, CEO of Monsanto. However, the crop protection unit also generates substantial free cash flow that funds investment in other areas, so evaluating the impact of any disposal will be a top priority, Grant said.
