Archer Daniels Midland Co. to Plead Guilty and Pay Record Fines for Price Fixing Charges

Agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland Co. has agreed to plead guilty and pay $100 million in fines for participating in price-fixing schemes in the lysine and citric acid markets, the Justice Department announced today. The fines represent the largest antitrust fines in US history.

According to prosecutors, ADM and several major competitors conspired to fix and raise prices for lysine, an amino acid used as an additive to animal feed, and citric acid, a flavor enhancer and preservative found in foods and beverages. The illegal price fixing spanned a period from 1991 to 1995 for lysine and 1994 to 1996 for citric acid. 

In addition to paying fines, ADM has agreed to cooperate with ongoing federal investigations into anticompetitive practices in these markets. Two non-US companies – Japan’s Ajinomoto Co. Inc. and South Korea’s Cheil Jedang Corp. – have also agreed to plead guilty for their roles in the price fixing conspiracies and pay fines of $15 million and $21 million, respectively.

Prosecutors allege that executives and employees of ADM, Ajinomoto, and Cheil Jedang communicated directly to discuss coordinating price increases and allocating market shares. These communications typically occurred at trade association meetings and industry conferences as well as private meetings between executives. According to Mark Peacock, an assistant attorney general in the antitrust division, “These price-fixing cartels affected billions of dollars in U.S. commerce. The collusive actions taken by these companies artificially inflated prices for lysine and citric acid.”

In a statement, ADM acknowledged that some of its former employees “engaged in improper conduct several years ago” and that the company has since strengthened its “compliance programs and control systems to prevent recurrence of such conduct.” ADM generates over $85 billion in annual revenue, so while the fines are a record, they represent only a fraction of 1% of the company’s top line. Some analysts argue that steeper penalties are needed to deter large companies from price fixing and other anticompetitive behavior.

The guilty pleas represent an embarrassing chapter for the major players in the agriculture and food processing industries but provide important lessons in business ethics for MBA students and corporate executives. As Assistant Attorney General Peacock concluded, “These cases should remind CEOs and all corporate officers that tolerating or condoning price-fixing schemes will result in serious consequences to them and their companies.” Overall, the fines and guilty pleas represent a victory for justice and fair competition in the global food supply chain.
