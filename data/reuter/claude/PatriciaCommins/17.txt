Quaker Oats Co. Doubles Profits Despite Drop in Sales and Struggles with Snapple 

The Quaker Oats Company announced today that its net income more than doubled in the third quarter despite a drop in overall sales and ongoing struggles with its Snapple beverage unit. Net income rose to $83.7 million, or 61 cents a share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from $33 million, or 24 cents a share, in the prior year.

Sales fell 1.7% to $2.11 billion from $2.15 billion last year. The decline was driven by lower volume from its U.S. cereal business, which was down 4%, and its international businesses. However, cost cutting and lower raw materials costs helped boost the bottom line.

"We were able to gain significant efficiencies and improve our margins even as we faced sales headwinds in some of our key businesses," said Quaker Oats CEO Michael Collins. "We have made solid progress taking costs out of our supply chain and headquarters operations through our restructuring initiatives."

Quaker Oats struggled in particular with its Snapple beverage unit, which was acquired in 1994. Snapple sales fell 11% in the quarter due to lower sales of its ready-to-drink iced tea and other juice drinks. Quaker took a $123 million charge in the quarter related to the reduced value of the Snapple brand. The company has struggled with Snapple for years as shifts in consumer tastes have hurt sales. Some analysts have called on Quaker to sell or spin off the Snapple business.

The company's stock price rose 3.4% on the earnings news as investors looked past the top-line sales challenges and focused on the improved margins and cost cutting. Quaker Oats said it expects to achieve $170 million in savings from restructuring initiatives this year, higher than its previous target of $100 million.

Quaker's North American cereal business remains its largest unit but has faced pressure from private-label cereals and changing consumer breakfast habits. The company has worked to reignite growth in cereal through innovation, launching new products like Quaker Oat Beverage and Chia Plus Ancient Grains hot cereal. It is also pushing its “Fuel for School” campaign to tout the benefits of oatmeal for children's health and education.

Collins said Quaker is well positioned for the future despite the external challenges it faced this quarter. By continuing to cut costs and improving operational efficiencies across its major business units, Quaker aims to boost margins and find paths to organic growth. The company maintained its full-year earnings forecast, signaling its confidence in continued progress. Investors, for now, appear willing to give the company more time to turn things around.
