Kellogg's Profits Drop Over 30% in Third Quarter as Cereal Volume Decreases in Competitive Market  

Kellogg Company reported a 32% drop in third-quarter profits as sales of cereal and other breakfast items declined in an increasingly competitive market.

The maker of Frosted Flakes, Special K and Eggo waffles said earnings fell to $329 million, or 96 cents per share, from $493 million, or $1.42 per share, a year earlier. Revenue dropped 3% to $3.52 billion.

Kellogg, like other large packaged-food companies, has been struggling as consumers switch to less processed foods and smaller brands. The company has been trying to boost sales by investing in product innovation, acquisitions and marketing, but a drop in cereal volume weighed on results in the latest quarter.  

In Kellogg's U.S. morning-foods division, which includes cereal, sales dropped 3.4%. Cereal volume declined in the mid-single digits as the company faced more competition from private-label brands and smaller cereal makers. In recent years, trendy new cereal brands catering to health-conscious consumers have also taken share from Kellogg.

Kellogg tried to boost sales in the quarter by launching new cereals like Donut Shop and Hi! Happy Inside, but the new products weren't enough to offset volume declines for established brands like Frosted Flakes and Raisin Bran. The weak cereal performance led the U.S. morning-foods unit's operating profit to fall by 12%.

Results were better in Kellogg's snack division, which makes Pringles chips, Cheez-It crackers and Nutri-Grain bars. Sales in the unit rose 2%, helped by recent acquisitions of protein-bar maker RxBar and cookie brand Comet Candy. Snacks operating profit climbed by 10%.

Outside North America, sales growth in Europe and Latin America offset declines in Asia Pacific. Kellogg has been restructuring its international operations to improve performance. The company is selling its cookies and fruit-snacks business in China and took full control of its India joint venture earlier this year.

Kellogg Chief Executive Steve Cahillane said results were mixed in the quarter but in line with the company's expectations. "We continue to operate in a very challenging environment," he said. Mr. Cahillane reaffirmed the company's full-year earnings guidance.

To turn around results, Mr. Cahillane has promised to invest in new products, cut costs and push into faster-growing categories like convenience foods, bars and meat alternatives. The efforts are aimed at helping Kellogg adapt to changes in consumer tastes that are reshaping the food industry. But the turnaround is still a work in progress, and more changes could be coming as Kellogg tries to revitalize brands in its declining categories.

Some analysts have suggested Kellogg consider more dramatic changes, such as selling its North America cereal business. Mr. Cahillane has said the company will review underperforming businesses and consider all options to create shareholder value.
