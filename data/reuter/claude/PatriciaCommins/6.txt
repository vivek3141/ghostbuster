Archer Daniels Midland Co settles $100 million antitrust case with minimal financial impact 

Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM), one of the world's largest grain traders and food processors, agreed to pay $100 million to settle an antitrust lawsuit with several purchasers of high fructose corn syrup. The settlement amount represents a fraction of the potential $1 billion in damages that could have been awarded if the case had gone to trial.

The lawsuit, filed in 2011, alleged that ADM conspired with rival corn syrup producers to fix prices between 2008 and 2016. The plaintiffs, which include major beverage and food companies that buy high fructose corn syrup, claimed that ADM and other producers agreed to manipulate prices through coordinated supply restrictions and price-fixing agreements. 

ADM denied all allegations of wrongdoing and asserted that it did not manipulate prices or harm customers. However, the company said it agreed to the $100 million settlement to avoid the uncertainty of a courtroom trial and distraction of protracted litigation. The settlement amount equates to about 5% of ADM's average annual net profit over the past decade. 

"We have consistently denied any wrongdoing, but after nearly a decade of litigation, we believe settling this matter is in the best interest of our company and all parties," said ADM Chairman and CEO Juan Luciano. The company's legal advisers recommended the settlement as the "most prudent course of action to minimize future legal costs and remove the risks associated with a jury trial."

Two other corn syrup producers, Tate & Lyle and Cargill, agreed to pay $100 million and $38 million respectively to settle similar lawsuits last year. The plaintiffs in the ADM case planned to use evidence from those prior cases to support their claims of an industry-wide price-fixing conspiracy. 

The settlement is subject to final approval by the U.S. District Court in Illinois overseeing the case. If approved, ADM will pay the $100 million into a settlement fund within the next 30 days. The company took a charge of $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 in anticipation of the settlement. Its stock price was largely unaffected by the news, dipping 0.2% in trading following the announcement.

In summary, while ADM faced allegations of significant antitrust violations, the ultimate financial impact on the company is likely to be minimal relative to its overall financial strength and earnings power. The settlement removes the ongoing costs and uncertainty around the litigation, allowing ADM's management team to refocus on running and growing its core business.
