McDonald's New Restaurant Openings Likely to Fall on Low End of Targeted Range  

McDonald's Corp said on Monday new restaurant openings globally are likely to be at the lower end of its targeted range of 500 to 700 for this year.

The world's biggest hamburger chain said the pace of new restaurant openings has been slower due to delays in permitting procedures in some regions as a result of measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

The pandemic has also led to temporary restaurant closures and restricted operations in many markets, hurting sales and traffic at existing locations. Comparable sales fell about 39% in the second quarter ended June 30.

Still, McDonald's said it continued to advance its business transformation strategy, including the modernization of its drive-thru, digital ordering and delivery services, which are helping drive sales amid mobility restrictions and social distancing norms.

The company also revamped operations and its menu to focus on drive-thru, takeaway and delivery. It removed some menu items like salads in the U.S. and all-day breakfast options in selected markets during the quarter to simplify operations, which it expects to resume once conditions improve.

For now, McDonald's is doubling down on promotions to spur sales, including a new meal deal in the United States and extending promotions in China and some European countries. The company also launched a new "Famous Orders" promotion in partnership with American rappers Travis Scott and rapper J Balvin.

It also expanded deliveries with Uber Eats to about 9,000 restaurants in the United States and reached 15,000 deliveries via McDelivery and drive-thru. Driven by these channels, the company's domestic comparable sales declined 2.3% in July, a sequential improvement from the second quarter.

McDonald's expects to continue improving monthly comparable sales in the third quarter as governments gradually relax restrictions and the company sustains momentum from its strategic initiatives. However, the return to a steady pace of new restaurant openings will depend on the timing of a broader reopening of economies and easing of regulations. Overall, McDonald's remains optimistic about the long term potential of its business.
