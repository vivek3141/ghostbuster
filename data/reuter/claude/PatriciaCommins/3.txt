Monsanto Considers Splitting into Two Separate Companies: Life Sciences and Chemical Business  

Monsanto Co., the world's largest seed and agrochemicals company, is exploring a possible split into two separate companies, according to people familiar with the matter. The move illustrates the underlying tensions in Monsanto's business model, as its chemical and genetically modified crop divisions navigate very different regulatory landscapes.

Monsanto's agricultural productivity segment focuses on seeds, biotech traits, and crop protection chemicals aimed at helping farmers grow more food. Its chemical division oversees non-agricultural chemicals used in various industrial applications. The potential split, still under discussion, would separate Monsanto into a specialized life sciences company focusing on seeds and biotech, and a chemical company that produces compounds like coolants and industrial lubricants.

The seeds and biotech segment, which generates about two-thirds of Monsanto's $15 billion in annual revenue, has become increasingly controversial as some consumers and environmental groups protest against genetically engineered crops. Strict regulation also limits growth. Separating this business could help unlock value for shareholders by highlighting the strength of Monsanto's agricultural science and biotechnology pipelines and freeing the life sciences arm from restrictions on GMOs and political controversy surrounding industrial agriculture. 

At the same time, splitting off the chemical division may allow it to grow unfettered by limits on genetically modified technology. The chemicals unit faces less regulatory scrutiny and could expand into life sciences applications beyond agriculture, some analysts note. The split may also make it easier for possible buyers, like chemical giants BASF or Dow DuPont, to acquire one or the other company.

However, dividing the corporation also poses risks, including reduced synergies from joint R&D and manufacturing, higher costs, and possible investor confusion from separating a company long focused on integrated "farm-to-table" solutions. There may also be political and public relations challenges in both businesses going forward without the diversification currently provided by the full Monsanto portfolio.

Monsanto's shares rose over 3 percent on the news before paring some gains. The company declined to comment on rumors regarding any potential strategic split. According to sources, the company's board has discussed the possibility of a split informally but has not made any final decision. Monsanto is expected to explore options for maximizing shareholder value, especially given recent market pressure. The coming months will indicate whether an historic breakup of Monsanto into two focused life sciences and chemical companies is in the cards.
