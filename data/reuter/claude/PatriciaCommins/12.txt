Archer Daniels Midland Co.'s Chairman apologises to shareholders for pricing-fixing scandal   

The Chairman of Archer Daniels Midland Co., G. Allen Andreas, delivered an apology to shareholders at the company's annual meeting today for the company's role in an international price-fixing scandal. Andreas acknowledged that three former executives pleaded guilty last year to conspiring with competitors to fix prices in the food additive markets.

"On behalf of the ADM Board of Directors and senior management, I want to apologize to all of our shareholders for this unacceptable conduct," Andreas said. The scandal dates back to 1996 when ADM executives met with competitors to fix prices for lysine, an amino acid used as a feed additive, and citric acid, a flavor enhancer and preservative. The illegal activity was exposed after Mark Whitacre, an ADM executive, acted as an FBI informant to expose the cartel.

Andreas admitted the company's role in the "global price-fixing cartel" has seriously damaged the company's reputation and share price. "This conduct was completely contrary to ADM's values and the way we expect to do business," he said. "We have learned from this experience and have taken significant steps to prevent anything like this from happening again."

ADM pleaded guilty in 1996 and paid a $100 million fine, the largest criminal antitrust fine in U.S. history at the time. Three former executives served prison time for their roles. ADM's share price plummeted over 40% in the aftermath of the scandal, though it has since recovered.  

Andreas outlined several compliance initiatives ADM has implemented, including a revised corporate code of conduct, an enhanced ethics and compliance training program for all employees, and a strengthened corporate compliance team. "The steps we have taken will help ensure that ADM's corporate culture demands and supports ethical behavior and compliance with the law at all levels of the company," Andreas said.

Some shareholders remain skeptical given the extent of wrongdoing that was exposed. "Promises of improved compliance provide little comfort when a company's culture was shown to be so rotten to the core," said Jenny Johnson, a shareholder from Ohio. Other shareholders, however, appear willing to give ADM another chance. "Every company faces challenges, and what matters most is how they respond," said Michael Davis, a shareholder from Illinois. "ADM seems to have learned from its mistakes, taken responsibility, and made real changes to become a better company."

The U.S. Department of Justice praised ADM for its cooperation in the investigation. But in a statement, the DOJ warned, "Should ADM violate antitrust laws again, the Department of Justice will not hesitate to file criminal charges against the company." ADM's share price climbed 2% following Andreas' apology, a sign that investors are also willing to forgive, if not forget. Going forward, ADM will have to prove through its actions that it has learned from this hard lesson in its history.
