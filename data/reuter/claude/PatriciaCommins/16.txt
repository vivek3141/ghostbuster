Monsanto Warns Analysts Not to Increase Full-Year Earnings Estimates 

Monsanto Co., the world's largest seed maker, warned Wall Street analysts not to raise their earnings estimates for the company's full fiscal year. Monsanto executives said on an earnings call that economic uncertainty and fluctuating commodity prices could dent the company's profits over the next two quarters. 

Monsanto reported better-than-expected results for the first three months of its fiscal year. Earnings came in at $3.49 billion, up 12% from the same period last year. Revenue rose 11% to $11.4 billion, boosted by strong sales of the company's biotech corn and soybean seeds and its flagship weed killer Roundup.

However, Monsanto's senior leadership urged caution for the rest of the year. "There are signs of economic distress for farmers with the collapse in grain prices over the last few months," said Chief Financial Officer Pierre Courduroux. "Our full-year guidance remains unchanged, but we want to signal to analysts that increasing their estimates at this point would be premature."

Soybean and corn prices have fallen around 15% from their peak last summer due to a bumper crop and slowing demand in China. That has squeezed profit margins for many farmers, Monsanto's main customers. At the same time, the U.S. Federal Reserve has signaled it may raise interest rates this year. That could curb demand from farmers looking to finance their operations.

"We've built our company to withstand volatility," said Monsanto CEO Hugh Grant. "But we have to remain prudent and take these macroeconomic factors into account." Grant said the company will reassess its full-year guidance over the next quarter and hopes to have "a clearer sense of the global economic picture" by then.

The warning from Monsanto's executives took many analysts by surprise. Shares dropped over 3% the day after the earnings call as several analysts downgraded the stock and lowered their price targets. Monsanto's stock is now down 10% year-to-date, underperforming the broader market. While analysts expect the long-term growth story for Monsanto remains intact, the company's leadership is asking investors not to rush ahead just yet.
