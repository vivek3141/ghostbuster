Shareholders Demand Changes in Governance at Archer Daniels Midland Co. Following Record-Breaking Antitrust Fine  

Shareholders of Archer Daniels Midland Co., one of the world's largest grain processors and food ingredients companies, are calling for significant changes to the company's governance and oversight after ADM agreed last week to pay $54.2 million to settle U.S. government charges of antitrust violations. The fine is the largest ever in a U.S.-only antitrust case.

ADM pled guilty to criminal charges that it conspired with competitors to fix prices for citric acid, a common food additive, between 1991 and 1995. Investigators found that ADM and other citric acid producers colluded to inflate prices through coordinated price increases and cutbacks in supply. The illegal activity cost citric acid buyers and consumers millions of dollars, according to the U.S. Justice Department.

In the wake of the fine, several major public pension funds that are ADM shareholders have called on the company to strengthen its board oversight and compliance programs to prevent future misconduct. “A fine of this magnitude indicates a failure of governance and oversight at the highest levels of ADM,” said William Atwood, executive director of the Illinois State Board of Investment, which holds over $100 million in ADM shares. “We are demanding changes to ADM’s board and compliance practices to ensure this never happens again.”   

ADM Chair and CEO Juan Luciano said in a statement that ADM has “learned from its mistakes” and has stringent programs in place to detect and prevent antitrust violations today. “We are committed to maintaining an honest and ethical culture throughout our company,” Luciano said. However, critics argue that ADM has been slow to reform following previous charges of price-fixing and anti-competitive behavior in the 1990s. The allegations raise questions about the strength of ADM’s corporate culture and ethics even under new leadership.

Shareholder proposals submitted for ADM’s next annual meeting call for, among other actions, the appointment of a board member with expertise in ethics and compliance, stronger oversight of the company’s lobbying and political activities, and clawback provisions that would allow ADM to recover bonuses and incentive pay from executives found responsible for wrongdoing. The proposals were submitted on behalf of pension funds in five states with holdings in ADM. Supporters argue the changes would encourage the company and its executives to focus on long-term responsible growth rather than short-term gains at the expense of ethics or legal compliance.

ADM has not yet responded to the shareholder proposals. However, following last week’s fine, Luciano said the company is “committed to positive change.” He pointed to ADM’s compliance office, employee training initiatives, and a corporate code of ethics as evidence of ADM’s reformed culture. “We know that actions speak louder than words, and we intend to let our actions prove how serious we are about doing business ethically and sustainably,” Luciano said. For many shareholders, however, last week’s record antitrust penalty shows that more fundamental changes in governance and oversight are still needed at ADM to match the CEO’s words. The coming annual meeting will reveal whether a majority of shareholders agree revolutionary intervention or trust in the current reform approach is the right path going forward.
