Details of the Front-Running Scandal:
Reports reveal that several Jardine Fleming employees were engaged in front-running activities over an extended period. These individuals allegedly used their knowledge of imminent large trades by clients to execute their own personal transactions ahead of them, profiting from the subsequent market price movements.
