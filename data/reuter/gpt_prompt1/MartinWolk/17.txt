Background on E. Coli Outbreak (200 words):
The E. coli outbreak that has shaken Seattle began with a cluster of severe gastrointestinal illnesses reported in the city's downtown region. Local hospitals witnessed a sudden influx of patients reporting symptoms such as severe stomach cramps, diarrhea, and occasionally bloody stools.

Initial tests on patients and environmental samples led them to focus on Odwalla products as a potential culprit for transmitting the infection.
E. coli bacteria are commonly found in the intestines of humans and animals, but certain strains can cause serious illness when ingested. Ingestion of contaminated food or water is the most common way for E. coli to spread, and improper handling or processing of food can lead to contamination. Given Odwalla's prominence within the beverage industry, consumers were taken aback by the news that their products might have caused the outbreak.

As a precautionary measure, they issued a voluntary recall of several of their juice products, including the popular orange juice variant.
The recall covers specific production lots manufactured during a specific time frame, identified as the potential source of the contamination.
