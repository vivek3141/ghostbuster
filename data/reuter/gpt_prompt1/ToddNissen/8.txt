Effects on Production and Supply Chain (100 words):
The Canadian autoworkers' strike, which entered its fourth week, has resulted in a major disruption to General Motors' production capacity. Several GM assembly plants across Canada have come to a standstill, leading to a reduced output of vehicles. As a result, the company has been compelled to implement temporary layoffs and cut working hours for its non-striking employees. Moreover, the strike has severely impacted the company's supply chain, causing delays in the delivery of essential components and parts, leading to further production bottlenecks.
Financial Consequences for General Motors (120 words):
The impact of the strike on General Motors' financial situation cannot be understated. With a significant decline in vehicle production and sales, the company is expected to experience a substantial revenue loss. Furthermore, the temporary layoffs and reduced working hours will likely strain the finances of the affected employees, potentially hampering their purchasing power. Analysts predict that this strike-induced slump in sales could result in a dent on General Motors' profitability for the current quarter, leading to a negative impact on the stock price and investor confidence.
Long-Term Implications and Collective Bargaining Importance (100 words):

Additionally, labor relations and trust between the company and its employees may suffer long-term consequences if a fair framework for resolution cannot be found.
