This strategic move highlights Ford's dedication to enhancing its product offerings, prioritizing quality, and driving operational efficiencies.

Dividends of leadership development:
These executive promotions are a testament to Ford's robust leadership development program, designed to identify and foster talent from within. The company's commitment to nurturing its top performers not only ensures continuity but empowers capable individuals who have proven their abilities and dedication.
