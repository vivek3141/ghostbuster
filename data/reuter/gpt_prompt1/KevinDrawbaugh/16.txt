Smoothly integrating Ventritex's business operations, products, and employees into St. Jude's existing structure will also be critical to the success of the deal.
The acquisition of Ventritex Inc represents a significant milestone for St. Jude Medical Inc, solidifying its position as a top player in the cardiac rhythm management market.
