Despite the liquidation, SIFCA's spokesman emphasized that the company's core activities, including palm oil, rubber, and sugar production, will remain unaffected.

The liquidation of the subsidiary will allow the company to focus on its core activities, promoting sustainability and enhancing its position in the market.
It is worth noting that Ivory Coast's ports are vital gateways for the country's exports, including agricultural commodities. The SIFCA spokesman assured that the liquidation process will not disrupt port arrivals or export activities. This reassurance is crucial to maintain smooth trade operations and safeguard the reputation of Ivory Coast's export sector.
In conclusion, SIFCA's decision to liquidate its loss-making subsidiary is a strategic move aimed at improving the overall financial performance of the company. While the specific details of the subsidiary's liquidation remain undisclosed, SIFCA's core activities and engagement with local communities will remain intact. Furthermore, the company has stated that the liquidation will not impact port arrivals, which is crucial for Ivory Coast's export-oriented economy.
