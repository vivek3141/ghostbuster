German tennis legend Boris Becker has been forced to withdraw from the upcoming Czech Indoor Open due to a recurring wrist injury. The former world number one had hoped to stage a successful comeback on the professional circuit, but unfortunately, his persistent ailment has once again dashed his aspirations.
Becker's wrist injury has been an ongoing concern throughout his career, and despite various treatment methods and surgeries, it has continued to plague him. This latest setback marks another frustrating chapter for the 52-year-old, who had hoped to make a triumphant return to competitive tennis.
