The specifics of the injury have not been disclosed, but it is reported to be severe enough to warrant his withdrawal from the tournament.
The news comes as a crushing blow to both Becker and his fans, who were eagerly awaiting his comeback on the tennis court. After retiring from professional tennis in 1999, Becker has remained involved in the sport, primarily as a coach and commentator.
