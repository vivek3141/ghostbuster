Canadian Shoppers Turning to the Internet for Holiday Gifts, survey finds
As the holiday season approaches, a recent survey has revealed a significant shift in Canadian shopping habits. The study, conducted by a leading market research firm, indicates that an increasing number of Canadians are relying on the internet for their holiday gift purchases. This trend reflects not only the convenience and accessibility of online shopping but also the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
According to the survey, nearly 70% of Canadian shoppers plan to do a significant portion of their holiday shopping online this year. This figure is a substantial increase compared to previous years when traditional brick-and-mortar stores dominated holiday shopping avenues. The survey also found that price comparisons, wider product selections, and the ease of having items delivered directly to their doorstep are the driving factors behind Canadians turning to e-commerce.
The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly played a significant role in this shift towards online shopping. With health concerns and social distancing measures still in place, physical shopping experiences have been restricted. As a result, many consumers have turned to digital platforms to fulfill their gift-giving needs. This trend is further reinforced by the fact that some provinces have enacted stricter lockdown measures recently, leading to the temporary closure of non-essential businesses.
While this pivot towards e-commerce is beneficial for online retailers, it presents challenges for brick-and-mortar establishments. Small local businesses, in particular, are grappling with the impact of reduced foot traffic and the inability to fully embrace online platforms due to limited resources or technological know-how. This shift highlights the urgent need for these businesses to adapt and develop an online presence to remain competitive in the evolving retail landscape.
Furthermore, the surge in online shopping raises concerns about cybersecurity and fraud. While many established online retailers have robust security measures in place, consumers must remain vigilant and take necessary precautions when sharing personal and financial information online. Cybercriminals often exploit the increased online activity during the holiday season, making it crucial for shoppers to verify the authenticity and security of online stores before making a transaction.
In conclusion, the survey's findings indicate that Canadian consumers are increasingly turning to the internet for their holiday shopping needs. The convenience, wider product selection, and contactless shopping experience offered by e-commerce platforms have become increasingly appealing. Nonetheless, the challenges faced by local retailers and the need to prioritize cybersecurity remain essential considerations in this evolving retail landscape.
