To cater to this demand, Evergreen International Airlines is planning to add more flights from Hong Kong to key destinations across Asia, Europe, and North America. The airline's extensive network, along with their advanced fleet and logistics infrastructure, will help expedite the delivery of goods and play a crucial role in supporting global trade.
The additional flights will not only benefit businesses in Hong Kong but also contribute to the overall economic growth of the region. With the enhanced flight schedule, companies in the region will have greater access to global markets, enabling them to expand their operations and boost trade volumes.
