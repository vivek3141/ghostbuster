Chinese President Jiang Zemin issued a strong call to the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to remain loyal to the Communist Party of China (CPC) on the momentous occasion of the 60th anniversary of the communist military ordeal. Speaking at a grand ceremony held in Beijing, President Jiang's remarks emphasized the significance of strict adherence to the party line and underscored the PLA's pivotal role in safeguarding China's socialist ideology and national security.
In his speech, President Jiang highlighted the historical significance of the communist military ordeal that took place six decades ago. The ordeal, which saw the CPC-led PLA triumph over the Kuomintang forces, marked a critical turning point in modern Chinese history. President Jiang attributed the party's success during that period to the unwavering loyalty, resilience, and unity of the soldiersâ€”an example that must continue to guide the PLA in the present and future.
Emphasizing the importance of ideology, President Jiang stressed that soldiers must firmly uphold the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The president underscored that ideological purity is a critical aspect of maintaining the party line, as it shapes the PLA's collective consciousness, commitment, and unwavering belief in the party's leadership. President Jiang's reiteration of these principles is seen as an effort to ensure the party's continued dominance over the military establishment.
Furthermore, President Jiang emphasized the need for the PLA to adapt and modernize while remaining rooted in socialist values. He acknowledged the vital role of technology, innovation, and military strength in safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. President Jiang called on soldiers to enhance their combat capabilities, actively engage in military reforms, and remain vigilant about emerging global security challenges. This call for adaptation reflects Beijing's desire to align the PLA with a more technologically advanced military landscape and its expanding global interests.
President Jiang's remarks also conveyed the importance of unity, discipline, and obedience within the PLA. He stressed the significance of "one center, two maintenances," referring to the CPC Central Committee as the core and maintaining unity under the centralized leadership of the party. The president underlined that loyalty to the party and adherence to the party line were indispensable for maintaining the PLA's strength and discipline. The message implicitly addressed any potential challenges to the party's authority within the military establishment, reinforcing the CPC's control and minimizing any deviation from the party's agenda.
Finally, President Jiang commended the soldiers for their outstanding contributions to peacekeeping missions, disaster relief efforts, and maintaining stability within China. Highlighting the PLA's engagement beyond national borders, he emphasized China's commitment to promoting world peace and development as a responsible global power. This sentiment reflects Beijing's aspiration to be seen as a reliable and cooperative actor on the international stage, while projecting soft power and countering any criticism of its military rise.
In conclusion, President Jiang Zemin's call for soldiers to toe the party line on the 60th anniversary of the communist military ordeal underscores China's continued emphasis on ideological purity, national security, and unity within the PLA. His speech highlights the party's recognition of the PLA's critical role as a guardian of China's socialist values and as a military force capable of protecting the nation's interests. As China emerges as a major global power, ensuring the PLA's unwavering loyalty to the party is of utmost importance to President Jiang and the CPC's leadership.
