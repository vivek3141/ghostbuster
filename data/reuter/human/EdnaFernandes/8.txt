Christian Salvesen, the transport to business services group which rejected a 1.1 billion pound hostile takeover from Hays, said on Monday its special dividend and power unit demerger gave "much better" shareholder value.
Chris Masters, Salvesen chief executive, told Reuters in an interview "I think this (plan) is much better" and "more in the interests of our shareholders." He said he thought the 150 million pounds special dividend and demerger plan for the Aggreko hire business compared favorably with the rejected 390 pence per share bid from Hays, ditched in August.  
Masters said the plan to spin off the fast-growing hire group Aggreko was the culmination of a six-year restructuring strategy.
He added that a review to deliver shareholder value had already been underway before the hostile Hays bid was made in the summer.
The path chosen by the board made the best financial sense in tax terms as well, he added.
He said the Aggreko business was now ready to go it alone and had strong growth prospects. "It now operates in 20 countries and is a global market leader," he said.  
The logistics business, which will remain within the Salvesen group, also offered strong growth potential, said Masters.
"In Europe, logistics got half of its profits from food two years ago. Now that figure is less than 30 percent. Industrial logistics is growing at twenty percent per annum and the consumer business is growing at around 15 percent, with food manufacturing business also offering strong growth thanks to European deregulation."
Christian Salvesen will be making its case to institutional shareholders over the next two weeks, said Masters, in a bid to persuade them that this package offers a better deal than the 1.1 billion takeover bid from Hays.
The board has been under pressure to deliver after suffering share price underperformance earlier this year against the Financial Times All Share index.
