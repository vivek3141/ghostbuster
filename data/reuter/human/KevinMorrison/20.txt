Westpac Banking Group, the second largest bank in Australia, announced plans on Wednesday to expand its Asian activities through an alliance with British-based Standard Chartered Bank Plc.
The move signals Westpac is ready to expand in the region again after putting most of its Asian activities up for sale 3-1/2 years ago to focus on Australasia.
At the time a recession was biting deeply into profits and the share register held potential predators such as Australia's richest man Kerry Packer and Lend Lease Corp Ltd.  
Westpac chief executive Bob Joss said in a statement the deal with Standard Chartered was of major importance.
"It is a good strategic fit for our future growth," he said. Standard Chartered group chief executive Malcolm Williamson said his bank was committed to "ensuring this new relationship with Westpac is of significant long term benefit to both companies".
The venture would focus primarily on Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, before expanding into Vietnam and China in about six months, said David Morgan, group executive of Westpac Institutional and International Banking.
