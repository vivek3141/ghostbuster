British supermarket retailer J. Sainsbury Plc expects its new banking venture to turn in profits "in a relatively short period of time," marketing director Kevin McCarten told Reuters in an interview.
"We see this as a commercial venture...it is not a huge sink of money," he said.
Sainsbury announced on Friday that it had applied for authorisation from the Bank of England to set up Sainsbury's Bank in which it would have 55 percent with Bank of Scotland taking 45 percent.  
He said the banking service would offer "great products...at better value than is currently available," but declined to comment on possible interest rates on accounts.
Sainsbury will draw on its database of customers signed up to its Reward loyalty card and other store cards for direct marketing of the banking facilities, McCarten said, but added that it was not planning to limit access to these customers.
"Our objective is to build (the business) across the UK," he said.  
Sainsbury currently has about five stores in Scotland, while Bank of Scotland will benefit because it has a limited presence south of the border.
"It's a lovely distribution channel," a Bank of Scotland spokesman told Reuters, adding that the new bank would have its own identity and would not carry the Bank of Scotland logo.
McCarten said there would not initially be banking counters in stores but added it could not be ruled out for the future.  
No decision has yet been reached on use of cash dispensers, the Bank of Scotland spokesman said, although he ruled out stand-alone machines.
McCarten said the banking facilities would be "completely separate" from its Reward loyalty card other than using the database.
He added that the aim was to encourage customers to see banking as part of Sainsbury's supermarket offer, which should have a knock-on effect for the stores.
"If you can increase customer spend a little, you grow your business," McCarten said.
