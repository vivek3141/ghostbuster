Chicago Board of Trade Chairman Patrick Arbor said Thursday he expects electronic technology to replace open outcry trading in 20 to 25 years.
"I would think that in 20 to 25 years, there will be some kind of technology that will replace the traditional, open outcry market," Arbor said in answer to a student's question after a speech at the University of Chicago.
In the past, the CBOT has said it views electronic trading as a supplement to open outcry pit trading, which it has said provides maximum integrity and liquidity at minimum cost.
A CBOT press release distributed after Arbor's speech quoted him saying that "electronic trading ... supplements open outcry during daytime hours and the evening session."
In answer to the student's question, Arbor remarked that his 33-year-old son, a CBOT member allowed to trade in the pits, has "got about 20 years left" in his trading career.
Arbor added, "Technology is the wave of the future. There's no question about it."
Electronic trading remains a small part of the total volume of trading done on the CBOT, but is growing rapidly.
Total trading volume on the exchange in 1995 was more than 210 million contracts and Arbor predicted record-setting volume in 1996. Electronic trading increased to an average daily volume of 7,397 contracts in the first quarter of 1996 from just 560 contracts in 1992, when it commenced.
"The growth of electronic trading is here. It's going to continue," Arbor said.
