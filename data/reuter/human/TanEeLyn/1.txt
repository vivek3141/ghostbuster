China on Wednesday gave Hong Kong a free hand to arrange media coverage of the colony's historic handover to Beijing, ending fears that the country's communist rulers might restrict press access.
Chinese and British negotiators working on details of Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty announced the agreement after their latest round of talks.
"We very much look forward to as many as possible of the international press and the local press being interested in participating and recording and reporting on the handover ceremony," Hugh Davies, British team chief at the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), told reporters.
The JLG negotiates the fine details of the transfer of the territory of 6.4 million people to Chinese rule.
Many in Hong Kong, including human rights activists and pro-democracy politicians, had voiced fears that China would not consent to a media invasion without the right to vet which journalists attended.
In a joint statement both countries said arrangements for media coverage would be made by the Hong Kong government.
"The two sides have agreed to entrust the Hong Kong government to receive and process applications from journalists, as well as handle and arrange other matters relating to media coverage of the handover ceremony," the statement said.
Application forms for media accreditation will be distributed by the Hong Kong government's Handover Ceremony Coordination Office from March 15 and should be returned before April 7.
Hong Kong, a British colony for over 150 years, reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30, and the government expects 6,000 foreign and local media representatives to cover the event.
Asked if the Hong Kong government would set any special conditions for accreditation, Davies said he did not envisage applicants being turned down.
"There will be no criteria applied ... provided you don't turn out to be a terrorist," he told reporters.
