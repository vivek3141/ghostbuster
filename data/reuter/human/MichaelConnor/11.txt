With the dark cloud of high raw material costs now clearing, large U.S. newspapers companies are expected to report good third-quarter earnings despite weak growth in advertising.
"I keep hearing good news out of these guys, and they're all smiling about newsprint," said Prudential Securities newspaper industry analyst James Marsh.
Newsprint for newspapers now costs an average $550 a ton, much less than the average forecast of $600 a ton at the start of 1996, he said. Per ton prices peaked at $743 last January.  
"Trends in advertising have been a little sluggish, but with lower newsprint costs, most newspapers should have a strong quarter," said newspaper industry analyst Edward Atorino at Oppenheimer & Co.
Retail advertising were tepid through late summer, after rising only about one percent during the first half of the year, compared with the first six months of 1995, analysts said.
Classified advertising rose 10 percent in the first half but likely cooled in the third quarter, Atorino said.  
Times Mirror Co will enjoy an especially strong lift from newsprint savings because of its inventory accounting methods and a sharp decline in its consumption of newsprint this year after shutting two big city papers, Marsh said.
"The fall in newsprint prices coupled with ongoing cost reduction efforts will result in strong second-half earnings for newspaper publishing companies this year and provide further benefit into 1997," Atorino said in a written report.
