Former Barings executive Ron Baker rejects a lawsuit filed by Dutch bank ING Barings which makes a claim for repayment of a 100,000 pounds ($165,000) loan he is alleged to have received, his lawyer told Reuters on Thursday.
ING Barings earlier confirmed a press report it is suing Baker for 113,000 pounds, representing the loan given while Baker was employed by Barings, plus interest.
It is alleged to have been paid in two 50,000 pounds tranches, the last of which was made just two weeks before the collapse of the bank in February 1995.
"He (Baker) is satisfied that he doesn't owe them (ING Barings) any money," Baker's lawyer Lindsay Hill, a partner at Fox Williams, said. "This doesn't constitute a good claim against Mr Baker."
Hill said Baker, who was head of financial products at Barings, "roundly rejects" the ING claim and says that whatever money was paid to him, it was not sufficient to cover what he was owed.
Asked if Baker was considering making a claim against ING Barings for unpaid money, Hill said his client was currently concentrating on a tribunal hearing where he is challenging charges levelled against him by Britain's Securities and Futures Authority (SFA).
In May, Baker said he was satisfied he had acted properly throughout his time at Barings. He said he was not involved in the bank's agency business through which rogue trader Nick Leeson racked up $1.4 billion losses which bankrupted the blue-blooded investment bank.
