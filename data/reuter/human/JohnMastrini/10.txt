The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) on Friday cut its forecast for 1996 real gross domestic product (GDP) growth as lower export demand, especially from neighbouring Germany, fuels the trade deficit and eases Czech expansion.
The CSU cut its full-year 1996 GDP projection to 4.8 percent growth -- the same as the real result for 1995 -- from its 5.1 percent year-on-year prognosis made at the beginning of August.
Czech GDP grew a real 4.3 percent in the first half of this year, according to the latest results.
In its report on Friday, the CSU said it expected full year 1997 real GDP growth at between 5.1 to 5.6 percent.
The CSU revised its forecast for the full-year 1996 current account deficit to 6.9 percent of GDP from 5.7 percent as a ballooning merchandise trade deficit continues to bite.
It said the current account deficit would grow to between 6.8 to 7.4 percent of GDP in 1997.
The bureau said the merchandise trade deficit would grow to 163.3 billion crowns by end-1996 from the roughly 111 billion crown deficit posted for the first three quarters this year and compared with roughly 96 billion crowns for the whole of 1995.
But the bureau said export growth should accelerate in 1997 to between 10.0 to 11.4 percent from 6.2 percent this year, while import growth would be between 14 to 16.2 percent next year from 15.4 percent in 1996.
It forecast the 1997 merchandise trade deficit at 200 to 210 billion crowns.
"It is realistic to forecast, in view of the massive investment into the (Czech) economy in the past several years and expected growth of (EU) economies... that the development of the (current account deficit) at the turn of 1997-98 would switch toward (the deficit's) reduction," the CSU said.
The bureau blamed mainly a stagnation in the first three quarters in the German economy -- which accounts for just over a third of Czech export demand -- and in the whole EU for the revised trade figures and the lower GDP forecast.
"I think it's realistic to suggest that the (Czech trade situation) won't be much different next year," said Charles Robertson an independent East Europe analyst.
"But the big question will be whether there will be some improvement toward the end of next year. If this carries on into 1998 and 1999 there are going to be big worries."
He expected that, despite the poor trade results, the Czech crown should be able to stay within the central bank's band of plus/minus 7.5 percent from the mid-point of the mark/dollar basket to which it is fixed each day.
After the CSU announcement, the crown remained steady, trading in a tight range around the central bank's Friday fixing at 26.960 to the dollar and 17.739 to the mark, or 2.75 percent above parity with the basket.
The CSU slightly eased its forecast for full-year 1996 inflation to 8.9 percent from 9.0 percent in August, and said consumer prices would slow to between 7.5 percent to 8.0 percent for the whole of next year.
It said unemployment would remain at one of the lowest levels in Europe, but said it would edge up slightly to between 3.3 to 3.5 percent by the end of 1997 from 3.3 percent at the end of this year.
The slowdown of inflation -- to an average of 7.5 to 8.0 percent by the end of 1997 from 8.9 percent at the end of 1996 -- would be helped by a slowing in real wage growth to between 8.1 to 8.5 percent next year from 9.1 percent in 1996, the CSU said.
