Australia's largest retailer, Coles Myer Ltd, forecast a rejuvenation in its profit outlook at its annual meeting on Tuesday but failed to stop shareholders launching into a six-hour tirade aimed at Coles' directors.
The prime target was former executive chairman Solomon Lew, who was re-elected as a director with the help of proxy votes after the floor of the meeting overwhelmingly rejected his re-election. Coles Chairman Nobby Clark, who was jeered when he tried to cut short debate on Lew's re-election, said Coles was seeing something of a rejuvenation in its businesses.  
"We're on the edge of something pretty good," Clark told the annual meeting. "We do have an upside and I'm confident we can do better for you," he said.
"First quarter performance is running above expectations and we hope that can continue," he said, adding that provided Christmas trading was reasonable, Coles Myer's bottom line results should improve in 1996/97.
