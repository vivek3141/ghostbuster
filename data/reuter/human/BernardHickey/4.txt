An inquiry into Australia's financial system has left open the option of mergers among Australia's big banks and takeovers of local banks by foreign banks in an interim discussion paper released on Wednesday.
The inquiry, established by the government and headed by prominent businessman Stan Wallis, outlined various options for reform and was careful not to state its own preferences.
But it said the key aim of any reforms should be increasing the efficiency of Australia's banks to compete globally and that new technology would transform the sector. Big banks such as the National Australia Bank Ltd have used the same reasoning lobbying for relaxed merger rules.
The banks have said big bank mergers are necessary to compete globally and new technology such as the Internet and global competition meant such mergers would not cut competition.
Policy set by the former Labor government has stopped mergers or foreign takeovers of Australia's four largest banks and its two largest insurance and superannuation groups.
The current conservative coalition government has said this so-called "six pillars" policy will remain in place until it has considered the Wallis inquiry's recommendations, due to be delivered by the end of March 1997.
"The Inquiry sees as its key goal the identification of means to increase the efficiency of the Australian financial system, without compromising its safety and peformance," the paper said. Increased efficiency was needed to complete globally, to obtain the benefits of new technology and to increase investment returns, the paper said. It asked if competition and innovation could be stimulated by widening access to traditional banking activities through:
* "Allowing direct non-bank access to the payments settlement system"
* Better accomodating financial conglomerates
* Allowing an increased range of institutions to provide a wider array of financial services, or
* relaxing some of the ownership restrictions on financial institutuions ?"
The inquiry said it was also wanted any reforms to increase competition and asked in that context "whether there are any public policy grounds for restrictions on foreign acquisitions in the banking or insurance industries?"
In discussing the details of how bank mergers might be approved, the inquiry said there was widespread consensus that banks should be subject to the same competition rules as other industries. Currently any bank merger must be approved by the government through the Treasurer and by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). This dual approval process does not apply in other industries.  
"In undertaking its assessment, the Inquiry notes its preference...for all sectors of the economy to be subject to a uniform set of competitionpolicy laws unless there is something sepcial which justifies different treatment," the paper said.
The Inquiry said it would consider the following options for merger approvals, including;
* keeping the current system of dual approval
* having the Treasurer accept the ACCC's decision, or * narrowing powers over mergers in banking and insurance law It said there would be no need for a 'six pillars' policy if the Treasurers powers were removed or if he agreed not to excercise them. "There was almost unanimous support that the 'six pillars' policy should be abolished," the paper said.
