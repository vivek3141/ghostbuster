Gold miner Niugini Mining Ltd, which owns 17.15 percent of the shares in Papua New Guinea's Lihir Gold Ltd, said on Monday it was looking at ways of giving those Lihir shares back to its shareholders.
"We're looking at the possibility of returning the Lihir shareholding to shareholders and when that can be done," Nuigini Mining chief executive Ian Goudie told Reuters.
Goudie said a straight forward return of the shares to shareholders could not approved until late 1998 given the Lihir mine's current debt arrangements.  
But Nuigini was also looking at other structures through which the shares could be returned before then, he said.
He said the Lihir share return was just one of several possible ways of unlocking the true value of the Lihir stake, which was not reflected in Niugini's current share price.
"The whole purpose is to unlock this mismatch," he said.
Niugini's assets could viewed in two parts -- the Lihir stake and other smaller mining assets, he said.
"If the two parts were to be separated they would appear to have more value to shareholders."
