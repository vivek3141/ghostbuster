Austin Reed Group Plc supplier of pinstriped suits to generations of British businessmen, said on Wednesday that a return to favour with women executives helped to boost its first-half profits and sales.
The group, which has around 50 stores in the UK and sells its classic-cut styles in Europe, Japan and the U.S., saw first half profits jump 64 percent to 2.3 million pounds ($3.6 million) while sales climbed 7.0 percent to 38.9 million pounds.
New chief executive Chris Thomson said in an interview that a turnaround in womens' clothing, which now accounts for around 20 percent of sales, was a key factor behind the gains.
He said the 1995 spring collection for women had been a "bit of disaster," when Austin Reed's ranges "didn't sell and we had to substantially discount to get rid of stock, so we are delighted by the way it's come back so successfully."
Austin Reed, which began life in 1900 as a gentlemen's outfitters in Fenchurch Street in the heart of the City, said there are encouraging signs of a rise in UK consumer activity.
"We are trading in a very competitive market," Thomson said, but he added that the group's autumn sales are ahead by around nine percent so far from a year ago.
The company plans to step up sales of its branded clothing through German, French and Italian retailers in particular.
"The Austin Reed brand is well known in Europe, being a quintessentially British brand, and I think there are tremendous opportunities to expand that," Thomson said.
