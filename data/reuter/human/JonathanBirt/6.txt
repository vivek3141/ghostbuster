U.S. power utility Dominion Resources Inc will have to reconsider the price it is prepared to pay for East Midlands Electricity Plc if it is realistic about acquiring it, analysts said on Thursday.
On Wednesday Dominion's interest in East Midlands was flushed out by U.K. stock exchange regulators after East Midland's share price jumped by 13 percent.
But Dominion said it would not go much above Wednesday's closing price of 608 pence, valuing East Midlands at just over 1.2 billion stg ($1.97 billion), and industry sources said it would "run away" if the market drove the price up further.
Investors seemed to take Dominion at its word on Thursday, and with no bid on the table East Midlands' share price slipped back 21 pence to 587 in midafternoon trading.
But analysts said an offer would be most unlikely to succeed at 610 pence, valuing East Midlands less highly than Northern Electric Plc, which is subject of a 659 million stg bid from U.S. energy group CE Electric.
SG Strauss Turnbull analyst Marshall Whiting said Dominion was being "very cheeky."
Dominion's declaration of interest follows hard on the heels of CalEnergy Co Inc unit CE Electric's 630 pence offer for Northern last week.
Using median forecast figures gathered by Edinburgh Financial Publishing, CE Electric's offer represents a P/E ratio of 9.3 against Northern's prospective year through March 1997 earnings and 8.6 times year through March 1998 earnings.
