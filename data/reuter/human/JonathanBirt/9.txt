Supermarket group Budgens Plc said on Monday that it expected to open 10 new wholly-owned stores in 1997, as well as continuing to build up its presence on petrol station forecourts.
In a telephone interview with Reuters after the company announced an 18 percent rise in first-half pretax profit to 5.04 million stg, chief executive John von Spreckelsen said the group continued to be "well-placed as a small operator in this niche where we are complementary to the superstores and the discounters."  
"The successful companies will continue to take market share from the less successful ones," he said.
Budgens saw sales rise by 8.1 percent to 183.0 million stg in the 28 weeks to November, while on a like-for-like basis they climbed 4.5 percent.
Spreckelsen said that sales growth in the run-up to Christmas slowed down as large stores pulled in trade, but had picked up again in January.
Shares in the group were virtually unchanged after the results, trading just 1/4 pence higher at 46 1/2 in early dealing on Monday.
