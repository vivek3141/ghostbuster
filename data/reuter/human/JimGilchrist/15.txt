Freight forwarders in Hong Kong say they have been warned that there will be a 20 percent increase in transpacific air cargo rates from the territory when the peak season starts on September 1.
Anthony Lau, vice-chairman of the 260 member Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding Agents Ltd (HAFFA), told Reuters that the 20 percent increase in the run up to Christmas was not surprising.
"I think it is fair and in line with expectations," Lau said.
He added it will apply to cargo destined for both the U.S. east and west coasts.
Warning notices had been received from the major transpacific carriers including Northwest Airlines, China Airlines, Japan Airlines, United Airlines, Evergreen International Airlines and Polar Air Cargo, Lau said.
