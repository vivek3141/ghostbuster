Engineers are investigating the cause of an engine failure aboard a Cathay Pacific Airways Limited airliner on November 11 which forced return to Ho Chi Minh City on one engine, an airline spokesman said commenting on a report in Flight International.
The Airbus A330-300 and 132 passengers had reached 37,000 feet after take-off when one of its two Rolls Royce 700 engines suffered a suspected gearbox failure. The pilots could not restart the powerplant and decided to return to Ho Chi Minh City where the engine was removed and flown back to Hong Kong for a detailed inspection, the spokesman stated.
The suspect gearbox part has since been returned to the U.K. for detailed analysis, a Rolls Royce spokesman in Hong Kong said.
Cathay has a fleet of nine Airbus A330s which seat around 320 passengers and carry up to 17 tonnes of belly cargo on inter-Asian routes. A spokeswoman for Hong Kong Dragon Airlines known as Dragonair, in which Cathay holds a minority stake, operates 4 R-R powered A330s.
R-R is a long term supplier to Cathay and since the Trent 700 engine entered service with Cathay in February 1995, this is the second recorded inflight shutdown, the Cathay spokesman said.
Industry observers say aircraft engines are now so reliable that mechanical failures are extremely rare.
Intense rivalry for new engines, particularly for the next generation of the Boeing 747 family, exists between R-R and its U.S. competitors Pratt & Whitney and General Electric s, the industry sources said. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
