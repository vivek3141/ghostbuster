Zhang was speaking on the opening day of China's first official air show held at the showpiece Zhuhai airport about 35 miles across the Pearl River delta from Hong Kong. Another major Chinese airline, China Southern Airlines, also confirmed at the show that it too was planning to start a Los Angeles service in March of next year.
