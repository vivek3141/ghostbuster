DHL Worldwide Express is investigating whether to have a new Hong Kong operations centre near the territory's new airport, its Hong Kong and China area manager Andy Tseng said.
The proposed centre would be in addition to and complement the express freight centre now under construction at Chek Lap Kok in which DHL has an equity stake.
It would also be in addition to the firm's existing town centre base near Tai Tak airport and its satellite depots across the territory. DHL recently invested HK$15 million in a new automatic handling system able to process 4,000 items an hour at its existing airport base.
"It is a vital decision for our future and a huge involvement. We must make sure we make the right decision for us and for our customer's changing needs in the future. It is difficult and we are collecting as much information as possible on what our customers want," Tseng said.
DHL say they have been approached by four real estate developers offering green field sites or existing buildings for conversion in west Kowloon, a mainly industrial area close to the new bridge and motorway link to the new airport on Lantau island.
Other air cargo companies are also reported to be considering off-airport sites because they fear high building rents and staff relocation problems at the new airport.
DHL says a viability study being conducted by a task force should be complete by the end of the year. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
