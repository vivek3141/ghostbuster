All-cargo airline Polar Air Cargo is to take delivery of its first Boeing 747-200F series aircraft at Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport on December 13, an airline statement said.
The handover of the aircraft fresh from a 'C' check at Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company brings the number of B747s in the Polar fleet to 14, it added.
The carrier's chief executive officier, Ned Wallace said in the statement that Polar's fleet will increase by two to three 747's each year over the next five years. The next 747-200F is scheduled for delivery in first quarter 1997, he added.
Industry observers say Polar has a reputation for being a low cost airline using first generation former passenger 747 aircraft converted to carry around 100 tons of cargo.
The U.S. based carrier said it is anticipating a "significant jump" in its Asian operations if the U.S. Department of Transportation finalises a "tentative" decision awarding Polar the new U.S.-Japan all-cargo route.
Polar said the Department of Transportation's favourable evaluation was partly due to its proposal to increase using Anchorage, Alaska as a hub to trans-load traffic between Asia, South America, Europe and the U.S.
"The final award of the Japan route will mark the culmination of a three year strategy by Polar to create an effective global network of operations. As we extend our geographic reach, we enhance our competitiveness by giving our customers the market access and route flexibility they need," Wallace added.
