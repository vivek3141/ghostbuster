The Toronto Stock Exchange posted another record close on Wednesday on the back of stronger financial service and conglomerate stocks.
The TSE's key 300 Composite Index rose 10.85 points to 5986.41 in heavy trading. Trading volume was 108.2 million shares worth C$1.9 billion (US$1.4 billion).
Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, eight rose led by conglomerates, banks, pipelines and media.
"This is an interest-sensitive area and where buyers tend to conglomerate," said ScotiaMcLeod senior vice-president Fred Ketchen.
Falling sectors included oils, transports and real estate.
Barrick Gold Corp. led Toronto's active issues after news on Tuesday of a deal which will give it a majority share in a rich Indonesian gold deposit.
One dealer said he had only traded Barrick -- the world's third largest gold producer -- and Bre-X Minerals Ltd. which discovered the Busang gold deposit.
"I think both are buys at this point in time," he said.
Bank stocks were snapped up by investors as Canada's Big Six banks began reporting year-end earnings this week.
Bank of Nova Scotia posted its first C$1 billion ($750 million) annual profit on Wednesday.
On the broader market, declining stocks edged out advances 556 to 437, despite gains in the key index. Another 294 shares were unchanged.
U.S. markets will be closed on Thursday due to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.
