The Toronto Stock Exchange snapped a seven-session winning streak to close softer on Monday, depressed by weak gold stocks.
The TSE's key 300 Composite Index lost 24.90 points to end at 6113.90 points, in turnover of 104 million shares worth C$1.58 billion.
"We had a really nice seven-day rally," said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie. "You're bound to have some kind of correction."
Gold bullion prices tumbled today in both London and New York, pushing Toronto's heavily weighted gold stocks into weaker territory. Some U.S. traders were off for the U.S. Martin Luther King holiday.

All of Toronto's 14 sub-indices lost ground except for oil and gas. The weak side was led by a 1.7 percent drop in golds, followed by media, transportation and forestry products.
Declining issues outnumbered advances 528 to 474, with 291 stocks unchanged.
