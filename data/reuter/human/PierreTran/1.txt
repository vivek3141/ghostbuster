European aircraft maker Airbus looks set to soar higher in 1996 following a bumper order from airline USAir on Wednesday, but tough decisions still need to be made on its products and ownership to secure the long-term future.
Airbus Industrie announced on Wednesday one of the biggest orders in aviation history with the Pittsburgh-based airline's command for 120 planes in the A320 narrow-body family of passenger jets and options for a further 280. List price for the orders was estimated at $5.3 billion.
The USAir victory follows Monday's order by Emirates, a Gulf-based airline, for 16 Airbus A330-200s worth $2 billion, which beat out a rival offer of Boeing Co's 767.
"The order backlog is really healthy," Emmanuel Dubois Pelerin, analyst at ratings agency S&P Adef said. The order book would sustain or even increase production rates for 1997 and 1998, he added.
An Airbus spokesman confidently forecast the consortium would rack up firm orders this year exceeding 300 planes, compared to 106 last year.
While there are no worries on products and profitability for the next two or three years there are uncertainties further ahead stemming from Airbus' change in legal status and implications for projects, particularly the A3XX large plane and stretched A340 long-range jet.
Airbus is a partnership made up of French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA) of Spain.
In the interests of increasing market responsiveness and competitiveness, Airbus wants to change into a joint stock company by 1999. Discussions are being held among the partners to decide the shape of the future company.
It also has to find external financing for the 3XX plane.
Airbus has said it wants to find between 30-40 percent of external risk sharing for the 3XX, which it estimates will cost $8 billion to develop.
Dubois Pelerin said he believed Airbus would have to choose to build either the stretched A340-600 or the 3XX, as running both at the same time would overload its finances,
But the Airbus spokesman said the consortium would be able to finance development of both the 340-600 and the 3XX, with the stretched 340 a top priority in the near term.
Airbus is under severe time pressure to come up with a rival to Boeing's monopoly at the large-capacity segment with its 777 and 747 combination which hit Airbus hard in 1995.
Boeing is studying the 747-500X and 747-600X derivatives of its Jumbo jet, which has been a cashcow since it entered service in the 1970s, but which nearly broke the company in development.
The new jumbos are expected to cost around $200 million a piece, which industry sources said prompted Airbus' senior vice-president commercial John Leahy to announce earlier this week that the 3XX would cost $198 million.
The Airbus supervisory board last month asked for the business case for the 340-600 to be presented in mid-December to allow an early decision on whether to launch the product. If it were launched, the 376-seater could be in service in late 2000 and head off competition from the early versions of the 747.
If the 555-seater 3XX goes ahead, it would fly in 2003 and tackle the 747 derivatives.
A signature earlier this week with Rolls-Royce Plc on using its Trent engine for the 3XX will allow Airbus to supply important performance data such as fuel burn, range and take-off and landing weight to the airlines it is talking to for its marketing studies.
