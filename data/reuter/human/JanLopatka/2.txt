The Czech Statistical Bureau
(CSU) said on Thursday it would change its methodology for
calculating industrial production, to bring it in line with
western standards.
CSU Chairman Edvard Outrata said the change, which updates
the old methodology introduced in 1953 under communist
planning, would take effect in January 1997.
The new methodology excludes multiple calculation of
semi-finished products, resources, and other materials and
commodities, which were included in output data at every stage
under the old method measuring the gross value of all goods
produced, the CSU said.
The new index will measure output changes by units, weight
or other measurements, of the total of 1,304 products out of
879 product groups consisting of one or more similar products.
The product groups's output indices will be placed in
sectors, using weighting equal to their weight in the
respective industrial sector.
The overall index will be calculated from weighted changes
in the sectoral indices.
Outrata said the old system of measuring "gross
production", or "goods production" was suited for the
management of a planned economy as it allowed to measure the
total summ of production and compare it with state plans.
Construction output data will be adjusted to the new
methodology at the beginning of 1998, Outrata added.
Preliminary monthly data will be released on the 40th day
after the end of the month being examined.
Outrata also said the data would include seasonally
adjusted and figures adjusted if the number of working days in
the period differed from previously measured periods.
He added the CSU would gradually, throughout next year,
start releasing seasonally adjusted and pro-rated figures for
most data on the same day as the raw figures.

Note. Current methodology examines companies with over 100
employees and includes estimates for smaller firms. The new
methodology includes data from some 5,200 firms with 25 or more
employees. As of January, it will include data form firms with
20 or more workers.
