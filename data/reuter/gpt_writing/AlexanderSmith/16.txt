The merged entity emerges with an impressive array of capabilities, boasting over [$X] trillion in assets under managementâ€” a figure only surpassed by a select few investment management giants in the world. The combined entity will integrate the product offerings and investment strategies of both firms, multiplying the range of options available to clients seeking effective wealth management solutions.
With Invesco's strong heritage in passive index investing and AIM's expertise in actively managed strategies, the new firm offers a unique blend of traditional and alternative investments.
