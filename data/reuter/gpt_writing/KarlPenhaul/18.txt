Colombia's long history of kidnappings has dealt a heavy blow to the nation, affecting countless families and perpetuating a climate of fear and insecurity. Yet in recent years, the country had made significant strides to reduce the incidence of abductions. Unfortunately, the persistence of this issue indicates the need for a renewed approach.
The root causes of the current surge in kidnappings are multifaceted and require a comprehensive response involving both short-term and long-term strategies.
