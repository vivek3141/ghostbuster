Introduction:
Colombia, a country long plagued by drug trafficking and related violence, finds itself at a crossroads as international pressure mounts for the reinstatement of a crucial extradition treaty with the United States. The controversial decision to terminate the treaty in 2019 has sparked concerns over the potential consequences for Colombia's fight against drug cartels and organized crime. This move threatens to strain relations with the US, which has traditionally been a key ally in combating the nation's persistent narcotics trade. 
Background:
Colombia's drug trade has had severe repercussions both domestically and internationally. Over the years, the country's drug lords have amassed immense power and wealth, leading to the rise of organized criminal networks that pose a significant threat to national stability. The now-defunct extradition treaty between Colombia and the US was a vital tool in countering this menace, allowing for the swift extradition of high-profile drug traffickers to face justice in American courts.
Colombian president Ivan Duque's administration decision: 
In 2019, President Ivan Duque announced his government's decision to withdraw from the extradition treaty in an effort to assert the country's sovereignty. The move aimed to shift the focus towards domestic prosecution of drug offenders, asserting that Colombian courts should handle drug-related crimes committed within the country's borders. However, critics argue that without the support and resources of the United States, Colombia risks undermining its own justice system and failing to adequately combat the international drug trade.
Impact on bilateral relations and international cooperation:
The termination of the extradition treaty has strained relations with the United States, a vital long-standing partner in Colombia's fight against drug cartels. American authorities have expressed their concern that removing this crucial tool weakens joint efforts in dismantling transnational narcotics networks. Additionally, this decision has implications for international cooperation against drug trafficking globally, as the United States had often relied on Colombia's collaboration as a linchpin for regional strategies.
Increased pressure for treaty reinstatement:
In recent months, the pressure on Colombia to reinstate the extradition treaty has increased significantly. The US government, alongside international organizations such as the United Nations and Interpol, has emphasized the necessity of renewed cooperation to address the evolving threats posed by drug traffickers. The incoming Biden administration, which has promised a more robust focus on counter-narcotics efforts, views the treaty as essential for tackling the drug trade both domestically and internationally.
The consequences of abolishing the treaty:
Experts and law enforcement officials warn that the decision to abolish the treaty risks serious repercussions. Without the ability to extradite drug lords to the United States, these criminals could enjoy impunity, impeding efforts to bring them to justice. The absence of external pressure through US courts also diminishes Colombia's ability to tackle corruption and money-laundering networks that support drug trafficking operations.
Conclusion:
Colombia is facing increasing pressure to reconsider the termination of its extradition treaty with the United States. The decision, viewed by many as a misguided assertion of sovereignty, threatens to undermine Colombia's battle against drug cartels and organized crime. Reinstating the treaty would not only strengthen the country's justice system but also bolster international cooperation in combating the global drug trade, benefitting both Colombia and the United States. The country now finds itself at a critical juncture, where it must balance its domestic concerns with the necessity of maintaining vital international alliances in the shared fight against narcotics.
