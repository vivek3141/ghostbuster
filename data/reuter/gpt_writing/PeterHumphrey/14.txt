The former Chief Executive from 1997 to 2005, Tung Chee-hwa possesses both the experience and the vision required to navigate the challenging socio-economic landscape in Hong Kong.
Background:
Born into a prominent shipping family, Tung Chee-hwa has had a long and successful career in the maritime industry, which has turned him into one of Hong Kong's most successful entrepreneurs.

Tung Chee-hwa's astute leadership skills propelled OOCL to new heights of success, earning him recognition as a powerful figure in Hong Kong's business community.
Political Influence:
Tung Chee-hwa's first foray into politics occurred in 1996 when he was selected by Beijing as Hong Kong's first Chief Executive following the handover from British rule. Although his time as Chief Executive was marked by various challenges, including the Asian Financial Crisis and public discontent, Tung Chee-hwa's leadership demonstrated his ability to navigate through difficult circumstances. Despite stepping down from the position in 2005 due to health issues, Tung Chee-hwa's political influence continued to exert a significant impact on Hong Kong's governance landscape.
Relevance in Hong Kong's Current Climate:
As Hong Kong grapples with ongoing political unrest, economic uncertainty, and a call for increased autonomy, the choice of Tung Chee-hwa as a potential leader could have wider implications.

However, detractors point to Tung Chee-hwa's previous term as Chief Executive, during which there were allegations of him being overly influenced by Beijing.
