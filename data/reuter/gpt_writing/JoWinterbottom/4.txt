He acknowledges that the UK market has witnessed a significant shift in shopping habits, driven by an increasing desire for healthier, sustainable, and locally sourced products. In response, ASDA plans to invest heavily in acquiring more organic and sustainable options, while fostering stronger relationships with local producers and suppliers.
Furthermore, the CEO aims to revolutionize the customer experience by harnessing technology to deepen engagement. Leighton is determined to leverage cutting-edge tools and digital capabilities to provide shoppers with a seamless and personalized journey from browsing to purchasing. By prioritizing online and mobile platforms, he intends to strengthen ASDA's digital presence and bolster convenience, aiming to cater to the ever-growing segment of customers favoring online shopping.
While ASDA has long been hailed for its affordability, Leighton understands that value extends beyond just lower prices. Consequently, he plans to shift the narrative by emphasizing the importance of quality and sustainable pricing. By ensuring that affordable products remain excellent in value and quality, ASDA aims to cater to customers' changing preferences without sacrificing its reputation as a cost-effective choice.
Leighton's strategy also extends to the workforce at ASDA. Recognizing the dedication and talents of employees, he is keen to invest in their development and well-being.
