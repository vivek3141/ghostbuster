French aviation executives fear renewed turbulence with the United States over airline market access
Paris, France - As the global aviation industry grapples with the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, French airline executives are raising concerns over the potential for renewed turbulence in their relations with the United States. With negotiations for a new bilateral air transport agreement on the horizon, fears are growing that access to the lucrative American market could be hindered, impacting the recovery and growth of French airlines.
At the heart of this anxiety lies the concept of 'Open Skies,' an international aviation policy that promotes fair competition, allowing airlines to freely access and operate in foreign markets. The existing Open Skies agreement between France and the United States, signed in 2001, has served as the bedrock for expanding air travel and fostering economic ties between the two nations.
However, recent shifts in the global aviation landscape, coupled with protectionist sentiments that emerged during the pandemic, have fueled concerns among French airline leaders. The United States, under the previous administration, implemented several measures that raised eyebrows in the European aviation community, including alleged subsidies provided to domestic airlines, revised agreements with Gulf carriers, and an increase in tariffs on European products, including a 15% tariff on Airbus aircraft.
Executives worry that these protectionist trends might spill over into negotiations for a renewed air transport agreement, potentially jeopardizing the freedom to operate in the U.S. market. French airlines, such as Air France-KLM, have heavily relied on international routes, including transatlantic flights, for their profitability and expansion.
"Access to the U.S. market is crucial for our long-term growth and recovery plans," said Jean-Marc Janaillac, CEO of Air France-KLM. "Any restrictions on our ability to operate and compete in the American market would hurt our industry and significantly limit our reach."
The French aviation industry has undoubtedly faced a challenging year due to the pandemic, with international travel grinding to a halt, and airlines grappling with record losses. The industry's recovery hinges on reopening key routes, especially those connecting European hubs with major U.S. cities. Pre-pandemic, France-U.S. air routes constituted one of the largest and most profitable markets.
Beyond economic concerns, the bilateral relationship between France and the United States faces broader uncertainties under new leadership in both countries. As President Joe Biden takes the helm in Washington, stakeholders hope for improved cooperation, but underlying tensions and protectionist instincts remain, casting a shadow of doubt over the future of aviation relations.
French aviation executives are calling for a fair, mutually beneficial agreement that allows for a level playing field between carriers from both countries. They emphasize the urgency of resolving these issues promptly to ensure the recovery of the industry while fostering strong economic ties between France and the United States.
"The time for protectionism has passed. We need a forward-looking agreement that benefits both American and French airlines," urged Anne Rigail, CEO of Air France. "By embracing fair competition, we can unlock the tremendous potential of our respective markets while facilitating the safe and efficient movement of people and goods."
As negotiations loom on the horizon, the French aviation industry remains hopeful that the discussions will result in a successful agreement that upholds fairness and transparency. Only time will tell whether these concerns will escalate into a genuine standoff between the two aviation powerhouses or if a compromise can be reached, fostering a renewed era of cooperation and air travel between France and the United States.
