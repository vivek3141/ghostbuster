4. Reducing Corruption and Ensuring Transparency: Strengthening anti-corruption measures, fostering transparency, and increasing public oversight will boost citizen confidence in government institutions.
5. Improving Public Service Delivery: The commission will work towards enhancing the delivery of public services, ensuring efficient access and timely resolutions for citizens' requests and inquiries.
