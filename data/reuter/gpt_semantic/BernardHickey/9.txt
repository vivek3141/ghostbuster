Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul and executive chairman of News Corp, expressed unwavering confidence in the company's ability to achieve a 20% rise in profits, despite a sluggish first quarter. Murdoch's optimism comes as News Corp faces a challenging media landscape and declining revenue in its news division.
Speaking at an investor conference in New York on Wednesday, Murdoch acknowledged the difficulties faced in the first three months of the year. He attributed the slow start to ongoing disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, along with lower advertising revenues and increased production costs. However, Murdoch reassured shareholders that News Corp was well-positioned to rebound and exceed expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Despite reporting an 8% decline in overall revenue for the first quarter compared to the previous year, the company's digital real estate services division, led by REA Group, delivered impressive results. Its digital property advertising platform experienced a revenue increase of 23%, largely driven by a strong rebound in the Australian housing market.
Furthermore, HarperCollins, the publishing arm of News Corp, saw a 5% growth in revenue, thanks to robust sales of fiction and nonfiction titles. The company's revenue from book sales has been boosted by a surge in online purchases and increased demand for e-books during the pandemic.
News Corp's news division, however, struggled during the first quarter. Advertising revenue for its print publications, including The Sun and The Times in the UK, and The Wall Street Journal in the US, declined by 20%. The division also faced rising production costs due to increased investment in digital journalism and marketing strategies.
Despite these challenges, Murdoch emphasized the progress made in digital subscriptions for news publications. The New York Post and The Times continue to experience steady growth in digital subscribers, fueled by engaging and exclusive content. Murdoch expressed confidence that the profitability of the news division could still be achieved as the advertising market starts to recover and digital audiences continue to grow.
News Corp has been actively diversifying its revenue streams and expanding its digital presence in recent years. Murdoch highlighted the company's acquisition of Investor's Business Daily, which aims to strengthen its position in the financial news sector. He also mentioned the increased investment in developing audio news products and platforms, capitalizing on the growing popularity of podcasts and audiobooks.
As News Corp enters the second quarter, Rupert Murdoch's unwavering confidence provides shareholders with renewed optimism. The media giant remains determined to navigate the evolving media landscape, with a focus on digital growth and strategic acquisitions, ultimately aiming to exceed expectations and deliver increased profits for the fiscal year.
