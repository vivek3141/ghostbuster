Pro-Taiwan Community in Hong Kong Flies Nationalist Chinese Flags for Last Time Before China Takeover
HONG KONG â€” In a poignant display of solidarity and protest against the impending handover of their territory to mainland China, a group of pro-Taiwan activists gathered yesterday to fly Nationalist Chinese flags for the last time. The event, which was organized by the pro-Taiwan community in Hong Kong, served as a symbolic farewell and a reminder of the identity and values they fear will be suppressed under Beijing's rule.
Located at the iconic Victoria Harbour, the gathering attracted a substantial crowd of people from all walks of life, uniting in their support for Taiwan and concern for the city's autonomy. Holding banners that read "Fight for Freedom" and "Stand with Taiwan," they defiantly raised the red and blue flags, while fervently singing nationalist anthems to express their unwavering love for their homeland.
The decision to stage this event came in light of recent developments within Hong Kong. With Beijing's tightening grip on the city, many fear that the "one country, two systems" principle, under which Hong Kong has enjoyed a high degree of autonomy, will be jeopardized. Taiwan, an island that has long enjoyed its own independence, has become an emblem of resistance against Beijing's control.
Ma Ying-jeou, former Taiwanese President and a prominent figure in Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) Party, sent a message of support to the Hong Kong activists. He applauded their courage and emphasized the importance of holding onto democratic values in the face of adversity and suppression.
The event was marked by moments of great emotion as participants shared personal stories of visits to Taiwan, cherished moments with loved ones, and the fear of losing their unique identity. Many also expressed concern for the future of Hong Kong's vibrant democracy, fearful that Beijing's control would lead to further suppression of freedom of speech, assembly, and the erosion of civil liberties.
As the flags gently fluttered in the sea breeze, it was hard not to feel a sense of nostalgia for a Hong Kong that once prided itself on its own identity and its status as a bridge between East and West.
"Our flag may no longer fly high in our own land, but it will forever live on in our hearts," said Carrie Li, an activist present at the gathering. This final act of resistance serves as a powerful reminder that the pro-Taiwan community will continue fighting to preserve their democratic values and their right to self-determination, long after the flags have been lowered.
