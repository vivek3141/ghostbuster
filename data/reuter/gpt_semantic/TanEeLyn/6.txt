China Raises Domestic Prices on Gasoil in Response to Soaring Demand and Emaciated Margins
BEIJING â€” In response to rising demand and slim profit margins, China has raised domestic prices on gasoil, a move that is expected to put further pressure on consumers and the economy.
With the global economy rebounding from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, demand for gasoil, used in transportation and industrial sectors, has skyrocketed in recent months. China, the world's largest energy consumer, has been grappling with a massive surge in demand, leading to a strain on its already emaciated margins.
On Monday, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) announced a hike of 3% on domestic gasoil prices, marking China's first adjustment in this area since April. The move comes as a response to the increasing costs faced by refiners, struggling with soaring international crude oil prices and tightening supplies.
While the Chinese government had previously adopted a cautious approach to fuel price adjustments, this policy shift reflects the seriousness of the situation. The NDRC noted that the new measure aims to "balance the interests of all parties in the oil supply chain and maintain stable market fundamentals."
The increase in gasoil prices is likely to impact consumers across the board. Transportation costs are expected to rise, leading to higher logistics expenses for businesses and potentially leading to inflation. The manufacturing sector, which relies heavily on gasoil, could also witness an increase in operational costs.
Analysts predict that the rise in gasoil prices could have a ripple effect across various industries. Liu Ming, an analyst at Shanghai-based Sinopec Securities, said, "This move not only signifies the urgency to address the profitability challenges in the refining sector, but also highlights China's need to take action to control energy consumption."
The decision to raise gasoil prices follows Chinese authorities' attempts to mitigate the unprecedented surge in commodity prices across the board. In recent weeks, China has taken steps to curb speculative trading and release strategic reserves of commodities such as copper, aluminium, and zinc.
Despite the challenges posed by rising costs, officials have assured the public that the government will take measures to ensure sufficient supply and avoid any substantial impact on the broader economy.
