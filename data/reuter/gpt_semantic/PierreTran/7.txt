French Aviation Executives Fear Renewed Turbulence with the United States over Airline Market Access
PARIS â€” As the aviation industry grapples with the devastating impact of the ongoing pandemic, French aviation executives are expressing growing concerns over the prospect of renewed turbulence with the United States over airline market access. With transatlantic travel a critical and lucrative market for both French and American carriers, any further strains in the relationship threaten to exacerbate the already gloomy outlook for the industry.
The issue centers around the Open Skies agreement, a longstanding aviation pact between the European Union and the United States. Under the agreement, airlines from both sides of the Atlantic are granted extensive access to each other's markets. However, the looming threat of protectionist measures from the United States has European aviation leaders on edge.
Traditionally, the United States has placed strict regulations on foreign carriers accessing its domestic market, while European countries adopt a more liberal approach. This longstanding imbalance came to a head in 2017 when United States airlines pushed for stricter regulations, fearing that their European rivals, notably the Middle Eastern airlines, were benefitting from unfair state subsidies.
In response, several Gulf carriers agreed to open up their accounting books, signaling a willingness to address the United States' concerns. However, the change in leadership in Washington has raised anxieties of a renewed push for restrictions.
French aviation executives worry that the protectionist sentiment, championed by former President Donald J. Trump, could reemerge under President Joe Biden. Old fears of potential curbs on European airlines' access to the U.S. market have resurfaced, further dampening prospects for the industry's recovery from the pandemic.
While the immediate focus for the industry remains the reopening of international travel amid Covid-19 vaccination campaigns, industry experts caution that the issue of airline market access cannot be overlooked. With the European Union and the United States set to resume negotiations on air traffic agreements in 2021, French aviation executives are lobbying their governments for robust negotiations that preserve current market access.
France's flag carrier, Air France, which has already suffered significant losses due to the pandemic, views the outcome of these negotiations as a make-or-break moment. The airline relies heavily on its transatlantic routes and fears that any restrictive measures would deal a severe blow to its recovery efforts.
There are concerns that any limitations on market access would not only harm the airlines but also impact tourism and trade between the two countries. Transatlantic flights account for a significant portion of total air traffic between France and the United States, with over five million passengers traveling the route in 2019.
French industry leaders are particularly worried that potential market restrictions would result in a loss of connectivity. This would have dire consequences not just for popular tourist destinations but also for businesses relying on regular and convenient access to the United States market.
As talks loom between the European Union and the United States, the French aviation industry, along with its European counterparts, will be closely monitoring the developments. The outcomes of these negotiations could determine the trajectory of the industry's recovery and shape the future of transatlantic travel. With mounting fears of renewed turbulence, aviation executives are calling for a fair and balanced approach that ensures a cooperative and prosperous future for the aviation sector.
