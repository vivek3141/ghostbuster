Eurotunnel SA Shares Fall After Disappointing Terms Of Restructuring Deal With Creditor Banks
PARIS — Eurotunnel SA, the operator of the Channel Tunnel between the United Kingdom and France, saw its shares plunge on Tuesday as investors responded to a disappointing restructuring deal with its creditor banks.
The stock dropped over 8 percent, reaching its lowest point in six months, after Eurotunnel announced the terms of the agreement.
Eurotunnel had been negotiating with a group of eight creditor banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, to restructure its debt. The company has been burdened with heavy debt since it built the Channel Tunnel in the 1990s.
Under the deal, Eurotunnel agreed to extend the maturity of its debt by seven years, to 2032, but at a steep cost. The agreement includes a 2.5 percent increase in the interest rate paid on the debt, which will now be set at 4.5 percent above the London Interbank Offered Rate. Additionally, Eurotunnel will have to make annual payments of €200 million ($236 million) in cash and €50 million ($59 million) in new equity.
Investors were disappointed by the terms of the restructuring deal, which they believed were overly taxing on Eurotunnel. Many were hoping for more favorable conditions that would have provided the company with more flexibility to invest in its operations and future growth.
“Shareholders expected a more balanced deal that would reduce the burden on the company and allow it to focus on improving its infrastructure and services,” said William Simmons, an analyst at AllianceBernstein.
The stock decline also reflected investor concerns about Eurotunnel’s ability to cope with its debt load given the ongoing economic uncertainties presented by Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic, which have heavily impacted the travel and tourism sectors.
Eurotunnel remains optimistic about its ability to weather the storm and believes that the restructuring deal will provide much-needed stability for the company during these challenging times. Jacques Gounon, CEO of Eurotunnel, stated, “This deal represents an important step towards securing the long-term viability of the Channel Tunnel and allows us to focus on initiatives to drive growth and improve the experience for our customers.”
Despite the setback, Eurotunnel has managed to maintain a strong track record of profitability. Last month, the company reported a 23 percent increase in revenue for the first half of the year compared to the same period in 2020, driven by a recovery in travel and trade between the UK and Europe.
The market reaction to the restructuring deal may be a temporary setback for Eurotunnel. However, as the company continues to navigate the challenges posed by Brexit and the pandemic, it will require further support to ensure its future success and sustain its position as a pivotal link between the UK and mainland Europe.
