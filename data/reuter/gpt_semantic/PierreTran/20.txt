PARIS â€” The French government has been applying pressure on Air France to favor Airbus over Boeing for its new long-haul fleet, according to sources close to the matter. This directive comes as France aims to strengthen its aviation industry and support national aerospace champion, Airbus.
Air France, the country's flag carrier, is preparing to renew its aging long-haul fleet, and the decision on whether to choose Airbus or Boeing has become a subject of intense debate. While Air France's CEO, Anne Rigail, has publicly advocated for a fair and transparent evaluation process, the French government has been pushing for a firm commitment to Airbus, according to insiders familiar with the discussions.
The renewed fleet is part of a larger plan to enhance Air France's competitiveness and expand its international offerings. The airline is set to replace its 25 Airbus A340 planes with more fuel-efficient, long-haul aircraft. However, the French government's insistence on favoring Airbus has raised concerns about political intervention in the airline's procurement decisions.
Some industry experts argue that choosing a mix of Airbus and Boeing planes would be more beneficial for Air France, as it would promote competition between the manufacturers and potentially optimize costs. However, the French government's focus on supporting Airbus, which employs about 48,000 people across the country, is driven by an effort to safeguard jobs in France's aerospace industry and maintain its global standing in the sector.
While Air France has traditionally been a significant customer for both Airbus and Boeing, with the former providing the majority of its long-haul fleet, the global pandemic has dealt a severe blow to the aviation industry. French officials hope that by lobbying for Airbus, they can ensure the survival and recovery of the national airline industry, which has been grappling with layoffs and financial difficulties due to reduced travel demand.
The involvement of governments in decisions regarding national airlines and their manufacturers is not without precedent. In several instances, governments have intervened to protect jobs and support domestic industries, particularly during times of economic uncertainty. However, these actions have drawn criticism from some experts who argue that such interference compromises market forces and ultimately weakens competitiveness.
Both Airbus and Boeing have declined to comment on the situation, while Air France has emphasized its commitment to a thorough evaluation process aimed at selecting the most suitable aircraft for its long-haul fleet. The airline's decision will have significant implications for the future of France's aerospace sector and will likely be closely watched by industry stakeholders worldwide.
