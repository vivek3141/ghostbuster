Reuters Report: Hong Kong Air Cargo Market Rates Continue to Rise Despite Eased Demand and Additional Capacity
According to a recent Reuters report, the air cargo market rates in Hong Kong are on an uphill trajectory despite eased demand and additional capacity. This unexpected trend has taken industry experts by surprise, leading to speculation about the underlying causes.
Hong Kong, known as the global hub for air cargo, has experienced a significant increase in rates over the past few months. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic causing a temporary slump in air transportation, the demand for cargo services has surged due to the rise of e-commerce and an increased need for medical supplies and personal protective equipment around the world.
The Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL), one of the leading cargo terminal operators at the Hong Kong International Airport, has reported a steady increase in rates over the past six months. Observers suggest this is largely due to air cargo being prioritized over passenger flights, which have been significantly reduced. Consequently, airlines have converted more passenger planes into cargo-only flights to meet the growing demand, reducing overall capacity.
The easing of restrictions and additional capacity in the form of flights from passenger aircraft repurposed for cargo, which one would expect to push rates down, has done little to curtail the rising costs. This puzzling phenomenon has left industry analysts scrambling to understand the underlying dynamics at play.
One possible explanation is that increased demand from rapidly growing e-commerce platforms has absorbed the additional capacity. The surge in online shopping during the pandemic has resulted in a higher volume of goods needing to be transported. Furthermore, as many countries face intermittent lockdowns and travel restrictions to curb the virus spread, air cargo has become even more vital than before for ensuring the efficient movement of essential goods.
Companies operating in the air cargo market have responded by adjusting their pricing strategies to reflect the increased demand. However, these higher rates could pose challenges for businesses relying on air transport, particularly smaller enterprises already facing economic hardships due to the ongoing pandemic.
As the situation evolves, industry experts continue to closely monitor the Hong Kong air cargo market, examining how rates will fluctuate as travel restrictions are lifted globally and the pandemic's long-term effects become clearer.
