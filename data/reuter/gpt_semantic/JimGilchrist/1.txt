Hong Kong's Dragonair to Purchase Two New Airbus Aircraft and Lease Another to Meet Demand for China Routes
HONG KONG â€” In a strategic move aimed at meeting the skyrocketing demand for flights to mainland China, Hong Kong-based airline Dragonair announced today that it will be acquiring two new Airbus aircraft and leasing another. The move solidifies Dragonair's commitment to expanding its operations and increasing its presence in the lucrative Chinese market.
Dragonair, a subsidiary of Cathay Pacific Airways, has experienced a surge in demand for flights to various destinations in mainland China in recent years. With the rapidly growing economy and increasing disposable income of Chinese travelers, airlines are vying to secure routes to and from major Chinese cities, and Dragonair is no exception.
The two Airbus aircraft being purchased by Dragonair are expected to be delivered by the end of next year. While the precise models were not disclosed, it is anticipated that the airline will opt for long-haul aircraft that have the range to cover the vast distances across China. This move will allow Dragonair to tap into more second-tier cities in China, beyond its current network that largely focuses on the major metropolises.
Additionally, Dragonair will be leasing another Airbus aircraft to meet the immediate demand for flights to China. This lease agreement, which is expected to commence within the next few months, will enable Dragonair to serve more destinations and offer increased frequency on popular routes. The exact duration and terms of the lease were undisclosed.
The decision to expand and invest in new aircraft comes as no surprise given the current economic climate in China. Despite the global slowdown due to the pandemic, China is experiencing a rapid rebound, which has significantly boosted domestic air travel. Moreover, travel restrictions have pushed Chinese nationals to explore their own country more extensively, leading to a sharp increase in domestic tourism.
Dragonair is optimistic about the market potential and believes that this expansion will position them as a key player in the Chinese aviation industry. By expanding its reach to more regions in mainland China, the airline aims to attract both business and leisure travelers who are seeking convenient and reliable connections.
The airline's CEO, Jeremy White, commented on the strategic move, stating, "With the economic growth and rising affluence of the Chinese population, the demand for air travel within China continues to soar. We are committed to providing excellent connectivity and service to our passengers, and this expansion will allow us to fulfill their travel needs effectively."
Dragonair's plans to bolster its fleet and route network come at a time of intense competition in the Chinese aviation market. Major airlines from around the world, including both domestic and international carriers, are eyeing expansion opportunities to tap into the vast potential offered by the Chinese market.
As Dragonair takes steps to meet the escalating demand for flights to mainland China, the airline is poised to confront the intense competition head-on while capitalizing on the economic boom and flourishing tourism industry in the country. The new Airbus aircraft will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in propelling Dragonair to new heights in the ever-evolving Chinese aviation landscape.
