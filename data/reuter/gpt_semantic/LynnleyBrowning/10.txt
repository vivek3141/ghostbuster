Russia's gold liberalisation unlikely to create "El Dorado of the East" soon, sources say
MOSCOW — Russia’s recent move to liberalize its gold market has garnered attention worldwide as investors eagerly assess the potential economic ramifications. However, experts suggest that the country's ambitious aspirations of creating an “El Dorado of the East” may remain elusive for the foreseeable future.
Last Monday, the Russian government announced a plan to liberalize gold trading, aiming to bolster the country’s economic growth and foreign currency reserves. Having long relied on oil and gas sales, Russia's access to international markets for gold has been limited. The new initiative, described by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin as an "economic breakthrough," will allow individuals to freely trade gold without government-approved licenses.
While this landmark decision undoubtedly presents opportunities, industry insiders caution that realizing the vision of an Eastern El Dorado won't be easy. Analysts point to a variety of factors that may hinder this ambition, including the dominance of Russia’s traditional sectors, the volatility of gold prices, and lingering structural issues within the country's gold market.
Gold has long played a crucial role in Russia's economic landscape. As the country currently ranks as the world's third-largest producer of gold after China and Australia, liberalizing the market could undoubtedly boost domestic production and ultimately transform Russia into a major player in the global gold industry. However, experts point out that such achievements cannot be expected overnight.
"Russia has a long way to go in terms of developing the infrastructure required to support a thriving gold market," says Andrey Petrov, a financial analyst at Moscow-based Bankovski Vestnik. Indeed, despite the abundant reserves, the country's gold sector still lacks the necessary institutions, skilled labor, and adequate transportation network to facilitate the ambitious growth that policymakers envision.
Moreover, within Russia's economy, the energy sector still remains a key pillar. Oil and gas account for a significant portion of the state's revenue and have the potential to overshadow the eventual contribution of the gold industry. This looming shadow poses a challenge for the government as it seeks to diversify the economy and reduce reliance on hydrocarbons.
Furthermore, the unpredictability of gold prices adds a layer of complexity to the equation. Gold has long been considered a "safe haven" asset, with its value often rising during periods of economic uncertainty. However, this volatility can make it a challenging market to navigate for both investors and countries looking to capitalize on a gold boom. The recent geopolitical tensions and ongoing economic uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic exemplify the potential risks inherent to this market.
Despite the challenges, Russian officials remain optimistic about the potential benefits of liberalization, highlighting the successful experiences of countries such as China and Australia in creating thriving gold markets. The government plans to support the development of gold mining regions and introduce measures to attract investment in the sector. Additionally, the central bank is also expected to gradually ease regulations on buying and selling gold, aiming to stimulate demand within the country.
While Russia's gold liberalization may not create an "El Dorado of the East" overnight, it offers tantalizing prospects for investors and the country's economy. A successful realization of this vision would diversify Russia's economy, enhance its geopolitical influence, and potentially lead to substantial wealth creation for its citizens. However, the road ahead is filled with challenges, requiring comprehensive reforms, investment, and a measure of luck to unlock the true potential of the Russian gold market.
As Russia ventures into this new era of gold trading, only time will tell if the El Dorado of the East will eventually come to fruition or remain an unattainable mirage on the horizon.
