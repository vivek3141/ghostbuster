The agreement, which was valued at approximately â‚¬800 million ($940 million), will see the consortium, led by investment firm Arlinson Group, take control of Lagardere's electronics division, known for its production of digital television equipment, including set-top boxes and television receivers. Lagardere, a major player in the global media industry, made the decision to sell its electronics business in order to focus on its core businesses, including books, magazines, and travel retail.
At a time when many European media groups are offshoring production to cut costs, Lagardere's commitment to keeping its electronics division within French hands is a significant development. The move is seen as a vote of confidence in France's skilled workforce and its ability to adapt to the rapidly evolving digital television technology landscape. Lagardere's chairman, Alexandra Mimoun, emphasized the importance of preserving French jobs, specifically highlighting the highly specialized nature of the work carried out by the division's employees.
The deal has received praise from French government officials who have been increasingly concerned about preserving the nation's technological infrastructure and avoiding the externalization of important industries. French Minister for the Economy, Bruno Le Maire, welcomed the sale, calling it a strategic move that safeguards employment and ensures that France remains at the forefront of digital innovation.
The consortium of investors, which also includes telecommunications firm FranceCom, has expressed its commitment to further developing the electronics division and expanding its presence in international markets. This declaration, combined with the retention of skilled workers, has reassured employees who were initially concerned about potential layoffs or relocations.
The Lagardere electronics division boasts a strong reputation in the digital TV industry, particularly in the creation of cutting-edge technologies. This know-how is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge in a sector dominated by technological advancements. By securing the division's expertise within the country, France can continue to be a driving force behind the technological developments shaping the future of television and media consumption.
The deal also underscores France's determination to strengthen its industrial base and ensure self-reliance in key sectors. With the global shift towards digitization, governments worldwide are grappling with the need to safeguard national interests and maintain control over critical industries. Lagardere's decision to divest its electronics division to French investors demonstrates its commitment to playing a role in these efforts.
As the agreement awaits regulatory approval, both Lagardere and the consortium expressed confidence in a smooth transition that will enable the division to continue operations without interruption. The sale is expected to be finalized by the end of the year.
Overall, the Lagardere-Electronics deal represents a significant win for France. By preserving jobs and securing valuable digital TV know-how within its borders, the country can continue to foster innovation, strengthen its industrial resilience, and maintain its status as a global leader in the media industry.
