In a bid to dispel mounting speculations surrounding the future of their joint venture, Volkswagen (VW) and First Automotive Works (FAW) emphatically denied reports suggesting that the partnership might be shut down. The German automaker and their Chinese partner, FAW, are resolute in their commitment to the venture and have reiterated their shared vision for a sustainable and prosperous future.
The highly anticipated joint venture was established in 1991, marking one of the earliest foreign partnerships in China's automobile industry. Over the past three decades, it has enjoyed remarkable success, steadily building a solid foundation based on mutual trust and collaborative innovation. The partnership has yielded significant benefits for both VW and FAW, and they are dedicated to preserving this fruitful alliance.
Responding to recent rumors that the joint venture could be on the verge of dissolution, VW released a strongly worded statement emphasizing the joint commitment: "Reports of the possible closure of the Volkswagen-First Automotive Works joint venture are utterly baseless and completely disregarded by both parties. Our partnership with FAW remains rock solid, and we are resolutely focused on exploring new opportunities and expanding our shared operations."
FAW echoed this sentiment, issuing a separate statement quashing any doubts about the future of the venture: "FAW remains fully committed to our partnership with Volkswagen. Our collaboration has been integral to our success and will continue to be a cornerstone of our long-term strategy. We categorically dismiss any speculation of the joint venture's closure, as it undermines the close bonds we have fostered over many years."
The joint venture's robust performance further underlines the rationale behind their unwavering commitment. In 2020, Volkswagen-FAW became the first company to deliver more than 3 million vehicles in China, a testament to the venture's market dominance and customer appeal. Furthermore, VW continues to invest heavily in electric vehicles (EVs) in China through the partnership, solidifying its presence in the world's largest EV market.
At the heart of the speculation lies uncertainty surrounding declining sales figures and potential hurdles facing the Chinese automobile market. China's automotive industry experienced a downturn in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic dampened consumer demand. Although recovery has been slow, both VW and FAW are optimistic about the market's rebound and are working collaboratively to navigate any challenges that may arise.
Volkswagen-FAWâ€™s proactive approach to addressing the obstacles ahead has further strengthened the partnership's resolve. The joint venture has outlined a strategic roadmap, aiming to invest 15 billion euros ($18 billion) in China by 2025, largely focusing on EV development and digitalization. This aggressive investment plan demonstrates the unwavering confidence VW and FAW have in their shared vision for the Chinese automobile market.
As the rumor mill continues to churn, Volkswagen-First Automotive Works remains steadfast in their message that reports of a potential closure are unfounded. The joint venture's strong performance, coupled with their dedication to joint investment, augurs well for their continued presence in the Chinese automobile industry. With a focus on technological innovation, sustainability, and customer satisfaction, Volkswagen and FAW are determined to overcome any challenges and achieve new heights within their strategic partnership.
