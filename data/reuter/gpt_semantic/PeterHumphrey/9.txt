Pro-Beijing Party Leader Asserts Harmonious Relationship between China-appointed Legislature and Hong Kong Institutions
HONG KONG — In a bid to address concerns surrounding the newly established China-appointed legislature in Hong Kong, the leader of the prominent pro-Beijing political party, Arnold Cheung, assured the public yesterday that the controversial body would not clash with existing Hong Kong institutions. Cheung’s remarks come amid mounting anxieties among local residents and pro-democracy activists regarding the impact this legislative body might have on the city’s traditional political landscape.
 
Speaking in a press conference held at the party headquarters, Cheung, the founding member and current leader of the China Unity Party, expressed his conviction that the newly constituted legislature would not undermine the existing autonomous system in Hong Kong, which has been in place since the handover of the city from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The remarks by Cheung, a well-respected and influential figure within pro-Beijing circles, are expected to influence public opinion on the controversial topic.
 
Cheung emphasized that the formation of the China-appointed legislature was not intended to subvert Hong Kong’s identity or erode the city’s cherished legal and political institutions. Instead, he argued that the legislature’s mission would be to enhance collaboration and maintain stability in the special administrative region, where pro-democracy protests have increased in the past year.
 
“We firmly believe that this legislative body will coexist harmoniously with the existing institutions in Hong Kong,” Cheung said. “It is not designed to replace them, but rather to bolster cooperation and ensure the smooth functioning of the one country, two systems framework.”
 
China's plans for establishing the legislature have sparked widespread unease among citizens. Critics fear that the new body will significantly erode the autonomy guaranteed to Hong Kong under the joint declaration signed by Britain and China during the handover. They argue that it could diminish the freedoms of speech, press, and assembly that have distinguished Hong Kong from mainland China.
 
However, Cheung dismissed these concerns as baseless rumors, emphasizing that the legislature would act as an advisory body, working closely with existing authorities in Hong Kong to address key issues that have plagued the region. Cheung stressed that the China-appointed legislature would complement, rather than subsume, the existing legislative council in the city, allowing for greater cooperation between the Hong Kong government and China's central authorities.
 
The China-appointed legislature, scheduled to be inaugurated later this month, will consist of 120 members who will be selected from among pro-Beijing community leaders, businesspeople, and politicians. The body will be tasked with advising on issues ranging from economy and governance to national security and cultural policies. However, the legislature will lack the lawmaking powers currently vested in Hong Kong's elected legislative council, which has been the center of pro-democracy movements in recent years.
 
The assurance by Cheung, who has long maintained close ties with Chinese officials, may quell some fears among Hong Kong citizens. However, pro-democracy activists and opposition politicians remain skeptical, suggesting that the newly formed body would serve as a means for Beijing to exert further control over the city. As public scrutiny continues, the impact of the China-appointed legislature on Hong Kong's institutions in the long term remains a critically debated topic.
