HONG KONG â€” As the highly anticipated July 1997 handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule looms, British Governor Chris Patten has issued a bold challenge to business leaders, urging them to stand up for the rule of law in the fragile territory.
In a speech delivered yesterday at the prestigious Foreign Correspondents' Club, Governor Patten emphasized the significance of preserving Hong Kong's cherished legal system, which guarantees fundamental rights, personal freedoms, and the independent judiciary. By issuing this challenge, he indirectly called upon the powerful local and foreign-owned businesses to use their influence to safeguard Hong Kong's core values.
Governor Patten, who has shown an unwavering commitment to Hong Kong's autonomy, stressed the importance of businesses in maintaining stability and promoting democratic values ahead of the handover. The future of Hong Kong's political system remains uncertain under Beijing's administration, raising concerns among the public and international community regarding civilian rights and the rule of law, which have come to define the territory.
"Businesses play an essential role in shaping society and the law," Governor Patten stated passionately, adding that "they have a moral obligation to help preserve Hong Kong's unique character and principles, especially in these uncertain times."
Patten's challenge was met with a mixed reaction from the business community. Some leaders, particularly those from multinational corporations, expressed agreement with the governor's call for greater responsibility. British businessman James Prescott, CEO of a leading financial institution operating in Hong Kong, applauded Patten's initiative, stating, "It is vital that businesses actively protect the rule of law, civil liberties, and the autonomy that Hong Kong has been known for."
Others, however, were more hesitant. Fearing economic repercussions and potential backlash from mainland China, numerous Hong Kong tycoons cautiously voiced their concerns over being drawn into political matters.
Lau Shui-ming, the prominent CEO of a successful conglomerate, emphasized the delicate position local businesses find themselves in. "While it is important to preserve the rule of law," he said, "we must also respect the fact that Hong Kong, under future Chinese rule, will be part of a much broader political framework."
Governor Patten remains steadfast in his calls for civic engagement, urging businesses to recognize their role beyond economic prosperity. However, the Chinese government views Patten's challenge as a political maneuver, accusing him of interfering in Hong Kong's affairs.
Tracey Wu, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, criticized Patten's approach as "double standards" and reiterated Beijing's commitment to the "one country, two systems" principle.
With tensions high and the handover just months away, this challenge by Governor Patten has stirred up a much-needed dialogue among businesses and the broader community about Hong Kong's future post-1997. As the world watches, the decisions made by these influential tycoons and multinational corporations may determine whether Hong Kong can maintain its unique identity or risk being swallowed by the vast Chinese mainland.
