BP Gives Lukewarm Reception to Colombian Proposal for Piedemonte Field
BOGOTÁ, Colombia — British multinational oil and gas company BP has expressed a lukewarm reception to the Colombian government's latest proposal for the development of the Piedemonte field, raising concerns over the fiscal terms and uncertainties surrounding the country's regulatory framework.
The announcement came during a press conference held at the company's regional headquarters in Bogotá. BP Colombia's CEO, Rebecca Malone, highlighted the potential of the Piedemonte field but emphasized that BP requires an investment framework that ensures long-term stability and competitiveness.
"The Piedemonte field holds promising resources that could significantly contribute to Colombia's energy sector. However, the proposed fiscal terms and regulatory uncertainties are of concern to us," Malone said. "It is crucial for us to have clear and stable investment conditions that align with our long-term business strategies."
The Colombian government had presented the proposal as part of its efforts to attract foreign investments and boost the country's oil production. The proposal aims to increase royalties and establish a profit-sharing mechanism for oil companies operating in the country.
According to analysts, BP's reception to the proposal is a potential setback for President Iván Duque's administration, which has been struggling to attract foreign investments to boost Colombia's oil industry. The government has been keen on attracting international companies to explore and exploit the country's oilfields in order to increase production and revenues, which have been heavily affected by the global oil price slump and declining reserves.
The Piedemonte field, located in the Cesar-Ranchería Basin in northeastern Colombia, is estimated to hold around 2.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The Colombian national oil company, Ecopetrol, currently operates the field, but the government is eager to bring in international partners to boost production and ensure effective exploration and extraction operations.
In response to BP's concerns, Diego Mesa, Colombia's Minister of Mines and Energy, assured that the government remains committed to creating an attractive investment environment. He acknowledged the need for a stable and predictable regulatory framework and emphasized ongoing dialogue with industry stakeholders to address their concerns.
"We value BP's interest in the Piedemonte field, and we are open to working together to address their apprehensions. We are dedicated to creating mutually beneficial conditions that accommodate the needs of both foreign investors and our country," Mesa stated.
The lukewarm reception from BP highlights the challenges the Colombian government faces in attracting foreign investments to revitalize its oil industry. It also indicates the importance of balancing fiscal terms and regulatory conditions to provide certainty and incentive for international companies to partner and invest in Colombia's energy sector.
