Several German citizens were apprehended in Colombia yesterday for attempting to smuggle a kidnapped victim out of the country, local authorities reported. The victim, a Colombian national in his mid-thirties, had been held captive for several weeks by a notorious criminal gang. Acting on a tip-off, Colombian police intercepted the group at a regional airport, just moments before they were set to board a private jet. The Germans, whose identities have not been disclosed, are believed to have been working in collaboration with the gang. The victim, who was found in good health, has been safely returned to his family. Investigations are ongoing.
