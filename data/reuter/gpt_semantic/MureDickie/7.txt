China's Rising Foreign Debt Not a Cause for Concern Despite Booming Economy, Say Financial Analysts
BEIJING â€” China's escalating foreign debt has been a subject of debate among economists and global financial markets, but experts argue that the country's debt burden is not a cause for concern, despite its rapidly growing economy.
China, the world's second-largest economy, has witnessed a substantial increase in its foreign debt in recent years. As of the end of June 2021, the country's total foreign debt reached a record high of $2.8 trillion, up from $1.4 trillion in 2016. This represents a significant rise in a relatively short period, leading to questions about the sustainability of China's debt burden.
Many analysts, however, contend that the increasing debt level is a natural consequence of China's economic growth and ongoing efforts to internationalize its currency, the yuan. The country's booming economy has attracted significant foreign investment, both from multinational corporations and individual investors, leading to an influx of capital and an increase in foreign liabilities.
Moreover, China's foreign exchange reserves, which safeguard against external shocks and potential debt crises, have remained robust. At the end of June 2021, China's foreign exchange reserves stood at around $3.22 trillion, providing a significant buffer that supports China's ability to manage its debt obligations.
Financial analysts assert that China's rising foreign debt is different from situations seen in other countries in the past. China's debt is predominantly denominated in its own currency, reducing the risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations. This composition mitigates the potential impact of a currency crisis, distinguishing China from economies that faced significant challenges due to debt denominated in foreign currencies.
Experts also point to China's unmatched net creditor position, meaning it holds more foreign assets than it owes to other nations. According to the People's Bank of China, the country boasted a net creditor position of $2.8 trillion by the end of 2020. This favorable position provides a strong foundation for China to service and repay its foreign debt without causing systemic financial risks.
While skeptics argue that the accumulation of foreign debt could create challenges for China's financial stability, analysts counter that the country has employed prudent measures to manage associated risks. China's policymakers have implemented tighter regulations and controls on capital flows, mitigating the likelihood of abrupt outflows and reducing potential vulnerabilities.
Additionally, China has a track record of successfully managing debt risks, having tackled similar challenges during the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. Chinese authorities have demonstrated resilience in navigating economic shocks, utilizing measures such as restructuring, recapitalization, and debt-for-equity swaps to address potential issues.
Concerns over China's rising debt have also been partially assuaged by its impressive economic growth. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, China's economy expanded by 18.3% in the first half of 2021, outpacing other major economies worldwide. This growth trajectory bolsters China's ability to generate income and service its debt, reducing the likelihood of a debt crisis.
In conclusion, financial analysts argue that China's soaring foreign debt should not be a cause for alarm, contrary to some concerns in global markets. China's robust foreign exchange reserves, the predominantly domestic currency composition of its debt, and its net creditor position provide a solid foundation for managing its debt obligations. Coupled with prudent measures implemented by Chinese policymakers and the country's impressive economic growth, analysts assert that China's ability to handle its foreign debt remains intact.
