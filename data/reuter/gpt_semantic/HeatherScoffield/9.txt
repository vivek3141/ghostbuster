Bre-X Minerals Ltd. Forges Alliance With Company Controlled by Eldest Son of Indonesia's President Suharto to Resolve Dispute Over Busang Gold Discovery
JAKARTA, Indonesia - In a move aimed at resolving the ongoing dispute over the Busang gold discovery, Canadian mining company Bre-X Minerals Ltd. has announced a groundbreaking alliance with a company controlled by Hutomo "Tommy" Mandala Putra, the eldest son of President Suharto of Indonesia. The agreement, which was met with mixed reactions from industry experts, is seen as a significant step toward finding a mutually beneficial resolution to the conflict.
The controversy began earlier this year when allegations of fraud emerged surrounding the supposed $4 billion worth of gold reserves at Busang, located in the jungles of Borneo. Bre-X's stock value plummeted as doubts were cast on the authenticity of the gold deposits, resulting in a wave of anxiety and concern among shareholders, investors, and government officials. The gold discovery, once hailed as one of the largest in history, now stands at the center of a legal dispute.
Under this newly formed alliance, a joint-venture company named PT Busang Emas will be established, with Bre-X retaining a 45% stake and the remaining 55% controlled by the company associated with Mr. Putra. The agreement, subject to regulatory approval, aims to restore confidence in the Busang project and pave the way for its future development.
Critics argue that such an alliance raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given Mr. Putra's familial ties to the President. However, both parties have stressed the alliance is founded on purely economic considerations and professional collaboration. They argue that the involvement of Mr. Putra's company will not only expedite the resolution of the dispute but also act as a bridge between Bre-X and the Indonesian government, facilitating smoother negotiations and cooperation.
Government officials have welcomed the move cautiously. In an interview, Minister of Mines Sjafruddin Djamin expressed hope that the alliance would lead to a swift resolution, emphasizing the importance of maintaining investor confidence in Indonesia's mining industry. However, he also highlighted the need for transparency and vigilance to ensure a fair outcome for all parties involved.
Industry experts are divided on the potential outcome of this alliance. Some view it as a pragmatic solution to a complex problem, with the involvement of influential local figures increasing the chances of an amicable settlement. Others, however, express concerns that the close ties between the President's family and the mining industry could overshadow due process, further damaging the credibility of the Busang project.
As the legal battle over the Busang gold discovery rages on, the alliance between Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and a company associated with President Suharto's eldest son represents a significant and controversial development. As stakeholders await regulatory approval and the outcome of ongoing negotiations, the eyes of the mining industry remain fixed on Busang, hoping for some clarity amidst the uncertainty that has plagued this once-promising venture.
