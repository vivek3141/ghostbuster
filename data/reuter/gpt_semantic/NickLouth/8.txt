Ameritech, a leading provider of telecommunication services across nine Midwestern states, announced a staggering increase of 15% in their profits for the third quarter of 1996. With their earnings reaching $523 million, compared to $455 million during the same period last year, Ameritech experienced its strongest growth in recent years. The company attributed its success to a combination of aggressive marketing strategies, the introduction of innovative services, and significant investments in infrastructure.

The company's earnings rose to $397 million, up from $354 million in Q3 1995. Sprint's solid performance has been attributed to its ability to capture more customers by offering competitive pricing packages and expanding its digital network.
"Under fierce competition, we managed to sustain our market share and even expand it," said Ronald T. LeMay, president of Sprint's long-distance division. "Our analysis indicates that clients appreciate our affordable rates and superior service quality."

Both Ameritech and Sprint displayed their commitment to integrating new technologies into their services to meet the evolving demands of their customers.
In addition to enhanced services and competitive pricing, Ameritech's success can be credited to its significant investments in building a more robust infrastructure.
