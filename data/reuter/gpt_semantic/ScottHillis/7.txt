US Securities Official Urges China to Increase Transparency in Listed Companies
BEIJING â€” In a bold move aimed at bolstering investor confidence, a senior United States securities official has urged China to increase transparency in its listed companies. The call comes amidst growing concerns over governance practices and accounting standards in the world's second-largest economy.
Speaking at a conference on international financial regulation, Valerie Szczepanik, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Senior Advisor for Digital Assets and Innovation, highlighted the urgent need for China to enhance disclosures and reporting requirements. Szczepanik stressed that greater transparency is vital to attract foreign investors and promote healthy capital markets.
"Transparency is the backbone of any robust financial system," Szczepanik firmly stated. "By enforcing stricter disclosure norms, China could alleviate concerns over undisclosed risks and ensure that investors have access to accurate information."
The SEC official's remarks assume significance as China steps up efforts to attract more international capital and counter fears of a slowing economy amidst the ongoing trade war with the United States. Recent studies have shown that foreign investment in Chinese stocks has steadily declined, partly due to concerns regarding corporate governance and accounting irregularities.
China's domestic stock market, also known as the A-share market, has long been criticized for its opacity and lack of transparency. The country's regulatory framework, while having made some progress over the past decade, continues to raise doubts among international investors.
To address these concerns, China launched multiple market reform initiatives, such as the introduction of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect programs, which facilitated international investor access to mainland Chinese equities. Additionally, the establishment of the ChiNext board in 2009 aimed to provide a platform for innovative and high-growth enterprises.
However, despite these measures, the underlying issues of corporate transparency persist. The lack of standardization across Chinese listed companies in terms of disclosures, accounting practices, and corporate governance remains a point of contention for foreign investors.
In her speech, Szczepanik outlined several steps that China could take to improve transparency. She suggested strengthening accounting standards, enhancing audit quality, and adopting globally recognized best practices for corporate governance. The SEC official also emphasized the importance of timely and accurate disclosure of material information, which would enable investors to make informed decisions.
The reaction to the SEC official's plea has been mixed. Some analysts argue that China's recent efforts to reform its securities market demonstrate its willingness to address the transparency issue. They state that the establishment of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) as a unified regulator has helped streamline regulations and enforcement. Additionally, the increasing number of Chinese companies listed on international exchanges shows a positive trend towards greater disclosure.
However, skeptics remain cautious. They argue that while China has made progress, a considerable section of the market, particularly smaller companies, still lacks sufficient regulatory oversight. They contend that stringent enforcement measures and consistent regulatory policies are necessary to ensure compliance with disclosure rules.
Meanwhile, the Chinese government has yet to respond formally to the SEC official's comments. Analysts believe that China is likely to adopt a more cautious approach and continue with its ongoing market reform initiatives. However, a complete overhaul of its corporate disclosure norms remains unlikely in the near term.
As China endeavors to attract foreign investment and consolidate its position as a global economic powerhouse, the spotlight on corporate transparency will continue to intensify. Only time will tell if China will heed the call for increased transparency and take actionable steps to address investor concerns.
