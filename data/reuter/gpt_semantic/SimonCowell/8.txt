The merger will give rise to a new powerhouse in the insurance sector, combining Lloyd Thompson’s extensive global reach with JIB Group’s expertise in the UK market.
The move comes as the insurance industry faces unprecedented challenges, including increased regulatory scrutiny and growing competition from insurtech start-ups.

The resultant international insurance firm will boast an impressive global footprint with operations across North America, Europe, and Asia. This increased scale will enable them to better serve their diverse client base, which includes multinational corporations, governments, and individuals.
Both Lloyd Thompson and JIB Group bring their own unique strengths to the table. Lloyd Thompson, with its 150-year history, possesses deep relationships with insurers and an extensive network of clients, while JIB Group has earned a reputation for its innovative use of technology and deep understanding of the UK market. The merger will create a dynamic blend of tradition and modernity, positioning the new entity for success in an evolving industry.
Although subject to regulatory approvals, the deal is expected to be finalized in the next six months. The merger will pave the way for significant growth opportunities and the potential to reshape the insurance landscape on a global level.
