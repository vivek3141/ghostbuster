Analysts Predict Long and Difficult Road Ahead for Ford as It Looks to Cut Costs and Revive Product Line in Europe
In an effort to tackle lingering challenges in the European market, Ford Motor Co. announced a cost-cutting plan and strategy to rejuvenate its product line. However, industry analysts suggest that the road ahead for the American automaker will be long and arduous.
Ford's sales in Europe declined by 8 percent last year, reflecting the broader struggles the company has faced in the region. With the automotive industry witnessing a shift towards electric and autonomous vehicles, Ford is eager to reposition itself and regain its competitiveness in Europe.
The company's new European restructuring plan aims to cut costs by $500 million, with a particular focus on cutting jobs and restructuring its operations. Ford is planning to reduce its workforce by up to 12,000 employees across its plants in Europe, in order to align its production capacity with the current demand. While voluntary redundancies will play a major role, there will also be involuntary layoffs as part of the process.
The decision comes after Ford announced the closure of its Bridgend engine plant in Wales, UK, which is expected to cost around 1,700 jobs. This move has been met with severe backlash, with unions and politicians expressing concern over the impact on the local community. However, Ford argues that these measures are necessary to ensure the company's long-term survival and profitability.
Ford is also looking to revive its product lineup in Europe, by introducing new models and focusing on higher-margin vehicles. To cater to the growing consumer demand for electric cars, Ford plans to introduce 16 fully electric and 24 plug-in hybrid models by 2022. This includes the much-anticipated introduction of the Mustang Mach-E, an electric SUV, which is expected to be released in 2020.
Furthermore, Ford aims to strengthen its commercial vehicle lineup, focusing on utility vehicles and vans, which have proven to be a more profitable segment. The company plans to release four new models by 2024 to gain market share in this area.
While Ford's new strategies might sound promising, analysts express skepticism about the feasibility of its plans. The European market is crowded and highly competitive, making it challenging for any automaker to gain momentum. Additionally, Ford faces strong local competitors who have already established themselves in the market.
The shift towards electric vehicles also presents a significant hurdle for Ford. They have lagged behind rivals in this segment and will face tough competition from established players like Volkswagen, which already dominates the European electric car market.
Moreover, economic uncertainties such as Brexit and trade tensions between the United States and Europe are creating added complications for Ford. The ongoing Brexit negotiations have created an unpredictable business environment, and any disruptions to the supply chain could further hamper Ford's efforts to thrive in Europe.
While Ford's restructuring plan is a step in the right direction, industry experts suggest that it might not be sufficient to turn things around. The company will need to make agile and innovative decisions to address the evolving demands of consumers and adapt to the rapidly changing automotive landscape.
As Ford embarks on its journey to cut costs and revive its product line in Europe, the challenges it faces are as daunting as ever. Whether the company can successfully navigate this difficult road and reclaim its share of the European market remains to be seen.
