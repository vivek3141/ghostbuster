Inter-African Coffee Organization to Focus on Low World Prices at Annual Meeting in Abidjan
ABIDJAN - The Inter-African Coffee Organization (IACO) will convene its annual meeting in Abidjan this week, bringing together representatives from coffee-producing countries across Africa to discuss pressing issues facing the industry. This year, the organization will primarily focus on the persistently low world prices of coffee, which have been affecting African coffee producers disproportionately.
The IACO, headquartered in Ivory Coast's economic capital, aims to promote solidarity and cooperation among African coffee-producing countries, which play a crucial role in the global coffee market. However, they have been grappling with declining profits as world coffee prices have plummeted to near-record lows. According to the International Coffee Organization (ICO), the average price of coffee hit a 13-year low in September 2021, further exacerbating the challenges faced by African coffee farmers.
With the theme "Reviving African Coffee: Strategies for Sustainable Growth," the annual meeting will offer a platform for African coffee producers to discuss potential solutions to address the issues of low world prices and seek avenues for collaboration and support to revitalize the African coffee industry.
Experts from the agricultural sector and key stakeholders in the coffee value chain, including roasters, buyers, exporters, and consumers, will be present at the meeting. Their participation is essential in understanding the complexities of the global coffee market and finding sustainable solutions to the pressing challenges faced by African coffee farmers.
The IACO has set an ambitious agenda for the meeting, aiming to explore innovative strategies to improve pricing mechanisms, enhance the quality and value of African coffee products, promote sustainable agricultural practices, and facilitate fair trade relationships. Various sessions and panel discussions will shed light on topics such as market diversification, climate change adaptation, and attracting investment into the coffee sector.
In addition to addressing the economic challenges, the organization will also focus on inclusivity and gender equality initiatives in the coffee industry during the meeting. Efforts will be made to ensure that women, who constitute a significant portion of the coffee workforce, are empowered and have equal access to resources and decision-making processes.
The annual meeting is not only an important platform for dialogue and collaboration but also an opportunity for African coffee producers to amplify their urgency and convey their concerns on an international stage. By highlighting the impact of low world prices on farmers and their communities, African coffee-producing countries hope to secure support from global partners, industry leaders, and consumers in their quest for sustainable and equitable growth.
As the global coffee industry faces myriad challenges, including climate change, unstable markets, and changing consumer preferences, the IACO's annual meeting comes as a timely reminder of the need for collective action and international cooperation. The outcomes of the meeting are expected to shape the organization's strategic approach in supporting African coffee producers and navigating the complex coffee landscape in the years to come.
