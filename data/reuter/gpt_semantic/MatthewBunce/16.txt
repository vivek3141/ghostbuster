Ivory Coast cocoa shipments estimated to reach 120,000 tonnes by end-November
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast â€” In a positive sign for the world's largest producer of cocoa, Ivory Coast, cocoa shipment estimates indicate that levels will reach 120,000 tonnes by the end of November. This marks a significant increase from the 90,000 tonnes shipped during the same period in October.
The rise in cocoa shipments is a positive development for the West African country, which relies heavily on this commodity for its economy. The estimates were revealed by industry sources on Monday, buoying hopes for a much-needed boost in revenue for Ivory Coast.
Cocoa, a critical cash crop for Ivory Coast, has been adversely affected due to the pandemic-induced economic downturn. With global demand plummeting earlier this year, the country experienced a loss in revenue, causing considerable financial strain. However, this recent increase in cocoa shipments comes as a ray of hope, signaling a potential recovery on the horizon.
While cocoa exports were initially subdued in the midst of the global health crisis, the recent surge in shipments is attributed to the reopening of economies worldwide and increased demand for chocolate products. This uptick in demand is especially notable as the holiday season approaches, with consumers turning to sweet treats to uplift their spirits.
In response to the optimistic news, cocoa industry analysts have cautiously predicted that this trend could continue into the last quarter of the year. If the estimated increase in shipments materializes, economists and policymakers believe it could assist Ivory Coast in navigating some of the financial difficulties it has faced this year.
However, experts have warned that uncertainties caused by the ongoing pandemic and any potential disruptions to global trade could affect the sector's recovery. Moreover, the volatility of cocoa prices in the international market remains a key concern for Ivory Coast, as it directly affects the country's export revenue.
As the end of November approaches, all eyes will be on the cocoa shipment figures, eagerly awaiting confirmation of the positive trend. The Ivory Coast government, in collaboration with industry players, will also continue to devise strategies aimed at supporting cocoa farmers and ensuring sustainable growth for the sector in the long term.
