Exporters Unite Against Ivorian Government's Plan to Hold Them Liable for Income Tax Owed by Upcountry Buyers
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast — In a controversial move, the Ivorian government has recently proposed a plan that would hold exporters liable for income tax owed by upcountry buyers, sparking outrage and unity among exporters throughout the country. The plan, if enacted, could have significant implications for the country's export industry, affecting various sectors such as cocoa, coffee, and cashew nuts.
The proposal, presented by the Ministry of Finance, aims to address the issue of tax evasion by upcountry buyers who frequently underreport their profits. By placing the burden of income tax on exporters, the government hopes to ensure that the proper amount of tax is paid, thereby increasing revenue collection and promoting greater fiscal responsibility.
However, exporters argue that this plan is unjust and burdensome, unfairly targeting honest businesses who have little control over the actions of the buyers they supply. They argue that holding exporters accountable for upcountry buyers' tax liabilities could have a crippling effect on their operations and hinder economic growth.
"We are being treated as scapegoats in this situation," said Amadou Diomande, a representative of the National Exporters Association. "Exporters have no way of controlling or monitoring whether our buyers are paying their taxes accurately or not. It is simply not fair to hold us liable for the tax debt of others."
The proposed plan has faced widespread opposition from both large-scale exporters and smaller family-owned businesses who rely heavily on the export market. They fear that the additional financial burden imposed by the plan could lead to reduced profitability, decreased investment, and even business closures.
Furthermore, critics argue that the plan fails to address the root cause of tax evasion – the lack of effective monitoring and enforcement within the tax system. Instead of shifting the responsibility onto exporters, they argue that the government should focus on strengthening tax collection mechanisms and improving transparency.
Exporters are now mobilizing to voice their concerns and seek a resolution. They have formed a coalition advocating on behalf of the entire export industry, calling on the Ivorian government to reconsider the proposed plan and engage in meaningful dialogue with all stakeholders.
"We are united in our opposition to this plan," stated Aminata Coulibaly, a cocoa exporter from the western region. "We are ready to work with the government to find alternative solutions that address tax evasion without disproportionately burdening exporters."
The government has taken notice of the backlash and has expressed its commitment to engaging with exporters to find a mutually beneficial solution. Finance Minister Kanigui Soro has acknowledged the challenges faced by exporters and has announced that a series of stakeholder meetings will be held to discuss the proposed plan and explore alternative options.
The outcome of these discussions remains uncertain, but both exporters and the government recognize the importance of maintaining a thriving export industry while ensuring fair tax compliance. Finding a balanced solution that addresses tax evasion without placing undue strain on exporters will be crucial for the continued economic development of Ivory Coast.
