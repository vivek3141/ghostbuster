The move by Imperial Tobacco Group highlights the company's bid to distance itself from potential litigation and embrace a more progressive stance in a changing regulatory landscape. With an increasing number of governments worldwide imposing stricter regulations on cigarette sales, tobacco companies are finding themselves at a crossroads. 
In recent years, cigarette manufacturers have faced lawsuits brought by individuals and entire communities affected by smoking-related illnesses. The litigation has resulted in billion-dollar settlements and damages awarded to plaintiffs, including the landmark 1998 Master Settlement Agreement between the major US tobacco companies and 46 US states.
Industry experts have pointed out that Imperial Tobacco Group's decision to separate from the conglomerate is consistent with its proactive approach to avoiding potential legal battles. By splitting from Hanson Plc, the tobacco giant aims to secure its financial future and minimize its exposure to mounting litigation risks. 
This announcement comes at a time when public sentiment towards the tobacco industry is evolving. Over the past decade, smoking rates have declined in many countries, as health campaigns have raised awareness about the risks associated with tobacco use. Furthermore, the rise in alternative products, such as e-cigarettes and vaping, has disrupted traditional tobacco sales.
Imperial Tobacco Group is not alone in its efforts to adapt to a rapidly changing market. Other tobacco companies, including British American Tobacco and Philip Morris International, have also made strategic moves to broaden their portfolios, investing in alternative nicotine delivery systems and reduced-risk products.
As part of the division from Hanson Plc, Imperial Tobacco Group plans to set up a separate legal entity that will be responsible for managing its litigation risk. By doing so, the company aims to shield its core operations from potential financial setbacks that could stem from future lawsuits.
However, critics argue that this move is merely a strategic maneuver designed to protect the company's profitability, rather than a genuine commitment to addressing the concerns surrounding the tobacco industry. They believe that tobacco companies must take more responsibility for the health consequences associated with their products, rather than focusing solely on legal and financial implications. 
Imperial Tobacco Group's decision to sever ties with Hanson Plc highlights the growing pressure on tobacco firms to confront the consequences of their actions. As legal action against the industry continues to mount, it remains to be seen whether this move will be enough to insulate Imperial Tobacco Group from potential litigation risks or whether it will spark broader conversations about the accountability of tobacco companies.
