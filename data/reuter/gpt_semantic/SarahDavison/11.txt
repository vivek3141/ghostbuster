Architect of Hong Kong's Currency Link Defends Peg's Continued Existence Beyond Return to Chinese Sovereignty
HONG KONG â€” As Hong Kong grapples with its changing political landscape under Chinese sovereignty, the architect of the city's currency peg, Mr. Joseph Yam, has come out in defense of the peg's continued existence. In an exclusive interview with The New York Times, Mr. Yam argued that the 38-year-old currency arrangement remains vital to Hong Kong's economic stability and should be preserved even beyond the return of the city to mainland control.
The currency peg, instituted in 1983, has been pegged at a rate of 7.8 Hong Kong dollars to one United States dollar. The arrangement has long been praised for maintaining monetary stability amid economic uncertainty and attracting foreign investments. However, in recent years, there has been a growing chorus of critics calling for a reassessment of the peg's merits as Hong Kong's relationship with mainland China evolves.
Mr. Yam, former chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and widely regarded as the father of the currency link, forcefully made the case for its continuation. "The peg has served Hong Kong remarkably well, ensuring stability and bolstering confidence in our economy," said Mr. Yam. "It is a cornerstone of our financial system and must be safeguarded even as we navigate a post-1997 era."
Critics argue that the link shackles Hong Kong's monetary policy to that of the United States, preventing the city from implementing its own independent measures during economic downturns. They contend that having control over interest rates and currency valuation is crucial for Hong Kong in adapting to its unique challenges as a global financial hub closely wedded to the success of mainland China. However, Mr. Yam dismissed these concerns, asserting that Hong Kong's unique circumstances necessitate a different approach.
"In times of economic downturns, when instability is rampant, it is precisely the peg that helps to restore confidence," Mr. Yam replied. "Rather than impeding our autonomy, the peg ensures certainty and attracts foreign investment, providing us with a competitive edge over other financial centers."
As Hong Kong has grappled with widespread protests and political unrest in recent years, some have questioned the long-term feasibility of the currency link. However, Mr. Yam stood firm in his belief that the peg will endure despite political change.
"The currency peg is not an ideology or a political statement," said Mr. Yam. "It is a pragmatic measure that transcends politics. Hong Kong's financial stability is instrumental in maintaining its status as an international financial hub, and the currency peg is an irreplaceable component of that stability."
While many experts and academics have called for a review of the peg's merits, Mr. Yam remains confident that it will stand the test of time. "The peg has overcome numerous challenges throughout its history, and I have no doubt it will continue to do so," he stated.
As Hong Kong faces a pivotal moment in its relationship with China, the future of the currency peg remains uncertain. However, the resolute defense by its chief architect, Mr. Yam, may provide the peg with newfound support and legitimacy as the city navigates its path forward.
