Harvard economist warns uncertainty could compromise Hong Kong's leading position as world's most competitive economy behind Singapore.
Hong Kong has long prided itself on its status as the world's most competitive economy, second only to Singapore. However, a prominent economist from Harvard University has recently issued a stark warning that this accolade could be under threat due to the rising uncertainty plaguing the city.
Professor Jonathan Chan, known for his expertise in economic competitiveness, has raised concerns about the mounting uncertainties surrounding Hong Kong's future. The ongoing pro-democracy protests, which have disrupted the city for over a year, alongside uncertainties stemming from the U.S.-China trade war, have cast doubt on Hong Kong's ability to maintain its competitiveness in the global economy.
Professor Chan, who has been closely monitoring the situation, stated that the protests have significantly disrupted the local business environment with frequent closures, transportation disruptions, and a decrease in consumer confidence. Business sectors such as tourism, retail, and hospitality have been hit hard, impacting local businesses as well as large multinational corporations.
Furthermore, the prolonged protests have raised doubts about Hong Kong's standing as a leading financial hub. Over the years, the city has attracted investors and businesses due to its robust legal framework, transparent governance, and excellent connectivity to global markets. However, the ongoing unrest has raised concerns about political stability and the future of the "one country, two systems" arrangement between Hong Kong and China.
The trade tensions between the United States and China, which have simmered for years, have also added to the uncertainties surrounding Hong Kong's competitiveness. The city has traditionally served as a vital gateway for foreign businesses aiming to tap into the vast Chinese market. However, the escalating trade war has led some companies to explore alternative business destinations, including Singapore.
Singapore, Hong Kong's main competitor in terms of economic competitiveness, has been actively promoting itself as a reliable and stable business hub. With its efficient infrastructure, low corporate tax rates, and investor-friendly policies, the city-state has attracted numerous businesses looking to hedge against uncertainties in the region.
Echoing these concerns, local business leaders have also expressed worries about the impact on Hong Kong's leading position. Lydia Kwok, the CEO of a Hong Kong-based conglomerate, stated that the uncertain environment has made it increasingly difficult to attract overseas companies to set up regional headquarters in the city.
Professor Chan believes that if these uncertainties persist, they could fundamentally alter the perception of Hong Kong's appeal, thus compromising its competitiveness in the global economy. He emphasizes the importance of swift and effective responses from both the Hong Kong government and Beijing to address the concerns raised by the business community.
As the Harvard economist warns of the potential consequences, Hong Kong finds itself at a crossroads. In order to preserve its status as a global economic powerhouse, the city must make concerted efforts to restore stability and address the concerns of businesses both local and international. Failure to do so could jeopardize its leading position, with Singapore ready to seize the opportunity to surpass its regional rival.
