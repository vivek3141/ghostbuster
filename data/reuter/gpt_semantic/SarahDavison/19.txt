Hong Kong Business Groups Defend China's Most Favoured Nation Trading Status Amid U.S. Controversy
HONG KONG - Amidst rising tensions between the United States and China, Hong Kong's business groups have staunchly defended China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a stable and mutual trading relationship between the two economic powerhouses.
The MFN status, granted to China by the United States in 1979, allows the country to enjoy the same favorable trade terms as other nations. However, in recent years, the relationship between the two countries has frayed over a myriad of issues, from trade imbalances to intellectual property theft and concerns regarding human rights violations.
The recent controversy surrounding the Hong Kong Security Law has also strained relations between the United States and China, leading to calls in Washington to reconsider China's MFN trading status. Critics argue that the imposition of the controversial law infringes upon the freedoms and autonomy of Hong Kong residents, thereby violating the international agreement under which Hong Kong was returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
In response to these concerns, several prominent business groups in Hong Kong have come forward to defend China's MFN status, arguing that any disruptions to the trade relationship would have far-reaching adverse effects on global commerce. These groups, representing a wide range of industries including finance, commerce, and logistics, believe that both the United States and China benefit from the existing trade arrangement.
Speaking on behalf of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC), the group's Chairman, Aron Harilela, stated, “Hong Kong has always been a strong advocate of free trade, and we firmly believe that maintaining China's Most Favoured Nation status is in the best interest of Hong Kong, the United States, and the global economy as a whole. Unilateral actions to unwind this long-standing agreement would have detrimental consequences on businesses and consumers alike.”
Similarly, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), a statutory body dedicated to promoting Hong Kong's economic development through trade, has also expressed its support for China's MFN status. HKTDC Executive Director, Margaret Fong, emphasized that Hong Kong's status as an international trade and finance hub relies heavily on the stability of regional and global trade relationships.
Fong further argued, “Hong Kong, as a separate customs territory, plays a crucial role as an intermediary between China and the rest of the world. Any disruptions in the trade relationship between China and the United States, such as the removal of China's MFN status, would have cascading effects on Hong Kong's economy and the broader global trading system.”
These sentiments were echoed by the Asia World Trade Association, a Hong Kong-based organization representing a broad range of businesses across the region. The Association's Chairman, Louis Tse, emphasized the need for continued engagement and dialogue between the United States and China. He noted, “While it is important to address areas of concern, we believe that working towards constructive solutions is far more beneficial than taking actions that may heighten tensions and jeopardize the progress made in our trading relationship over the years.”
As tensions continue to escalate between the United States and China, the defense of China's MFN trading status by Hong Kong business groups underscores the significance of stable and mutually beneficial trade relationships. With global trade already facing immense challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining open channels of communication and cooperation becomes even more critical for the recovery of economies worldwide.
