Canadian Consumers Set to Be Scrooge Again This Holiday Season, Survey Shows
TORONTO â€” As the holiday season approaches, a new survey suggests that Canadian consumers are bracing themselves to tighten their wallets once again. The survey, conducted by a leading market research firm, indicates that a vast majority of Canadians plan to be more cautious with their spending this year, mirroring the trends witnessed during the previous holiday season.
The study, which surveyed over 5,000 adults across the country, found that nearly 80% of respondents have intentions to spend less on gifts and holiday festivities in 2021. This data comes as no surprise, as the harsh economic consequences of the ongoing pandemic continue to affect Canadians' financial stability.
The study also revealed that over 50% of respondents cited concerns over rising inflation rates, unemployment, and the escalating cost of living as key reasons for adopting a more frugal approach this holiday season. The persisting uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and potential future lockdown measures were also mentioned as factors that could hamper spending.
Experts believe that these widespread concerns are impacting consumer confidence and willingness to splurge, despite the recent rebound in several sectors of the Canadian economy. While the nation's finances have improved, the lasting effects of the pandemic still weigh heavily on citizens' minds, causing them to prioritize saving over spending.
The survey findings may pose a challenge for retailers and businesses that rely heavily on holiday sales to bolster their yearly revenue. Many stores are already accustomed to scaling back their expectations, implementing discounts, and adjusting inventory orders to align with changing consumer behavior. This year, however, they may need to brace themselves for an even larger drop in revenue.
As Canadian consumers gear up to be Scrooge once again this holiday season, experts predict that online shopping will surge as people prefer to shop from the safety of their homes. Retailers that are well-prepared to cater to the evolving preferences, such as offering efficient delivery options and a seamless online shopping experience, may have a competitive advantage in attracting consumers.
Regardless of the potential impact on the economy, the survey results serve as a reminder of the long-lasting impacts of the pandemic. Canadian consumers' conservative mindset persists, emphasizing the importance of financial stability over lavish celebrations this holiday season.
