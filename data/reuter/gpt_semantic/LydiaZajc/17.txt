Canadian Shoppers Turning to the Internet for Holiday Gifts, Survey Finds
In a transformative shift accelerated by the ongoing global pandemic, Canadians are increasingly turning to the internet for their holiday shopping needs. A recent survey by a leading market research firm revealed that this year, a staggering 80% of Canadians plan to do at least some of their holiday shopping online. This trend marks a significant departure from traditional brick-and-mortar shopping habits that have long defined the holiday season.
The survey, which polled over 2,000 Canadian adults, found that the convenience and safety afforded by online shopping were major factors driving this shift. With COVID-19 cases continuing to rise in several Canadian provinces, the desire to avoid crowded malls and stores topped the list of reasons cited by respondents. In addition, the ease of comparing prices, accessing a wider range of products, and the convenience of doorstep delivery were all highlighted as key advantages offered by online retailers.
The Canadian e-commerce sector has responded to this influx of online shoppers, particularly during the holiday season. Major retailers have invested heavily in bolstering their online platforms and have ramped up their digital marketing efforts. Online marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, and Walmart have experienced unprecedented growth in Canada, attracting both local and international sellers.
While traditional retailers are grappling with declining foot traffic, many have launched their own e-commerce websites or partnered with delivery services to remain competitive. Some smaller independent businesses have also transitioned online, leveraging social media platforms to reach a broader audience.
However, this shift towards online shopping is not without challenges. The survey revealed concerns around security and privacy among Canadian consumers, with 65% expressing worries about potential fraud and data breaches. To address these concerns, e-commerce platforms and retailers have implemented advanced security measures and encryption protocols, reassuring consumers of their commitment to protect personal information.
As the holiday season approaches, Canadian retailers are bracing themselves for an unprecedented surge in online orders. With Black Friday and Cyber Monday just around the corner, experts predict record-breaking online sales. In a year when everything from work to socializing has moved predominantly online, it appears that holiday shopping is no exception.
