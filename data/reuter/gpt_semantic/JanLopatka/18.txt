Czech National Bank Governor Advocates a Slow Approach to the Privatization of Komercni Banka Shares
PRAGUE â€” The Governor of the Czech National Bank, Jiri Rusnok, has cautioned against rushing the privatization of state-owned Komercni Banka shares. Calling for a measured and gradual approach, Rusnok argued that a sudden and extensive sale of shares could disrupt the stability of the country's financial sector.
Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Governor Rusnok emphasized the need for a cautious approach to privatization. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a healthy balance between public and private ownership to ensure the stability and resilience of the banking sector amidst potential economic uncertainties.
Komercni Banka, the largest retail bank in the Czech Republic, is currently nearly 50% owned by the state. The government is planning to offload its shares in the bank to invigorate the country's economy and strengthen market competitiveness. However, Governor Rusnok stressed the importance of managing this process prudently.
"We need to avoid excessive and sudden shifts in ownership, which could create instability in the banking sector," Rusnok stated. "Gradual privatization will not only mitigate risks but also guarantee a more stable future for the Czech Republic's financial system."
Komercni Banka, established in 1990, went through severe restructuring in the 1990s to become a significant player in the banking market. It has been instrumental in supporting the country's economic growth, contributing to the expansion of lending to households and businesses.
Experts in the financial sector have echoed the Governor's concerns. Petra Lunakova, an analyst at Prague-based brokerage J&T Banka, emphasized the need for a strategic and methodical privatization plan.
"Gradual privatization will allow for better market absorption and maintain the bank's reputation," Lunakova explained. "It will also minimize any negative consequences for the country's financial stability."
The potential for market disruption has been highlighted by recent challenges faced by some European countries. In countries such as Hungary, the sudden privatization of state-controlled banks has often resulted in decreased lending capacity and instability in the financial sector.
Governor Rusnok's cautious approach aligns with the recommendations from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has urged the Czech Republic to proceed with prudence to maintain the financial sector's strength and stability.
While Governor Rusnok supports the privatization process, he emphasizes that a slow and measured approach is crucial for a successful outcome. The Czech National Bank aims to cooperate closely with the government to devise a strategy that ensures the optimal balance between public and private ownership of Komercni Banka shares, safeguarding the country's long-term economic prospects.
