Speaking at a press conference in Prague, Governor Rusnok addressed concerns regarding the economic impact of a strong currency on Czech exports. The Czech Republic is highly dependent on its export market, particularly in the automotive and machinery sectors, making up almost 80% of its gross domestic product.
Exporters have been advocating for a currency devaluation, arguing that a weaker Czech crown would enhance their international competitiveness and revive the country's stagnating export growth. Some economists have suggested that a weaker currency could help counteract the sluggish global demand caused by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
However, Governor Rusnok emphasized that maintaining a strong currency is crucial for the stability and long-term sustainability of the Czech economy. He acknowledged the global uncertainties surrounding the pandemic but reiterated his belief in the resilience of the country's export-oriented industries.
"The Czech National Bank remains committed to its current monetary policy framework, which is based on an inflation target and exchange rate stability," Rusnok stated. He further added, "Maintaining a strong currency not only brings price stability but also fosters domestic investments, consumer purchasing power, and reduces the risk of capital flight."
Rusnok's announcement came shortly after the Czech National Bank unexpectedly raised its key interest rate last month, becoming the first European central bank to do so since the pandemic began. The decision was seen as an attempt to curb rising inflationary pressures and maintain confidence in the currency.
However, the governor did acknowledge the challenges faced by exporters and vowed to continue monitoring the situation closely. He assured that the central bank would provide necessary support to affected sectors through targeted monetary and fiscal measures.
The stance taken by Governor Rusnok reflects the Czech National Bank's conviction that a strong currency serves as a sturdy foundation for the Czech economy, ensuring its resilience in the face of external shocks and fostering long-term growth.
