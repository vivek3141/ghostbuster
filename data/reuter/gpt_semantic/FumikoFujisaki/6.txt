The joint venture, named Nippon Life Insurance Philippines, Inc., will be established in collaboration with EastWest Banking Corporation, one of the Philippines' leading universal banks. Through this partnership, Nippon Life Insurance aims to capitalize on the growing demand for life insurance products in the Philippines by leveraging EastWest's extensive distribution network and local expertise. By tapping into this dynamic market, the Japanese insurer hopes to contribute to the financial well-being and protection of Filipinos.
The decision by Nippon Life Insurance to expand its operations into the Philippines highlights the company's long-term growth strategy. With a population of over 110 million people and a rising middle class, the Philippines presents a lucrative market for life insurers. A growing awareness of the need for financial security and life insurance coverage, coupled with an expanding economy, make it an attractive investment opportunity for Nippon Life Insurance.
Commenting on the joint venture, Kazuhide Toda, President of Nippon Life Insurance, expressed his enthusiasm for this milestone move. He stated, "We are thrilled to become the first Japanese insurer to offer life policies abroad, and we believe the Philippines presents a perfect opportunity to expand our presence in Southeast Asia. We are committed to providing financial protection and peace of mind to Filipinos, and we are confident that our collaboration with EastWest Banking Corporation will ensure the success of this endeavor."
Moreover, the establishment of Nippon Life Insurance Philippines, Inc. aligns with the Philippine government's ongoing efforts to boost the insurance sector to better protect its citizens. In recent years, the government has introduced various initiatives to promote financial inclusion and encourage insurance penetration. This joint venture demonstrates the confidence that international insurers have in the Philippines' potential.
For EastWest Banking Corporation, this partnership not only strengthens its product offerings but also enhances the bank's status as a comprehensive financial services provider. It enables the bank to fulfill its commitment to cater to the evolving needs of its customers by offering Nippon Life Insurance's globally renowned life insurance products.
Nippon Life Insurance Philippines, Inc. is set to begin its operations in the second half of 2022, pending regulatory approvals. The joint venture aims to introduce a diverse range of life insurance policies tailored to the local market, encompassing protection, investment, and retirement products. Through its expansion into the Philippines, Nippon Life Insurance is poised to make a meaningful impact on the lives of Filipinos while bolstering its global presence.
