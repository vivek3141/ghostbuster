The British veteran, Tim Henman, who has previously excelled in indoor tournaments, also had a successful start to his campaign. Henman played against the determined Serbian, Boris Djokovic, who pushed him to his limits in an exhilarating three-set match. Henman's resilience and experience eventually paved the way for his victory, with the British tennis star securing the win in a decisive tiebreak.
With his trademark serve-and-volley tactics, Henman mesmerized the crowd with his deft touches at the net and remarkable court coverage.
