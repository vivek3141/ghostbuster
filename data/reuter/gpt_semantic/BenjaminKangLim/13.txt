China Demands That the US Cancel Plans to Sell Weapons to Taiwan, Ratcheting Up Tensions in the Asia-Pacific Region
BEIJING — In a move that has the potential to escalate tensions in the already fraught relationship between the United States and China, the Chinese government has demanded that the US immediately cancel its plans to sell advanced weapons to Taiwan, which it considers a wayward province under its sovereignty. The sale, proposed by the US State Department, includes missiles, anti-ship systems, and other military equipment worth an estimated $2.5 billion.
China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, reinforced Beijing’s position during a recent press conference, stating, “The Chinese government resolutely opposes any form of official exchanges between the US and Taiwan, as well as any arms sales to Taiwan. This action by the US severely violates the principles of the One China policy and will undermine China's national security.”
The proposed sale comes at a time of heightened tensions between Beijing and Taipei. China has long been irked by Washington's support for Taiwan, an independently ruled democratic island that it considers part of its territory, and has been using increasingly assertive rhetoric and actions to assert its sovereignty over the self-governed island.
Taiwanese Defense Minister, Chiu Kuo-cheng, acknowledged the importance of the proposed arms deal, emphasizing that it is essential for maintaining peace and stability in the region. He also expressed gratitude towards the US for its continuous support in helping bolster Taiwan’s defensive capabilities against China.
However, the Chinese government argues that the proposed weapons sale runs counter to the principles of the Three Joint Communiqués, which paved the way for the establishment of diplomatic ties between the United States and the People's Republic of China (PRC). The communiqués, signed in 1972, 1979, and 1982 respectively, stress that the US will gradually reduce arms sales to Taiwan, eventually leading to complete cessation.
The US, on the other hand, defends its decision to sell arms to Taiwan as part of its commitment to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the Asia-Pacific region. President Joe Biden’s administration, while not explicitly confirming the sale, has stated its intention to continue providing Taiwan with defensive weapons to help it strengthen its security.
Analysts suggest that the proposed arms sale could further strain US-China relations, which are already tense due to issues such as trade disputes, human rights concerns, and the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The sale is likely to be seen by Beijing as a direct challenge to its sovereignty claims and could provoke retaliatory measures from China.
China has frequently used economic coercion against countries that engage in actions it perceives as threatening its core interests. In the past, it has levied economic sanctions on firms deemed to have violated its One China policy, such as in the case of US companies selling military equipment to Taiwan. Whether this proposed sale will result in similar retaliatory actions remains to be seen.
Amid this escalating situation, a test of President Biden’s new approach towards China may be imminent. His administration has called for a more coordinated and multilateral response to address Beijing's assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region.
The outcome of the proposed arms sale to Taiwan will not only have significant implications for US-China relations but also for peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region as a whole. With tensions continuing to rise, the world is closely watching how both China and the United States will navigate this precarious situation.
