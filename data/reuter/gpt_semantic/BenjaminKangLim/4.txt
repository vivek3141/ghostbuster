Jiang Zemin Making All the Right Moves to Retain Power in Post-Deng Era Say Analysts
 
 
BEIJING — Jiang Zemin, the President of the People's Republic of China, is defying expectations and solidifying his grip on power in the post-Deng Xiaoping era, according to political analysts here. As the first leader to transition from a collective leadership model since the days of Chairman Mao, Jiang's maneuvers are seen as transformative, consolidating power in a way that could shape China for years to come.
 
Jiang, 70, has been able to navigate the intricate Chinese political landscape, keeping his hand firmly on the country's reigns, analysts say. His ability to maintain equilibrium between opposed factions and interests within the Communist Party has allowed him to stay in power for almost a decade, long surpassing the initial skepticism surrounding his ascension.
 
"Jiang Zemin is the master of balancing various factions and ensuring his own position," said Li Xiaoming, a political analyst at the China Policy Foundation. "He has been able to keep the party unified while making incremental gains to strengthen his own authority."
 
Throughout his tenure, Jiang has prioritized economic growth and modernization, allowing China to emerge as the world's manufacturing juggernaut. This focus on economic development has boosted his credibility and support among both conservative and progressive factions within the party.
 
In addition, Jiang has been adept at introducing limited political reforms, primarily aimed at soliciting feedback and participation from different stakeholders while avoiding any significant power-sharing arrangements. Experts see this approach as Jiang's way of placating calls for political liberalization without threatening his own authority.
 
His most recent move to retain power was the promotion of his protégé and current Vice President, Hu Jintao, to a key post in the Central Secretariat. This strategic promotion is seen by analysts as Jiang's way of ensuring a smooth transition of power once he steps down, solidifying his influence beyond his presidency.
 
"Jiang's elevation of Hu Jintao sends a strong message to the party and his rivals that he intends to wield significant power even after leaving office," said Wu Xia, a political scientist at Peking University. "This move secures Jiang's political legacy and ensures the preservation of his policies."
 
Despite critics voicing concerns over an arguably repressive crackdown on dissent and tightening control over the media, analysts insist that Jiang's political maneuvering has been vital in maintaining social cohesion and political stability in China. While there are growing calls for political liberalization from some intellectuals and activists, many Chinese citizens see the current system as the source of China's rapid rise and are hesitant to disrupt the status quo.
 
"Jiang's ability to keep the country on a steady economic trajectory and maintain social order is what the majority of Chinese citizens value," explained Li Xiaoming. "There is a widespread belief that political stability is the prerequisite for China's continued economic growth and social progress."
 
Jiang's skillful navigation of Chinese politics has allowed him to outmaneuver potential rivals, many of whom initially dismissed him as a transitional leader. With his pragmatic, nuanced approach, Jiang has successfully positioned himself as the influential figurehead of the Chinese Communist Party, inspiring respect from both the party itself and the Chinese public.
 
As he approaches the end of his second term, Jiang Zemin's hold on power appears stronger than ever. His ability to balance competing factions, maintain economic growth, and introduce limited political reforms has cemented his legacy as a transformative leader during the post-Deng era. Whether his influence continues beyond his presidency remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Jiang's political prowess will have a lasting impact on China's political landscape.
