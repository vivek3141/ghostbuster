China Slams Taiwan for Failing to Crack Down on New Independence Party
By ERIC WONG
BEIJING â€” China, in a strong rebuke, criticized Taiwan on Tuesday for its failure to take decisive action against the recently formed New Independence Party, calling it a threat to cross-strait stability.
In a press conference held at the State Council Information Office, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian expressed deep concern over the growth of the New Independence Party and accused Taiwan's government of "turning a blind eye" to a party that promotes separatism.
The New Independence Party was established last month with the goal of achieving full independence from mainland China. Led by prominent Taiwanese independence advocate Chen Wei-tung, the party has gained significant attention and support among Taiwan's younger generation, many of whom distrust mainland China.
"Taiwan's inability or unwillingness to suppress these radical elements only serves to undermine cross-strait stability and to further damage the already-complicated relationship between the two sides," Spokesperson Zhao said.
The party's formation follows a series of increased tensions between Beijing and Taipei. China has long considered Taiwan a part of its territory and has not renounced the use of force to bring about reunification. Although Taiwan has operated as a self-governing entity since 1949, the question of its political status remains a contentious issue.
Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen's pro-independence stance and her refusal to acknowledge the "One China" principle have further strained relations between the two sides. China has intensified diplomatic, military, and economic pressure on Taiwan, reducing international space for the island nation and eroding its sovereignty.
The Chinese government's response to the New Independence Party's emergence reflects its zero-tolerance policy towards any form of separatism. Beijing fears that independence movements in Taiwan could set a dangerous precedent for other regions with challenges against Chinese sovereignty, such as Tibet and Xinjiang.
However, critics argue that China's hardline stance is an infringement on Taiwan's democracy. Academics, rights groups, and foreign governments have repeatedly urged China to respect the will of the Taiwanese people and to engage in peaceful dialogue to resolve the delicate issue.
"The emergence of the New Independence Party is a symptom of the deep-seated frustrations felt by many young Taiwanese who feel excluded from enacting and shaping the island's future," said Terry Chang, a professor of international relations at the University of Taipei. "China's heavy-handed tactics only escalate tensions and fail to address the root causes of this growing sentiment in Taiwan."
The New Independence Party, while still small in size, presents a challenge to President Tsai's ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which has taken a cautious approach towards the issue of independence. Taiwan's government finds itself in a difficult position, torn between the desire to protect national security interests and the need to appease a population that is increasingly demanding political autonomy.
Political analysts suggest that Beijing's increasing scrutiny over the New Independence Party may further push young Taiwanese towards a more radical stance on independence. The Chinese government's stance on the matter could inadvertently fuel support for the party and contribute to a vicious cycle of mistrust and animosity between the two sides.
As tensions persist, the path towards peaceful resolution seems obscured. The responsibility now falls on both sides to engage in constructive dialogue and explore compromises that protect the interests of all parties involved. Failure to do so risks further deterioration in cross-strait relations and the potential for increased instability in the region.
