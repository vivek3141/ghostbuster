The strategic move comes as part of the company's commitment to advancing ethical and environmentally friendly technologies globally.
With a surge in demand for sustainable products and services worldwide, Ethical Holdings aims to capitalize on the growing opportunity in the United States. The company plans to channel its increased R&D budget towards developing innovative solutions to address pressing environmental challenges, such as climate change and waste management.
Ethical Holdings' decision to target the US market follows a series of successful ventures across Europe and Asia, where the company has spearheaded groundbreaking sustainable projects. Renowned for its expertise in solar energy, green transportation, and eco-friendly infrastructure, Ethical Holdings is well-positioned to make a significant impact on the US sustainability landscape.
