Analyze and contrast the themes of time, war, and the invisibility of evil in Wis≈Çawa Szymborska's poems "The End and the Beginning" and "Hitler's First Photograph." How do these poems illuminate the duality of time, both as reciting historical patterns with ease and as being completely untelling of events to come? Discuss how the poems explore the reconstruction after war and the innocence of birth, as well as the contrast between the present and the future in regards to Hitler and his potential paths in life.
