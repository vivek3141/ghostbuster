Explain the concept of reliability design and its significance in managing the lifetime of material. What factors contribute to the reliability of a system or component? How does reliability technology impact the cost-effectiveness of a system? Discuss the challenges faced in anticipating and managing failure in lifetime systems. Additionally, examine the role of "margin" reliability and the importance of designing to specific strength margins. What are the potential causes of product failure and how can they be prevented?
