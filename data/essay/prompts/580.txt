Discuss the causes and consequences of social inequality and the challenges faced in addressing it. Examine both macro-scale factors such as income segregation and development prioritization, as well as micro-scale factors such as ambiguous data on the poorest population and inequality in school environments. Additionally, explore the role of institutional discrimination and individual characteristics in perpetuating social inequality. Finally, consider the limitations of historic solutions and the potential for preventative approaches to address social inequality in the long term.
