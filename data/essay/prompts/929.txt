Analyze the flaws in the arguments presented in the article "The image of God" by Genesis File, which seeks to disprove Darwin's theory of evolution and prove the existence of external intelligence in the creation of life on earth. Using evidence-based science, critique the article's claims regarding the scarcity of transitional forms in the fossil record and the lack of observed mutations into other species. Consider the factors and conditions that may have influenced evolutionary changes over time. In your conclusion, summarize the deficiencies in the evidence presented and provide recommendations for improving the arguments against evolution.
