In an essay, analyze the current wealth distribution patterns in the U.S. and discuss the underpayment of registered nurses and the overpayment of National Football League (NFL) players. Use utilitarian ethics as a framework to justify the selection of these examples and argue why compensation should align with the degree of social importance. Evaluate possible strategies for correcting this injustice, such as limiting NFL players' wages, imposing profit use rules on sports entities, or petitioning for legislative action to increase minimum wages for RNs.
