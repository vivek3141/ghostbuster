Discuss Rousseau's concept of self-love and its two manifestations (amour de soi-mÃªme and amour-propre). Explain how these two forms of self-love differ in nature, their effects on societal interactions, and their role in perpetuating inequalities in various aspects of life. Use examples from Rousseau's writings and apply these concepts to analyze the portrayal of a totalitarian society in Orwell's novel 1984.
