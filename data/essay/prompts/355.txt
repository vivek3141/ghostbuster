change through short-term wins. This means identifying specific goals and milestones that can be achieved relatively quickly to demonstrate the benefits of the changes. This could involve securing a temporary increase in medical supply inventory or successfully implementing a new forecasting system for supply needs.
 7. Building on these short-term wins, it is important to continue to push for change and not to become complacent. This requires maintaining momentum and keeping the sense of urgency alive among supporters. It may involve celebrating successes and recognizing the efforts of those involved in implementing the changes.
 8. Finally, the last step in Kotterâ€™s framework is to embed the changes into the organizational culture. This means integrating the new practices and processes into the daily operations of the healthcare system to ensure long-term sustainability. It may involve updating policies and procedures, providing ongoing training and education, and continually monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the changes.
In conclusion, the shortage of medical supplies in the outpatient surgical setting is a significant problem that requires a change in the healthcare system. Using John Kotter's eight-step framework for leading change, nurses and healthcare professionals can work together to create a sense of urgency, build a coalition, develop a vision and strategy, communicate the vision, stimulate action, achieve short-term wins, maintain momentum, and embed the changes into the organizational culture. By following this framework, positive results can be achieved and the shortage of medical supplies can be effectively addressed.
