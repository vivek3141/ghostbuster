Explore the role of expressionism in art during the 19th and early 20th centuries, focusing on how artists conveyed intense emotions and departed from representing reality. Analyze specific artworks, such as Delacroix's The Lion Hunt, Munch's The Scream, Lovis Corinth's Nude Girl, and Ludwing Kirchner's Seated Girl, to understand the extent to which artists conveyed emotions. Additionally, discuss the impact of the industrial revolution and religion on sculptures, using examples like Vasily Kandinsky's Composition VII and August Macke's Great Zoological Garden. Finally, examine the role of sculptures, specifically Wilhelm Lehmbruck's Kneeling Woman, in conveying themes of melancholy and loss in women's relationships.
