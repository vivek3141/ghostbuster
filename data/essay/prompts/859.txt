In light of California's recent prison reform bill to reduce the number of prisons, this essay explores the effectiveness of the Realignment as a remedy for prison overcrowding. Discussing the humanitarian implications, consequences, and access to justice, the essay aims to address the gaps in existing research by examining the conditions of detention rather than just the number of prisoners. Considering the findings that previous scholars have discovered, analyze whether the reduction of prisons in other regions with overcrowding issues would be a viable solution.
