Discuss the potential therapeutic applications of neural stem cells for slowing or halting the aging process in the brain. Include an analysis of the complexity and limited capacity for healing and regeneration of brain tissue, as well as an assessment of how neural stem cells replace and differentiate into neurons and other cells of the brain. In your essay, evaluate the literature that explores the regulation and differentiation of neural stem cells, focusing on the ventricular-subventricular zone and subgranular zone. Additionally, discuss different therapeutic approaches and their potential for rejuvenation. Finally, provide a comprehensive discussion on the topic, drawing conclusions based on the research findings.
