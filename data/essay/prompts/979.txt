Discuss the relationship between the two-nucleotide code and the evolution of the current triplet genetic code, and explain the implications for the number of amino acids in ancient proteins. Furthermore, explore the concept of degeneracy in the genetic code and how it supports the theory of a two-nucleotide code in primitive proteins. Finally, analyze the impact of G + C content on DNA stability and its significance in polymerase chain reactions.
