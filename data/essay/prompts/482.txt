To what extent should a company be held responsible for injuries sustained by skiers on their slopes? Consider the case of Mr. Craig and Mr. Alex, who were injured while skiing on a slope that was supposed to be closed. Discuss the actions of the company's workers and their role in creating risks for the skiers. Analyze the responsibility of the company, the skiers themselves, and the individuals who sent Mr. Alex to the untested slope without an instructor. Consider the severity of Mr. Alex's injuries, the length of his recovery period, and the need for compensation. In your response, also consider the nature of skiing as a traumatic sport and the potential risks that skiers should be aware of.
