1. What are the major causes of intraoperative hypotension and how do they affect blood pressure at the cellular/receptor level?
2. How does intraoperative hypotension contribute to postoperative complications and increased rates of mortality following non-cardiac surgery?
3. What are the risk factors associated with intraoperative hypotension and how do they impact the incidence of adverse postoperative outcomes?
4. What is the relationship between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intraoperative hypotension, and how does even short periods of decreased MAP impact patient outcomes?
5. What is the incidence of intraoperative hypotension and its connection to mortality rates, acute kidney injury, and myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery?
6. What is the impact of anesthetic medication on the pathophysiology of intraoperative hypotension and what further research is needed on its treatment and perioperative management?
7. How does advanced age, history of hypotensive episodes, emergency surgery, and vulnerability to tissue ischemia contribute to the development of intraoperative hypotension and its associated complications?
8. How can healthcare professionals better manage and prevent intraoperative hypotension in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia?
