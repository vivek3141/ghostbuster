Discuss the role of epigenetics in understanding an individual's propensity to develop a specific health condition, using type 2 diabetes as an example. Explore the impact of environmental and behavioral factors on gene expression, and discuss the potential for both increasing and reducing disease risk through epigenetic modifications. Additionally, consider the influence of social determinants of health on epigenetics and the importance of considering family history when assessing disease risk.
