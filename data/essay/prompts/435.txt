Discuss the impact of colonial conquest on the roles and conditions of native and African women in the Americas during the 17th century. How did the invasion and establishment of European colonial societies affect the social and economic order of indigenous tribes? What were the experiences of native women in terms of labor, trade, and conversion to Christianity? Additionally, how did the role of African women in societies such as the Fetu and Bakongo tribes differ from that of native women? What social hierarchies and norms shaped their roles, and how did slave status impact their autonomy and rights? Finally, examine the story of queen Njinga and her resistance against the Portuguese in Kongo.
