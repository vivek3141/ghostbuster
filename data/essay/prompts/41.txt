Analyze the concept of social capital and its significance in democratic societies, as discussed by Robert Putnam in his book "Bowling Alone". Discuss the causes and consequences of the decline in social capital in the United States since the mid-to-late-1960s, and explore potential solutions for re-establishing social capital in contemporary society. Consider the distinction between bridging and bonding social capital and the potential limitations or risks associated with the development of social capital.
