and depth, and is divisible (Thibaut, 2018). Descartes argues that the mind and body are fundamentally different substances, with the mind being a non-extended thinking substance and the body being an extended material substance.

Consider the concepts of clarity and distinctness, the role of God in guaranteeing truth, and the nature of substances in Descartes' philosophy.
