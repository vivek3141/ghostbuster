Write an essay analyzing the use of propaganda in the article "Propaganda: How Not to Be Bamboozled" by Donna Woodfolk Cross. Consider the author's argument that propaganda is neither good nor bad and explore the examples she uses to illustrate different fallacies and demagoguery techniques. Further, discuss the implementation of an association fallacy in the article and how it subtly sways the reader. Additionally, analyze the author's choice to predominantly use right-wing talking points as examples, and examine the implications of this lack of representation for opposing viewpoints. Consider the irony of the article being a tool for propaganda despite its intention to expose propaganda.
