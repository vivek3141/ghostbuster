Local governments have several options for raising revenue to fund their public services and operations. The main methods include property taxes, income taxes, sales taxes, user fees, and business taxes. However, not all of these are used in the UK, and some are more democratic than others. 

The current primary method of local taxation in the UK is the Council Tax, a tax on residential property. Households pay a tax based on the assessed value of the property they live in. While relatively simple to administer, the Council Tax is regressive since lower-income households spend a higher proportion of their income on housing. It also does not account for the ability to pay. However, the Council Tax gives local governments a stable and predictable source of funding that is tied to the local area.

A more controversial method previously used in the UK was the Community Charge, more commonly known as the "poll tax." This was a flat tax charged to adults, regardless of income or property ownership. The Community Charge was extremely unpopular because it was seen as unfair. It eventually led to protests and riots and was abolished in the early 1990s. From a democratic perspective, a flat tax ignores the principle of ability to pay and places a higher burden on lower-income individuals. The Community Charge showed how an unpopular local tax can threaten social cohesion and trust in government.

In contrast, a local income tax, based on the ability to pay, is seen as fairer by many. Residents pay according to the income they earn in that tax area. However, local income taxes can discourage economic activity and be complex to calculate and collect. If tax rates vary in neighboring areas, it may lead to "tax competition" where people choose where to live and work based primarily on lower taxes rather than on community preference. Income taxes are used in some countries, such as the United States and Canada, but not currently in the UK.

Other options not used in the UK include local sales taxes, business taxes, and user fees. A local sales tax, added to the purchase of goods and services, is a stable source of revenue but can be regressive if applied broadly. Taxes on local businesses, such as property and employment taxes, are tied to the local economy but can discourage business investment. Highly specific user fees, such as for waste collection, are fair but may be difficult to enforce.

In conclusion, while there are many options for funding local government, the most democratic method is one that balances stability, fairness, and the ability to pay. A progressive property tax, with variable rates and exemptions based on income, can achieve this balance better than a flat tax. The Community Charge demonstrated how an unfair flat tax can be unsustainable. Local income and sales taxes, though used elsewhere, risk creating inequities or discouraging economic activity. Overall, the current Council Tax could be improved by varying rates based on ability to pay, making it a fairer and more democratic method of local taxation in the UK.
