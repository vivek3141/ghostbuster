Dispersal strategies in primates refer to the movements of individuals away from their natal social groups to new areas and groups. Different primate species exhibit various dispersal patterns, including female-biased dispersal, male-biased dispersal, and both-sex dispersal. These dispersal strategies have important genetic consequences that shape social dynamics and population structures.

Chimpanzees are one of the few primate species that exhibit female-biased dispersal. Female chimpanzees typically leave their natal groups once they reach sexual maturity and transfer to new groups, whereas most males remain in their natal groups for life. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain female chimpanzee dispersal. The inbreeding avoidance hypothesis suggests that female dispersal reduces the risk of inbreeding with related males in their natal groups. The local resource competition hypothesis proposes that female dispersal mitigates feeding competition between mothers and daughters. The mate choice hypothesis posits that females disperse to find new mating opportunities and genetically dissimilar mates in other groups.

Female chimpanzee dispersal has significant genetic consequences. It increases gene flow between groups and reduces inbreeding, promoting genetic diversity within the population. However, it also breaks up female social bonds and kin associations within groups. Females that transfer to new groups must build new social relationships and alliances, and they lose the benefits of cooperation with their female relatives. Male philopatry, on the other hand, allows close alliances between related males within groups to develop, which benefits male reproductive success and group defense. Overall, female-biased dispersal and male philopatry in chimpanzees generate a population structure with high between-group genetic differentiation but also sufficient within-group genetic diversity.  

In contrast to chimpanzees, most vervet monkey populations exhibit male-biased dispersal where males disperse from their natal groups and females are generally philopatric. Similar hypotheses, such as inbreeding avoidance and mate choice, have been proposed to explain male dispersal in vervets. Male dispersal in vervets also has important consequences on genetics and sociality. It promotes intergroup gene flow and reduces inbreeding by increasing mating between unrelated individuals. However, it disrupts the close social bonds between related males within groups. Male dispersal also leads to stronger social relationships between philopatric females, which benefit female fitness through cooperation in infant care and group defense. The population genetic structure of vervets consequently shows greater between-group differentiation in matrilineal compared to patrilineal relatedness.

Red howler monkeys demonstrate a dispersal strategy where both sexes disperse from their natal groups, known as both-sex or bidirectional dispersal. This dispersal pattern can facilitate intergroup gene flow and inbreeding avoidance. However, it may disrupt kin-based cooperative relationships within groups for both sexes. Both-sex dispersal often leads to a weaker population genetic structure with lower between-group differentiation due to high levels of dispersal and intergroup mating. This dispersal strategy illustrates that primates are diverse in their social and dispersal patterns, which have varying effects on individual fitness, social behavior, and population genetics.  

In summary, primate species exhibit different dispersal strategies, including female-biased, male-biased, and both-sex dispersal, shaped by multiple evolutionary drivers and hypotheses. These dispersal patterns generate diverse consequences on social relationships, inbreeding levels, and population structures across the primate order. Using chimpanzees, vervet monkeys, and red howler monkeys as examples, this essay has discussed how female-biased dispersal, male-biased dispersal, and both-sex dispersal affect primate genetics and sociality at the individual, group, and population levels.
