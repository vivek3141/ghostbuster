Intertextuality refers to the ways in which texts are connected through references and allusions to other texts. Authors often revisit and rework familiar stories, myths, and archetypes by using intertextuality to create intertextual hybrids – new texts that fuse together elements from multiple sources. The story of Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe has been revisited many times through this intertextual process. 

Two notable examples of authors who have reworked the Robinson Crusoe myth through intertextuality are J.M. Coetzee in his 1986 novel Foe and Michael Tournier in his 1967 novel Friday. In Foe, Coetzee reimagines Crusoe’s island and complicates the imperialist and colonialist themes of Defoe’s work. The character of Friday is given a voice and identity beyond that of Crusoe’s “savage” servant. Tournier’s novel focuses on the master-slave power dynamic between Crusoe and Friday, depicting a homoerotic and nearly fetishistic relationship between the two characters. These novels use intertextuality to critique and subvert the messages and themes in Robinson Crusoe.

To “revisit” the myth of Robinson Crusoe through intertextuality in my own work, I envision a short story that fuses elements from Defoe’s novel with Shakespeare’s The Tempest. In my story, Crusoe’s island would become a kind of Prospero’s isle, a place of magic and spirits. Friday’s character would be hybridized with Caliban from The Tempest. The story would deal with themes of imperialism, enslavement, and the relationship between the “civilized” and the “savage.” This fusion of the two myths could create an interesting intertextual work that provides social commentary on colonialism and racism.

In summary, intertextuality provides a means for authors to revisit familiar stories and myths by creating new hybrid texts that build on elements from multiple sources. Revisiting the myth of Robinson Crusoe has allowed authors like Coetzee and Tournier to offer critiques of themes around imperialism and human relationships. By fusing Robinson Crusoe with The Tempest, I could create an intertextual short story dealing with related themes. Intertextuality gives authors an opportunity to revive classic works of fiction and weave them together in new ways.

The essay provides an overview of intertextuality and how authors employ it to revisit existing myths and stories. It gives two examples of novels that have reworked the myth of Robinson Crusoe and describes their themes and critiques. The essay then outlines one way I could use intertextuality to fuse Robinson Crusoe and The Tempest into a hybrid work dealing with similar themes. The conclusion reinforces how intertextuality can be used as a creative tool to build on preexisting stories and revive them for new audiences.
