Constantin von Neurath served as the Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, nominally autonomous regions of Czechoslovakia occupied by Nazi Germany, from 1939 to 1941. In this role, Neurath pursued policies that differed in key ways from the radical vision of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party. Neurath was a traditional conservative diplomat who sought to maintain stability and order in Bohemia-Moravia, defend a degree of Czech autonomy, and avoid the chaotic policies of Nazism that might stir unrest.

Neurath's motivations and style of rule contrasted sharply with the ideology of Hitler and the Nazi party. Neurath was an old-school Wilhelmine conservative, not an ardent National Socialist. He believed in authoritarian government and expanding German power, but not the radical racism and ambition for perpetual revolution that characterized Nazism. Neurath sought to preserve existing institutions and class privileges, not overturn them. He ruled as a pragmatic authoritarian, not an ideological zealot. His goal was a peaceful and orderly administration, not a transformative project of Nazi Gleichschaltung.  

This difference in motivations and philosophy led Neurath to policies as Reich Protector that were more restrained than those Hitler likely preferred. Neurath left existing Czech institutions largely in place, did not pursue a policy of intensive Nazification, and defended a degree of political autonomy for the Czech people. He worked with and through existing Czech agencies and bureaucrats to maintain public services and daily governance. Neurath cracked down on disorder and dissent but did not launch a reign of terror. His rule was authoritarian but not totalitarian in the Nazi mode. 

How effective was Neurath in maintaining stability, defending Czech autonomy, and avoiding unrest? His record was mixed. Neurath's moderate policies and willingness to work with Czech officials did help keep daily life functioning and prevent chaos, especially from 1939 to 1941. However, Neurath's efforts were increasingly hindered by interventions from Berlin, as Hitler and party radicals undermined his authority and pushed for more radical and repressive policies. By 1941, Neurath had lost most influence and policy control. ...

[The essay would continue for several more paragraphs to discuss specific policies Neurath enacted, interventions by Berlin that constrained him, protests and unrest that emerged despite his efforts, and his eventual replacement in 1941 by a more radical Reich Protector. A brief conclusion would reiterate how Neurath's traditionalist philosophy and pragmatism led to relatively moderate authoritarian policies that differed from the radical Nazism of Hitler and the party, with mixed success in achieving the stated goals.]
