Student debt has emerged as a major crisis in recent years, with implications that go far beyond students' financial wellbeing. There is a growing body of research linking high levels of student debt to poor mental health outcomes, including increased stress, anxiety, and depression.  

Several studies have found connections between student debt and decreased psychological health. A 2018 study of over 500 students in Australia found that those with higher debt had significantly higher psychological distress and poorer wellbeing. A study of American medical students found perceived debt, whether actual or anticipated, was associated with higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. The stress of debt may be particularly damaging because it often coincides with other stressful life events like starting college, becoming independent, and planning for one's career. 

Federal policies have exacerbated the student debt crisis and its mental health consequences. Government grants, subsidies, and loan programs aimed to make college accessible have had the unintended effect of encouraging institutions to raise tuition. Students must then borrow more to finance their education, and they struggle to pay off interest rates that sometimes exceed the rate of wage growth. Students today graduate with over $30,000 in debt on average in the U.S., a number that has more than tripled in the past 30 years. High debt levels at graduation can seriously impact students' financial and life choices for decades.

To address this problem, policy and institutional changes are urgently needed. The government should increase need-based grants and subsidies to reduce students' dependence on loans. Interest rates on existing and future student loans should be lowered to make repayment feasible. Loan forgiveness and income-based repayment programs should be expanded to prevent students from being crushed by lifetime debt sentences.  

Colleges and universities must also take responsibility by cutting unnecessary costs and reining in tuition increases. They can reduce non-essential amenities and administrative expenses, invest in mental health resources for students, limit dependence on adjunct faculty, and slow the building of lavish facilities. They should also be transparent about the real costs of attendance so students can make informed choices.

In summary, student debt has become a crisis that is damaging the psychological and financial health of young people. However, this crisis was created through policy choices, not inevitability, and it can be mitigated through policy changes and institutional reforms that make college affordable and debt burdens sustainable. Overall, we must make student wellbeing—not institutional or corporate gains—the priority in higher education.
