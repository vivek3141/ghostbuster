To what extent did the Modernist period in literature see a loss of faith in narrative? Referring to Virginia Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway" and Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" in your answer.

The Modernist period in literature, roughly from the 1910s to 1940s, was marked by a shift away from traditional narrative techniques. The rise of Modernism saw authors move away from logical or chronological stories with a clear beginning, middle and end. Key characteristics of Modernism included the use of stream of consciousness, nonlinear narrative forms, and open-ended or fragmented conclusions, as well as a more cynical and disturbed postwar worldview. 

Two notable examples that demonstrate the Modernist loss of faith in traditional narrative are Virginia Woolf's 1925 novel "Mrs. Dalloway" and Joseph Conrad's 1902 novella "Heart of Darkness." In "Mrs. Dalloway," Woolf employs stream of consciousness and a nonlinear narrative form to explore her characters' inner lives. The story unfolds over the course of a single day in London, but Woolf frequently shifts back and forth in time as she delves into her characters' memories, thoughts and emotions. While certain events like the party Clarissa Dalloway is hosting form a loose narrative structure, the overall effect is a loss of a traditional chronological plot. The open-ended conclusion, with Clarissa's musing on the sky and a homeless old woman, also suggests a move away from narrative closure.

Similarly, in "Heart of Darkness" Conrad adopts a frame narrative structure, with Marlowe's story being told through the perspective of an unnamed narrator. But this frame is loose and fragmentary, allowing for philosophical reflections on imperialism and human nature. The nonlinear voyage into the Congo, which forms the center of the novella, reflects the Modernists' rejection of chronological and logically progressing plots. The work also has an open ending, with Marlowe refusing to reveal Kurtz's last words and the narrator left meditating on the darkness of the human experience.

While both works have elements of a plot and narrative, they subvert many of the traditional narrative techniques that were common before the rise of Modernism. The authors employ innovative forms like stream of consciousness and nonlinear timelines, focusing more on inner psychology and themes than strict chronology or closure. The endings of both texts are open, reflecting uncertainty rather than narrative resolution. Overall, Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway" and Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" demonstrate the loss of faith in conventional narrative that characterized the Modernist period. Both authors moved away from traditional storytelling techniques to craft works that were more experimental, inward-looking and ideologically complex.
