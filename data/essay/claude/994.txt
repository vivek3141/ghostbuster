Distinguishing between voiced and voiceless phonemes in English can be challenging for several reasons. Voiced and voiceless pairs of obstruents, like /b/ and /p/, differ primarily in the vibration of the vocal folds during articulation, but this distinction can be subtle and difficult to perceive. This has led some linguists to propose alternative classification systems that aim to capture more salient acoustic properties.

One difficulty in distinguishing voiced and voiceless obstruents is that the primary acoustic cue, vocal fold vibration, is not always clearly perceived. In casual or fast speech, voicing contrasts can be neutralized or obscured. The voicing distinction is also more difficult to perceive for obstruents in word-final position, where vocal fold vibration ends abruptly. These factors can make it challenging for listeners to reliably determine whether an obstruent is voiced or voiceless based only on the presence or absence of vocal fold vibration. 

Alternative classification systems have thus been proposed that rely on more perceptually salient properties. One system distinguishes “oral” and “glottalic” obstruents, where glottalic obstruents involve a glottal stricture and oral obstruents do not. Another system distinguishes “slack” and “tense” obstruents, where tense obstruents exhibit greater articulatory precision and energy. Under these systems, voiceless obstruents tend to be glottalic and tense, while voiced obstruents tend to be oral and slack, but the classifications capture acoustic properties directly rather than relying on the perception of vocal fold vibration.

Certain articulatory phenomena, like pre-fortis clipping and glottalization, also help signal the voicing distinction. Pre-fortis clipping refers to the shortening of a vowel before a voiceless obstruent. This results in a shorter vowel duration before voiceless obstruents compared to voiced obstruents, which can aid perception. Glottalization refers to the articulation of a voiceless obstruent with creaky or irregular vocal fold vibration. Glottalization is more likely for voiceless obstruents, especially in word-final position, helping to signal the voicing distinction. 

However, pre-fortis clipping and glottalization differ in their application to voiced and voiceless obstruents. Pre-fortis clipping reliably distinguishes following voiceless obstruents, but not all voiced obstruents exhibit longer preceding vowel duration. Glottalization frequently signals word-final voiceless obstruents, but voiced obstruents are rarely glottalized. So while these phenomena can aid in perceiving the voicing distinction, their absence does not necessarily indicate a voiced obstruent.

In summary, distinguishing voiced and voiceless obstruents in English can be difficult due to the subtlety of the primary cue of vocal fold vibration. Alternative classification systems based on more salient properties like glottalization and articulatory precision have thus been proposed. Certain articulatory phenomena, including pre-fortis clipping and glottalization, can also signal the voicing distinction, but they differ in how reliably they indicate voiced versus voiceless obstruents. Perceiving the voicing contrast in English ultimately requires attending to a combination of acoustic cues that, in concert, mark this phonological distinction.
