Esping-Anderson's The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism is a seminal work in comparative welfare state studies that established a typology of welfare regimes based on their degree of decommodification and stratification effects. However, the work has been criticized by feminists for its gender-blindness and failure to incorporate gender regimes and the role of the family into its analysis. While Esping-Anderson's typology holds empirically, it fails to capture the complexity of welfare states' impacts on women's lived experiences. Birgit Pfau-Effinger's work on culture and gender arrangements helps address these deficiencies and provides a more robust theory of welfare regimes that accounts for gender.  

Esping-Anderson's conceptualization of welfare states' origins and development has been critiqued by feminists for ignoring the role of women's movements and gender politics. Esping-Anderson traces the rise of welfare states to class politics and the power resources of leftist political parties. However, feminists argue that women's movements were also instrumental in expanding welfare states, especially in gaining rights and benefits for women like maternal leave, childcare, and healthcare. By overlooking women's agency in welfare state development, Esping-Anderson presents an incomplete historical account that obscures women's interests and needs.

Similarly, Esping-Anderson's concepts of decommodification and stratification have been criticized for their gender blindness. Decommodification refers to the degree to which individuals can opt out of the labor market, but it is a gender-neutral concept that does not reflect women's more precarious relationship to the labor market due to care responsibilities and labor force interruptions. Stratification refers to the welfare state's role in leveling social inequality, yet it fails to account for gender stratification and the "male breadwinner" model embedded in some welfare regimes. Feminists argue these concepts must be rethought to integrate gender by considering things like "defamilialization" and gender equality as measures.  

Most significantly, Esping-Anderson's analysis has been faulted for marginalizing the role of the family. His theory focuses on the relationship between the state and the market, framed around individuals and classes. But for women, the family is also central in mediating their welfare and life chances. Welfare regimes rely on and in turn shape gender regimes - the sets of norms and rules governing gender roles and relations in the family and society. By largely ignoring the family, Esping-Anderson's theory cannot properly assess the impact of welfare states on women's welfare, labor force participation, and dependence on the family.  

While these critiques reveal deficiencies in Esping-Anderson's theoretical framework, his empirical typology of welfare regimes is not wholly invalidated and has been substantiated by subsequent research that incorporates gender. Liberal regimes provide limited decommodification and emphasize the market, conservative regimes uphold traditional gender roles centered on the family, and social democratic regimes aim for gender equality along with decommodification. However, when gender is included, additional types may emerge - for example, a "familialistic" regime based on the family as the primary welfare provider.  

Pfau-Effinger's work helps reconcile Esping-Anderson's typology with feminists' critiques. Her concept of the "gender arrangement" - the links between welfare and gender regimes - provides a more comprehensive framework for analyzing welfare states. The liberal UK and conservative Germany both have low decommodification, but differ in their gender arrangements: the UK has a "market-oriented" arrangement where gender equality and defamilialization are high, while Germany has a "family-oriented" arrangement with more traditional gender roles. This nuanced theory thus preserves Esping-Anderson's insights but provides a gender-sensitive account of how welfare and social policies interact with cultural norms and gender relations in society.  

In sum, while Esping-Anderson established a seminal typology of welfare regimes, his theoretical framework is limited by a gender-blind approach that minimizes the role of women, families, and gender politics. However, his empirical findings can be reconciled with feminist-informed analyses that consider welfare and gender regimes together. Concepts like defamilialization, gender stratification, and gender arrangements address the deficiencies of decommodification and stratification by linking the state-market nexus to gender relations. Pfau-Effinger's work integrating welfare and gender regimes provides a model for how future analyses can build on Esping-Anderson's foundation while overcoming its gender insensitive nature. Overall, feminist critiques enrich rather than wholly undermine Esping-Anderson's welfare regime theory and typology.
