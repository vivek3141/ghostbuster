Plants have evolved three major mechanisms to overcome the low affinity of Rubisco, the enzyme that fixes carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, for CO2. These mechanisms allow plants to adapt to different environmental conditions and concentrations of CO2.

The first mechanism is increased production of Rubisco, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step of CO2 fixation. Having more Rubisco increases the total capacity for CO2 fixation, even if the affinity of each enzyme remains relatively low. This is an effective strategy for plants in high light, open environments where CO2 concentrations are not limiting. Many plants in sunny, open habitats, like grasslands, have evolved a C4 photosynthetic pathway that concentrates CO2 around Rubisco, allowing for more Rubisco with higher rates of photosynthesis.  

The second mechanism is the localization of Rubisco in areas of high CO2 concentration. In many plants, Rubisco is concentrated in bundle sheath cells, which are located close to the stomata and have a high internal CO2 concentration. The high CO2 allows Rubisco to operate at maximum efficiency despite its low affinity. This is an adaptation that is most useful in hot, dry environments where stomata must remain closed for much of the day to conserve water. C4 plants that concentrate CO2 in bundle sheath cells, such as maize and sugarcane, are common in tropical grasslands and savannas.   

The third mechanism is increased affinity of Rubisco for CO2 over oxygen (O2). Rubisco can fix both CO2 and O2, but CO2 fixation leads to productive photosynthesis while O2 fixation leads to photorespiration, which reduces photosynthetic efficiency. Some plants, especially those adapted to cool climates, have evolved forms of Rubisco with higher specificity for CO2 over O2. This allows more productive photosynthesis even at low CO2 concentrations. Plants with these high-specificity Rubiscos, such as certain cabbage, spinach and bean species, are most effective in cool weather when O2 concentrations are higher relative to CO2.

In summary, plants have evolved three mechanisms to adapt to the low affinity of Rubisco for CO2: increased production of Rubisco, localization of Rubisco in areas of high CO2, and increased specificity of Rubisco for CO2 over O2. These mechanisms allow plants to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions with different levels of CO2 availability. Plants can be specialized based on these mechanisms to adapt to sunny vs. shady, hot vs. cool, and dry vs. wet habitats.
