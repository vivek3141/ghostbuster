Presidential Reconstruction, occurring under Presidents Lincoln and Johnson, set out to reintegrate the Southern states after the Civil War while securing freedom and basic legal rights for former slaves. However, Presidential Reconstruction ultimately failed due to lenient policies towards Southern elites, lack of protections for African Americans, and conflicts with Congress over how Reconstruction should proceed. 

President Lincoln took tentative first steps towards Reconstruction during the Civil War. He did not believe the Confederacy had left the Union legally and therefore any Reconstruction policy had to be light-handed. In December 1863, Lincoln issued a presidential proclamation offering amnesty and restoration of property rights (excluding slaves) to any Confederate who swore an oath of allegiance to the Union. Over the next year, Union-controlled Southern territories would draft new constitutions abolishing slavery and be readmitted to the Union. However, Lincoln did little else to protect the rights of freed slaves or remake Southern society. His mild policies aimed to reconcile the Union as quickly as possible.

After Lincoln's assassination, President Andrew Johnson adopted an even more lenient stance towards the South. He granted amnesty and restored political rights to most former Confederates. Like Lincoln, Johnson believed that the Southern states had never left the Union and therefore the federal government had limited authority to impose terms for readmittance. Johnson vetoed efforts to extend legal rights and protections for African Americans and allowed Southern governments to enact “Black Codes” restricting the rights and mobility of freed slaves. 

Johnson’s Reconstruction policies were too lenient towards the Southern elite and did not do enough to protect African Americans, undermining their aims. The old Southern ruling class remained largely in place, with many former Confederate leaders elected to Congress and state legislatures. The Black Codes subjected African Americans to economic, social and political restrictions resembling slavery, with former slaves unable to vote, own land, or move freely in public spaces. Presidential Reconstruction failed to democratize Southern society or meaningfully incorporate African Americans into the polity. 

The Radical Republicans in Congress argued Presidential Reconstruction was too soft on the South and did not guarantee rights or protections for African Americans. They passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Fourteenth Amendment, and Reconstruction Acts placing the Southern states under temporary military rule. The Reconstruction Acts in particular were a direct repudiation of Johnson’s policies, as Congress now asserted authority over the Reconstruction process.

Johnson's stubborn resistance to these Congressional efforts exacerbated the tensions between the executive and legislative branches. His vetoes of the Civil Rights Act and Fourteenth Amendment made African Americans question whether they had gained any meaningful freedom. The impeachment of Johnson by the House of Representatives demonstrated the depths of disagreement over how to reconstruct the Union.

In conclusion, Presidential Reconstruction under Lincoln and Johnson aimed to speedily reintegrate the Southern states into the Union. However, their lenient policies towards former Confederates, failure to protect freed slaves, and conflicts with Congress doomed Reconstruction to fail in its aims to remake the South and secure equal rights. The limits of Presidential authority and the need for a stronger Reconstruction policy became clear, setting the stage for Congressional Reconstruction in the following years.
