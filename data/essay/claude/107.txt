The Annales School of historical thought developed in France in the early 20th century and came to dominate European historiography for much of the century. Founded by Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre in 1929 with the journal Annales d'histoire économique et sociale, the Annales School pioneered an interdisciplinary approach to history that incorporated geography, sociology, economics, and anthropology. The school aimed to study history at long timescales, focusing on social and cultural phenomena like mentalities, social structures, and systems of exchange.

Bloch and Febvre established many of the key principles of the early Annales School. They advocated for a "total history" that examined all aspects of human societies across long durations, not just political or military developments. Bloch in particular emphasized historical geography and believed historians should incorporate spatial and geographical concepts into their analyses. Bloch and Febvre also promoted a comparative approach, studying societies across Europe and the world to identify similarities and differences. However, the Annales School is most associated with Fernand Braudel, who served as editor of the journal from 1956 to 1968 during the "Age of Braudel."

Braudel consolidated the Annales approach but also introduced key changes. Like Bloch and Febvre, he pursued a total history of long durations and promoted interdisciplinarity. However, Braudel devoted more attention to geographic history and emphasized the role of the physical environment in shaping human societies. His magnum opus, The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II, exemplified the Annales interdisciplinary methodology but diverged from Bloch and Febvre in its vast scope and environmental determinism. Braudel also introduced a three-tiered theory of historical time: the quasi-immobile longue durée of geography, the conjunctures of events and cycles, and the événements of traditional political history. This temporal framework reflected Braudel's more systematic theorization of the Annales approach. 

The leadership of Braudel thus both continued and departed from the vision of Bloch and Febvre. All three historians pursued an interdisciplinary, comparative history of long durations, but Braudel's tenure was marked by a turn toward geographic history and environmental determinism not wholly embraced by the founders. Braudel also constructed more systematic theories of historical temporality and interdisciplinarity that built upon the intuitions of Bloch and Febvre. 

In conclusion, the Annales School pioneered new approaches to historical thought that continue to influence historiography today. Under Bloch, Febvre, and especially Braudel, the Annales historians pursued groundbreaking works of historical geography, analyzed social and cultural history at long timescales, and incorporated insights from the social sciences. Although the "Age of Braudel" represented both continuity and change from the ideals of Bloch and Febvre, the Annales School as a whole transformed historical thought through its interdisciplinary methodology, longue durée frameworks, and rejection of traditional political historiography. The Annales School produced a "total history" of people, spaces, and periods outside the bounds of traditional historical inquiry.
