Leopold von Ranke  is often characterized as 'the father of scientific history' due to his rejection of speculative philosophizing in favor of rigorous archival research and objective analysis. However, Ranke's approach was not strictly 'scientific' in the modern sense. While Ranke helped pioneer some hallmarks of modern historical methodology, his philosophy of history retained elements of Romanticism and his Christian faith. Ranke argued for focusing on what "actually happened" through immersion in primary sources, but his belief in divine providence shaping human affairs belied an ultimate subjectivity in his interpretations of historical events. 

Ranke broke from Enlightenment historians by rejecting a priori philosophizing about the overall meaning or purpose of history. He believed historians should not judge the past based on the present's values but understand each period on its own terms. In his formative work The Histories of the Latin and Germanic Nations (1824), Ranke declared: "History has assigned to it the task of judging the past, of instructing the present for the benefit of the ages to come...To history is given the function of judging the past, of instructing the present for the benefit of ages to come...I have the courage to say it: for a higher aim we will abandon tendencies and purposes of this kind." 

To realize this aim of understanding history on its own terms, Ranke pioneered immersion in primary sources and archival research. He aimed to construct histories based not on speculation but on "what actually happened" according to contemporaneous accounts. Ranke traveled extensively to uncover new sources and was an early proponent of archival research and "source criticism"â€”rigorously analyzing sources for accuracy and bias. His method reflected a belief that historical truth could emerge from these sources through objective analysis by the historian.

However, Ranke's philosophy of history was not purely 'scientific' or materialist. He remained convinced that history unfolded according to a divine plan, writing: "There is a higher power, a higher law, which rules over men...This higher power we call Providence. In history as everywhere else, it is the ultimate cause of all that happens." Ranke believed historians could discern "the finger of God" in the unfolding of events. While eschewing speculative philosophizing, Ranke's Christian worldview and belief in providence shaped his interpretations in a way that departs from modern scientific objectivity. 

Ranke's philosophy and methods proved enormously influential, shaping German historicism and modern professional historiography. His emphasis on rigorous sourcing and archival research established foundations of modern historical method. However, later historians built upon and modified Ranke's approach by embracing more materialist philosophies. 

In the United States, Ranke's methods were imported in the 1870s and 1880s but adapted to American Progressive philosophies like pragmatism. Pioneering American historians like Frederick Jackson Turner studied in Germany, absorbing Ranke's emphasis on sources and archives while rejecting notions of providence. Turner articulated a frontier thesis far more materialist than anything Ranke proposed. 

In conclusion, while Ranke pioneered modern standards of historical evidence and archival research, his philosophy retained elements of Romanticism and Christian belief largely eschewed today. Ranke shaped foundations of modern history as a rigorous, evidence-based field, but his work truly epitomized an emerging historicism rather than a strictly "scientific" approach to history in the modern sense. Ranke's philosophy and methodology have proven enormously influential, but historians have built upon, adapted, and departed from them in ways that render the label of Ranke as "the father of scientific history" only partially accurate. Overall, Ranke's pivotal role in establishing history as a source-based field while retaining certain pre-modern philosophies make his relationship to scientific history complex and multifaceted.
