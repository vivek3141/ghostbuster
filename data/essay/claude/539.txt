In his work "The Social Contract," the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau theorizes about the transition from the state of nature to civil society and how it affects mankind. Rousseau believes that in the state of nature, human beings are essentially good and naturally peaceful. However, as humanity moved into a civil state with the development of society, people became more competitive, vain, and selfish. Overall, Rousseau argues that the civil state is an intermediate state between nature and true freedom for humanity. 

According to Rousseau, in the state of nature, human beings are isolated, free, and primarily concerned with self-preservation. They are simple in their pleasures and desires. There is no notion of "good" or "evil" and no morality. Although there is little language or reason in this pre-social state, Rousseau sees it as a time of innocence where people are naturally good and compassionate. They help each other out of empathy and share resources.

However, as societies formed and humanity entered the civil state, this innate goodness started to fade. People began to form relations with one another, develop language and culture, establish property rights, and compete for status. This led to the concepts of "good" and "evil" arising and the need for self-love and vanity. Rousseau argues people in the civil state become selfish, vain, and greedy. Their desires are no longer limited to basic necessities but extend to power, wealth, and fame.

According to Rousseau, the civil state is an imperfect state between nature and true freedom. Although humanity gains reason, morality, and technology in civil society, people lose their natural goodness and compassion. Rousseau believes for humanity to reach its full potential, people must find a way to regain the freedom and equality of the state of nature while maintaining the reason and virtue that come with society. The ideal state is one where the "general will" of citizens is the guiding principle, promoting the common good over self-interest. Only then can humanity achieve true freedom and justice.

In conclusion, Rousseau sees the movement from the state of nature to the civil state as a loss of innate human goodness in favor of vice and corruption. However, he believes humanity can progress toward perfect freedom by cultivating reason and morality while promoting the common welfare of all. The transition affects humans by making them selfish but with the potential for virtue.
