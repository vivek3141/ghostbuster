Aristotle believes that everything has a function or work that it strives to fulfill. For humans, Aristotle argues that our function is to live in accordance with reason, and to achieve excellence in intellectual contemplation. Living in accordance with reason entails cultivating virtue and wisdom which allows one to flourish. This conception of human function is central to Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, where he explores how one can achieve eudaimonia, or a life of well-being and happiness.  

For Aristotle, reason is the highest capacity of humans. When we exercise reason, we are fulfilling our human function. Reason allows us to deliberate about actions, determine virtue, and pursue truths about ethics and knowledge. The highest actualization of reason is philosophical contemplation - the active exercise of reason for its own sake. Aristotle believes contemplation is the most pleasant and self-sufficient activity, and the highest virtue. 

Reason also allows us to determine ethics and how to cultivate virtue. For Aristotle, ethics is inextricably tied to determining the good life for humans. He argues that virtue lies at the mean between extremes of excess and deficiency. By using prudence and reason, we can determine the virtuous mean in each situation. The cultivation of virtue through habit and choice allows us to fulfill our function. Virtue aims at excellence, not just for its own sake but also for living well.

Some objections can be raised against Aristotle's conception of a human function. One could argue that humans have a diversity of functions and there is no single thing that humankind strives for. Humans could have functions as social beings, as workers and creators, as well as rational beings. Aristotle would counter that while humans engage in a multiplicity of activities, reason is the highest capacity that guides all the others. Reason determines how we carry out all other functions virtuously. 

Another objection is that Aristotle's conception of human function excludes some humans who cannot reason or engage in contemplation. Aristotle acknowledges this but would argue that his theory applies to humans as a whole, not every single individual. He believes there is a norm from which some deviate due to "bad luck". His theory aims at determining the most complete good for the ideal case, while allowing exceptions do exist.

In conclusion, Aristotle's view that the human function is to live according to reason shapes his entire ethical theory. Reason allows us to deliberate about actions, determine virtue, and pursue philosophical truths. The cultivation of virtue and wisdom are necessary for excellence in reason, which allows us to achieve eudaimonia - the ultimate end and good for humans. While some argue against a single human function, Aristotle believes reason can determine how we ought to live and guide other human pursuits. His conception of human purpose has had a profound and lasting influence on Western ethical thought.
