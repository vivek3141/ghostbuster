The case concerning the retention of fingerprints, DNA samples and DNA profiles under s64(1A) of the Police and Criminal Evidence (PACE) Act 1984 focused on whether such retention was compatible with Articles 8 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The main issue was whether the indefinite retention of such private information violated the right to respect for private and family life under Article 8, especially for individuals who were subsequently acquitted.

The majority of the court found that the retention engaged Article 8(1) as it concerned private information about one's identity. However, they argued that such retention pursued the legitimate aims of "the detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences" under Article 8(2). They cited the utility of fingerprints and DNA in identifying suspects, securing convictions and exonerating the innocent. As long as sufficient safeguards were in place to ensure that the materials were only used for legal and policing purposes, the benefits outweighed the costs to privacy. 

The majority rejected that there was discrimination contrary to Article 14. They argued that the retention policy applied equally to all those arrested for recordable offences, regardless of outcome. The acquitted were not singled out due to their status, and retention served the purpose of an accurate and up-to-date national DNA database. There were lawful and objective justifications for any difference in treatment between convicted and non-convicted individuals.

In conclusion, the majority held that s64(1A) was compatible with the Convention as it struck a fair balance between private and public interests. In contrast, the dissenting opinion argued that its compatibility was not justified. They reasoned that an indefinite policy was disproportionate and not "in accordance with the law". Its application to the acquitted could not be reasonably justified and thus amounted to discrimination. A fair balance would be a time-limited retention for non-intimate samples only.

In summary, the central issue was whether the indefinite retention of fingerprints, DNA samples and profiles, especially of non-convicted persons, was proportionate under Article 8 and non-discriminatory under Article 14. The majority decision focused on the utility of DNA in law enforcement to justify compatibility, while the dissent argued that the policy went further than necessary and reasonable to achieve its aims. Overall, the case reflected the difficulties in balancing privacy rights with public interests like security and crime prevention.
