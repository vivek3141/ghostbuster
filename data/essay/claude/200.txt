The formation of the vertebrate limb involves the coordinated activity of several signaling centers and proteins to establish the three axes: the proximal-distal axis, anterior-posterior axis, and dorsal-ventral axis. These signaling centers communicate with each other to create the proper spatial organization of the limb.

The proximal-distal axis is established early in development by the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), a thickened epithelium located at the distal tip of the limb bud. The AER secretes fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) that stimulate the proliferation of cells in the underlying mesoderm, causing the limb to grow outward from the body. At the same time, a progress zone located just below the AER helps determine the number and identity of digits that will form in the autopod. The progress zone works by interpreting FGF signals to establish the correct spatial organization of digits.

The anterior-posterior axis is established through signaling by proteins in the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA), a region of mesoderm located on the posterior side of the limb bud. The ZPA secretes Sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein, which causes the limb bud cells in contact with it to become posterior in identity. Cells farther from the ZPA, in the anterior limb bud, are specified as anterior. Shh signaling from the ZPA also helps establish the correct number of digits that will form in the autopod. 

Finally, the dorsal-ventral axis is established through signaling from the non-ridge ectoderm and ventral mesoderm. The non-ridge ectoderm, located on the dorsal side of the limb, expresses Wnt7a protein. Wnt7a causes the underlying mesodermal cells to become dorsal in fate. The ventral mesoderm expresses Engrailed-1 (En1) protein, which specifies the overlying cells to become ventral. These dorsal and ventral signaling centers must be properly oriented with respect to the anterior-posterior axis for the limb to develop normally.

In conclusion, the three axes of the vertebrate limb are patterned through the coordinated signaling of the AER, ZPA, non-ridge ectoderm, and ventral mesoderm. These signaling centers secrete factors like FGFs, Shh, Wnt7a, and En1 to establish the proximal-distal, anterior-posterior, and dorsal-ventral limb axes, respectively. Proper communication between these signaling centers is essential for the growth and patterning of the vertebrate limb.
