Gel electrophoresis and western blotting are two common molecular techniques used to isolate and identify specific proteins. Gel electrophoresis separates proteins in a sample by size using an electric field and a polymer matrix such as agarose or polyacrylamide. Samples are loaded into wells in the gel and subjected to an electric field, which causes the proteins to migrate in the gel based on their size and charge. Smaller proteins migrate further through the pores in the gel. The separated proteins are then stained for visualization or transferred to a membrane for western blot analysis. 

Western blotting, also known as immunoblotting, uses antibodies to detect specific proteins from the sample that have been separated by gel electrophoresis and immobilized on a membrane. The membrane is probed with a primary antibody that specifically binds the target protein. A secondary antibody conjugated to an enzyme is then applied, and the resulting protein band is visualized through the addition of a substrate for the enzyme. The location and intensity of the band indicates the approximate size and quantity of the target protein.

To analyze glutathione-S-transferase (GST) using these techniques, GST-expressing E. coli cells could be lysed and the total protein isolated. An aliquot of the protein sample would be subjected to SDS-PAGE, a common gel electrophoresis technique using a polyacrylamide gel and sodium dodecyl sulfate to denature proteins. The separated proteins would be transferred to a nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and blocked to prevent nonspecific antibody binding. The membrane would then be probed with a primary anti-GST antibody followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Addition of a chemiluminescent HRP substrate would illuminate the GST band, allowing visualization and analysis. The molecular weight and intensity of the band would confirm the expression and approximate concentration of the GST protein.

There are several challenges to expressing foreign proteins in prokaryotic cells. Prokaryotic promoters and translation elements may not function properly with some eukaryotic genes, reducing expression. Eukaryotic proteins may require post-translational modifications or chaperones that are absent in prokaryotes, impacting protein folding and activity. Toxicity is also an issue, as high levels of some foreign proteins can be lethal to prokaryotic cells. Using a tightly regulated prokaryotic promoter, low temperature expression, chaperone co-expression, and nutrient-limited growth conditions are some strategies used to improve foreign protein expression.

In summary, gel electrophoresis and western blotting are invaluable tools for analyzing proteins. These techniques, when applied to detect GST expressed in E. coli, would confirm the presence of the GST protein and provide quantitative data on its molecular weight and concentration in the sample. Challenges remain in expressing eukaryotic proteins in prokaryotic systems, but various strategies have been developed to address issues with promoters, translation, toxicity, and protein folding. Continual optimization of these methodologies enables ever more sophisticated protein analysis and expression.
