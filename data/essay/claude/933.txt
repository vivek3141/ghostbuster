Robert Browning's dramatic monologues "My Last Duchess" and "Porphyria's Lover" offer compelling insights into the treatment of women in Victorian society through the depiction of male characters asserting dominance over their female counterparts. In these poems, Browning adopts the personas of two murderous men conveying their motivations and justifications for killing their lovers in one-sided conversations with silent interlocutors. By giving these men a platform to express themselves without interruption, Browning is able to illuminate the disturbing mindsets that view women as possessions to be controlled and suppressed. 

In "My Last Duchess," the Duke of Ferrara is showing a portrait of his deceased duchess to a servant of his prospective new bride's family. Through his commentary on the painting and recollections of his interactions with the duchess, the Duke reveals that he killed his last duchess because he felt she did not properly respect his position and authority. The Duke describes the duchess's "heart...too soon made glad" by others' attention and smiles as "as if she ranked / My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name / With anybody's gift." His grievance stems from her failure to uphold the patriarchal values that see women as subordinate to men. The Duke's misogynistic views are a reflection of the broader societal norms of the era, where men were expected to dominate over women.

Similarly, in "Porphyria's Lover," the speaker murders his lover, Porphyria, in a desperate attempt to preserve a fleeting moment of happiness and control over her. When Porphyria enters from the cold into the speaker's cottage, she momentarily gives him her full attention and devotion: "And, last, she sat down by my side / And called me. When no voice replied, / She put my arm about her waist." However, the speaker recognizes this loving gesture as ephemeral, since Porphyria must eventually return to her ordinary life outside where she answers to her family and society. To perpetuate this temporary power over her, the speaker strangles her with her own hair: "That moment she was mine, mine, fair, / Perfectly pure and good." Through this disturbing act, the speaker asserts dominance in the only way he knows how in a society where he otherwise has little agency or control as a poor man. Both "My Last Duchess" and "Porphyria's Lover" thus reflect the rigid gender hierarchies of the Victorian era that disempowered women and bred unhealthy notions of masculine authority.

Browning's use of dramatic monologue is essential to conveying these themes of misogyny and patriarchal control in Victorian society. By letting the Duke and the lover speak in their own voices, Browning allows readers to observe unfiltered the workings of their troubled minds. Their one-sided confessions elicit both disgust and unease in readers who can do nothing but listen as passive bystanders. The speakers' revelations feel intensely personal while also profoundly unsettling. Through their disturbing rationalizations and projections of blame onto their victims, the speakers provide glimpses into the darkest recesses of the Victorian male psyche. The effect is a compelling look at the prevalent sexism and oppressive treatment of women in Browning's era revealed through characters that make no apologies for their cruel actions and beliefs.

Overall, Browning's dramatic monologues "My Last Duchess" and "Porphyria's Lover" offer a piercing look at the marginalization of women in Victorian England through speakers who assert their dominance in horrifying ways. By adopting the perspectives of these misogynistic male characters, Browning provides a platform to voice the cultural attitudes that disempowered women and reduced them to mere possessions of controlling men. In giving expression to these sinister mindsets without interruption, Browning reveals uncomfortable but necessary insights into the experience of women in 19th-century patriarchal society.
