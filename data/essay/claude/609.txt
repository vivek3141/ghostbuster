Financing Options for a Small E-Company like My Mp3 

There are several financing options available for a small e-commerce company like My Mp3 to fund their business operations and growth. The options include:

1. Bootstrapping: This means self-financing the business using the founders' own money and reinvesting the profits. This is a good way for My Mp3 to get started without taking on debt or giving up equity. However, the amount of capital available through bootstrapping is limited to what the founders can put in.

2. Crowdfunding: My Mp3 could raise money from many individuals investing small amounts through an online platform like Kickstarter or Indiegogo. This allows My Mp3 to raise funds without giving up equity. However, crowdfunding campaigns require a lot of work to execute and there is a risk of not reaching the funding goal. The amounts that can be raised are also limited, often to just enough to launch a new product.

3. Angel investment: My Mp3 could get investment from wealthy individuals, known as angel investors, in exchange for equity in the company. Angel funding allows larger amounts of capital than bootstrapping or crowdfunding, often hundreds of thousands to a few million dollars. However, angel investors obtain equity and often want a say in how the business is run. 

4. Venture capital: Venture capital firms invest large amounts of money, from $3 million up to $100 million or more, in high-growth startups like My Mp3 in exchange for equity. Venture funding can help My Mp3 scale quickly, but venture capital comes with more strict requirements for control and exit timelines.

In their business plan, My Mp3 likely outlines a revenue model based on selling mp3 downloads and streaming subscriptions to customers. The main expenditures in their plan would be:

1. Product development: The costs to develop and improve their website and mobile apps, source music tracks, and negotiate licensing deals.  

2. Marketing and advertising: Costs to promote the service and acquire new customers through social media, search engines, and other channels.

3. Bandwidth and hosting: Costs to host their website, store customersâ€™ music libraries in the cloud, and stream music tracks.

4. Salaries: Compensation for employees in roles like engineering, design, marketing, customer service, and management.
