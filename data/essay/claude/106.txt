Peter Burke, a prominent social and cultural historian, laid out an innovative methodological approach in his 1978 book on the patrician families of early modern Venice and Amsterdam, The Patrician Families of Venice and Amsterdam. His approach was interdisciplinary, comparative, and covered a long historical period. 

Burke began by comparing patrician families in Venice and Amsterdam, two major centers of trade and commerce in early modern Europe with oligarchic republican governments dominated by merchant elites. His interdisciplinary approach drew on insights from history, sociology, and anthropology. He studied marriage alliances, social networks, households, and property over three centuries, from around 1500 to 1800. This long time frame allowed him to trace both continuity and change in the patriciates. 

A key theme in Burke’s analysis was the correlation between economic structure and social structure in Venice and Amsterdam. In Venice, trade was based around the Mediterranean, power was highly concentrated, and family dynasties dominated the oligarchy. In contrast, Amsterdam’s trade and economy were more global and diverse, power was less concentrated, and its patrician class was more open. Burke argued these differences shaped distinct social structures and cultural attitudes in each city’s patrician class.

In Venice, the oligarchy was rigid and hereditary, dominated by old noble families in a closed caste system. Family alliances and loyalties were paramount. Patricians saw themselves as an aristocracy based on birth. In Amsterdam, the ruling merchant elite was more fluid and open. Wealth and business success were paths to power and status. Family connections still mattered for political alliances and business deals but overall social mobility was higher. Patricians in Amsterdam thought of themselves more as wealthy and successful burghers than traditional aristocrats.

Economic changes in the 17th and 18th centuries reinforced these differences, according to Burke. As Venice declined, its patrician class clung more tightly to notions of birthright and tried to prevent downward mobility. In prospering Amsterdam, new merchant families entered the regent class, keeping it open and flexible. Burke argues these contrasting reactions shaped a more rigid conservatism in Venice's patriciate and a more progressive outlook in Amsterdam's.

In conclusion, Burke employed an innovative and persuasive methodology to compare the patrician classes of Venice and Amsterdam over three centuries. By analyzing family connections, social structures, cultural attitudes, and economic bases in each city, he revealed how merchant oligarchies could develop very differently depending on the environment. His work remains influential in showing how economic and political conditions intertwined with social relationships and mentalities in early modern Europe. Overall, Burke made a compelling case for how these two merchant republics represented distinct models of patrician society in the era.
