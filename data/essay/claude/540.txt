A president's success is highly debated and depends on many complex factors. On the one hand, popularity and perception with the public is important for a president. On the other hand, effective governance and concrete policy changes or legislative achievements also determine a president's success and legacy. Ultimately, a president's success likely depends on a combination of popularity, governance effectiveness, leadership ability, and external factors outside of a president's control.

In the short term, popularity and perception are significant factors in a president's success. Presidents depend on popularity and public approval to advance their agenda, especially in the modern era of constant media coverage and scrutiny. An unpopular president will face difficulties in gaining support for policies and legislation. Public opinion of a president also influences their party's success or failure in midterm and general elections. For these reasons, presidents devote substantial resources to crafting their public image through rhetorical style, television addresses, social media, and public appearances. 

However, popularity alone does not make for a successful presidency in the long run. Effective governance, leadership, and policy changes are also crucial determining factors. Presidents are judged historically on their tangible accomplishments and impact on the nation. Major policy achievements like healthcare reform, economic stimulus programs, or tax cuts shape a president's legacy for generations. Presidents also need strong leadership abilities to navigate crises, build coalitions, and steer the country through difficult periods. For example, presidents like Lincoln and FDR led the country through wars and economic depression, demonstrating resolve, vision, and competent management.

A president's influence on policy and the economy is limited by external factors, despite rhetoric to the contrary during campaigns. The economy follows the business cycle, and while presidential policies may modestly impact growth or labor markets at the margins, the president does not "control" the economy in a substantial way. Similarly, a president depends on Congress to pass legislation, and governors and local officials are responsible for implementing and enforcing many policies. Divided or opposition government also constrains a president's policy influence. However, presidents can powerfully shape policy debates by using the "bully pulpit" to raise public awareness on issues like health care, education, taxes or the environment. A persuasive president, especially one focused on a key policy priority, can often find ways to drive legislative progress.

A president's personality plays a role in their leadership and perception but should not be overstated. Personality traits may incline presidents to focus on certain types of policies or prefer a particular leadership style. However, political beliefs, skills, experience, advisors, and circumstances also strongly determine a president's priorities and decisions. A president's rhetoric, public image, specific policies, and key events will ultimately matter more to their success and legacy than personality alone. 

In conclusion, a president's success depends on a combination of popularity, governance, leadership, personality, and external factors. While popularity and perception are significant in the short term, tangible accomplishments and competence drive historical success in the long run. A president's influence is constrained by Congress, economic conditions, and global events, but presidents can powerfully shape policy through leadership and communication. A president's personality may inform their leadership style but is not solely determinant of their priorities or legacy. Overall, there are many complex ingredients in a successful presidency, and evaluating any president requires a balanced and nuanced analysis.
