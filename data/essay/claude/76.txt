The Enlightenment philosophy of the 18th century had a profound impact on the earliest colonial encounters between Europeans and Aboriginal people in New South Wales. The era emphasized reason, scientific progress, and natural law, which shaped colonial policies around punishment, agriculture, and race relations in significant ways. 

The decision to transport convicts to Australia was influenced by Enlightenment beliefs in environmental determinism and the possibility of reform. Rather than executing minor offenders as had been common previously, transportation aimed to rehabilitate criminals through forced labor in a new environment. Officials believed a distant penal colony, where convicts were isolated from corrupting influences and had to work productively to survive, could instill discipline and morals in those who had gone astray. The colonists brought Enlightenment principles of reason, order, and productivity to bear on the management of punishment. Strict rules and tight regulation of behavior sought to mold the characters of convicts. 

Enlightenment thinking also guided agricultural practices. Colonists applied scientific methods to explore the natural world and determine the island's potential. Experiments with new crops and farming techniques aimed to cultivate the land productively. agricultural societies promoted innovation. However, the colonists' optimism in their ability to master nature through reason was tested by unfamiliar Australian conditions. Their early struggles and failures highlighted the limits of their Enlightenment-inspired confidence.

Racial ideology and the treatment of Aboriginal people were also affected by Enlightenment thought. While some marginal thinkers argued all humans shared a common nature, most held that different races represented separate stages in human evolution. They saw Aboriginal people as 'savages' lower on the ladder of progress. This view justified dispossessing Aboriginal groups of their lands and attempting to 'civilize' them. Some Enlightenment philosophers opposed slavery and valued all human life, but in the colony, violence and oppression prevailed.

In conclusion, the Enlightenment had significant and complex effects on early colonial Australia. Core beliefs in science, reason, moral progress, and natural law shaped key policies around punishment, agriculture, and race relations. However, Enlightenment thinking also contained seeds of egalitarianism and humanism. Tensions between humanism and prejudice, reason and Romanticism, science and human experience would continue to shape Australia as the 19th century unfolded. The Enlightenment legacy was ambiguous and contested, as the colonists grappled with creating a new society in an unfamiliar land.
