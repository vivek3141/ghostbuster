Mathematical models are useful tools for predicting the displacement of beams under load. By applying theoretical principles of engineering mechanics, formulas can calculate the deflection of beams based on several factors, such as loading, dimensions, material, and support conditions. However, these models make simplifying assumptions and cannot capture all aspects of beam behavior. Experimental testing is required to validate mathematical models and determine their accuracy for specific scenarios.   

Mathematical beam models are based on the theory of elasticity and Bernoulli-Euler beam theory, which assume beams experience small deflections and negligible shear deformation. These assumptions hold for most beam materials and loading conditions, allowing formulas to reasonably approximate displacement. The deflection of a beam depends on how it is loaded and supported. For example, a simple beam with two fixed supports will deflect less under a point load than a beam with pin supports. Beam dimensions, material, and geometry also matter; a short, wide beam composed of steel will deflect less than a long, thin beam made of aluminum under the same load.

To mathematically model beam displacement, formulas incorporate these factors. For a simple beam with point loads, the deflection formula includes the distributed load (q), length (L), Young's modulus (E), moment of inertia (I), and the number and location of point loads (P). For more complex cases with varying or distributed loads, numerical methods like the double integration method approximate the deflection curve. While mathematically elegant, these formulas rely on assumptions that inevitably introduce errors. They do not consider imperfections in beam material and geometry, complex stress distributions, or large deformations. 

Experimental testing can determine the accuracy of mathematical models for predicting beam displacement. By measuring the actual deflection of beams under known loads, researchers can compare the results to theoretical predictions. Discrepancies point to limitations in the assumptions and approximations of the mathematical models. For example, experiments show that Timoshenko beam theory, which accounts for shear deformation, more accurately predicts deflection of short or highly loaded beams than the Bernoulli-Euler theory. Experiments have also refined numerical methods, determining optimal element sizes and integration techniques to minimize errors for varying load conditions. 

Overall, mathematical models and experimental testing work together to understand beam deflection. Mathematical theory provides a foundation to systematically analyze the problem and generate initial predictions. Experiments then validate the models, determine their accuracy limits, and inspire refinements to assumptions and methods. Accurately predicting beam displacement requires considering both the strengths and weaknesses of theoretical models and practical experiments.
