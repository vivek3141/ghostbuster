There are several factors that contribute to a child's popularity within their peer group. These factors relate both to the child's social competence—their ability to effectively navigate social interactions and relationships—as well as their behavior and interactions with peers.

One of the most significant factors determining a child's popularity is their level of social competence and skill. Children who are socially competent are adept at interpreting social cues, navigating social dynamics, and relating to others in a friendly, empathetic manner. They are able to attune to the needs and interests of their peers, understand different social situations, and respond in a socially appropriate way. These children tend to be viewed by peers as friendly, likable, and socially adept. Studies have found that popular children exhibit higher levels of social skills like empathy, cooperation, assertion, and self-control. Their ability to relate to and engage socially with a wide range of peers contributes to their popularity.

A second factor is a child's level of peer acceptance and inclusiveness. Children who are popular tend to be very inclusive of others, accepting towards peers who are different from themselves, and willing to associate with a wide range of social groups. They do not exclude or bully other children. Instead, they build connections across groups and welcome a diversity of peers into their social circles. Their inclusive nature and willingness to accept others contribute to their popularity and social status.

Another contributing factor is a child's level of prosocial behavior, such as kindness, generosity, and helpfulness. Children who display more prosocial behaviors towards peers—like sharing, complimenting, assisting, and cooperating with others—are often viewed by their peers in a very positive light. Their prosocial actions signal to other children that this child is friendly, trustworthy, and concerned for the wellbeing of others. This, in turn, makes other children enjoy their company and seek out relationships and interactions with them. Studies have found a strong link between prosocial behavior, peer acceptance, and popularity in children.

In contrast, children who exhibit high levels of aggression, bullying, withdrawal, or anxiety tend to be viewed more negatively by peers and are less likely to be popular. Their behavior and interactions signal to peers that they may be difficult or unpleasant to engage with, and as a result, others are less drawn to build close relationships with them. While personality factors outside of a child's control also contribute to their social experiences, the child's actual behavior and competence play an undeniably significant role in shaping their peer relationships and popularity.

In summary, several key factors that contribute to a child's popularity in their peer group relate to their level of social competence, inclusiveness of others, prosocial behavior, and overall positive interactions with peers. The child's ability to build positive connections across a diverse range of peers through adept social skills, kindness, and acceptance plays a central role in how they are viewed by others. Their popularity is largely determined by the nature of their social behavior and relationships. With support, children can strengthen these skills and behaviors to build closer peer connections and increase their level of social success and popularity.
