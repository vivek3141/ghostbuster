The social housing sector has been contracting in many Western countries since the mid-1970s. This essay explores the underlying reasons for this trend by analysing the housing policies of the UK, the Netherlands, France and Sweden. 

There are four main reasons why social housing sectors have declined. Firstly, the conditions that necessitated the initial building of social housing, such as severe housing shortages after World Wars and slum clearances, no longer exist in these countries. With rising standards of living, the vast expansion of homeownership and increasing housing supply, the original rationale for social housing has diminished.

Secondly, homeownership has become an attractive and achievable aspiration for more people. Government policies such as the right to buy schemes in the UK and France have enabled social housing tenants to purchase their homes at discounted rates. This has reduced the social housing stock. The promotion of homeownership is also embedded in cultural values and government policies.

Thirdly, there is a self-eroding dynamic within social housing itself. As social housing estates age and deteriorate, they become less desirable and stigmatised. This vicious cycle leads to abandonment and demolition of social housing. Policies to remedy this through regeneration and mix-tenure often result in a net loss of social rented homes.

Finally, there are perceived pressures for governments to reduce public spending on social housing. The rise of neoliberalism since the 1970s emphasised free market, fiscal discipline and a smaller welfare state. Government subsidies for social housing were seen as inefficient use of public funds. The UK government cut funding for social housing the most drastically.

However, social housing is not completely doomed. There are differences in the levels of contraction and future prospects of social housing sectors. The UK abolished its social housebuilding program but the Netherlands, France and Sweden continue to build social housing at varying rates. The Dutch and Swedish governments provide substantial funding and see social housing as integral to a fair and inclusive welfare system, though at a smaller scale.

In conclusion, while the rationale for post-war social housebuilding has ended and cultural values have shifted to favour homeownership, social housing sectors need not inevitably decline. With sufficient government will and funding, social housing can continue as part of a mixed-tenure system in some countries, even if not at the high levels of the post-war decades. Government intervention and investment remain key to stabilising and reinvigorating social housing.
