There is a wide range of opportunities for international and English students at Oxford Brookes University to communicate and interact. However, there is also room for improvement in facilitating more effective exchange between these groups of students. 

To begin with, Oxford Brookes has a large and active international student population, making up over 40% of the total student body. There are students from over 140 countries, providing a diverse range of cultural and linguistic backgrounds on campus. The university also has dedicated programs, services, and facilities for international students to help them transition to life in the UK and at Oxford Brookes. For example, student orientation, buddy programs, and the International Student Advisory Service. These programs ensure international students have opportunities to interact with domestic students from the moment they arrive.

International students also frequently interact with English students in their daily activities, such as while sharing accommodation, in academic classes, or participating in university sports and societies. A survey of international students at the university found that 64% live in shared student accommodation where they regularly interact with English students.  Furthermore, group assignments and in-class discussions provide additional opportunities for cross-cultural interaction and relationship building. The university also fosters participation in extracurricular activities, with over 100 sports clubs and societies that both international and English students are actively involved in.

However, interaction between these student groups at a deeper intercultural level is limited. While international students report making English friends, most relationships remain quite superficial.  Language barriers, cultural differences, and the tendency for students to cluster within their own national groups are challenges to building closer connections. The university's exchange programs are an excellent mechanism for facilitating deeper interaction, but participation rates are low, with less than 5% of students taking part in an exchange.

To improve intercultural exchange, some recommendations for the university include: promoting exchange programs more widely by highlighting the benefits to students; creating more opportunities for conversational exchanges through a buddy program or language caf√©; offering training for students in areas such as intercultural communication; and organizing more shared social events, mentor programs or joint student projects between groups. 
 
Overall, while there are clearly existing opportunities for international and English students to interact at Oxford Brookes University, participation in exchange programs and deeper intercultural relationships remain limited. By promoting shared social experiences and intercultural learning opportunities, the university could strengthen relations between these student populations. Increased interaction and exchange would benefit both international and English students in becoming more cross-culturally competent and gaining a richer learning experience.
