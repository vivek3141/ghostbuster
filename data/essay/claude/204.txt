J. L. Mackie argues for second order moral scepticism in his work Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong. He believes that there are no objective moral facts or truths. By 'second order' moral scepticism, Mackie means scepticism about the existence of objective moral values, not scepticism about our knowledge of values. His argument relies on two core arguments: the argument from relativity and the argument from queerness. 

The argument from relativity points out that moral codes differ greatly across societies and cultures. If there were objective moral truths, we would expect to find more agreement across cultures about moral values and norms. The wide diversity of moral codes suggests that moral values are shaped by cultural and social factors, not objective moral facts. For example, practices like polygamy are accepted in some cultures but condemned in others. If polygamy was objectively morally wrong, it should be condemned by all societies. The argument from relativity shows that moral values vary with cultural beliefs and social practices, undermining the notion of objective moral truth.

The argument from queerness suggests that objective moral facts would be very strange or 'queer' entities, unlike anything else in the universe. They do not seem to fit within a naturalistic worldview. Moral properties like goodness or badness do not seem to correspond to any natural property. There are no moral particles or forces that could make up moral facts. If moral facts existed, they would be immaterial, non-natural and categorically different from any natural facts. But we have no way of discerning such queer moral entities. Since we should not posit the existence of strange entities beyond necessity, we have no reason to believe in objective moral facts.

However, there are some objections that can be raised against Mackie's arguments. Concerning relativity, the diversity of moral codes may simply reflect the diversity of human beliefs, not prove that objective moral truth does not exist. There could still be moral truths that some societies have grasped better than others. Moral progress is also possible, as societies move closer to moral truth over time by reforming prejudiced or unjust practices. 

In response to the argument from queerness, it is unclear why moral properties cannot supervene on natural properties, as multiple realizable properties do. Moral facts may accompany certain natural facts, without strictly corresponding to them. Moral facts may be categorically different from natural scientific facts but not completely divorced from the natural world. They would be no more 'queer' than mathematical, modal or epistemic facts which are also immaterial yet describable.

In conclusion, while Mackie presents an articulate case for second order moral scepticism, his arguments are not conclusive. Objective moral facts could still exist, even if they are difficult to discern, and even if not all societies acknowledge them. Moral truth may be intelligible as supervenient on or accompanied by natural facts. Unless there are decisive refutations of these possibilities, Mackie's moral scepticism is premature. His arguments from relativity and queerness do not definitively prove that objective moral values do not or cannot exist. There remain live possibilities that moral objectivism could be defended against Mackie's sceptical challenge.
