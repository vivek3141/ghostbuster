The study of management has evolved over the decades from a predominantly natural scientific approach to a more socio-psychological perspective that recognizes the human and social aspects involved in organizational behavior and leadership. Early management theorists adopted a positivist view that management could be studied as a natural science using objective methods such as description, prediction, control, and explanation of human behavior in organizations. However, this approach has significant limitations in capturing the complex realities of management given the psychological and social factors at play. 

Positivists believed that valid knowledge could only come from direct observation and experience, not from speculation. They sought to apply the scientific method to the study of management and organizations. A key assumption was that human behavior could be studied objectively and explained in a deterministic manner, much like the natural sciences. Positivists focused on concrete, measurable facts and pushed for more rigorous quantitative methods to gather and analyze data. They aimed to find universal laws that could describe, explain, and predict organizational phenomena.

However, the positivist view fails to account for the subjective, irrational aspects of human behavior that cannot be studied with the same objective, detached manner as natural phenomena. People have free will, complex motives, diverse values and do not always act rationally or logically. Organizational behavior is also highly contextual, culturally dependent and can change quickly in response to unpredictable events. The positivist methods of control and prediction are limited given these intrinsically human characteristics. While useful for studying physical systems, they cannot fully capture the psychological and social dynamics involved in management. 

In contrast, the interpretivist perspective holds that reality is socially constructed and complex human behavior patterns emerge from people's interpretations and interactions. Meaning is not objective but formed through inter-subjective understanding. Interpretivists argue that social sciences should aim to understand meaning, not search for predictive laws and causal explanations. Researchers should get inside the realities of those studied to understand thoughts, feelings, values and foster empathy. Interpretive methods like in-depth interviews, participant observation and case studies are better suited to explore the rich complexity and diversity of organizational life.

The radical functionalist view of management as a natural science dominated much of the early 20th century but is now largely rejected. The field has shifted to a socio-psychological perspective that  focuses on human relationships, group dynamics and leadership. Contemporary theories recognize management as a social activity that is fundamentally about organizing cooperative, purposive human effort. They aim to understand intrinsic human behavior and how relationships, meaning, values and identity interact with formal structures. This view is pluralistic, accepting multiple perspectives on organizational realities. 

In conclusion, while the natural scientific approach and positivist methods pioneered the early study of management, they fail to capture its profoundly human and social aspects. The interpretivist and socio-psychological perspectives are better equipped to explore the complexity, diversity and fluidity of organizational behavior in the modern world. The study of management has and will likely continue developing as a social science rather than a natural science.
