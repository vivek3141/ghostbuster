Case 5 appears to be the optimal publishing alternative for a cookbook targeting student audiences. Case 5 offers a print-on-demand model, digitally printing physical books as ordered and shipped directly to customers. This model reduces upfront costs and risks for the author compared to a traditional print model that requires minimum print runs. Given students' limited budgets, a lower cover price made possible by lower production costs will be important to drive sales. 

A print-on-demand model eliminates warehousing costs for a large stock of physical books. The author can start with a relatively small initial order of a few hundred books, gauge demand, and order more copies as needed based on sales. This "test the waters" approach reduces risk in case of lackluster demand. The ability to ramp up slowly and invest in more copies over time as the book finds its audience gives the best chance of optimizing the final printed volume.

Print-on-demand also provides more flexibility to make changes to the book over time in response to feedback and reviews. The author can easily update recipes, add or remove chapters, and make both major and minor changes to the content to improve the reader experience and value. With a traditional print model, the author is stuck with whatever is in the initial large print run. The ability to adapt and improve the book over multiple printings will result in higher quality and engagement, especially important for novice student cooks.

To maximize appeal while limiting financial risk, the author should price the cookbook competitively at $19.99 to $24.99 and keep the page count under 200 pages. At 200 pages, even at $24.99 the production costs through Case 5 would be under $10 per book, allowing for a solid profit margin. A lower price point is critical to driving volume sales among budget-conscious students. Keeping the book relatively concise will also make it appear more accessible and less intimidating, while reducing production costs. 

In summary, the print-on-demand model offered by Case 5 is the ideal publishing option for a student cookbook project. It reduces upfront costs and financial risk for the author, provides flexibility to improve the book over time, and enables a competitive price point and efficient format to maximize appeal to students. The ability to start small, adapt, and invest in more copies over time as the book finds its audience gives the best chance of success. With the right pricing and production strategy focused on value, a student cookbook could thrive under this model.
