Pluripotent stem cells are a powerful type of stem cell that has the ability to differentiate into any cell type in the body. They are derived from human embryos at the blastocyst stage and can divide indefinitely while maintaining their ability to differentiate into specialized cells. Pluripotent stem cells were first derived from mice in 1981 and later in 1998 from human embryos. Given their ability to turn into any cell, pluripotent stem cells have enormous potential for medical research and applications. 

The unique properties of pluripotent stem cells enable them to be useful for medical research in several ways. They can be used to better understand early human development and what goes wrong in developmental diseases and birth defects. They also provide an ideal platform to study the effects of drugs or toxins on human cells without endangering human life. Pluripotent stem cells are also useful for developing disease models to better understand diseases, identify new drugs, and test their effectiveness. Some of the diseases that could benefit include Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease.

Pluripotent stem cells also have promising potential for cell-based therapies and regenerative medicine. They could be directed to turn into specialized cells to replace those lost due to injury or disease. For example, they could be used to generate dopamine-producing neurons to treat Parkinson's disease or insulin-producing beta cells to treat diabetes. They could also potentially be used to repair damaged heart tissue after a heart attack. However, much more research is needed to turn this potential into safe and effective therapies.

While pluripotent stem cells have significant promise, their use also raises important ethical concerns. The main concern is the destruction of human embryos to derive new embryonic stem cell lines. This is controversial and opposed by those who believe that human life begins at conception. Recently, alternative methods have been developed to generate pluripotent stem cells without destroying embryos, such as induced pluripotent stem cells and alterative sources like umbilical cord blood stem cells. However, pluripotent stem cells derived from human embryos are still considered the gold standard for research and therapy development. 

In summary, pluripotent stem cells have enormous potential for medical research and applications due to their ability to differentiate into any cell type in the body. They enable a better understanding of development and disease, provide platforms for drug testing, and could lead to new cell replacement therapies. However, their use also raises ethical concerns, mainly due to the destruction of human embryos to derive embryonic stem cells. Going forward, alternative sources of pluripotent stem cells may help address these ethical issues while enabling continued progress in this promising area of medicine.
