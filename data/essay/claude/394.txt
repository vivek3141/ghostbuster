George Berkeley presented arguments for his idealism by claiming that it is impossible to conceive of unperceived things. His arguments are tied to his imagistic theory of understanding which holds that humans gain knowledge about the world by having ideas that represent sensory experiences. Berkeley argues that something can only be said to exist if it is perceived or conceived in the mind through ideas. If something cannot be perceived or conceived, it cannot meaningfully be said to exist. Therefore, there cannot be material objects that exist independently of perception.

Berkeley's argument centers on his claim that it is impossible to conceive of or imagine an unperceiving thing. He argues that when we claim to conceive of something, we can only do so by representing it with ideas in our mind, which are ultimately derived from and represent our perceptions. We cannot have an idea that does not represent something perceivable. Therefore, we cannot meaningfully claim to conceive of an unperceiving, unperceived thing. Berkeley argues that phrases like “unperceived matter” are meaningless and incoherent. If we cannot conceive of unperceiving matter through ideas, then we have no ground to claim that such matter exists. Only perceived things, represented by ideas in the mind, can be said to have meaningful existence.

If Berkeley's arguments are shown to be invalid, his idealism collapses. If it can be demonstrated that we can conceive of unperceiving, unperceived things, then his theory that only perceived things represented by ideas can exist is undermined. For example, we can imagine invisible, undetectable entities or forces that are imperceptible to human senses. The possibility of quantum entities that are unobservable in principle show that we can conceive of unperceiving things that can still meaningfully exist. Mathematical concepts also point to things that can be coherently conceived without perception. Invalidating Berkeley's arguments opens the possibility that an mind-independent material world can exist even if it remains unperceived. 

Berkeley's imagistic theory of understanding and his idealism rely on his arguments that unperceived things cannot be conceived or imagined. If these arguments are shown to be flawed, his overall philosophical system is weakened. While the possibility of perceiving and conceiving go hand in hand for Berkeley, they can come apart. We can conceive of things, like mathematical truths, logical rules or theoretical entities, even without the possibility of perceiving them. The implications are that Berkeley's strict equation of existence and perception must be loosened. His idealism would need modification to account for unperceiving things that can still be meaningfully said to exist. The material world may be more independent of the mind than Berkeley's philosophy suggests. Overall, if Berkeley's arguments against conceiving the unperceived fail, his imagistic theory of understanding and idealist metaphysics must adapt considerably. His system can no longer maintain that all meaningful claims about existence ultimately depend on perception and perceivable ideas alone.
