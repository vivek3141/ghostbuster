Oscar Wilde's successful career as a playwright and writer of prose was built in part on his ability to reflect and subvert Victorian social norms through witty and clever critique. However, underlying much of Wilde's writing is also a subtle engagement with his heritage as an Anglo-Irish writer living in England. In his works, Wilde frequently approaches themes that reflect his own cultural background, including discussions of Anglo-Irish relations, imagery evoking Ireland's potato famine, and references to the "Big House" system of wealthy landlords overseeing large estates. 

Wilde was born in Dublin to Anglo-Irish Protestant parents, with a father who was a leading ear and eye surgeon. The Anglo-Irish made up a small Protestant ruling class that had historical ties to England but had lived in Ireland for generations. They saw themselves as culturally and politically distinct from Catholic native Irish people. Wilde's upbringing was thus one of privilege that rested on the social order of Protestant rule in Ireland. In his writings, Wilde often critiques and satirizes Anglo-Irish culture and the British ruling class in Ireland. In The Importance of Being Earnest, for example, Lady Bracknell's snobbery and disdain for social climbers reflects the prejudices of the Anglo-Irish upper crust. Similarly, in "The Devoted Friend," Wilde uses the characters of the miller and the water-rat to represent the Irish peasantry and the Anglo-Irish gentry, respectively, highlighting the water-rat's selfishness and exploitation of the miller.

Beyond commenting on Anglo-Irish relations, Wilde also invokes imagery connected to the Great Famine in subtle ways. The Famine left a deep impact on Ireland due to the immense suffering and population loss it caused. In The Picture of Dorian Gray, Wilde describes "starving toilers in starved hamlets" who are "with harsh cries and curses tearing up the flowers in English pleasure gardens." This unsettling juxtaposition indirectly recalls the horrible consequences of famine and displacement. Similarly, in his poem "Irish Poets and Poetry" Wilde couches praise for Ireland's literary heritage in language that acknowledges the country's turbulent history, speaking of how "her bards have sung / Than the red rose of her martyrdom."

Finally, Wilde makes frequent reference to the Big House, a symbol of the vast estates owned by wealthy Anglo-Irish landowners. These lavish manor houses and the lifestyles of their inhabitants are referenced in both Wilde's comedic and tragic works. In The Importance of Being Earnest, Jack Worthing's country estate serves as the Big House, hosting fox hunts, garden parties, and other affairs of the leisure class. Meanwhile, in "The Selfish Giant," the Giant's magnificent garden represents an idealized Big House entity. However, after the Giant shuts out the children from his garden, it falls into disrepair and ruin. This reflects the eventual decline of many Anglo-Irish estates. 

In conclusion, Oscar Wilde's writing frequently approaches and reflects upon his Anglo-Irish heritage in multifaceted ways. Through wry commentary on Anglo-Irish class pretensions, subtle famine references, and invocation of the Big House motif, Wilde's works ultimately highlight and critique the privileged social order into which he was born. At the same time, they capture Wilde's profound affection for and connection to Ireland itself. Taken together, these themes demonstrate that although Wilde spent most of his life in England, Ireland always remained his "native land."
