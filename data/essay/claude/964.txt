Low cost airlines face significant problems in regards to the environmental pollution caused by flying. Air travel contributes to high levels of carbon emissions that accelerate climate change. The aviation industry currently accounts for about 2% of global carbon dioxide emissions, but this number is anticipated to grow rapidly as more people across the world travel by air and as airlines expand their operations.  

One proposed solution to reduce emissions from flying is the use of alternative and more sustainable aircraft fuels. Biofuels made from plant materials and renewable energy sources can reduce the life cycle emissions from aircraft. However, biofuels are currently more expensive to produce, require land that could be used for food production, and still release carbon dioxide when burned as jet fuel. Thus, while promising, biofuels alone are not sufficient and airlines should consider other solutions as well.

Improved aircraft design and technology can also help lower emissions. Newer aircraft models are more fuel efficient, reducing carbon pollution per flight. However, purchasing new aircraft is very expensive for airlines, and it can take decades to fully turn over fleets. Airlines could consider retrofitting existing planes with more efficient engines, winglets, and components to curb emissions at lower cost, though retrofits still require large capital expenditure.

Increasing operational efficiency is a further step airlines can take. Optimizing flight schedules and aircraft load to maximize occupancy, reducing aircraft idle time while taxiing and waiting to take off or land, and flying more direct routes when possible can all decrease fuel burn. However, operational changes may increase costs or reduce flight frequency for airlines.

Beyond solutions implemented by airlines, governments can take action through policy measures like carbon taxes, cap and trade programs, and sustainability requirements. Regulation on the aviation sector to curb emissions has been limited to date but will likely need to increase to drive substantial progress. Multinational cooperation is also key given the global nature of air travel and climate change. 

In summary, alternatives fuels, new technologies, improved operations, and government policies all show promise for tackling pollution from low cost airlines and aviation overall. However, costs, scale of adoption, and the global effort required pose barriers. A coordinated, multi-pronged strategy across stakeholders that balances environmental and economic priorities will be needed to effectively combat this pressing issue over the long term. Overall progress will depend on continued innovation and on transitions that can be realistically implemented across the highly complex air travel system.
