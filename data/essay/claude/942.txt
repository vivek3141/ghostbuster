Local governments in the UK rely on a variety of methods to generate revenue, each with implications for local democracy and autonomy. The main sources of local government funding are property taxes, user charging for services, local sales taxes, and local income taxes. 

Property taxes, levied on the value of residential and commercial properties, are a major source of funding for local councils. Property taxes provide a stable source of revenue but can disproportionately impact certain groups like pensioners or low-income homeowners. However, property taxes are often seen as fair since the value of one's property reflects the benefits of local services and infrastructure. Property taxes also give local governments more control and autonomy over revenue collection. For example, in the US, local property taxes fund over 60% of K-12 education, giving local schools independence from federal and state mandates.

User charging, where residents pay directly for certain services like waste collection or parking, provides a straightforward way for local governments to generate revenue while making the cost of services transparent to residents. However, user fees can be regressive since they impact lower-income groups more. They also provide an incentive for local governments to prioritize the needs of fee-paying residents over others. In Belgium, disputes over language policy and education funding have been exacerbated by reliance on local user fees and property taxes.

Local sales and income taxes provide a significant source of revenue for some councils but require cooperation with central government to implement. While sales and income taxes can generate substantial revenue in urban commercial centers, they may fall short in rural areas. They also reduce local autonomy since tax rates are often set at the national level. Some US states allow local sales tax add-ons, but local income taxes are rare. 

In conclusion, there are good arguments on both sides of each revenue method. An ideal system would balance local autonomy and accountability, the needs of both higher-income urban and lower-income rural areas, and incentives for voter participation. A mix of property taxes, user fees, and locally administered taxes may provide the most balanced solution. But there are many open questions about how to structure revenue collection to best support effective and democratic local governance.
