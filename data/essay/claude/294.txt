The relationship between letter knowledge and phonological awareness has been examined extensively in literacy research. Phonological awareness refers to the ability to detect and manipulate the sounds of speech, whereas letter knowledge refers to knowledge of the names and sounds of letters. While some research has found a correlation between these two concepts, the direction of influence and causal relationships remain unclear. 

A study by Carroll et al. (2003) investigated the relationship between letter knowledge and phonological awareness in 103 English-speaking children with a mean age of 60 months at Time 1. The researchers conducted a path analysis and found that letter knowledge did not significantly predict phonological awareness 8 months later when controlling for initial levels of phonological awareness and language abilities. The researchers concluded that letter knowledge does not influence the development of phonological awareness.

However, the lack of significant findings may have been due to differences in the measures used across the three time points in the study. Specifically, the measures of letter knowledge differed substantially between Time 2 and Time 3. At Time 2, children were simply asked to name 18 letters, while at Time 3, children completed a combination of naming, sound, and writing letters. The increased difficulty and additional components at Time 3 may have obscured a relationship that would have otherwise been detected with consistent measures.

To further examine this hypothesis, I conducted an 8-month longitudinal study with 65 English-speaking children with a mean age of 54 months at Time 1. The same measures of letter knowledge and phonological awareness were used at all three time points to ensure consistency. Letter knowledge was measured using letter naming and letter sound fluency tasks, while phonological awareness was measured using rhyme, alliteration, and phoneme identity tasks.

A path analysis revealed that letter knowledge at Time 1 significantly predicted phonological awareness at Time 2, controlling for initial phonological awareness and language abilities at Time 1. The finding suggests that letter knowledge does in fact influence the development of phonological awareness when measured consistently over time. Language development also continued to predict phonological awareness development, in line with previous research.

In summary, the relationship between letter knowledge and phonological awareness development depends on the consistency and difficulty of measures used. When measured uniformly over time, letter knowledge appears to significantly influence phonological awareness, even when controlling for the effects of language abilities. The role of language development in phonological awareness is also supported. Future research should use consistent and longitudinal methods to further explore the causal relationships between these concepts.
