Taylorism, or scientific management, refers to a theory of management developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor in the late 19th century. Taylorism aimed to improve economic efficiency in the workplace by optimizing the way tasks were performed. The core ideas of Taylorism were breaking down complex jobs into simple, repetitive tasks, training workers in the "one best way" to do the job, and rewarding high productivity. 

Taylorism emerged during the Industrial Revolution in the U.S. As factories mechanized and the division of labor became more specialized, managers and business owners sought ways to maximize efficiency and productivity to increase profits. Taylor, an engineer by training, believed that scientific principles could be applied to the workplace. Through time and motion studies, Taylor analyzed the most efficient ways for workers to perform repetitive tasks. He argued that there was "one best way" to do any job, and that optimal methods should be determined scientifically.

The key principles of Taylorism were simplifying jobs into the smallest possible tasks, training workers in the optimal methods to perform those tasks as efficiently as possible, and incentivizing worker productivity. Managers were responsible for planning and closely monitoring how work was done. Workers, on the other hand, were reduced to largely unskilled laborers who simply followed orders. This process gave managers much more power and control over employees. 

Critics argue that Taylorism contributed to the exploitation and dehumanization of workers. Braverman argued that Taylorism deskilled workers and gave monopoly power to managers, reducing employees to appendages of machines. Littler similarly noted that Taylorism treated workers like parts in an industrial machine, valued only for their productivity and obedience. While Taylorism increased profits for companies, it did so at the expense of workers, whose jobs became monotonous, tedious, and closely monitored. 

Despite these criticisms, Taylorism spread rapidly because it generated huge economic gains. Companies that adopted scientific management principles maximized efficiency, reduced waste, and boosted productivity. This allowed companies to gain a competitive advantage, increase market share, and generate more profits. Although alternative management strategies like human relations theory later emerged, Taylorism dominated business thinking for decades because of its impact on productivity and profits.

In conclusion, Taylorism, or scientific management, was a theory developed to increase economic efficiency in factories. Although it has been criticized for reducing workers to unskilled and closely controlled robots, Taylorism spread widely because companies that adopted its principles gained a competitive advantage and increased profits. Taylorism gave managers more power over workers and transformed the employment relationship into one driven strictly by metrics of productivity.
