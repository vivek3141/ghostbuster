Why Society Should Embrace Due Process in Police Interrogations 

The right to due process, or fair legal procedure, is a fundamental principle of any civilized justice system. The presumption of innocence, right to counsel, and protection from unlawful search and seizure are all hallmarks of due process that help ensure fair and impartial justice. Nowhere are due process rights more important than in police interrogations, where individuals can face extreme pressure to confess or implicate themselves in a crime. While some argue that limiting police interrogation power reduces efficiency or effectiveness, due process protections in this context promote fairness, equality, and control within the criminal justice system overall.

Fairness is an essential characteristic of any equitable justice system. Coercive police interrogation techniques like excessive questioning, denial of food or sleep, and false promises of leniency undermine fairness by distorting the truth-seeking process. They make people more likely to confess involuntarily or provide inaccurate information just to escape the interrogation. Once a confession is obtained, it is difficult to determine if it was voluntarily given, even with judicial review. Due process protections are needed to limit coercive techniques, allow the accused access to counsel, and create a clear record of the process to enable fair evaluation of the confession’s validity. With these protections in place, judges and juries can make fully informed determinations of guilt or innocence.

Equality before the law is another key principle of justice. Without due process limits on police interrogation power, those most vulnerable in society—including minorities, juveniles, and individuals with mental disabilities—are at greater risk of unfair treatment. Groups with less power or status are more prone to intimidation and coercion, and less likely to fully understand their rights. By mandating things like parental consent for minors, accommodations for disabilities, and access to legal counsel for all, due process helps ensure equal treatment and opportunity for justice regardless of one’s background or social standing. It helps address inherent inequalities in the system and society as a whole.

Finally, due process protections introduce necessary control and oversight into police investigations. Unfettered power, even within well-meaning institutions, risks overreach and abuse. Due process checks like warrants based on probable cause, rules against unreasonable search and seizure, and judicial review of police conduct establish boundaries and accountability. They also protect civil liberties and demand high ethical standards. Oversight and accountability are vital not just to prevent intentional wrongdoing, but also to correct unintentional biases or flaws in human judgement. Due process makes the system as a whole stronger, more credible, and more trusted by the communities it serves.  

In conclusion, while there are arguments against limiting police power by mandating due process, the benefits to fairness, equality and control within the system far outweigh any minor loss of efficiency. Upholding individuals’ basic rights and civil liberties should be the top priority in any justice system that values integrity, impartiality, and the wellbeing of citizens. Due process protections for police interrogations accomplish this by helping achieve fair outcomes, equal treatment under the law, and accountable oversight of investigative authority. A justice system without these attributes loses legitimacy and trust. Society should embrace due process to build a system that serves and protects all.
