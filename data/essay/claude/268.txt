The doctrine of intention to create legal relations in contract law refers to the requirement that parties must intend to be bound by the terms of an agreement for it to be considered legally enforceable as a contract. If the parties did not intend to create a legally binding agreement, the courts will not recognize it as an enforceable contract, even if it satisfies all the other requirements such as offer, acceptance, and consideration. 

The key rationale behind this doctrine is that the law of contracts should only apply to those agreements that the parties actually intend to have legal consequences. If two parties are simply negotiating or discussing a possible arrangement in a casual manner with no real intention to be bound by those discussions, it would be unjust to hold them to contract law standards. The courts do not want to make unwilling parties to contracts or discourage casual negotiations.

However, determining intention can be challenging, as parties rarely explicitly state their intentions in an agreement. As a result, courts often have to infer intention from the circumstances and the conduct of the parties. In doing so, courts frequently consider policy factors to determine whether it is appropriate or desirable to find an intention to create legal relations. For example, courts are more likely to find an intention where one party has relied on the agreement to their detriment, especially if the other party was aware of such reliance. This helps prevent injustice that may arise from casual or unilateral promises.

On the other hand, the use of such policy considerations has been criticized for introducing uncertainty and subjectivity into the law of contracts. The actual expressed intentions of the parties may be overlooked in favor of the court's view of what is reasonable or fair in the circumstances. Some critics argue that the doctrine of intention to create legal relations should be abolished altogether. They believe that objective evidence such as the words and actions of the parties should be the only considerations, rather than the court's speculations about the parties' unexpressed intentions or policy interests.

In my view, the doctrine of intention to create legal relations remains useful to prevent the unjust enforcement of casual agreements that parties do not view as legally binding. However, courts should be cautious about relying too heavily on policy factors and should put more emphasis on objectively determining the actual intentions of the parties based on the language of the agreement and the behavior of the parties. The policy goals of fairness and justice are better pursued through legislation and contract law principles such as the doctrines of misrepresentation, duress, and undue influence. Overall, balance and restraint are needed to ensure this doctrine achieves its purpose without unnecessary uncertainty or subjectivity.
