Local governments in the UK rely on various methods to raise revenue to fund public services and operations. The main sources of local government revenue are council tax, non-domestic rates, grants from central government, and charges for services. Central government exercises a significant degree of control over local government finance through limiting revenue raising powers, setting caps on certain taxes, and determining the level of grants.

The primary source of own-source revenue for local governments is council tax, which is a tax on residential property. Council tax bands are based on the estimated value of properties, with higher value properties paying significantly more. Council tax provides local authorities with a relatively stable source of income, but it is an unpopular tax and council tax rates are subject to politically-motivated control by central government. In recent years, the ability of local authorities to raise council tax has been capped at around 3% to limit the overall tax burden. 

Non-domestic rates are taxes on businesses based on the rental value of commercial properties. Like council tax, local governments have limited autonomy to set non-domestic rates due to control by central government. Revenue from non-domestic rates also tends to fluctuate significantly based on the health of local economies. During periods of economic difficulty, central government often further limits the ability of local governments to collect non-domestic rates, for example, by providing discount schemes or extending appeals mechanisms.

Grants from central government, such as the Revenue Support Grant and specific service grants, make up a sizable portion of local government revenue. Specific service grants are allocated to fund key services like education, public health, and transport. However, central government controls how these grants can be spent and places various reporting requirements on recipients. Revenue Support Grants provide more flexibility but have declined substantially as a share of local government funding in recent decades as part of central government's efforts to make local governments more self-sufficient. 

Charges for services like parking fees, licensing, and permits make up a relatively minor source of revenue for most local governments. Fees and charges are constrained by the cost of providing the services and political concerns over ensuring access. Some view service charges as the most transparent and fair method of raising revenue as people only pay for what they use. However, over-reliance on service charges can limit access for lower-income groups.

In summary, while local governments in the UK have access to several means of raising revenue, their revenue raising powers remain largely under the control of central government. Constraints around taxes like council tax and business rates limit the autonomy of local governments, and dependence on central government grants provides significant influence over local priorities and spending. At the same time, service charges cannot realistically fund the majority of local government activities. There are good arguments on both sides regarding the appropriate balance of central control and local autonomy over revenue and funding. Ultimately, this remains an issue that involves political philosophy around the nature of local democracy as much as technical questions around public finance.
