Alcohol has significant impacts on the brain that psychiatric nurses should understand in order to properly care for patients. When consumed, alcohol is absorbed into the bloodstream and causes changes in the brain that lead to the psychological and physical effects associated with alcohol intoxication. The primary effects alcohol has on the brain involve the disruption of communication between neurons, which can negatively impact a person's mood, behavior, cognition, and coordination.

The primary effect of alcohol in the brain is that it disrupts communication between neurons. Alcohol inhibits the function of chemical messengers in the brain known as neurotransmitters, particularly a neurotransmitter called glutamate. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, stimulating neural activity. By inhibiting glutamate, alcohol slows down neural activity and communication in the brain. 

At lower doses of alcohol, the inhibiting effect primarily impacts higher-level functions in the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain involved in executive functions like reasoning, planning, problem solving, and self-control. This disruption leads to the mild euphoria, decreased inhibitions, and impaired judgment associated with moderate alcohol intoxication. However, as higher amounts of alcohol are consumed, the effects spread to other parts of the brain involved in basic life functions like breathing, heart rate, body temperature regulation, balance, and coordination. This can lead to dangerously slowed breathing and heart rate, lowered body temperature, loss of balance and motor control, and even blackouts or death.

For psychiatric patients, the effects of alcohol on mood and cognition can be particularly problematic. Alcohol's disruption of neurotransmitters like glutamate and GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, can worsen symptoms of depression and anxiety. Alcohol also impacts the brain's reward and pleasure centers, stimulating the release of dopamine that reinforces alcohol-seeking behaviors. This effect underlies the addictive potential of alcohol. Alcohol intoxication can also trigger or worsen psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders.

Due to these significant effects on brain function and mental health, psychiatric nurses must understand the impacts of alcohol in order to properly care for patients. Nurses should carefully screen patients for alcohol use problems, educate patients about the effects of alcohol, and be prepared to manage intoxicated patients to ensure safety. Recognizing the signs of alcohol intoxication and understanding how alcohol disrupts the brain can help nurses provide better care.
