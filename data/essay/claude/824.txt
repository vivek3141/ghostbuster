The rising number of Chinese outbound tourists in recent years has brought substantial benefits to many destinations in the UK, including Oxford. According to official statistics, Chinese tourists made up 287,000 of the total 36.9 million visits to the UK in 2017, spending £660 million (VisitBritain, 2018). Within the UK, Oxford is one of the most popular destinations for Chinese visitors due to its historical architecture, prestigious universities, and Harry Potter connections. 

The motivations and behaviors of Chinese tourists in Oxford can be analyzed using the Mayo and Jarvis (1981) model which categorizes trip characteristics into four types based on the interactions between tourists’ cultural values and motivations. The first type is the “explorer” who seeks authentic experiences different from home and values independence and adventure. The second is the “elite” who pursues prestigious and luxurious experiences and is motivated by status enhancement. The third is the “unusual” who aims for novel and exciting experiences that are not commonly pursued. The last type is the “mass tourist” who prefers familiar experiences for relaxation and socialization.

For Chinese tourists in Oxford, the “elite” and “explorer” types are most relevant. The “elite” tourists are attracted by Oxford’s world-class universities and cultural heritage which they see as symbols of high status. Their trips are well-planned to participate in prestigious and authentic activities like attending lectures, dining at high-table, and staying in luxury hotels. The “explorer” tourists, on the other hand, value independence and seek an in-depth understanding of local history and lifestyle. They spend more time exploring different colleges and museums, walking the historic streets, and try local British cuisine. 

Given the motivations and behaviors of the two major types, “elite” and “explorer” Chinese tourists, destination managers in Oxford should adopt the following marketing strategies:

1. Promote prestigious and luxurious experiences: Emphasize the heritage architecture, famous alumni, and college traditions which appeal to the “elite” tourists. Suggest luxury accommodation options and exclusive activities led by university students. 

2. Highlight unique culture and history: Place more information about the city’s history, university culture, famous landmarks and museums to attract the “explorer” type. Recommend self-guided walking tours and food experiences for them to explore the city at their own pace.

3. Use influential Chinese social media: Leverage Chinese social media like WeChat and Weibo to spread information about Oxford. post in Chinese to capture the attention of potential visitors from China. Engage Chinese key opinion leaders and student ambassadors to share their experiences in Oxford.

4. Provide essential facilities and services: Ensure Chinese language assistance, accept popular Chinese mobile payments, and have Chinese cuisine options which make Chinese tourists feel welcome and comfortable.

In summary, an in-depth understanding of the cultural values, motivations, and behaviors of Chinese tourists in Oxford enables destination managers to adopt targeted marketing strategies. By promoting prestigious and unique experiences, engaging with Chinese social media, and providing familiar facilities, Oxford can establish itself as an appealing destination for both “elite” and “explorer” type tourists from China. The increased number of Chinese visitors, in turn, contributes to the sustainable growth of Oxford's tourism industry.
