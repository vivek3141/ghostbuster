Anne Bradstreet's poem 'The Author to Her Book' uses negative and self-deprecating language throughout to convey the poet's attitude toward her work. The significance of this language is that it highlights Bradstreet's insecurities and anxieties as a female poet in a male-dominated literary world. 

Bradstreet opens the poem by addressing her book as her 'ill-form'd offspring' that she is embarrassed to claim as her own. She describes her work as 'deformed' and 'mis-shapen' and worries that it will be judged as such by readers. This negative view of her own creative output shows Bradstreet's lack of confidence in her own abilities and skill. As a woman poet in the 17th century, she faced substantial prejudices and obstacles. Her use of self-loathing language reflects her internalization of the belief that as a woman, her creative works were somehow illegitimate or subpar.

Bradstreet also blames external forces for the faults she finds in her work. She writes that her book was 'snatch'd' from her 'feeble brain' before it was ready, suggesting her ideas were taken from her prematurely. She also blames her lack of education and her domestic duties as a wife and mother as impediments to her art. The implication is that in a more just world, one where she had equal opportunity and freedom to develop her craft, her work might have turned out better. Her negative language is thus a means of registering the disadvantages she faced and the anxiety she felt about creating literature as a woman.

Ultimately, though, Bradstreet's poem adopts a tone of reluctant acceptance regarding her work. Though initially embarrassed to claim her 'rambling brat,' she acknowledges it as 'the child of my feeble brain.' Her negative language gives way to an understanding that though imperfect, her creative works have value and significance. The journey of the poem mirrors Bradstreet's struggle for confidence and self-actualization as an artist in a society that undervalued and undermined women's creative potential. Through the poem, she comes to claim her status as an author and celebrate her emergence as a pioneering woman poet.
