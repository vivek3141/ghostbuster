Edward Bond's notorious play Outraged poses a radical challenge to traditional Freudian interpretations of the Oedipus complex. Rather than portraying the complex as a psychological struggle, Bond uses it as a metaphor to critique deeper societal problems. The play employs dark humor and violence to make the audience uncomfortable and confront humanity's capacity for depravity. 

At the center of the play is the character Len, a practical and severely flawed everyman. While Len initially appears relatable, even likable, his ordinary nature makes his disturbing actions all the more unsettling. The play suggests that within each ordinary person lies the potential for violence and moral failure.

Len's desire to kill his stepfather, Frank, does not stem from an unconscious sexual rivalry, as in a traditional Oedipal narrative. Rather, Len's animosity arises from Frank's abusive and predatory behavior. Frank is a figure who revels in violence and uses his position of power to exploit others. The play implies that figures like Frank who embody society's darkest aspects arise not from individual pathology but from systemic failings. The real "complex" here is not Oedipal but rather humanity's tendency to turn a blind eye to injustice and moral corruption.

The play's disturbing and violent events implicate the audience through their gradual escalation. At first, Frank's abusive behavior and the suffering of his wife and stepchildren seem sadly familiar, even mundane. But as the violence crescendos, the audience realizes with discomfort that their initial nonchalance makes them complicit. The play suggests ordinary people can become desensitized to extraordinary cruelty, and inaction in the face of injustice enables its perpetuation.

Len's eventual parricide is not a victory but another disturbing moral failure. While Frank is a cruel man who deserves punishment, violence should not be met with more violence. Len's actions jeopardize his own humanity, even as he rids the world of a moral monster. The play proposes no easy answers and refuses neat resolutions, leaving the audience unsettled with more questions than solutions.

In sum, Outraged utilizes a subversive reinterpretation of the Oedipus story to challenge society's moral failings. With its unsettling events and unlikeable yet ordinary characters, the play implicates the audience's own darkness and capacity to ignore injustice. By the play's end, the true "complex" in question is humanity's tendency to remain outraged at metaphorical monsters like Oedipus, all while enabling real monsters like Frank. Bond suggests the Oedipus complex may reveal less about psychological drives than our unsettling societal tendencies - tendencies the play brutally and humorously exposes.
