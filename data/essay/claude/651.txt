The synthesis of the core structure of salicylihalamide, a complex marine natural product with anticancer properties, was reported in 2012 by Ishmael, McDonald, Dunbar, and co-workers. The key elements of this synthesis include a convergent approach to assemble the core tricyclic structure of salicylihalamide from simpler precursors in a stereocontrolled fashion. 

The synthesis began with a cyclohexene derivative which was first epoxidized and then the epoxide was opened with a vinyl Grignard reagent to introduce the carbon-carbon double bond found in one of the fused rings. The cyclohexenol derivative was then subjected to a gold-catalyzed hydroalkoxylation to form the fused tetracycle in one step. While this represents an efficient strategy to construct the fused ring system, the low yield (42%) of this key step reduces the overall efficiency of the synthesis.

The tetracycle was then elaborated through multiple synthetic steps to install the side chains and the salicylic acid moiety found in the natural product. The side chain containing a terminal alkene group was introduced through a Wittig reaction, and then further functionalized to the ketone found in the natural product. The salicylic acid group was appended through a Heck arylation, which efficiently added the aromatic ring. The key elements of stereocontrol in this synthesis were the hydroalkoxylation reaction which set two stereocenters, and the subsequent synthetic steps were not noted to affect the stereochemistry. 

The reported synthesis represents an efficient route to establish the tricyclic core of salicylihalamide in 14 linear steps and with full stereochemical control. However, some limitations detract from its overall efficiency. The yield of the gold-catalyzed hydroalkoxylation could likely be improved through further optimization, and the introduction of protecting groups for certain alcohols and amines could prevent undesired reactivity and improve yields. More detail on the characterization of key intermediates would strengthen the synthesis. Overall though, this work represents an impressive achievement towards the total synthesis of this complex natural product. With further refinement, this strategy could become a general route to access the diverse azoline marine alkaloids.

In summary, the reported synthesis establishes the fused tricyclic core of salicylihalamide through a convergent retrosynthetic approach from simple precursors. The key strengths are the one-step gold-catalyzed hydroalkoxylation to form the central ring fusion, and the stereoselective nature of the synthesis. Limitations include moderate yields for some steps, the possibility of increased protecting group use, and an overall lack of characterization data for key intermediates. The methodology demonstrates a viable route to access the structural class of salicylihalamide natural products.
