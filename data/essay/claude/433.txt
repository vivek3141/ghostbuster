Eamon de Valera and Michael Collins were two of the most significant leaders in Irish history during the early 20th century. Both played pivotal roles in Ireland's struggle for independence from Britain, though they differed significantly in their approaches and visions for Ireland's future. De Valera and Collins have been portrayed in very different lights in historical commentary, with de Valera often receiving more negative or critical depictions compared to the heroic status frequently attributed to Collins. However, de Valera's comments about Collins upon the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising in 1966, in which he acknowledged Collins' skill and talent, have been corroborated to some extent by historiography. Though they were political rivals, de Valera and Collins shared an ambition for an independent Ireland. By analyzing their political achievements, mystique, and considering the context in which they operated, we can gain a fuller understanding of their complex and consequential roles in Irish history.  

Eamon de Valera and Michael Collins were both instrumental leaders in the Irish independence movement, though they took very different approaches. De Valera believed in gradualism and maintaining the moral high ground, as evidenced by his rejection of the Anglo-Irish Treaty that Collins helped negotiate. Collins, on the other hand, was a military leader who believed armed conflict was necessary to achieve independence. Collins organized guerrilla warfare tactics and the assassination of British intelligence agents during the Irish War of Independence from 1919 to 1921. Though their methods differed, de Valera and Collins shared the political ambition of establishing an independent Irish nation. 

De Valera served as President of Dáil Éireann and later Taoiseach for nearly 40 years between 1919 to 1959, making him one of Ireland's longest-serving leaders. However, his legacy remains controversial and complex. He has been criticized for lacking coherent social and economic policies, for being too focused on disengagement from Britain, and for being out of touch with public opinion at times. De Valera's devout Catholicism and desire to make Ireland a Gaelic, Catholic nation also garnered criticism. At the same time, de Valera's political achievements were substantial. He led the anti-Treaty side during the Irish Civil War, helped draft the Irish constitution in 1937 which established Ireland's status as an independent republic, and maintained Irish neutrality during World War II against pressure from Britain. 

In contrast, Collins' short but highly significant career and his death at a young age helped cement his status as an Irish martyr and hero. His skilled military and political leadership during the War of Independence, followed by his work negotiating the Anglo-Irish Treaty, established Collins as one of the primary architects of Irish independence. Collins' death during the Civil War only added to his mystique as a patriotic leader who sacrificed his life for Ireland. However, had he lived, Collins may have faced many of the same political, social and economic issues and criticisms as de Valera during an inevitably complex post-independence reality.   

While history has often portrayed de Valera's legacy in a more negative light compared to the heroic status of Michael Collins, there are several reasons why de Valera deserves to be remembered more sympathetically and as an impactful leader in his own right. De Valera's political achievements in helping establish and shape an independent Irish republic were substantial, even if his policies and vision were not always aligned with majority opinion. His devout Catholicism and desire to emphasize Ireland's distinct cultural identity were understandable in the context of centuries of British rule. ...
