Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of the hand face significant challenges in managing their condition and following the recommended treatment regime provided by their therapists and physicians. The primary treatments for RA of the hands are exercise, splinting, and medication. However, studies show that patient adherence to these treatments is often poor due to physical, mental, and social barriers. 

Many patients struggle to perform the recommended hand exercises regularly due to the pain and difficulty involved. The hand joints and muscles in RA patients are inflamed and damaged, making movement painful and strenuous. Patients report that they cannot exercise for as long or as vigorously as prescribed. Others find the exercises too complicated or time-consuming to perform daily. The chronic pain from RA also contributes to decreased motivation to exercise. These physical barriers make it hard for patients to adhere to the exercise regime suggested by their therapists.

Using splints and braces on the hands can also be uncomfortable, inconvenient, and embarrassing for patients. The splints can be bulky, difficult to put on independently, and draw unwanted attention to the patient's condition. Patients may feel that the splints highlight their disability and deformities, causing distress. Due to these factors, patients frequently do not wear their splints for as long as recommended or may stop using them altogether. 

In addition to physical barriers, there are mental health challenges that negatively impact treatment adherence. Many patients with chronic illnesses like RA experience depression or anxiety, which reduce motivation and energy levels. Patients may feel hopeless or helpless about their condition, leading them to question the value of recommended treatments. The stress and daily struggles of living with RA also make it difficult to prioritize exercises, splinting, and self-care. These mental barriers demonstrate why patients may not follow the suggested treatment regime.

Patients' social circumstances similarly play a role in adherence to treatment. Some patients lack social support from family and friends to help them follow recommendations. Others struggle with financial hardship, lack of transportation, or time constraints from work and family responsibilities. These social barriers make exercising, attending appointments, and managing RA treatments challenging. 

In summary, RA patients face significant physical, mental, and social barriers to following the recommended exercise, splinting, and self-management treatments suggested by their healthcare providers. While these treatments have been shown to reduce symptoms and slow disease progression, their benefits cannot be realized if patients do not adhere to them. Healthcare providers should address these barriers through patient education and support. They can teach simple, practical exercises, provide psychosocial support, and identify social resources for at-risk patients. By understanding patients' experiences and tailoring treatments, providers can empower RA patients to live better lives despite chronic illness.
