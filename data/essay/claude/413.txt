Evaluate the usefulness of grand theories of integration in analysing European Union (EU) policy making. 

The major theories of European integration, namely federalism, functionalism, neo-functionalism, intergovernmentalism and liberal intergovernmentalism, have made substantial contributions to understanding the complex process of policy making in the EU. However, none provide a complete explanation on their own. Each theory offers useful insights that shed light on certain aspects of EU governance, but also have weaknesses that limit their explanatory power. 

Federalism envisions the EU developing into a federation, like the United States, with an integrated political system and shared sovereignty among the member states. While it anticipated ambitious governance reforms that led to increasing authority of EU institutions, its assumption of an inevitable progression towards a federal end-state is flawed. The EU remains an intergovernmental organisation where member states are reluctant to transfer powers to the supranational level. Federalism therefore has limited relevance in explaining the uneven nature of EU integration.

In contrast, functionalism and neo-functionalism place greater emphasis on supranational governance and the autonomy of EU institutions. They argue that integrating particular sectors of the economy and society in a functional manner can create a momentum for broader political integration through 'spillover effects'. These theories made an important contribution in explaining the early success of integration in areas such as coal and steel production. However, they underestimate the role of member states and cannot account for situations where spillover does not occur or even reverses.  

Intergovernmentalism offers a corrective by portraying EU integration as a process dominated by intergovernmental negotiations between member states. Decision making power remains with the national governments who cooperate to the extent that it is in their self-interest. This theory provides a persuasive account of periods where member states reassert control over the integration process. However, its state-centrism implies that countries have complete control over outcomes and ignores the influence of EU institutions and supranational actors altogether. 

Liberal intergovernmentalism attempts to reconcile this tension between intergovernmental and supranational governance. It acknowledges that states are the primary actors in EU policy making but argues they do not act in isolation. Instead,  institutions and interest groups influence states' preferences and bargaining positions during intergovernmental negotiations. This theory offers a elegant framework that can accommodate both power and preferences, national governments and EU institutions. Nevertheless, its focus on large-scale institutional bargains risks missing incremental policy developments.

In conclusion, while federalism was too optimistic, functionalism and neo-functionalism were too dismissive of national governments. Intergovernmentalism went too far in the opposite direction by portraying member states as acting alone. Liberal intergovernmentalism provides a useful synthesis but cannot capture the full complexity of EU policy making. Overall, there is no single theory that coherently and comprehensively explains European integration. The process is too multifaceted for any one approach to illuminate all of its dimensions. A coherent understanding requires consideration of multiple theories and perspectives.
