The Leniency Notice in the European Union antitrust law allows cartel members to report their illegal cartel activities in exchange for immunity from fines or a significant reduction in fines. It is a tool used by the European Commission to detect and investigate cartels by incentivizing cartel members to come forward with information. 

The Leniency Notice was first introduced in 1996 and revised in 2002 and 2006 to strengthen the incentives for companies to apply for leniency. Under the Notice, the first company to provide information about a cartel's illegal activities (called the 'whistleblower')  is granted total immunity from fines. The subsequent applicants can receive a reduction of up to 50% in fines depending on the timing of their application and the value added to the investigation. The Notice covers secret cartels that affect trade between EU member states. Immunity is only granted if the company is the first to provide information that allows the Commission to conduct targeted inspections. The company must also satisfy other requirements such as fully cooperating throughout the investigation and ceasing involvement in the cartel immediately.

The Leniency Notice has been quite successful in uncovering cartel activity in Europe compared to the pre-leniency era. Between 1969 to 1999, the Commission was able to prosecute around 3 cartels per year. After the introduction of the Leniency Notice, the number rose to 13 convictions per year between 2000 to 2019. Some of the most notable cases were uncovered due to leniency applications, such as the trucks, vitamin B3 and smart card chips cartels. However, the Notice also has significant limitations compared to the antitrust leniency programs in the United States. The scope of immunity under the EU Notice is more limited and the discretion of the Commission in granting leniency is greater relative to more transparent US policies. The lack of criminal sanctions for cartels under EU law also weakens the deterrent effect of the Notice.

There are also concerns surrounding the retributive effects of granting leniency to offenders involved in such a serious violation of laws. However, the Notice balances these concerns by demanding offenders to fulfill responsibilities such as immediately ending their participation in the cartel and fully cooperating during the investigation. Although they escape the largest fines, leniency recipients still face civil damages in lawsuits and sustained damage to their reputation. Their cartel activity is still prohibited and investigated.  

Overall, the Leniency Notice program, despite its limitations, has been reasonably effective in exposing cartel conduct that would otherwise remain concealed. However, there is room for improvement to optimize its deterrent effects and address all retributive concerns. Continued efforts such as revising the Notice to enhance transparency, clarity and predictability, increasing sanctions beyond administrative fines, and facilitating private damages actions will help maximise the effectiveness of the EU cartel enforcement regime. In conclusion, the Leniency Notice plays an important role in cartel detection, but should continue improving to achieve comprehensive, fair and deterrent cartel policy objectives.
