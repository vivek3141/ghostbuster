The Beefeater pub in Cascais, Portugal currently employs several strategies for capacity management to optimize staffing levels and ensure high customer satisfaction, especially during busy evening periods. However, further optimization of the staffing system could help lower costs and improve resource utilization when serving drinks.

The Beefeater schedules staff in advance based on historical attendance data for different days of the week and times. More staff are scheduled on Friday and Saturday evenings when the pub is typically very busy. Staffing levels are lower during weekday afternoons and evenings when attendance is lower. This scheduling strategy helps ensure the Beefeater has adequate staffing to meet customer demand during peak periods but does not overstaff during off-peak times. Forecasting attendance and staffing levels in advance based on historical data is an effective strategy for maximizing resource utilization. 

During busy periods, the Beefeater also employs a floating bartender who can help at different bar stations as needed. If one bar station becomes very busy, the floating bartender provides additional support to help minimize customer wait times. The floating bartender is also available to help greet customers, take drink orders, and serve drinks to tables. This helps optimize staff utilization and ensures high customer satisfaction even when the pub is very busy.

In terms of process optimization, the Beefeater could implement a ticket numbering system for customers awaiting drink orders at the bar. This would allow customers to sit back down at their tables instead of crowding the bar area while waiting for their drinks. The ticket numbers could be called over the PA system when the drinks are ready to be picked up at the bar. This could improve the customer experience by reducing congestion at the bar and wait times for drinks. It may also reduce the number of staff needed at the bar at any given time, allowing more staff to focus on taking orders and serving at tables.

An additional strategy to optimize the drink serving process could be implementing a drink running system where one or two staff act as dedicated drink runners to deliver drinks from the bar directly to customer tables. This could further reduce crowding at the bar area and ensure faster drink delivery to customers at their tables. However, there is a cost to dedicating staff solely to running drinks. Analysis would need to be done to determine if the benefits of improved customer experience and resource utilization outweigh the additional staffing costs before implementing such a system.

In summary, the Beefeater employs effective capacity management strategies like data-driven staff scheduling, floating bartenders, and flexible staff roles. However, implementing additional process optimizations like a ticket numbering system for bar orders and dedicated drink runners could help lower staffing needs at the bar, reduce crowding, minimize wait times, and further improve the customer experience during busy evenings. With an optimized staffing system and serving process, the Beefeater would be well equipped to efficiently meet customer demand while maximizing resource utilization.
