The relationship between sleep and learning has been demonstrated by numerous studies. Sleep plays an important role in memory consolidation, which is the process of stabilizing and cementing memories after they have been encoded for long-term storage. Different stages of sleep appear to aid the consolidation of different types of memories. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in particular has been implicated in the consolidation of procedural and visuo-motor memories. 

REM sleep is characterized by rapid eye movements, an activated brain state, and muscle paralysis. It makes up about 20-25% of total sleep time in humans and occurs in periods throughout the night, with longer periods towards the end of sleep. Studies investigating the link between REM sleep and learning have largely focused on procedural tasks that incorporate a visual-spatial component. For example, Karni et al. (1994) found that participants who were trained on a visual discrimination task and then deprived of REM sleep did not show the same performance improvements on the task as non-deprived participants. Wamsley et al. (2010) found increased brain activity related to a visual maze task during post-training REM sleep. These findings point to a role for REM sleep in consolidating visual-spatial procedural memories.

However, the relationship is complex, as other studies have found links between non-REM slow-wave sleep stages 3 and 4 and procedural learning. For example, Fenn et al. (2003) found that retention on a motor sequence task was reduced in participants deprived of just slow-wave sleep compared to control and REM-deprived groups. The conflicting findings may relate to methodological differences, such as the learning tasks used. REM sleep deprivation in particular is difficult to achieve without affecting other stages. As such, the precise contribution of REM versus other sleep stages to procedural memory consolidation remains unclear.  

At a biological level, REM sleep appears to facilitate the consolidation of procedural and visual-spatial memories through neural reactivation and connectivity changes. During REM sleep, the cortex exhibits similar activation patterns to those observed during wakeful visual-spatial learning tasks. This reactivation may help to strengthen the neural connections involved in the learning. The pontine brainstem also releases acetylcholine during REM sleep, which is important for memory consolidation and plasticity. The release of other neurotransmitters like norepinephrine may also play a role.

Disruptions to normal sleep cycles, whether through sleep deprivation, disease, or other factors can have negative impacts on learning and memory. REM sleep deprivation early in development when large amounts of procedural learning are taking place may be particularly detrimental. In older adults, reductions in slow-wave sleep that come with age may also reduce procedural learning and plasticity. Understanding the complex relationship between the different stages of sleep and types of learning and memory is crucial for developing interventions that may help mitigate the negative cognitive effects of sleep disturbances. 

In conclusion, while REM sleep has been most strongly linked to the consolidation of visual-spatial procedural memories, the relationship between sleep stages and learning is complex. Different stages are implicated in the consolidation of different types of memories, and methodological limitations make it difficult to ascertain the precise contributions of specific stages. At a biological level, REM sleep appears to facilitate memory consolidation through neural reactivation, connectivity changes, and neurotransmitter activity - but similar processes are involved in other sleep stages. A clearer understanding of these relationships will help in developing interventions for individuals with disrupted sleep.
