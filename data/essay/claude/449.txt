When conducting any form of psychological research, whether qualitative or quantitative, several important factors must be considered to ensure the investigation is rigorous and trustworthy. Reliability and validity are two key concepts that differ in application between qualitative and quantitative approaches. Qualitative research can achieve reliability and validity, though in different ways than quantitative methods. Each approach also has distinct advantages and disadvantages, and there are circumstances when one method may be more appropriate than the other. Developing a 'New Science' that incorporates both qualitative and quantitative techniques could provide a more holistic understanding of psychological phenomena.  

In quantitative research, reliability refers to the consistency and replicability of findings, often assessed using statistical measures. Validity means the research measures what it is intended to measure. In qualitative research, reliability is achieved through transparency about the researcher's perspectives and detailed descriptions of methods and analyses so others can replicate the study. Validity is established through strategies like triangulation using multiple data sources, member checking by asking participants to review interpretations, and searching for alternative explanations. While quantitative validity and reliability can be numerically quantified, qualitative validity and reliability require rigorous methodology, constant re-evaluation of the researcher's biases, and in-depth engagement with and observation of the subject of inquiry.

Qualitative research is well-suited for exploring complex social phenomena, understanding people's experiences, giving voice to marginalized groups, and generating new theories. However, it can be difficult to generalize from qualitative findings, and studies are often limited by small sample sizes. Quantitative research excels at testing hypotheses, generalizing results to wider populations, and producing precise numerical data. Yet, it often fails to capture the richness and complexity of human experiences. Using only one method can limit understanding and lead to an incomplete or skewed view of the topic under study.

A 'New Science' incorporating qualitative and quantitative methods could provide a holistic understanding of psychology by leveraging the strengths of each approach while overcoming their shortcomings. For example, qualitative research could explore a new topic and generate hypotheses, which are then tested through a quantitative experimental study with a larger sample. The qualitative findings might also help interpret the quantitative results by adding context and meaning. Combining methods in this way, through a mixed methods research design, will produce knowledge that is both broad and deep, contextualized and generalizable, descriptive and predictive. 

To conclude, a psychology that employs both qualitative and quantitative techniques, through a mixed methods 'New Science,' will yield a fuller understanding of the human mind and behavior. Achieving reliability and validity in any research requires rigorous methodology, constant reflection, and a commitment to capturing the complexity of the subject matter. Both qualitative and quantitative approaches offer unique advantages for investigating psychological phenomena when thoughtfully and ethically applied. An integrated methodological framework can leverage these strengths to generate new insights that tapping into each alone cannot provide.
