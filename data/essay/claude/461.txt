The five human senses - sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch - rely on complex cell signalling mechanisms to detect environmental stimuli and communicate that information to the brain. While there are some similarities in how these signalling pathways work across the different senses, there are also important differences in how they are activated, amplified, and terminated.  

Vision begins when photons of light strike photoreceptor cells in the retina called rods and cones. This activates a signalling cascade that converts the light signal into an electrical signal. The electrical signal is amplified and transmitted to bipolar cells and then ganglion cells, whose axons bundle to form the optic nerve connecting the eye to the visual cortex. The visual signalling pathway requires the activation of G-protein coupled receptors and ion channels, as well as the secondary messenger cGMP. The signal is amplified through these cell receptors and ion channels, but is eventually terminated by phosphodiesterases that break down cGMP.   

The sense of hearing is activated by sound waves deflecting off hair cells in the inner ear, which triggers the opening of mechanically-gated ion channels. This leads to an influx of potassium ions and the generation of an electrical signal that is amplified and sent to the auditory cortex. The signalling in the auditory system is terminated through the pumping of ions back across the cell membrane to restore the cell's resting state. Unlike the visual pathway, hearing does not involve secondary messengers and instead relies directly on ion channels.  

Olfaction or the sense of smell involves the activation of G-protein coupled receptors and ion channels by odorant molecules binding to receptors in the olfactory epithelium. This triggers a signalling cascade involving cyclic AMP as a secondary messenger, which amplifies the signal and results in changes to ion concentrations. The signal is terminated by phosphodiesterases degrading cAMP and ion pumps restoring ion balance. Taste works in a similar fashion, with taste stimuli activating G-protein coupled receptors and ion channels on taste buds that trigger secondary messengers like cAMP to amplify the signal.

The sense of touch is activated by physical pressure, temperature, or vibration stimulating touch receptors under the skin. This leads to the opening of ion channels, allowing ions such as sodium and potassium to flow into the cell and generate an electrical signal. The signal is amplified and transmitted through the spinal cord and thalamus to the somatosensory cortex. Signal termination involves ion pumps restoring the cell's ion concentrations. In contrast to the other senses, no secondary messengers are involved in touch sensation.  

In summary, while there are some commonalities in the use of G-protein coupled receptors, ion channels, and secondary messengers for cell signalling across the senses, there are differences in how each sensory pathway is activated, amplified, and terminated depending on the nature of the stimuli they detect. Vision and olfaction share more similarities as they both rely on cyclic secondary messengers, whereas hearing and touch have simpler signalling mechanisms primarily involving ion channels. A comprehensive understanding of how these diverse signalling mechanisms work together is key to understanding the complexity and richness of human sensation and perception.
