Beta analysis is a useful tool for evaluating the relative risk of different stocks in a portfolio. The beta value of a stock measures the sensitivity of the stock's price to the overall movements of the market, as measured by a broad market index like the S&P 500. Stocks with a beta greater than 1 are more volatile than the market, while stocks with a beta less than 1 are less volatile. Beta can help investors determine which stocks may increase their portfolio risk and which may offset risk.  

Among the three stocks—Hilton, Texas Instruments, and Giant Foods—beta analysis would suggest that Texas Instruments likely has the highest beta, indicating it is the most volatile and highest risk stock of the three. Hilton and Giant Foods, as a hotel chain and grocery store, respectively, likely have betas less than 1, indicating they are more stable and lower risk. To determine the actual beta values for these stocks, we can use regression analysis to calculate the slope of the line between the weekly returns of each stock and the S&P 500 over the past few years. The steeper the slope of the regression line, the higher the beta.

For example, if Texas Instruments had a slope of 1.2, this would indicate that for every 1% increase in the S&P 500, Texas Instruments returns increase 1.2% on average. This would give Texas Instruments a beta of 1.2, confirming it as the highest beta, most volatile stock. In contrast, if Hilton and Giant Foods had slopes of 0.5 and 0.8 respectively, their betas would be less than 1 at 0.5 and 0.8. With betas less than 1, Hilton and Giant Foods would be considered more defensive, stable stocks.

In summary, beta analysis through regression tools can help determine the amount of market risk associated with different stocks. For an investor looking to balance a portfolio with stable and more volatile stocks, beta analysis would suggest emphasizing stocks with betas around 1, while adding stocks with higher and lower betas based on the investor's risk tolerance. The higher the beta, the more volatile and risky the stock, but also the greater potential for higher returns. Using beta to compare Hilton, Texas  Instruments and Giant Foods, Texas Instruments likely has the highest beta, while Hilton and Giant Foods likely have lower, more stable betas based on their business models. Beta analysis gives investors another tool to make strategic allocation decisions in creating a balanced portfolio.
