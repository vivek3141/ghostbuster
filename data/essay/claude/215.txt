The doctrines of consideration and intention to create legal relations are key components of contract law. They relate to the formation of contracts and aim to determine whether parties to an agreement intended to enter into a legally enforceable contract.  

The doctrine of consideration requires that for a contract to be legally binding and enforceable, each party must provide something of value in exchange for a promise. In other words, a promise on its own is generally not enough to form a contract – something must be given in return, such as money or goods. For example, in the case of Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co (1893), Mrs Carlill provided consideration in the form of money paid for the smoke balls. In return, the Carbolic Smoke Ball Co promised that the smoke balls would prevent influenza. This formed an enforceable contract.

The doctrine of intention to create legal relations considers whether the parties intended to be legally bound by their agreement. Not all promises and agreements made between parties are intended to be legally enforceable. Some are made on the basis of trust or goodwill. The key factors for determining intention include whether the agreement is domestic or commercial, whether it is written or oral, and the wording and content of the agreement. For instance, in Balfour v Balfour (1919) a husband promised to provide his wife with £30 per month while he was away. This was found to be a domestic agreement and there was no intention to create a legally binding contract. Compare this with Esso Petroleum v Commissioners of Customs and Excise (1976) where an exchange of letters between Esso and the Commissioners was deemed to demonstrate an intention to create legal relations due to the commercial and formal nature of the correspondence.

The doctrines are related in that they both seek to determine whether a legally enforceable contract exists between parties. However, intention to create legal relations focuses on the mindset of the parties, whereas consideration concentrates on whether something of value has actually been exchanged. Critics argue that these doctrines are flawed and unreliable. Intention can be difficult to prove and open to interpretation, while the requirement for consideration does not account for gratuitous promises that should be enforceable.  Despite criticisms, the doctrines remain fundamental to contract law and the finding of legally binding agreements. They aim to strike a balance between upholding promises and avoiding unfairness. Overall, the doctrines of consideration and intention to create legal relations, supported by case law, are essential to determining whether an agreement constitutes an enforceable contract.
