The French Revolution of 1789 brought radical changes to the political, social, and cultural fabric of France. The major revolutionary changes include the overthrow of the monarchy, the establishment of a republic, shifts in political power that gave more representation to the common people, reinforcement and expansion of the ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity, and major changes to social class structures. 

The French monarchy had ruled France for centuries, with the king holding absolute power under the divine right of kings. However, the monarchy had failed to deal with a financial crisis in the 1780s that led to famine and suffering, especially among the common people. Resentment of the lavish spending of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette fueled revolutionary fervor. In 1789, the storming of the Bastille prison symbolized the start of the revolution against the monarchy. In 1792, the monarchy was overthrown, and in 1793 King Louis XVI was tried and executed for treason. The revolution established a republic in France centered around democratic representation and citizenship.

The revolution shifted political power from the aristocracy to the broader population of citizens. The Estates-General, made up of representatives from the three estates of clergy, nobility, and commoners, had last met in 1614. But in 1789, the Estates-General was convened to deal with the financial crisis. The commoners' representatives proclaimed themselves the National Assembly and took the Tennis Court Oath, vowing not to disperse until a new constitution was established. The National Assembly went on to pass laws abolishing feudalism and the old aristocratic system, establishing the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and setting up a constitutional monarchy. Political power was being transferred from the aristocracy to the common citizens of France.

The ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity became rallying cries of the revolution. The revolution aimed to promote equal rights and representation under the law, freedom of speech and press, and brotherhood among citizens. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen proclaimed liberty, equality, and fraternity as the core principles of the revolution. Key revolutionary steps like abolishing feudalism and hereditary titles and privileges struck down the social class system and aimed to achieve greater equality and freedom for citizens. The revolution sought to rebuild society with the ideals of a democratic republic rooted in the rights and will of citizens.  

The social class system in France was fundamentally changed by the revolution. The hereditary aristocracy was abolished, and feudal systems of obligation and taxation were ended. The Declaration of the Rights of Man proclaimed equality under the law for all citizens. But at the same time, the opportunities and power newly opened up to common men also excluded women. And violence grew more extreme against perceived enemies of the revolution, especially nobility, clergy, and political dissidents. Moderate and radical phases of the revolution impacted how quickly and violently changes were implemented. But the overall thrust was to dismantle the old class system in the name of egalitarianism.

In conclusion, the French Revolution brought about radical changes that shaped the modern democratic republic of France. The overthrow of the monarchy, shift of power to citizens, spread of Enlightenment ideals, and dismantling of the old class system were revolutionary transformations that marked a new epoch of liberty, equality, and democracy in France. The Enlightenment values of reason, liberty, equality, and representative government fueled the revolutionary zeal to remake society according to these democratic principles. The French Revolution left a lasting legacy for democracy in its wake.
