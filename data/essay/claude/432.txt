Hedley Bull's theory of international politics, as articulated in his seminal work The Anarchical Society, is one that is state-centric and focused on order. For Bull, the primary actors in the international system are states sovereign over their internal affairs and external actions. While there are other actors such as intergovernmental organizations, multinational corporations, and non-state actors, states remain the most powerful and important actors shaping world politics. Given the anarchical nature of the international system, with no overarching authority above states, order is a key concern. Bull argues that order arises from the society of states, as states cooperate to establish certain rules, norms, and institutions to facilitate cooperation and constrain conflict. 

However, the pursuit of order can come at the expense of justice. When states come together to establish order, they do so based on their own interests and priorities. Weaker states may have little choice but to accept the order and rules imposed by stronger powers. The enforcement of order is also often accompanied by the use of force, coercion, and violence, which raises ethical concerns. There is an inherent tension, then, between the pursuit of order and the pursuit of justice in international relations according to Bull's theory.

Bull acknowledges this tension but ultimately prioritizes order over justice. He argues that without a basic level of order, there can be little justice. Order is a prerequisite for other goals like justice, welfare, and morality. Bull also contends that while domestic societies place a high value on justice, the international system is not orientated towards justice in the same way. The decentralization of power among states and the lack of community bonds between states mean that order takes precedence. 

However, Bull's theory has been criticized as overly realist in its focus on states and power, ignoring the role of non-state actors and ethical concerns. His prioritization of order over justice is seen by some as problematic. While order may be necessary, justice is also crucial for human well-being and flourishing. His state-centric theory also underestimates the importance of globalization in eroding state sovereignty and national borders.

In conclusion, Hedley Bull's international theory addresses the tension between order and justice by placing a clear primacy on order. His state-centric theory sees states as the primary actors in global politics concerned mainly with ensuring order in an anarchical world. However, his theory has been criticized for emphasizing order at the expense of justice and ethics and for being too state-centric. The tension between order and justice will likely continue as global politics evolves.
