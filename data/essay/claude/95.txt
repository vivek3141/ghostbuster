Parmenides of Elea was an ancient Greek philosopher who lived around the 5th century BC. He is best known for his ideas about change and permanence articulated in his poem On Nature. In this work, Parmenides lays out his view of reality which he calls "the Way of Truth." He argues that the ultimate reality is one, unchanging, and indivisible. This view stands in contrast with the everyday experience of plurality, change, and motion that he calls "the Way of Seeming." 

Parmenides' poem is divided into two parts. In the first part, he describes the Way of Truth which represents true reality and knowledge. He argues that what truly is must be unchanging and indivisible. He reaches this conclusion through a deductive argument. He starts with the premises that "what is" cannot come from "what is not" and that "what is" cannot become "what is not." From these premises, he reasons that true reality must be one, continuous, unchanging, and indivisible. There cannot be plurality or change in what truly exists. Motion and change are but illusions according to the Way of Truth.

While Parmenides focuses on the logical coherence of the Way of Truth, he recognizes that it does not match our everyday experiences of the world. We perceive plurality, change, and motion all around us. To account for this, Parmenides proposes the Way of Seeming - the realm of mere appearances and illusions. The world we perceive with our senses is not the world as it really is according to Parmenides. The Way of Seeming represents the false beliefs of mortals who rely on their fallible senses. They are deceived into thinking that the changing world they perceive represents ultimate reality. In truth, it is but a façade that obscures the unchanging reality of the Way of Truth.

Parmenides includes the Way of Seeming in his poem to contrast it with the Way of Truth and warn us against being taken in by appearances and illusions. While the rational argument for the Way of Truth may be logically valid, our everyday experiences suggest a different view of the world. The Way of Seeming represents this alternative but false view - one that assumes plurality, change, and motion are real. By articulating both the Way of Truth and the Way of Seeming, Parmenides highlights the difference between the world as it really is (the Way of Truth) and the world as it appears to be (the Way of Seeming). The latter is a mere illusion that leads us away from true understanding according to Parmenides.

In summary, Parmenides presents a rational argument for an ultimate reality that is one, unchanging and indivisible - this is the Way of Truth. But he also includes the Way of Seeming, the world of appearances and illusions, in order to contrast it with the Way of Truth and warn against being misled by our senses. The Way of Seeming represents the false beliefs of mortals who assume the changing world of experience represents ultimate reality. But according to Parmenides, true understanding comes from grasping the eternal, unchanging reality of the Way of Truth behind the façade of the Way of Seeming.
