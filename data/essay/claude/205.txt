The period between 1760 and 1830 in Britain saw the rise of industrialization and the introduction of new manufacturing processes that led to massive economic and social changes. This era is commonly referred to as the Industrial Revolution, and during these 70 years Britain transitioned from a predominantly agricultural and handicraft-based economy to one increasingly dominated by machine-based manufacturing and the factory system. While this revolution began in Britain and then spread to the rest of the world, the extent to which this period can be labeled as 'the' Industrial Revolution in Britain is debatable. 

On the one hand, this era saw the rise of mechanization and the factory system, especially in the textile industry. New processes like the flying shuttle, the spinning jenny, and the cotton gin increased the efficiency and scale of textile production. The steam engine was also developed and improved during this time, providing a cheap and efficient source of power for the new factories and machinery. These innovations and the rise of factories led to a massive increase in manufactured goods and economic growth. Powered machinery and the division of labor allowed for far greater productivity and scale, transforming traditionally domestic trades into a factory-based industry. 

However, while significant, these changes were still limited in scope during this period. Textiles was one of the only industries to adopt machinery and factories on a wide scale. Most production was still based in small workshops and manual trades. The vast majority of workers still worked in agriculture - as late as 1851, half the British workforce still worked in farming. Steam power was still relatively limited, and horse and water remained important sources of power for most businesses. Transportation and infrastructure also remained quite basic. So, while parts of the economy were rapidly industrializing, most British workers still lived and worked in a predominantly agricultural and craft-based world. 

In conclusion, while the 70 years between 1760 and 1830 saw truly revolutionary changes in British industry with the rise of mechanization, the factory system, and steam power, the extent to which this can be labeled as 'the' Industrial Revolution is limited. These changes were initially confined to just a few sectors, regions, and sections of society. Most of Britain at the time remained agricultural and craft-based. So, this era witnessed the start of industrialization and what would become a massive social and economic revolution, but the transformation was still ongoing and limited by the standards of today. Britain was on the path to an industrial society but still had a long way to go to become a fully industrialized nation.
