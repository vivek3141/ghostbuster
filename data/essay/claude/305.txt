The emergence of sociology as a distinct scientific discipline in the 19th century was the result of several important factors. First, the Enlightenment ideals of reason and scientific empiricism led thinkers to apply the scientific method to the study of human society and social relations. There was a belief that social phenomena could be studied objectively using rational and logical reasoning. Major Enlightenment thinkers like Montesquieu applied reason and empirical observation to the study of social institutions and their influence on society. 

Second, the social upheavals of the French and Industrial Revolutions in Europe led to disruptions of traditional social patterns and norms. This led to an increased awareness of the importance of understanding social dynamics and the functioning of society. Philosophers sought to understand the underlying principles that governed society amid the social chaos and rapid changes. The revolutions thus stimulated new thinking about social relations and institutions.

Third, advances in other fields of study like biology, psychology, and economics influenced early sociological thinking. Concepts like evolution, behavior, and class conflict were applied to the analysis of human society. For instance, Herbert Spencer adopted evolutionary ideas to propose a theory of progressive social evolution from simple to complex forms. Karl Marx applied concepts from political economy to argue that class conflict drove historical social change. These cross-disciplinary influences shaped the early theoretical frameworks of sociology.   

Fourth, urbanization and industrialization in the 19th century led to the growth of cities, the movement of people to new environments, the development of new social classes, and the weakening of traditional community ties. This fostered awareness of emerging social problems like poverty, alienation, and class stratification. It also made social dynamics and interactions more complex and diverse. Sociology emerged to study these new modern phenomena and understand how society was being transformed by these massive social changes. 

Finally, new statistical and data gathering techniques were developed that allowed for the collection and analysis of social data on a large scale. This permitted early sociologists to find social patterns from empirical data, rather than relying mainly on philosophical reasoning. Pioneers like Adolphe Quetelet used social statistics to uncover social regularities and laws that govern society. These new research methods were pivotal to establishing sociology as an empirical science.

In conclusion, the emergence of sociology in the 19th century was spurred by various philosophical, political, scientific, and social factors coming together. Sociology arose as the scientific study of society to understand the forces shaping the rapidly changing social world. The new science of sociology sought to apply reason and empirical evidence to gain insights into human social behavior and the principles that govern social dynamics.
