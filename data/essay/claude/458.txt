There are several motives for UK employers to adopt direct employee involvement (EI) techniques. A key motive is to improve organizational performance and productivity. Direct EI techniques such as teamwork, quality circles, and problem-solving groups provide employees with opportunities to contribute ideas and participate in decision making. This can tap into employees' knowledge and skills, foster creativity and innovation, improve quality and efficiency, reduce costs, and ultimately enhance organizational performance. 

Empirical evidence from the Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (WIRS) and Workplace Employee Relations Survey (WERS) shows the increasing use of direct EI techniques in UK organizations. According to WIRS, the proportion of workplaces using teamworking increased from 66% in 1998 to 77% in 2011. Self-directed work groups rose from 11% in 1998 to 27% in 2011. The use of quality circles and problem-solving groups also increased over this period. WERS provides further evidence, with over 60% of workplaces adopting teamworking and over 25% using self-directed work groups in 2011. These surveys suggest direct EI techniques have gained prominence in UK organizations.

There are several factors driving the adoption of direct EI. Intensified competition and pressure from product markets compelled organizations to explore new approaches to enhance competitiveness. EI techniques were seen as a means to improve quality, reduce costs, and speed up responsiveness to customers. Some organizations implemented EI as part of a "soft" human resource management strategy, to motivate and empower employees. EI was also used by some employers to bypass trade unions and establish a direct channel of communication with employees. Moreover, direct EI came into fashion as an progressive management practice, though some critics argue it was adopted for symbolic rather than substantive reasons.

While direct EI may benefit organizations in multiple ways, the impacts seem uneven. WERS data shows workplaces using EI techniques reported higher labor productivity, product quality, and health and safety. However, the links between EI and other outcomes like employee relations, job satisfaction and employee wellbeing were weaker. The benefits also depend on factors like the specific EI method used, how well it is implemented, whether employees genuinely have opportunities to participate, the skills and motivations of employees, and the organizational context. 

In conclusion, UK employers have various motives to use direct EI, ranging from improving performance to following managerial fashion.  Although EI techniques are widely used, the benefits are mixed and conditional.  Organizations should evaluate whether and how EI can most benefit them based on their own strategic priorities and circumstances.  Careful implementation and integration with complementary policies are needed to fully realize the potential benefits of direct EI.
