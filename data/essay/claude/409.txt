Artisans in the nineteenth century were more likely to engage in militant collective action like strikes, protests, and riots compared to proletarian workers. There are several reasons for this. 

First, artisans had a stronger sense of occupational identity and solidarity. They were skilled craftsmen, often organized into guilds and craft associations. These organizations fostered a shared identity and support system among those in the same trade. When the interests of the trade were threatened, this solidarity could quickly mobilize into protest. In contrast, proletarian workers in factories were more isolated and alienated from each other. They came from diverse backgrounds and often did not stay in the same job or workplace for long. This made it harder for them to develop a shared identity and purpose.

Second, artisans had more autonomy and control over their work, so they had a stronger sense of independence and entitlement. As skilled craftsmen, they were able to control the pace and process of their work. If they felt their autonomy was being encroached upon, they would protest to defend it. Factory workers, on the other hand, had little control over their work. They were more compliant and less likely to question the new discipline and loss of freedom that came with industrial work. It took decades of labor organizing for factory workers to develop a sense of shared grievance over their conditions.

Third, artisans often owned their own tools and workspaces, so they had a proprietary interest to defend. Policies or employers that threatened their livelihoods were seen as a direct attack. In contrast, factory workers did not own the means of production, so they were less likely to protest against their employers or government when wages or conditions were poor. They were more easily replaced, and feared the consequences of protest.

Finally, governments and employers were less experienced in dealing with unrest from workers, so artisans' protests were often successful, at least in the short term. This emboldened further protests. Over time, the state got better at policing dissent and limiting the gains of protest, while employers gained the upper hand in controlling their workforces. This made later unrest from proletarian workers harder to achieve and less effective.

In conclusion, artisans in the early nineteenth century were uniquely positioned to engage in militant collective action in a way that industrial proletarian workers were not. Their solidarity, autonomy, proprietary interest, and temporary successes in protest allowed artisans to defend their interests during a period of economic upheaval, even as the balance of power was shifting away from labor. It would take several more decades of difficult organizing for proletarian workers to follow in their footsteps.
