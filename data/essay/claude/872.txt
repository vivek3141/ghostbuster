Liverpool being named the UK's 2023 European Capital of Culture is a massive opportunity for the city's tourism industry. The Capital of Culture designation recognizes cities across Europe that showcase arts and culture, and previous award-winners have attracted millions of new visitors and an economic boost of hundreds of millions of dollars. Liverpool can expect a major influx of tourists coming to experience its history, culture, nightlife, and entertainment.

For businesses in Liverpool's tourism industry, the Capital of Culture represents a chance to gain a competitive advantage by promoting sustainable and responsible tourism. The Marriott Liverpool City Centre Hotel, located in the heart of the city, is well positioned to benefit from the increased number of visitors. However, to gain a competitive advantage, the hotel should utilize its resources and capabilities to ensure it attracts visitors in a sustainable way that provides maximum benefit to the city.

The hotel can utilize its location, amenities, and service capabilities to promote sustainable tourism. Given its ideal location, the hotel should partner with local arts and cultural institutions to offer visitor packages that encourage people to explore the city's heritage and support community organizations. The hotel can use its various food and beverage outlets, fitness center, and event spaces to highlight locally-sourced goods and host events promoting sustainability. Staff should be well-trained in providing recommendations for sustainable tourism activities, such as shopping at local businesses, dining at independent restaurants featuring locally-sourced ingredients, and taking public transit.

Digital marketing campaigns should encourage sustainable tourism by promoting the city's cultural attractions, music scene, sports teams, and natural spaces. Messaging should recommend walking, biking, and public transit as the best ways to explore the city. The hotel's social media can be used to shine a spotlight on local artisans, musicians, small businesses, and community projects that visitors can support. Partnerships with sustainable tourism organizations would allow the hotel to tap into an ethical visitor market interested in experiential travel, cultural learning, and supporting local communities.

Overall, Liverpool winning the European Capital of Culture is a huge opportunity for the city's tourism industry and businesses like the Marriott City Centre Hotel. By utilizing its prime location and facilities and promoting sustainable tourism practices, the hotel can gain a competitive advantage. Focusing on community partnerships, highlighting local goods and events, educating staff and visitors, and running marketing campaigns that encourage sustainable exploration of the city's arts, culture, and heritage, the hotel will attract ethical and engaged travelers. This will allow Liverpool to benefit economically from tourism in a responsible way. With the city in the global spotlight, now is the time for stakeholders to step up and shape sustainable tourism.
