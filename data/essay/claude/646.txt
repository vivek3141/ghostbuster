Sigmund Freud analyzed a patient he called the “Wolf-Man” between 1910 to 1914. The Wolf-Man, whose real name was Sergei Pankejeff, was a Russian aristocrat who suffered from a mental illness that Freud diagnosed as neurosis with obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Freud used psychoanalysis to treat Pankejeff and interpret the meaning of his symptoms through analyzing his childhood experiences, family dynamics, and dreams. 

Freud believed that Pankejeff's psychological condition was caused by traumatic childhood experiences that were repressed but continued to affect his behavior unconsciously. In particular, Freud focused on one of Pankejeff's dreams of observing wolves sitting in a tree outside his bedroom window as a small child. Freud interpreted this dream as representing Pankejeff witnessing his parents having sex, which Freud believed was a psychologically traumatic experience that Pankejeff had repressed. Freud thought this repression and other childhood experiences had arrested Pankejeff's psychosexual development at an early stage, causing his neurotic illness.

Over four years of intensive psychoanalysis, Freud claimed that Pankejeff experienced symptom reduction and strengthened insight into the unconscious roots of his illness. However, Pankejeff was not "cured" and continued to suffer from symptoms for the rest of his life, suggesting the limited success and perhaps unrealistic aims of Freud's treatment. Freud argued that psychoanalysis could not undo the impact of such deeply traumatic experiences, but could only render them conscious and help the patient develop coping strategies.

Modern biomedical approaches to mental health differ substantially from Freud's psychoanalytic approach. Today, Pankejeff's condition would likely be diagnosed as obsessive-compulsive disorder and treated with a combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy. Instead of focusing on childhood experiences and dreams, modern treatment would focus on changing unhealthy thought and behavior patterns through targeted, structured techniques. Medication may also be used to help regulate any underlying biological components.

In conclusion, Freud diagnosed and treated the Wolf-Man, Sergei Pankejeff, for a neurotic illness using psychoanalysis by interpreting his childhood experiences and dreams. Although Pankejeff experienced some symptom reduction, Freud's ambitious hopes for a cure were not realistic. Modern treatment approaches for patients like Pankejeff rely more on cognitive and biological interventions, less so on revisiting childhood experiences. While Freud's theories have been enormously influential, modern psychology and psychiatry have evolved different approaches to understanding and treating mental illness.
