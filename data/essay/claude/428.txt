There are two predominant normative conceptions of governance in Europe: liberal intergovernmentalism and federalism. Liberal intergovernmentalism emphasizes state sovereignty and intergovernmental cooperation, whereas federalism aspires for greater political integration and the conferral of sovereignty to a supranational level. The tension between these two views has contributed to the European Union's legitimacy crisis.

Liberal intergovernmentalism sees the EU as an organization for intergovernmental cooperation that does not challenge state sovereignty. Power remains with member states, who cooperate voluntarily and in a intergovernmental fashion in areas of mutual benefit like trade. This view sees legitimacy as coming from democratic member states. In contrast, federalism envisions a federal Europe with a strong supranational level of governance that exercises independent authority over member states in some policy areas. Legitimacy comes more from European citizens and institutions according to this view.

The EU today embodies aspects of both views, but there is no consensus on a single model of governance. The EU has supranational elements like the European Commission and Parliament, but also strong intergovernmental elements like the Council of the EU, which represents member state governments. This mixed system contributes to the EU's legitimacy crisis. Those who favor liberal intergovernmentalism do not believe the EU has enough legitimacy to exercise strong supranational authority, while those who favor federalism think the EU is not integrated enough. There is also a "democratic deficit" since most EU power still lies with member states, but citizens feel distant from EU decision making. 

The lack of a common European identity also exacerbates these issues by making citizens feel more attached to their nation states than to Europe. Differences in language, culture, religion and history have made it difficult to forge a shared European identity. Efforts to cultivate a European identity, like the Erasmus student exchange program, have had limited success. As long as citizens feel much more Europeaness attached to their nation states, they will be reluctant to confer greater sovereignty and legitimacy to the EU level.

Various solutions have been proposed to address this crisis of legitimacy, but none are wholly satisfactory. Giving more power to the European Parliament and connecting citizens to EU policymaking may enhance supranational legitimacy, but member states are unlikely to support severely curtailing their authority. Fostering a common European identity may be a generational project that will not quickly resolve current divisions.  Relying on intergovernmental procedures like treaty changes and unanimity may uphold state legitimacy but intensify the democratic deficit. 

In conclusion, the tension between liberal intergovernmental and federalist views of European governance, combined with the lack of a strong European identity, has led to a crisis of legitimacy for the EU. Proposed solutions like strengthening supranational institutions, building a shared identity or empowering intergovernmental cooperation may each partly help address certain aspects of the crisis but cannot resolve all the contradictions that lie at its heart. Significant innovations in governance and years of generational change may eventually be required to overcome these fundamental challenges around legitimacy in the EU.
