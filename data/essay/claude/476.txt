The Gower SOS campaign is a Welsh pressure group aiming to prevent commercial companies from dredging the seabed off the coast of Gower for aggregate extraction. Their main tactics are raising public awareness of the environmental impacts of dredging through their website and social media platforms, as well as directly lobbying political representatives. This essay will analyze how effective the Gower SOS website is in achieving the campaign's goals by comparing it to the Save our Green Fields campaign website.

The Gower SOS website is relatively simple but provides a good overview of the key campaign issues and goals. The homepage prominently features the campaign's mission statement â€œto stop the damaging practice of dredging off our precious coastline and protect Gower's marine environment for future generations." This clearly and concisely conveys the purpose of the campaign to visitors and signals that the website will focus on environmental protection. The website then outlines the main reasons for opposing dredging, including destruction of marine habitats, release of contaminants, and industrialization of coastal views. These points are supported with images of idyllic beaches and coastlines, establishing an implicit contrast with the potential impacts of dredging. Overall, the website effectively highlights the central arguments against dredging in a visually compelling way for visitors.

In comparison, the Save our Green Fields website has a less cohesive structure and message. The campaign is broader in scope, aiming to prevent development on greenfield sites across the country. The homepage is text-heavy and does not have a concise mission statement conveying the purpose and goals. The reasons for opposing greenfield development are wide-ranging, from loss of agricultural land to increased traffic and pollution. As a result, the key arguments and messages are not as focused or memorable for visitors compared to the Gower SOS website. While the use of images of green landscapes helps illustrate the campaign cause, the overall impression is of a more generalized opposition to development rather than a specific goal.

In terms of legitimizing the cause and influencing policymakers, the Gower SOS website is more effective due to its targeted approach. The provision of summaries of scientific research on the impacts of dredging from UK academics and NGOs, as well as an online petition for local residents, add credibility to the campaign messages. In contrast, the Save our Green Fields website does not prominently feature evidence from expert bodies or local community support. Their petition covers development nationally rather than for a specific local area. As such, policymakers may view their positions as less well-informed or supported compared to the localized approach of Gower SOS.

Overall, while both websites aim to raise awareness of environmental campaigns by highlighting key arguments and impacts, the Gower SOS website is superior in clarity of messaging, legitimacy of evidence, and call to localized action. The comparison with Save our Green Fields illustrates how a more targeted campaign focused on a specific issue can be more compelling and influence local policy decisions. With further improvements to provide more detailed evidence and examples of the impacts of dredging, the Gower SOS website can continue to be an effective tool for achieving the campaign's goals.
