The narrative voices employed by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner' and Jane Austen in Emma function very differently and reflect the authors' contrasting attitudes towards their readers. 

Coleridge adopts a poetic narrative voice in 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner' that is metaphorical, mystical and aims to evoke emotion in the reader. The poem is written in rhythmic verse with a strong cadence to entrance the reader. The archaic language and exotic imagery of 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner' situates the tale in a distant time and place, appealing to the reader's imagination. The mystical and ominous tone is created through eerie description of  the 'charmed water' and the Mariner's 'skinny hand'. Coleridge seeks to inspire feelings of awe, fear and even discomfort in the reader, drawing them into a fantastical world.

In contrast, Austen utilizes an ironic, gossiping narrative voice in Emma that mimics the idle chatter of the upper classes she is satirizing. The story is relayed in a casual, meandering style with tangential observations and opinions peppered throughout.  Dialogue and free indirect discourse are used extensively to reveal characters' improper and unguided speculation. By adopting the voice of a judgmental social observer, Austen subtly mocks her characters and readers who share such prejudiced views.  Rather than evoking fantastical imagination, Austen's narrative voice arouses knowing amusement in readers.  

The differences in narrative voice reflect Coleridge and Austen's contrasting views of their readers. Coleridge respects readers as thinkers who can grasp metaphorical ideas and be moved by poetic expression. His narrative voice in 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner' appeals to readers' intellectual curiosity in mystical concepts of sin, morality and atonement. Austen, however, adopts a more cynical narrative voice that satirizes the gossip and prejudice of her social milieu. Her ironic narrative voice in Emma suggests Austen sees most readers as frivolous and small-minded, and thus they become implicit objects of mockery.

In conclusion, the narrative voices in Coleridge's poem and Austen's novel achieve notably different effects that provide insight into how the authors regarded and aimed to engage with their readers. Coleridge's metaphorical voice appeals to readers' imagination and intellect, whereas Austen's ironic voice arouses readers' satirical amusement at the triviality and improper speculation of the upper classes. The contrast reflects Coleridge's respect for readers as thinkers versus Austen's more dismissive view of most readers' frivolous prejudices and gossip. Overall, the differences in narrative voice and authorial attitude are pivotal to the reading experience of these two 19th century texts.
