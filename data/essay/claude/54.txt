There has been an ongoing debate about the effects of viewing aggression and violence in visual media, such as television and films, on aggressive behaviors in  children and adolescents. While some experts argue that a causal link exists between viewing aggression and real-world aggressive tendencies, especially in younger viewers, others contend that the evidence does not conclusively prove that viewing aggression leads to aggression, especially when other influences like parenting, mental health, and social environment are considered.

Studies exploring the relationship between viewing aggression in the media and aggression in children have produced mixed results. Some of the earliest studies in the 1960s and 1970s found a correlation between viewing violent television and aggression in children. For example, a well-known 1972 study conducted by Aletha Huston and colleagues found that preschool children who watched violent cartoons showed more aggression in their play immediately after viewing compared to children who watched nonviolent cartoons. However, these early studies were often correlational and could not prove that viewing aggression actually caused aggressive behaviors.   

In the 1980s, studies using experimental methods found more compelling evidence for a causal link. For example, a 1984 study by Leonard Eron and colleagues randomly assigned children to watch either violent or nonviolent television in a controlled lab setting. They found that children who viewed violent shows were more likely to exhibit aggressive behaviors immediately after, such as punching an inflatable doll, compared to those who watched nonviolent shows. These types of experimental studies helped build the case that viewing aggression could provoke aggression in the short term.

However, the evidence from studies on long-term effects was more mixed. Some longitudinal studies showed an association between viewing aggression at a young age and aggression later in life, but others did not and the relationships were often weak. Critics argue that these links could reflect the influence of other factors, like an aggressive personality. Studies also found that the strength of the relationship depended on factors such as mental health, parenting, and social problems. For example, children from troubled homes or with preexisting behavior problems may be more susceptible to aggressive media. But for most children with normal development and parenting, the effects seem to be negligible or short-lived.  

In conclusion, while some research has found a link between viewing aggression in the media and aggression in children, especially in experimental and short-term studies, the evidence for long-term harm is mixed and inconclusive. The impact seems to depend on moderating factors like parenting, mental health, age, and social environment. For most children, especially older kids and adolescents, the effects of viewing aggression appear to be minimal. Concerns over the influence of media violence may be overblown, and regulation of media could violate principles of free speech. Still, some researchers argue that a risk of harm exists for certain vulnerable groups, supporting the case for more education and parental discretion regarding media choices for children. Overall, the debate around this issue is complex with valid arguments on both sides.
