Compotech Industries Plc is looking to increase the production capacity of its Flexi-Connector component to meet rising demand. There are three main options to consider for increasing production capacity:

1. Building a new dedicated production facility. This option involves constructing an entirely new factory to solely produce the Flexi-Connector component. The advantage of this option is that it provides the largest capacity increase and ensures no disruption to existing production lines. However, it requires the largest upfront capital investment and takes the longest time to implement. Using the Net Present Value (NPV) method, the large initial investment required would significantly reduce the NPV of this option.

2. Expanding the existing production facility. The current production line for the Flexi-Connector could be expanded by adding new equipment and production lines within the existing factory. This option requires less capital investment than building a new facility but would still provide a sizable capacity increase. There may be some temporary disruption to existing operations while facility expansion takes place. The lower required investment would result in a higher NPV for this option compared to the first option. 

3. Outsourcing production to a third-party manufacturer. Compotech could partner with a third-party contract manufacturer to produce the additional Flexi-Connectors required. This option requires almost no capital investment from Compotech but sacrifices control over the production process and quality. Contract manufacturing fees would also reduce the potential NPV. There is also a risk the third-party could become a competitor if they learn too much about producing the Flexi-Connector.

Overall, the two most advisable options to focus on are expanding the existing production facility or outsourcing production to a third-party manufacturer. Expanding the existing facility provides more control and quality assurance but requires a larger investment. Outsourcing to a third-party requires less investment but sacrifices control and risks creating a future competitor.

Using the NPV method to evaluate these investment opportunities provides several advantages. It accounts for the time value of money by discounting future cash flows to today's value, allowing a fair comparison between options with different lifespans and investment timeframes. It also provides an objective valuation by quantifying both costs and benefits in monetary terms. However, there are some disadvantages to NPV analysis. It requires estimating uncertain future cash flows, interest rates, and the project lifespans which can be difficult. It may also favor short-term benefits over longer-term strategic opportunities. Subjective factors like risk, flexibility, and strategic fit can be hard to incorporate into a purely financial analysis.

In summary, while expanding existing operations and outsourcing to third-party manufacturers both have their merits for increasing production capacity, a balanced analysis using both NPV and strategic evaluations is recommended before a final decision is made. Compotech should choose the option that achieves the requisite production increase in a timely manner while preserving quality, controlling costs, and aligning with longer-term strategic goals.
