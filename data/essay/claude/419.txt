Carbon steels are iron alloys that contain up to 2% carbon, along with alloying elements such as manganese, phosphorus, sulfur, and silicon. The composition and cooling treatment of carbon steels can affect their microstructure and mechanical properties. In carbon steels, the phase transformations involve austenite to ferrite or cementite. The austenite phase exists above 912°C, the eutectoid temperature. As the steel cools below the eutectoid temperature, the austenite transforms into ferrite and cementite, depending on the composition of carbon and other alloying elements. 

The microstructure can consist of ferrite, cementite, pearlite, and martensite. Ferrite is a soft, ductile phase with a body-centered cubic crystal structure. Cementite is a hard, brittle phase containing 6.7% carbon. Pearlite is a lamellar mixture of ferrite and cementite. Martensite is a hard, brittle phase with a body-centered tetragonal crystal structure. The fractions of these phases depend on the steel's composition and cooling rate. Steels cooled slowly through the eutectoid temperature consist mainly of pearlite, while steels cooled rapidly can form martensite. 

The cooling rate affects the steel's microstructure and properties. Slow cooling, such as furnace cooling, produces a coarse pearlite microstructure with good machinability but low strength and hardness. Medium cooling, such as air cooling, produces a fine pearlite microstructure with moderate strength and hardness. Rapid cooling, such as quenching in water or oil, produces a martensite microstructure with high strength and hardness but low ductility. The strength and hardness can be further increased through tempering, where the steel is heated to a temperature below the eutectoid point. 

In comparison, copper-zinc alloys and aluminum-silicon alloys display different phase transformations and microstructures. The copper-zinc binary phase diagram shows a eutectoid point at 893°F with less than 0.5 wt% Zn. Below this temperature, the alloy can consist of a soft, ductile α phase (face-centered cubic) and a hard, brittle β' phase (body-centered tetragonal). Alloys with 15-35% Zn that are cooled slowly through the eutectoid point will have a coarse lamellar structure of the two phases.  More rapid cooling produces a fine lamellar structure with improved properties. At higher  zinc concentrations (35-95%), the alloy forms a single β phase with an ordered cubic crystal structure.

The aluminum-silicon binary phase diagram shows a eutectic point at 12.6% Si and 577°C. Below this temperature, the alloy forms aluminum solid solution (α phase) and silicon particles (β phase) embedded in an α matrix. At 5-12% Si, slow cooling produces a coarse structure of isolated silicon particles in an aluminum matrix, while fast cooling produces a fine spheroidal structure, which provides maximum strength. At higher silicon concentrations, a phase called Al-Si eutectic forms with a characteristic silicon flake morphology. In both the copper-zinc and aluminum-silicon alloys, the cooling rate and concentrations of the minority elements have a strong effect on the phase transformations, microstructures, and resulting properties.

In summary, the type of phase transformation, the resulting microstructure, and the mechanical properties of an alloy depend on its composition and cooling treatment. Slow cooling generally leads to soft, ductile microstructures, while fast cooling can produce hard, brittle structures. By controlling the cooling rate, the phase transformations and properties of steel, copper-zinc, aluminum-silicon, and other alloys can be optimized for different applications.
