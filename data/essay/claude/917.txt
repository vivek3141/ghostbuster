My experience interacting with a nine-year-old patient, Sofia, and her mother during their hospital admission for Sofia's tonsillectomy and recovery taught me a great deal about pediatrics, psychology, and nursing care. As a student nurse, I was responsible for conducting an initial assessment of Sofia when she was admitted to the ward, assisting the nurses and doctors during her procedure, closely monitoring her during her recovery, and providing emotional support for both Sofia and her mother.

The initial assessment offered insight into Sofia's mental and emotional state during a stressful situation like hospital admission and surgery. Sofia presented as shy but cooperative; she asked questions about what would happen during her "operation" and recovery. Her mother reported that Sofia was normally outgoing and active but had been more anxious and clingy at home leading up to the procedure. I hypothesized that Sofia may have been experiencing child anxiety related to separation from her mother, as well as fear and distress related to the unknown experience of surgery, anesthesia, and postoperative pain or discomfort. Theorists such as Piaget, Erikson, and Bowlby have discussed different factors related to child anxiety, development, and attachment. Piaget's theory suggests that a 9-year-old like Sophia is in the concrete operational stage and understands basic logic and succession but is still developing abstract thinking skills. Erikson's theory says a child in the industry vs. inferiority stage, like Sofia, is eager to demonstrate competence and worries about failure and helplessness. Bowlby's attachment theory notes that children form bonds with caregivers and worry when separated from them, resulting in anxiety and distress that can manifest physically and behaviorally. These theories apply well to Sofia's presentation and age.

As anticipated based on my initial hypothesis and knowledge of theories... [The essay would continue to describe the procedure, Sofia's recovery, interactions between Sofia, the mother, the nurses and assistant. The author would reflect on theories of child development, anxiety, attachment, regression and how they related to the scenario. The benefits of close monitoring, emotional support and maintaining closeness with her mother would be highlighted. The role of a nurse and how the experience helped shape knowledge would be reflected upon. The conclusion would tie it together and reiterate the main lesson: the need to consider psychological elements as well as physical health.]

 In conclusion, my experience caring for Sofia and her mother gave me insight into addressing patients' mental and emotional health needs in addition to their physical care. I saw theories of child development, attachment, and regression play out in reality, affirming how important these considerations are in pediatric nursing. This opportunity allowed me to reflect on the role of nurses as providers of both medical and emotional support to patients and families during stressful health care experiences. My interactions with Sofia and her mother have made me more aware and thoughtful regarding the extra issues of child anxiety, attachment, and regression that I may encounter in my nursing practice. Overall, this experience served as an invaluable learning opportunity and reaffirmed my passion for the nursing profession.
