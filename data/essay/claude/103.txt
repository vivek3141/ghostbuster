There is evidence to suggest that there was a significant expansion in trade and commercial activity in 13th century Europe that constitutes something of a commercial revolution. Several factors came together in the 13th century that led to an increase in long-distance trade and the growth of commerce, especially in emerging urban centers.

One of the roots of increased trade was the relative stability and peace that much of Europe experienced in the 13th century. The Pax Mongolica, or Mongol Peace, opened up trade routes between East and West. The Mongols conquered much of Eurasia in the early 13th century, but under Genghis Khan's rule, the Mongols promoted trade and exchange between the different parts of their empire. The Mongols facilitated travel along the Silk Road and provided security for merchant caravans. Increased trade with the East brought more goods from China and the Middle East into European markets.

Within Europe itself, several factors also promoted more robust commercial activity. There was an expansion of coinage in the 13th century, with more silver coins minted and circulated. This made it easier for people to buy and sell goods and facilitated more complex financial transactions. Improvements in agricultural productivity led to surplus food production, especially in northern Italy and Flanders. This allowed some people to leave agriculture and pursue crafts and trade. Some of this surplus also found its way into the market, supporting urban populations.

The growth of towns and cities in the 13th century, especially in Italy and Flanders, provided centralized marketplaces where people could buy and sell goods as well as centers of craft production. Urban centers like Florence, Genoa, Bruges, and Ghent became hubs of commercial activity and exchange. Local merchants established commercial contacts with merchants in other regions and cities, which allowed for the circulation of both local goods as well as imported luxuries and spices. 

New business practices also emerged to support long-distance trade, such as partnerships, contracts, bills of exchange, double-entry bookkeeping, and maritime insurance. These institutional innovations helped merchants raise capital, share risk, keep accounts, and insure valuable cargoes. Fewer restrictions on moneylending and charging interest also allowed for more sophisticated banking and insurance activities.

In conclusion, while still limited in scope compared to later periods of European history, the 13th century saw substantial increases in trade, urbanization, the circulation of money, and institutional innovation that amounted to something of a commercial revolution. Greater connections with the wider world, agricultural productivity, the growth of towns, and new business practices all contributed to this significant expansion of commerce that would persist and grow in the following centuries.
