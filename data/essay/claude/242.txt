Emotional labor refers to the process of managing feelings and expressions to create a socially desirable public display during interactions. In the workplace, emotional labor involves actively shaping one's emotional expressions to match the needs and expectations of the employer or role. Emotional labor is particularly relevant in customer service roles where front-line staff have frequent interactions with customers.  

There are two main views on how employee commitment to customer service can be achieved. The first view focuses on employee satisfaction and empowerment. When employees are satisfied with their jobs and feel empowered in their roles, they tend to be more committed to providing good service. Satisfied and empowered employees are more likely to make emotional investments in their interactions with customers. They genuinely care about the customer experience and will engage in deeper emotional labor to create positive experiences.  

The alternative view focuses more on management monitoring and incentives. According to this view, employee commitment depends on factors such as adequate compensation, rewards, training, and performance monitoring. When employees know their emotional labor is being scrutinized and is tied to rewards, they are more likely to comply with the emotional displays expected of their roles. However, this approach risks prioritizing quantity over quality of service and can lead to surface acting, reducing authentic positive experiences for customers.

Front-line staff are essential for achieving excellence in customer service as they have the most direct interactions with customers. When front-line staff are committed to their roles, they provide the emotional labor necessary to create memorable and meaningful experiences for customers. Management must empower front-line staff by demonstrating appreciation for the emotional demands of their roles, providing adequate training and compensation, and involving staff in decision making. When front-line staff feel their emotional labor is valued but also feel trusted and empowered, they can deliver authentic caring service.

Emotional labor has a significant impact on job satisfaction. Surface acting, or faking the expected emotional displays, is associated with lower job satisfaction as it can lead to feelings of inauthenticity and emotional exhaustion over time. Deep acting, where employees work to feel the emotions they are displaying, is less negatively impactful but still requires effort and can drain emotional resources. Management must aim to cultivate positive emotional environments and strong organizational cultures which facilitate natural positive emotions in both employees and customers. When the emotional environment is mutually positive and authentic, the need for extensive deep or surface acting is reduced. 

Overall, employee commitment to customer service depends on balancing the needs and expectations of management with the wellbeing and satisfaction of front-line staff. Success requires an organizational culture where front-line staff feel empowered to provide genuinely caring service, while also feeling supported and rewarded for the emotional demands of their work. Management plays an important role in monitoring, rewarding, and empowering employees to do emotional labor in a sustainable and personally meaningful manner. When this balance is achieved, front-line staff can be deeply committed to exceeding customer expectations through authentic emotional connection and excellence in service.
