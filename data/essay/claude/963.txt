The 1969 novel Kes by Barry Hines provides insight into the challenging socio-economic conditions of working-class communities in North England in the 1960s. The story's protagonist, 15-year-old Billy Casper, lives with his abusive older brother Jud and neglectful mother in a small mining town. Billy finds escape in training his kestrel falcon, Kes. However, his dire circumstances represent the limited opportunities and hopelessness felt by many in similar post-industrial Northern towns. 

Billy lives in a community still recovering from the decline of coal mining, the region's primary industry. Most men work unstable, low-paying jobs or face unemployment. Billy's brother Jud cannot find steady work and takes out his anger on Billy. Their mother works long hours at a biscuit factory, leaving Billy to fend for himself. With little adult guidance or support, Billy struggles in school and seems destined for a life of limited prospects. His discovery of Kes, however, gives him purpose and helps form his identity. Sadly, Jud kills Kes out of spite, representing how socio-economic hardship breeds cruelty.

Had Billy come of age almost 20 years later under Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government, his situation may have felt even more dire. Thatcher's policies exacerbated inequality and economic decline in Northern post-industrial communities. Her push towards free market capitalism and reduced government intervention led to factory closures and job losses in mining and manufacturing. Privatization of public housing and education made it harder for working-class families to get by. By the 1980s, many Northern towns faced poverty, social breakdown, and urban decay. 

For a character like Billy, Thatcherism would have represented complete abandonment of working-class communities by the government. With the decline of mining and factories, job prospects would be even scarcer. Cuts to public services like housing, healthcare and education would make life considerably harder. Billy's family would struggle more and have less means of escape or opportunity. Tragically, there may have been little hope for a brighter future or escape via a pastime like training Kes.

In conclusion, Kes offers a sobering glimpse into working-class hardship in post-industrial North England.  Billy Casper's circumstances highlight the limited opportunities and lack of hope in such communities in the 1960s. Though set decades earlier, the destitution and social breakdown in many similar Northern towns under Thatcher's government in the 1980s indicate Billy's situation may well have been exacerbated had his story taken place 20 years later. Overall, the novel gives insight into decades of struggle in Britain's post-industrial Northern communities.
