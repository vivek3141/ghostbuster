The Q-cycle is a series of electron transport steps within the electron transport chain (ETC) of the inner mitochondrial membrane that involves the transfer of protons and electrons between coenzymes Q and cytochrome complexes. The Q-cycle allows for more protons to be pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane per pair of electrons transported through the ETC, thus increasing the efficiency of ATP production. 

The Q-cycle revolves around the movement of electrons between ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) and cytochrome b, which is part of cytochrome bc1 complex (cytochrome complex III). When two electrons are transported from complex I or II to ubiquinone, ubiquinone picks up two protons from the mitochondrial matrix and is reduced to ubiquinol. Ubiquinol then donates one electron at a time to cytochrome b. The one-electron donation results in the formation of a ubisemiquinone radical, which can either donate its remaining electron to a second cytochrome b molecule or pick up another electron from complex I or II. This branched electron flow results in more protons being pumped across the inner membrane.

The mammalian cytochrome bc1 complex contains 11 subunits, including cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, the Rieske iron-sulfur protein, and coenzyme Q. Cytochrome b is made up of 8 transmembrane helices that contain two b-type hemes which receive electrons from ubiquinol and pass them to cytochrome c1 or the Rieske protein. The movement of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein is key to enabling electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c1 and pumping of protons. When in one conformation, the Rieske protein receives an electron from ubiquinol and passes it to cytochrome c1. When in the other conformation, the Rieske protein receives an electron from ubiquinol but passes it to cytochrome b, which enables proton pumping.

Dysfunction or mutations in the subunits of the cytochrome bc1 complex can lead to mitochondrial myopathies and oxidative damage due to disruption of electron transport and proton pumping. Mutations in cytochrome b specifically have been associated with exercise intolerance and myopathy. Deficiencies in coenzyme Q, which donates electrons to cytochrome b, can also reduce the activity of the Q-cycle and lead to mitochondrial disease.

In summary, the Q-cycle and cytochrome bc1 complex work together through a series of electron transfers and proton pumps to generate the proton gradient used for ATP synthesis. The movement of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein between cytochrome b and cytochrome c1, and the transfer of one electron at a time from ubiquinol to the cytochromes are essential for enabling branched electron flow and increased proton pumping. Dysfunction of this complex can lead to mitochondrial diseases through disruption of energy production. The Q-cycle thus contributes greatly to our understanding of how mitochondrial electron and proton transfer are linked to power generation in the cell.
