The Cape Town Principles of 1997 provide a definition of child soldiers as "any person under 18 years of age who is part of any kind of regular or irregular armed force or armed group in any capacity." They include children who act as combatants, cooks, messengers, and porters for armed groups of both state militaries and non-state armed groups, including paramilitaries or militias.

In many armed conflicts, especially in developing countries, children are recruited into armed forces and participate in hostilities as child soldiers. They are recruited in several ways, including abduction, forced conscription, and manipulation of vulnerable young people by offering money, food, or other rewards. The Cape Town Principles condemn recruitment and use of children as soldiers, including forced recruitment and recruitment by deception, and considers it a war crime and a violation of international humanitarian law. Once recruited, children are used as soldiers in armed conflicts in various ways: They are not only used as combatants, but also as spies, porters, cooks, sex slaves and to plant landmines or explosives. Both boys and girls are recruited and used, though boys tend to be used as fighters while girls serve in support roles. The Principles note that even when children are not directly participating in combat, their association with armed forces puts them in extremely dangerous and traumatic situations.

In summary, the Cape Town Principles define child soldiers broadly and condemn all recruitment and use of children in armed conflict, including in non-combat roles. They consider any use of children by armed groups to be forced recruitment and a war crime, in recognition of the severe and long-lasting trauma that children soldiers undergo. Overall, the Cape Town Principles advocate for protecting children in conflict and justice for victims of forced recruitment as child soldiers.
