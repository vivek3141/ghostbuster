The Bourbon Reforms comprised a series of administrative, economic, and political changes imposed in the Spanish and Portuguese colonies from the 18th century onwards. They significantly disrupted the established socioeconomic order in Latin America and provoked varying responses from different groups in the colonies. Ultimately, the reforms intensified sentiments of nationalism and unrest in Latin America, as local elites resented increased control and taxation from Spain and Portugal. 

Traditionally, Spain had adopted a largely hands-off approach to governing its American colonies. Local elites, including Creoles, enjoyed a great deal of autonomy and control over trade and governance. The Catholic Church also wielded tremendous influence over social and political affairs. However, in the mid-18th century, the new Bourbon monarchy sought to overhaul imperial administration and revitalize the ailing Spanish economy. They aimed to tighten control over the colonies, increase tax revenues, and promote free trade.

Administratively, the Bourbons created new viceroyalties and reorganized local government. They imposed the intendancy system, appointing peninsulares as tax collectors and administrators. This challenged the power of Creoles in local government and administration. The Church also lost some privileges, as the Crown took control of tax collection from the Church and expelled the Jesuit order from the colonies.

Economically, the Bourbons pursued free trade policies that favored peninsulares. They cut off Creole merchants from exclusive trade with Spain and opened more ports to foreign trade. While ostensibly boosting commerce, these reforms primarily benefited peninsulares, who took control of the new trade opportunities. The Crown also increased taxes on Creoles, including the tobacco monopoly and sales taxes.

These administrative and economic reforms encountered resistance from local elites, especially Creoles who were excluded from new opportunities and shouldered higher taxes. Peninsulares also angered locals by occupying many government and Church positions. At the same time, the reforms strengthened the colonial economy overall and improved some infrastructure. But the unequal distribution of benefits and costs intensified tensions between American-born Creoles and Spanish-born peninsulares.

Other factors also fueled nationalist sentiments, including Enlightenment ideals of liberty and republicanism. Exposure to these values through education and contraband literature resonated with Creole elites. Enlightenment principles also underpinned revolutions in Britain's North American and France, inspiring hopes of independence.

In conclusion, while the Bourbon Reforms sought to strengthen the Spanish empire, they disrupted traditional colonial society and governance in Latin America. By favoring peninsulares over Creoles, centralizing control, and increasing taxation, they aggravated latent nationalist tensions and set the stage for independence movements across Spanish America. The reforms challenged the status quo, but resistance to changes and desires for self-governance were equally instrumental in spurring Latin American nationalism.
