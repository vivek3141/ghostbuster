How Isabel Allende Uses The House of the Spirits to Illustrate That Writing is an Act of Love

Isabel Allende's debut novel The House of the Spirits beautifully illustrates how writing can be a radical act of love. The story follows three generations of a family in an unnamed Latin American country, centering around the lives of Esteban Trueba and Clara del Valle. Allende uses the characters' relationship to writing to show how it can combat hatred, provide insight and coherence amid disorder, and ultimately set one free from fear.   

Esteban Trueba is motivated by a hate that poisons his relationships and society. His rape of Pancha Garcia and abuse of his workers stem from a hatred born of a desire for power and control. He sees the peasantry as somehow less human than the ruling class to which he belongs. Yet his love for Clara redeems some part of his humanity. When Esteban writes letters to Clara during their long years apart, the act of writing functions as a conduit for that love. His letters, "letter after letter...was intended as a proof of his constancy and love" (90). Though imperfect, his love for Clara saves him from being utterly consumed by hatred and pulls him back towards his better nature.

In contrast, Clara embraces love and uses writing to make sense of a disordered world swirling with mysterious spirits and cryptic omens. From childhood, Clara lives partly in the realm of spirit and intuition that others don't see. Her first act of writing comes when she begins a diary at age twelve to describe "the uncanny happenings in [her] daily life and...make them seem more real" (51). When she can share these strange sensations with no one else, writing becomes her lifeline to understanding and coherence. Her diary entries and later letters to Esteban are imbued with her capacity for wonder, joy, and loveâ€”even in times of deepest pain. Through writing, Clara thus finds clarity and solace.   

Ultimately, Clara achieves a kind of liberation from fear through her writing. As a clairvoyant spiritist, Clara is subject to fits of delirium and trance from which she cannot escape on her own. When her spiritism causes turmoil in the Trueba household, Esteban takes radical measures to "cure" her, causing Clara to feel trapped and lose sense of her own identity. Yet she continues recording her mystic experiences in secret diaries, an act which frees her spirit and lets her maintain connection with the core parts of herself that transcend the physical. Her writing is a source of courage and freedom even when all else is stripped away.  

Through the characters of Esteban and Clara, Allende beautifully illustrates her theme that writing is an act of love which can overcome hatred, provide coherence amid chaos, and free us from fear. Though flawed, Esteban finds redemption in his love letters to Clara. Clara relies on her diaries and letters to make sense of the strange world in which she lives and ultimately finds liberation through her secret writings. By depicting these transformative powers of writing, Allende suggests it is one of the most powerful acts of love. Overall, The House of the Spirits is a hymn to love, wonder, and the written word.
