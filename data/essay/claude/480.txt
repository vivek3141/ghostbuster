The 16th century saw the first major encounters between Europeans and the native peoples of the Americas. The Spanish conquest of Mexico and the establishment of European colonies in North America were two of the most significant events, with enormous consequences for the native populations. While there were some similarities in the factors driving European expansion into the New World, there were also key differences in the attitudes and desires of the Spanish in Mexico compared to the English, French, and other colonists in North America that greatly influenced how events unfolded.  

In Mexico, the Spanish were motivated primarily by a desire for gold, glory, and the spread of Christianity. Hernan Cortes led an expedition to explore and claim land for the Spanish crown, but his men were also spurred by the promise of riches like those found by the Spanish in Central America. The native Mexica (Aztec) empire was a wealthy, complex civilization that promised ample spoils and riches to plunder. The Spanish were also deeply devoted to their Catholic faith and saw the conversion of native peoples as a religious duty. By contrast, while some early English colonists in North America were motivated by a desire to spread Protestantism, many more came for practical reasons like seeking economic opportunity or escaping difficult circumstances in England. There was little evidence of centralized native empires to conquer for gold or glory.   

The initial interactions between the Spanish and Aztecs were aided by the advisor and translator Malinche, a native woman who knew both Spanish and Nahuatl, the Aztec language. Through Malinche, the Spanish learned of political divisions within the Aztec empire they could exploit. The Aztecs at first welcomed the Spanish, believing Cortes may be a legendary figure. However, conflicts soon arose, and the Spanish were able to overcome the mighty Aztecs through military force, aided by native alliances and the spread of disease. In North America, early contacts were more limited, and alliances with certain tribes were not as pivotal in overcoming others. Powerful native coalitions did not immediately form to oppose the new colonists. While disease would also ravage the native populations of North America, the societal effects were not as catastrophic as in Mexico.

The attitudes of the Spanish towards the native Mexicans were ambivalent but generally racist. The Spanish oscillated between seeing the Aztecs as noble servants of the empire and savage heathens, and they brutally massacred Aztecs at times. The Spanish crown created laws protecting natives but also enslaved many. In North America, English attitudes were also complex and prejudiced, but there were not the same preoccupations with conversion and control. Policies like the reservation system reflected a notion that natives should be segregated. Slavery was also part of the colonial system but not as widespread as in Mexico and other Spanish colonies.   

In conclusion, while the encounters between Europeans and Native Americans throughout the Americas during the 16th and 17th centuries resulted in violence, oppression, and devastation, the nature of the initial contacts and subsequent interactions varied based on motivations, attitudes, and circumstances in each region. The Spanish conquest of Mexico was spurred by a thirst for gold and glory as much as by religion and resulted in alteration and control of nearly all aspects of Aztec civilization. The English and other colonists in North America, driven more by practical motivations, gradually expanded their settlements with slightly more separation and less systematic destruction of native societies, even while still severely exploiting and marginalizing native peoples. The different ambitions and ideals that Europeans brought to the New World set the stage for distinct patterns of colonization that shaped new societies.
