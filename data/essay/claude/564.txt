The International Criminal Court (ICC) was established in 2002 as a permanent court to prosecute individuals for the most serious crimes of concern to the international community, such as genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. The ICC plays an important role in addressing human rights atrocities and enforcing individual criminal responsibility for international crimes. However, it faces significant limitations, including subjective thresholds for determining relevant crimes and weaknesses in precisely defining certain international crimes. These limitations impact its ability to effectively prosecute perpetrators of human rights violations. 

The ICC serves to deter future human rights atrocities by signaling that the international community will not tolerate impunity for the gravest crimes. Its existence affirms the principle that all individuals, no matter their position of power, can be held criminally accountable under international law. The ICC prosecutes and punishes perpetrators of mass atrocities when states are unable or unwilling to do so themselves. This deters leaders and offers justice to victims.

However, the ICC faces major challenges in achieving its mission. One key limitation is its reliance on states to cooperate, as it lacks an independent enforcement mechanism. States may refuse to cooperate by not joining the ICC, not referring situations to the ICC, or not enforcing ICC arrest warrants. For example, despite evidence of international crimes in Syria, Russia and China have vetoed UN Security Council referrals of the situation to the ICC. 

Another limitation is subjectivity in determining which situations and cases satisfy the ICC’s gravity threshold to merit prosecution. The ICC depends on prosecutors to evaluate situations and cases, but they have broad discretion, and their judgments can be subjective or politically motivated. For example, the ICC has been criticized for disproportionately focusing on African countries. This subjectivity undermines perceptions of impartiality and fairness.

A further limitation is vagueness in definitions of international crimes like aggression, making it difficult to prosecute. The ICC must prove crimes were committed intentionally or knowingly "beyond reasonable doubt." If the definitions of crimes are unclear, this high standard of evidence is hard to meet. For example, the crime of aggression is poorly defined, lacking clarity on what acts actually constitute aggression. This prevents consistent, fair prosecutions for aggression.

These limitations significantly impact the ICC's ability to prosecute perpetrators of human rights atrocities. They allow many perpetrators to escape justice, failing victims and undermining deterrence. Domestic prosecutions may provide an alternative, but many states also face issues of lack of political will, inadequate laws, and overburdened legal systems. International and domestic actors must work to strengthen the ICC, clarify international criminal law, and build states’ capacity to prosecute atrocity crimes themselves. While the ICC plays an important role, its limitations demonstrate the vital need for complementary national and international efforts to end impunity.

In conclusion, the ICC plays an essential role in addressing human rights atrocities, but it faces major challenges, including subjectivity in determining criminal liability and weaknesses in defining international crimes. These limitations undermine its ability to effectively prosecute perpetrators of human rights violations and have significant implications for the pursuit of justice. Overcoming these challenges requires strengthening cooperation, clarifying law, and building domestic capacity. The ICC must be part of a broader system of international criminal justice.
