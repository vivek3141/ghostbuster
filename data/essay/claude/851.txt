Our multi-professional group consisted of a social worker, two nurses, a physical therapist, and an occupational therapist. We came together to design an interview process and evaluate candidates for an open registered nurse position on our interdisciplinary team. 

First, we reviewed the job listing and qualifications to develop a shared understanding of the role and responsibilities. We wanted a candidate with at least five years of experience, a bachelor’s degree in nursing, certification in wound care, and experience working in home health or with complex chronic conditions. Beyond clinical skills, we valued traits like compassion, motivation, critical thinking, communication, and the ability to work collaboratively in a team setting.

With this in mind, we drafted ten interview questions to evaluate both the technical skills and soft skills of the candidates:

1. Tell us about your educational background and relevant work experience. How has it prepared you for this role?

2. What attracts you to working with medically complex and chronically ill patients? What skills and qualities do you have that would make you effective in this role?

3. Describe a time when you had difficulty communicating with a patient or family member. How did you handle the situation and what did you learn from it? 

4. Discuss a difficult decision you had to make in your clinical practice recently. How did you determine the best course of action? 

5. How would you approach developing an individualized care plan for a patient with multiple chronic conditions and social barriers to managing their health? What would you focus on?

6. What do you see as the most challenging aspects of home health nursing? How would you address them?

7. What are some innovative strategies you have used to promote patient motivation or engagement in their own care and health outcomes?

8. Discuss an example of when you advocated for a patient in your care. What was the issue and outcome?  

9. How would you establish rapport and trust with patients as a new member of the care team entering their home?  

10. Why are you interested in this particular position and what relevant strengths would you bring to this team?

We conducted phone screenings with the top six candidates based on their applications. The two most compelling candidates were invited for in-person interviews. During the interviews, two team members would ask a question and evaluate the candidate's response before moving onto the next question asked by a different member. We were assessing not only the content of their answers but also their communication skills, confidence, rapport-building, and alignment with our team values.

After the interviews, we debriefed as a group to compare our evaluations of the candidates’ performance and determine who we felt was the best fit for the team based on our criteria. We offered the position to our top candidate, a candidate who demonstrated a passion for patient advocacy and education, comfort with complex clinical situations, and commitment to a collaborative approach in her work. 

Through this experience, I found evaluating my own communication, attitudes and professional practice to be as important as assessing the candidates. Conducting a collaborative hiring process challenged me to consider a candidate from multiple perspectives...
