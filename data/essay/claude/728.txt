The Single Origin model, also known as the Out of Africa theory, proposes that modern humans evolved in Africa and then dispersed into other parts of the world, replacing existing populations of Homo erectus and other archaic humans. This model suggests that all modern human populations today share a common ancestor from Africa from between 50,000 to 200,000 years ago. 

The fossil record provides significant evidence in support of the Single Origin model. The oldest known fossils of anatomically modern humans have been found in Africa, dating back 195,000 years. Skulls such as Omo I and Omo II from Ethiopia, as well as Skull 5 from South Africa, show a mix of archaic and modern features but are clearly Homo sapiens. The "anatomical modernity" of these early African fossils indicates they are closely related to modern populations today.

In contrast, the earliest modern human fossils found outside of Africa are much more recent. Remains from Israel's Skhul and Qafzeh caves are dated to 90,000-100,000 years old. Fossils from Australia and East Asia are only 45,000-60,000 years old. This suggests modern humans evolved in Africa for over 100,000 years before migrating out of the continent to other parts of the world. The replacement of archaic human populations outside of Africa, like Neanderthals in Europe and Homo erectus in Asia, provides further evidence for the spread of modern humans from an African point of origin.

Genetic evidence also strongly supports the Single Origin model. Studies of mitochondrial DNA, passed down maternally, and Y chromosome DNA, passed down paternally, both point to an African origin for modern humans. Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam, the most recent common ancestors of all people alive today based on these genetic markers, have been traced back to Africa. Genetic diversity is also highest among populations indigenous to Africa, especially in hunter-gatherer groups. This is consistent with African populations having the longest time for genetic mutations to accumulate in humans.

In summary, the Single Origin model proposes that modern humans evolved in Africa before dispersing around the world and replacing other archaic hominins. The fossil record shows that the oldest modern human remains are found in Africa, dating back nearly 200,000 years ago. Genetic evidence locates humanity's most recent common ancestors in Africa and shows higher human diversity among African populations. While debate continues, multiple lines of evidence point to Africa as the origin of our species, Homo sapiens.
