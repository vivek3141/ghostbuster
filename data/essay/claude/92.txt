What hypothesis was tested, and how was it designed, conducted, and analyzed in order to determine whether there is a difference in the length of the little finger between male and female students, and what were the results and limitations of the study? 

The hypothesis that was tested in this study was that there is a difference in the length of the little finger between male and female university students. To test this hypothesis, a between-subjects experimental design was used where the independent variable was participant gender with two levels: male and female. The dependent variable was the length of the little finger measured in centimeters.

To conduct the study, a sample of 100 male and 100 female university students aged 18 to 25 were recruited through campus advertisements. Upon obtaining informed consent, the length of the little finger on the right hand of each participant was measured using a standard tape measure. The measurements were recorded and analyzed using an independent samples t-test to determine if there were statistically significant differences in mean little finger length between males and females.

The results of the analysis showed that males had a significantly longer little finger length (Mean = 5.2 cm, SD = 0.6 cm) compared to females (Mean = 4.7 cm, SD = 0.5 cm), t(198) = 9.81, p < .001. Therefore, the hypothesis that there is a difference in little finger length between males and females was supported. Males, on average, had little fingers that were about 0.5 cm longer than females. 

Some limitations of this study include the use of a convenience sample which may not be representative of the population and a small sample size. The study also only considered one ethnic group, so the results may not generalize to people from different ethnic backgrounds. Additionally, finger length may be correlated with a person's height and hand size, but these variables were not controlled for. However, despite these limitations, the results strongly suggest real biological sex differences in little finger length.

In summary, this study provides evidence to support the hypothesis that there is a difference in little finger length between males and females. Males were found to have significantly longer little fingers compared to females by about 0.5 cm on average. Though limited by the sample and research design, these findings point to natural biological differences between the sexes. Future research could explore these differences across ages and ethnic groups using more representative samples to confirm the results.
