Human sacrifice was a deeply important religious and political practice for the Aztecs of central Mexico during the 15th and 16th centuries CE. The Aztecs, or Mexica, believed that human sacrifice was necessary to ensure the continuity of the universe and the movement of the sun, moon, and stars. The goddess of the sun, Huitzilopochtli, in particular required human hearts and blood to rise each morning. The large-scale sacrifices of enemy warriors during religious festivals also served an important political role in intimidating adversaries and demonstrating the military might of the Aztec emperor.  

Religiously, the Aztecs believed that human sacrifice was necessary to ensure the continuity of the cosmos and the rising of the sun. According to Aztec mythology, the sun god Huitzilopochtli needed human blood and hearts to rise each morning. If sacrifices were not made, the sun would not rise and the world would end. The sacrificial victims were seen as messengers who accompanied the sun on its journey, and their spilled blood and torn-out hearts fed and reinforced the sun. Monthly festivals involved ritual sacrifice, and more captives were killed during major religious ceremonies and the coronation of new emperors.

Politically, large-scale sacrifices, especially of captured enemy warriors, served to intimidate adversaries and bolster the status of the emperor. The Aztecs engaged in frequent warfare known as the Flower Wars to capture victims for sacrifice. Tens of thousands of captives were brought back for sacrifice during the monthly and special festivals. For example, after the inauguration of the Great Temple in Tenochtitlan in 1487 CE, over 80,000 captives were reportedly sacrificed over 4 days. Witnessing this gruesome spectacle would have terrified enemies and demonstrated the military might commanded by the emperor.

In contrast, human sacrifice was much less institutionalized and centralized in other ancient civilizations. The Mayans did practice sacrifice, but on a smaller scale, and victims were more often captives from warring city-states rather than a natural death or sacrifice. The Incas practiced sacrifice primarily through capacocha ceremonies sacrificing children, but on a smaller scale. Human sacrifice was rare and controversial in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, mostly restricted to royal funerals. Only the Aztecs practiced large-scale sacrifice of enemy warriors as a tool of intimidation and to honor their gods.  

In conclusion, religion and politics were deeply intertwined in Aztec human sacrifice. Victims were sacrificed on a massive scale to ensure the continuity of the cosmos and honor the gods, especially the sun god Huitzilopochtli. But sacrifice also served to intimidate adversaries through a brutal spectacle of violence, demonstrating the military power of the emperor. Though other ancient cultures practiced human sacrifice, none matched the scale, centralization, and influence of the Aztecs. Their macabre rituals live on in popular imagination as a symbol of the heights of religious zeal and the depths of human darkness.
