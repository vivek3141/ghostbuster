In her research study on sexual attitudes across cultures, Judith Treas published the book "Comparative Perspectives on Sexuality: A Cross-National Study of University Students in 22 Countries" in 1992. The central research question Treas aimed to explore was how university students' attitudes and values around sexuality varied across different cultural contexts. 

To examine this question, Treas adopted a cross-national survey methodology. She developed a survey instrument with over 200 questions covering topics such as premarital sex, extramarital sex, homosexuality, abortion, and gender roles. This survey was administered to over 20,000 university students across 22 countries spanning Asia, Africa, Latin America, North America, and Europe between 1988 and 1990. Some of the included countries were the U.S., Britain, France, West Germany, China, Japan, Nigeria, Chile, and India.

Using the survey data, Treas analyzed differences in attitudes between countries to identify broader patterns related to cultural values. For example, she found more permissive attitudes toward premarital and extramarital sex in Western nations compared to Asian and African nations. She attributed these differences to cultural values around individualism, gender equality, and secularism that were more prominent in Western nations. Treas also examined differences in attitudes within countries based on personal factors like gender, religiosity, and socioeconomic status.

While informative, there are some important limitations to Treasâ€™ cross-national study that warrant acknowledgment. First, by focusing on university students, she examined a select, educated sample that may not represent the broader diversity of cultural attitudes in each country. University environments can also promote more progressive cultural views, potentially biasing the results. 

Second, the survey method relied on self-reported data, which can be subject to social desirability bias. Respondents may have felt inclined to report attitudes they felt were more culturally acceptable rather than their personal views. This could have led Treas to underestimate differences between countries.

Third, conducting the exact same survey across diverse cultural contexts could have led to misinterpretations or unequal understandings of questions or response options between countries. Some concepts around sexuality do not translate equivalently across cultures. So the survey may not have measured exactly the same attitudes in each country.

In summary, Judith Treas employed a cross-national survey study to systematically compare university students' sexual attitudes across 22 countries. While an innovative methodology, there were some significant limitations including a narrow sample, potential self-report biases, and issues in cross-cultural survey adaptation. For future research, mixed-methods approaches, more representative sampling, and localized surveys may help address these limitations. Overall though, Treas' research provided meaningful insights into the role of culture in shaping sexuality attitudes worldwide.
