There were several major causes of increasing tension between the Northern and Southern states in the decade before the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. These tensions stemmed from differences over the issues of state's rights versus federal authority, western expansion of slavery, and economic and social differences between the regions. Ultimately, political compromises to accommodate these tensions broke down completely in the early 1860s, precipitating secession and war.

The first major issue was a disagreement over state's rights versus federal authority. The Southern states believed that they retained a large degree of sovereignty and autonomy under the Constitution to govern themselves, especially on the issue of slavery. The Northern states disagreed and believed the federal government held superior authority. This came to a head over the tariff issue in the 1830s, when South Carolina threatened to nullify a federal tariff they viewed as unfair. The conflict was resolved by a compromise tariff, but the underlying tension over state's rights remained.

A second tension arose over the expansion of slavery into new territories in the West. The South wanted to expand slavery into these new territories, while the North opposed its expansion. The Missouri Compromise of 1820 established a dividing line allowing slavery in some new territories, but this compromise broke down with the acquisition of more territory after the Mexican-American War. The Compromise of 1850 then allowed some territories to decide for themselves on slavery through popular vote. However, the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 repealed this compromise and allowed these territories to choose whether to be "free" or open to slavery. This led to bloody conflict between pro-slavery and anti-slavery forces in Kansas.

There were also intensifying economic and social differences between the agrarian South and the increasingly industrial North. The North had a larger population and greater wealth than the South, with booming industries such as textiles and railroads. The South remained dependent on agriculture, especially cotton and tobacco grown by slave labor. There was a growing sense in the South that their economy and political power were declining relative to the North. Socially, the regions had grown further apart in the decades since independence.

Attempts at political compromise to bridge these tensions ultimately failed in the late 1850s and early 1860s. The Compromise of 1850 and Kansas-Nebraska Act were seen as concessions to the South, and they intensified sectional conflict. The Republican Party emerged in the North with a platform to restrict slaveryâ€”they were opposed by the Southern Democrats. When the Republican Abraham Lincoln was elected President in 1860, the deep South seceded from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America. War erupted in April 1861 with the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter in South Carolina.

In summary, growing tensions over state's rights, the expansion of slavery, and economic/social differences led to a breakdown in political accommodation between North and South. Secession and war were seen by both sides as the only remaining options by 1861. The Civil War that followed resolved in the Union's favor the questions of secession and slavery that had been the roots of sectional crisis.
