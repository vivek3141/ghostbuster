The friendship between James Joyce and Italo Svevo was instrumental in the development of each author's writing. Although Svevo was twenty-years older than Joyce, the two men met in Trieste, Italy in 1907 and quickly bonded over their shared love of literature. At the time, Joyce was working as an English tutor while Svevo ran a successful glass business. Joyce helped Svevo improve his English, and Svevo became a champion of Joyce's work, which at the time was not yet recognized as genius. Their friendship blossomed into a mutually supportive literary relationship that had a profound impact on both of their writings.

When Joyce and Svevo first met, Joyce was still in the early stages of his writing career. He had only published a few poems and was working on drafts of Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Svevo, on the other hand, had written and self-published two novels to little acclaim: Una Vita and Senilit√†. However, after meeting Joyce and improving his English under Joyce's tutelage, Svevo developed a keen interest in creative writing. He was fascinated by Joyce's avant-garde style and asked Joyce to critique his previous works. Joyce obliged and provided feedback that would shape Svevo's third novel, La Coscienza di Zeno. Svevo made substantial edits to the novel based on Joyce's notes before publishing it in 1923. La Coscienza di Zeno proved to be Svevo's breakthrough work and brought him literary recognition, in large part due to Joyce's guidance and support.

At the same time, Svevo became an early champion of Joyce's groundbreaking work. He promoted Joyce's writing to contacts in the literary world and provided Joyce feedback on drafts of Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist. Svevo was an especially strong advocate of Joyce's first novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, which had been rejected for publication by several publishing houses. Svevo's support and belief in Joyce's talent were invaluable to helping Joyce find the confidence to continue developing his experimental style. Joyce's relationship with Svevo affirmed for him that even if his writing was not immediately understood, it had artistic value. 

While living in Trieste, Joyce and Svevo met frequently to discuss literature and share details of their writing projects. There are accounts of lively debates the two engaged in about aesthetics and the purpose of art. These conversations challenged each other and broadened their perspectives. As Joyce progressed into writing Ulysses, he shared parts of drafts with Svevo, who gave feedback even as the novel became increasingly complex. Svevo's willingness to engage deeply with Joyce's most experimental work further strengthened their bond.

The friendship between Joyce and Svevo demonstrates the significant influence that relationships between writers can have on their work. Their literary friendship was built on a shared passion for pushing the boundaries of fiction and mutual support in pursuing avant-garde styles that were not always embraced by mainstream audiences. By championing each other's most creative writing, Joyce and Svevo emboldened one another to further experiment. The feedback and critiques they provided helped shape drafts into finished works that came to define modernism. Through a fortuitous meeting and an enduring friendship, Joyce and Svevo shaped each other's destinies as writers and produced some of the 20th century's most notable works of fiction. Their relationship illustrates the profound impact of literary friendships.
