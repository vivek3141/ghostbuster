Students who have been disciplined or expelled from school may have grounds to challenge the school's decision through judicial review. There are several possible arguments they can make in court to review the school's actions.

One argument is that the school failed to consider relevant considerations when making its decision. The court will examine whether the school took into account all the relevant factors in the student's particular case. If the school failed to consider factors like the student's disciplinary record, personal circumstances, or the specific context of the incident, the court may find that the school's decision was unreasonable. For example, if a student with no prior record was expelled for a first minor offense without consideration of his clean record, that may suggest the school failed to weigh relevant considerations. 

A second argument is that the student was denied the right to a fair hearing. Procedural fairness requires that individuals are given an opportunity to understand the case against them, respond to allegations, and have their responses considered before a decision is made. If a school expelled a student without properly notifying them of the charges, giving them a chance to defend themselves, or allowing them to have a representative present, that lack of fair procedure could warrant judicial review. The court will assess whether the school's disciplinary process was consistent with the duty to act fairly.

A third argument is that the decision-makers were biased or gave the appearance of bias. The rule against bias requires that school officials act impartially when making disciplinary decisions. If it can be shown that the officials were prejudiced against the student, had predetermined the outcome before hearing the case, or would benefit personally from the student's discipline, the decision may be overturned due to bias. However, establishing actual bias can be difficult, so a court may also intervene if there is simply a reasonable perception of bias based on the circumstances.

The principles of proportionality and Wednesbury unreasonableness may also be used to challenge the school's policies or decisions. The principle of proportionality means that the punishment must fit the offense. If a school were to permanently expel a student for a minor first offense, that may be seen as disproportionate by a reviewing court. Under the Wednesbury principle, a school policy or decision can be overturned if it is so unreasonable that no reasonable person acting reasonably could have made it. An example may be a school's policy to always suspend students for swearing, regardless of context or individual factors. A court could rule that such a policy fails the test of reasonableness according to the Wednesbury standard.
