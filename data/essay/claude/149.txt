My Experience Studying Emergency Medicine in Egypt 

The decision to pursue a summer internship studying emergency medicine in Cairo, Egypt was both exciting and nerve-wracking. On the one hand, the opportunity to explore a vibrant foreign capital and immerse myself in a new medical system was thrilling. On the other hand, travelling to a country experiencing political unrest and uncertainty gave me pause. However, my curiosity and desire for a challenge ultimately outweighed my reservations.

Upon arriving in Cairo, I was immediately struck by the energy and bustle of the city. The traffic, the sounds, the smells—all were new and invigorating. My program was based out of Kasr Al-Ainy Medical School, one of Egypt's top institutions, located right in downtown Cairo. For the first two weeks, we received intensive instruction in emergency care techniques and procedures, many of which differed from standard practices in Western hospitals. We learned triage methods adapted for mass casualties, how to operate with limited medical resources, and innovative ways of handling severe trauma. The hands-on experience in Kasr Al-Ainy's emergency department was invaluable. The variety of cases, from industrial accidents to violent crimes, exposed me to many conditions I had only read about in textbooks.  

Outside of our medical duties, experiencing Cairo as a wide-eyed foreigner was unforgettable. I wandered the alleyways of Khan el-Khalili bazaar, dodging merchants hawking their wares. I gaped at the towering pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx, still shrouded in mystery. I explored the Cairo Museum, housing untold ancient treasures like mummies, monumental statues, and the golden death mask of Tutankhamun. On weekends, my fellow students and I would stay out late, sharing meals, laughing over cups of thick Turkish coffee, and attempting to communicate with friendly locals. We felt perfectly at ease, exploring on our own and soaking in all the city had to offer.

However, that sense of ease was shattered halfway through my trip. On an unassuming Wednesday, a bomb exploded at Khan el-Khalili bazaar, killing 17 people and injuring dozens more. My classmates and I had wandered that very spot just days before. The attack was a harsh reminder of the instability bubbling below the surface. At the hospital, the emergency department was inundated with victims, many suffering horrific injuries. We worked for hours assisting doctors and nurses with triage, bandaging wounds, giving morphine for pain, and comforting shell-shocked patients. The first-hand experience of a mass emergency situation like this was eye-opening but harrowing. I felt a mixture of emotions—panic, helplessness, resilience—that I had never faced in my medical training.

When my internship ended and I returned home, I felt changed by my experiences in Egypt, both good and bad. I had grown tremendously as an emergency medical provider, gaining valuable knowledge and skills that are otherwise difficult to attain. But beyond the medical education, living in Cairo, if only briefly, made me appreciate the unforeseen challenges of practising medicine in a developing country. Most of all, bearing witness to ordinary people facing unthinkable tragedy with courage and grace gave me a deeper understanding of human resilience. Despite its difficulties, I will always look back on my time in Egypt with a sense of pride at having stepped far outside my comfort zone and embarked on a journey that has shaped who I am today, both personally and professionally.
