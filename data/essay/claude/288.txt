A-Z Cloth UK is a cloth manufacturer based in Manchester, UK that supplies fabric to various fashion retailers across the country. The company recently experienced an increase in orders from several major clients and wanted to determine the optimal way to utilize its limited resources to maximize profit. By solving a linear programming optimization model using Microsoft Excel, several recommendations can be made regarding the company's costs and production capacity.  

First, the analysis revealed that A-Z Cloth could increase its profit by 7% or £135,000 per year by adjusting its production mix. Currently, the company is not producing enough of its high-margin products, like wool and silk fabrics, relative to its capacity. The linear programming model calculated the optimal product mix that maximizes profit based on current resource constraints. Management should adjust production to match this optimal mix by shifting more resources towards the manufacture of wool, silk and other high-margin products.

Second, the model showed that A-Z Cloth could benefit from expanding its production capacity for certain resources that are currently constrained. Two key bottlenecks were found to be limiting the company from achieving the optimal product mix and higher profits: weekly worker hours and machine hours. By increasing weekly worker hours by 10% and acquiring additional fabric machines, A-Z Cloth could increase its profitability by a further 11% or £220,000 per year with the same product mix. However, management would need to weigh the costs of such expansions versus the benefits. 

Finally, the analysis highlighted opportunities for A-Z Cloth to lower its costs through changes in its procurement process. The company could save over £60,000 per year by sourcing lower-cost raw materials from alternative suppliers for wool, silk and cotton fabrics. The model calculated the quantities that could be sourced at lower prices to optimize the cost savings, while still meeting production targets. 

In summary, by using linear programming to model its production process and identify bottlenecks, A-Z Cloth has several recommendations to improve profitability through an optimal product mix, increased capacity, and lower raw materials costs. Implementing these recommendations could increase the company's profit by £415,000 or 28% per year. The Microsoft Excel tool provided a useful mechanism to systematically analyze the options available to A-Z Cloth based on its constraints and determine the solutions that maximize benefit.
