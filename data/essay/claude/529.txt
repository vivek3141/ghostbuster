In 2004/2005, Tesco had a strong performance that was driven by their four-part strategy focusing on their core UK business, expanding into non-food items, offering retailing services, and growing internationally. 

Tesco's core UK food business continued to perform well in 2004/2005. They strengthened their dominant position in the UK grocery market, growing their market share from 28.6% to 30.1%. This was achieved through a focus on providing outstanding value and quality to customers. Tesco offered lower prices on staple products and ran successful promotions and discount events. They also continued improving their fresh food sections and product ranges to provide great quality. This solid performance in their core UK business gave Tesco the foundation and financial strength to invest in the other parts of their strategy.

Tesco made good progress in expanding their non-food ranges in 2004/2005. They added more dedicated non-food space in existing stores, opened standalone non-food stores called Extra, and continued expanding product ranges. Tesco's clothing brand 'Cherokee' performed well, and they also launched a homeware brand called 'Tesco Home'. Non-food sales growth outpaced food sales growth, increasing 20% in the year. The success of Tesco's non-food strategy reinforced the fact that customers wanted to buy high-quality non-food products at Tesco's low prices. 

Tesco also did well in developing their retailing services businesses, which included personal finance and internet shopping. Tesco Personal Finance had a great year, with profits exceeding Â£100 million for the first time. Tesco.com also performed strongly, with sales growing by over 50% in the year. Tesco started offering internet shopping service 'Tesco Express' which allowed customers to shop online and pick up their goods from smaller Express stores. These service offerings gave customers additional value and convenience, strengthening Tesco's brand and customer loyalty.  

Internationally, Tesco continued to expand by entering more markets and growing in existing markets. They entered Slovakia and Turkey, and also acquired Chinese retailer Hymall, which gave them a significant presence in China. Elsewhere, Tesco grew strongly in Central Europe, Ireland, and South Korea. Although still a relatively small part of the group, international growth gave Tesco long term opportunities for expansion beyond the UK.

In summary, Tesco had an excellent performance in 2004/2005, showing strong growth in all parts of their four-part strategy. Their core UK business went from strength to strength. Non-food and retailing services both performed well, supporting Tesco's capabilities beyond traditional grocery retail. And international growth provided Tesco future opportunities in emerging markets. Overall, Tesco's coherent and complementary four-part strategy drove their success and performance in 2004/2005.
