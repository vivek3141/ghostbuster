The traditional Westphalian model of international law centered on sovereign nation-states as the primary actors in global governance. However, globalization has fundamentally challenged this model by facilitating the rise of new governance mechanisms and actors that operate beyond and across nation-states. A "multi-layered network" of institutions and bodies has emerged to govern issue areas that transcend national borders, such as the global economy, environment, health, media, human rights, and conflict.    

Global economic governance provides one example of how governance has moved beyond the state. Institutions like the World Trade Organization, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund aim to regulate the global flow of trade, finance, and investment. While nation-states remain members, these bodies have established rules and norms of their own that shape national policies. The increasing power and influence of transnational corporations also highlight how economic governance now involves non-state actors. Corporations can threaten to move operations abroad if states impose too much regulation, undermining state sovereignty.

New communication technologies have enabled the rise of global media and networks that are difficult for any single state to control or censor. The Internet and social media connect citizens across borders, facilitating the spread of ideas, cultural influences, and political movements in ways that bypass traditional state governance. States struggle to assert authority over these global networks and the threats and opportunities they represent. 

Environmental issues like climate change have revealed the need for global governance to solve problems that do not respect national borders. Institutions such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have been established to assess scientific evidence, set targets, and hold countries accountable to global agreements like the Paris Accord. However, enforcement of these agreements remains a challenge, as nation-states prioritize their own domestic interests.  

Global health issues have also been met with international cooperation through the World Health Organization and partnerships between nations, NGOs, and private funders. However, governance of issues like pandemic disease or the equitable distribution of medicines is complex with many competing interests. States may resent encroachment on their sovereignty even as global cooperation is necessary.

In conclusion, globalization has fundamentally transformed global governance by enabling new institutions and actors that operate beyond nation-states. However, governance of global issues remains complex and contested, as states struggle to assert control and sovereignty in spaces that demand cooperation. A multi-layered global governance system has emerged, but its effectiveness depends on balancing national interests with global priorities. Overall, globalization has irreversibly changed the nature of governance in today's world.
