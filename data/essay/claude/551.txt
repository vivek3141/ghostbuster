"What was Che Guevara's contribution to the insurrectionary phase of the Cuban Revolution?"

Che Guevara was a central figure in the Cuban Revolution and played an instrumental role in the insurrection against Fulgencio Batista's dictatorship. As a guerrilla leader fighting beside Fidel Castro, Guevara helped orchestrate the revolutionary war that led to Batista's overthrow and the establishment of a communist government in Cuba.   

Guevara first met Castro in Mexico City in 1955 and joined his guerrilla army known as the 26th of July Movement. Guevara served as a military advisor and doctor to Castro's forces. When Castro's guerrillas landed in Cuba to launch their insurrection, Guevara came with them. He helped train new recruits in guerrilla warfare tactics and organized the communications systems between different units. Guevara led his own column of guerrillas that operated in the Sierra Maestra mountains. His column deployed effective hit-and-run tactics against Batista's forces, gaining victories at the battle of La Plata and the battle of Arroyo del Infierno. These victories boosted morale and propelled the spread of the insurgency.   

As the uprising gained momentum, Guevara took on a more prominent leadership role. In 1958, he was named commander of the four guerrilla columns that made up the Rebel Army's Santiago de Cuba garrison. From this position, Guevara helped orchestrate the final offensive against Batista's forces across the province of Oriente. On January 1, 1959, Batista fled Cuba as the guerrillas took control of Santiago and other major cities. Guevara then led his forces into Havana, marking the end of the insurrection and the triumph of the revolution.  

Guevara's military prowess, leadership, and socialist ideology made him a heroic figure in Cuba following the revolution. Along with Castro, he shaped the early policies of the new communist government. However, Guevara grew disillusioned with the direction of the Cuban regime and left Cuba in 1965 to support other leftist revolutionary movements around the world. He was killed while organizing guerrillas in Bolivia in 1967. 

In summary, Che Guevara was instrumental to the success of the guerrilla war against Batista in Cuba. He served as a military leader, advisor, and doctor to Castro's forces. Guevara led his own guerrilla column, helped plan the final offensive, and took control of Santiago and Havana. His contribution as a revolutionary leader and military tactician was essential to overthrowing Batista's dictatorship during the insurrectionary phase of the Cuban Revolution.
