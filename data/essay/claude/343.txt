There have been several factors that have contributed to the increased frequency and severity of financial crises around the world since the 1970s. These factors include increasing global financial integration, risky lending practices by banks and financial institutions, government policies that distort markets, and the erosion of controls on the movement of capital across borders. These factors interact with and exacerbate one another, creating vulnerability in the global financial system.

Global financial markets have become increasingly integrated since the 1970s due to advancements in communications technology, removal of capital controls, and increasing numbers of cross-border transactions and financial flows. This globalization of finance means that risks and shocks can spread quickly across the world. The East Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-1998 demonstrated how a crisis that began in Thailand with the collapse of the Thai baht spread rapidly to other East Asian countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and South Korea through the contagion effect. As global financial integration accelerates, the potential for financial contagion grows.  

Risky lending practices by financial institutions have also contributed to financial instability. In the pursuit of profits and market share, banks have incentives to lower lending standards and take on greater risks. They tend to lend excessively during economic booms when risks seem low, then cut lending dramatically during downturns. This amplifies the booms and busts of economic cycles. In the lead-up to the East Asian Financial Crisis, East Asian banks lent aggressively to risky borrowers and real estate projects, leaving the economies vulnerable when those debts went bad. 

Government policies like interest rate manipulation, excessive borrowing, and implicit guarantees for banks and firms can also plant the seeds for crisis. Low interest rates and government borrowing in the years before the crisis led to excess liquidity and risky speculation in East Asia. Governments also implicitly guaranteed the liabilities of weak financial institutions, creating moral hazard. When governments face crisis, often due to these distortionary policies, they turn to the IMF for emergency funding.

The IMF, as the lender of last resort for governments in crisis, has also contributed to moral hazard by repeatedly bailing out governments in crisis situations. After the Mexican peso crisis in 1994-1995 and the East Asian Financial Crisis, the IMF provided emergency loans to stabilize governments and economies. However, these bailouts reduce the incentives for governments to pursue sound economic policies and prudent regulation of their financial systems. They come to expect IMF intervention when crises happen, perpetuating risky behavior.

In summary, increasing global financial integration, risky banking practices, distortionary government policies, and moral hazard from IMF bailouts have been major factors contributing to financial instability since the 1970s. These factors have interacted to make the global financial system more prone to crisis, as demonstrated by the spate of financial crises in the developing world during this period, including the crisis that hit East Asia in 1997-1998. To strengthen the global financial system, greater regulation and oversight of financial institutions, more prudent macroeconomic policies, and less moral hazard from IMF lending are badly needed. Overall, reducing financial globalization and risks in the system can help create stability.
