Immanuel Kant's doctrine of Transcendental Idealism attempts to reconcile our common sense experience of an external world of objects with the view that the human mind actively structures sensory experience into an ordered whole. Kant argues that space, time, and causality are not externally existing relations that we discover in the world, but are instead the preconditions of our own cognition - the necessary framework through which we experience the world. 

Kant distinguishes between the phenomenal world, which is the world as we experience it through our senses, and the noumenal world, which refers to a hypothetical "real" world that exists independently of our perception. According to Transcendental Idealism, we can never have knowledge of things as they really are in themselves in the noumenal world. We can only know the phenomenal world, which is represented to us through the filters of our minds like space, time, and causality. These filters shape our experience and make the world appear to us in a law-governed and orderly fashion.

Space and time, for Kant, are the two "pure forms of intuition" - they are the frameworks within which we perceive objects and events. Space refers to the three-dimensional extension in which we experience objects, and time refers to the succession of moments that provide a before and after to events. Kant argues that space and time are not objective features of the external world, but are an integral part of our faculty of intuition or perception. We cannot perceive objects and events outside of these frameworks of space and time.

In addition to space and time, Kant identifies certain "categories of the understanding" such as causality that structure our experience. We tend to perceive events in the world as following causal laws, with preceding events necessitating subsequent events. But Kant argues causality is not an objective feature of the world that we discover; rather, it is a concept that we impose upon our experience. The categories give our experiences a logical coherence and unity, but they stem from our own minds, not the external world.

In this way, Kant reconciles our experience of an orderly spatiotemporal world governed by causal laws, with the idea that we can never know the ultimate nature of things as they are in themselves. We know only appearances, not the "things-in-themselves." Kant argues we play an active role, along with the unknown external world, in structuring our experience. Transcendental Idealism is Kant's attempt to account for how we can have knowledge of a world outside of us, while recognizing the role of our mental faculties in shaping that knowledge. Overall, Kant's view represents a Copernican revolution in Western thought, placing the human subject at the center of our comprehension of the world.
