Through my work experiences in the hospitality industry, I have gained valuable managerial and personal skills, as well as insights into industry practices. However, there are also certain skills I have not yet fully developed. 

Two key skills I have acquired are effective communication and problem-solving. As a front desk agent, I regularly interacted with guests and managed their concerns by actively listening, addressing their needs, and resolving issues to their satisfaction. For example, when a guest had lost his luggage, I reassured him, filed a complaint with the airline, and made the necessary arrangements for a temporary toiletry kit. I have become adept at using conflict resolution techniques and critical thinking to troubleshoot issues.

That said, I have not yet mastered delegation and providing constructive feedback, two other crucial managerial competencies. I tend to take on responsibilities myself rather than empowering others. I also find it challenging to give critical feedback to coworkers, as I aim to maintain harmony. These are skills I hope to improve through ongoing experience and mentorship.

The Meridien Dona Filipa, located in Portugal's Algarve region, exemplifies the use of effective customer service procedures and satisfaction measures. With amenities for business and leisure travelers alike, the Meridien cultivates a seamless guest experience through personalized welcome greetings, a online customer satisfaction survey, and prompt follow-up actions. The hotel has been recognized with numerous hospitality awards, demonstrating their commitment to exceeding guest expectations at every turn. 

In summary, I have developed valuable "hard" and "soft" skills through my work in hospitality, but recognize that learning is an ongoing process. By continuing to learn from experience, mentors, and industry leaders, I aim to expand my skill set and better meet the needs of my organization and its clientele. Overall, my experiences have taught me the importance of a growth mindset in a field where excellence is defined by the quality of each guest's experience.
