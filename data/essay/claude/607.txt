The objective of this laboratory was to gain hands-on experience controlling the M16C microcontroller and manipulating its output ports to display information on the seven segment LED displays. Through completing this lab, I learned how to program and operate the M16C to send signals to the output ports that would illuminate the correct LED segments to display numbers and letters.

To start, I had to configure the M16C's ports to be output ports so they could send signals to the seven segment displays. This involved setting data direction register values to 1 for the port pins connected to the displays. Next, I wrote a program to send signals to Ports 2 through 5, which were connected to the four seven segment displays. To display a number on a seven segment display, the correct combination of LED segments needs to be lit up. For example, to show the number 3, the a, b, c, d, and g segments need to be turned on. By manipulating the bits in the port data registers, I could turn on and off each of these seven segments.  

The program cycled through displaying the numbers 0 through 9 on the first seven segment display, with a short delay between each number. It then displayed the letters A through F on the same display, again with a short delay. This demonstrated how different numbers and letters could be shown by lighting up different LED segment combinations. The other displays were programmed in a similar manner to count from 0 up to 3 in binary, and then display the word "done".

Through completing this laboratory, I gained valuable experience with directly controlling a microcontroller to operate hardware peripherals. I learned how seven segment displays function at a fundamental level by illuminating LED segments to represent numbers and letters. I also enhanced my understanding of manipulating port data direction and data registers to turn on and off individual port pins. This hands-on learning and practice in interfacing a microcontroller with external hardware components is essential in developing a strong comprehension of embedded systems. Overall, this laboratory objective to control the M16C and seven segment displays was achieved, and much was learned about display interfacing and microcontroller port configuration and operation.
