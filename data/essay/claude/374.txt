International joint ventures can provide significant benefits to companies looking to expand into new markets or gain new capabilities. However, there are also risks that must be carefully managed. For HC, collaborating with CNI could help address capacity and cost issues through technology licensing or different patterns of joint venture collaboration.

On the benefit side, JVs allow companies to gain local market knowledge, share costs and risks, and leverage complementary skills. For HC, partnering with CNI could mean faster access to Chinese manufacturing expertise and distribution networks. CNI would gain HC's technical and product knowledge. 

However, there are risks of loss of control over technology, lack of strategic alignment, and the possibility of an unsuccessful partnership. HC would need to protect their intellectual property and ensure an equitable deal structure. They would also need to carefully evaluate CNI as a compatible partner whose goals match their own.

Licensing HC's technology to CNI could allow HC to gain royalties from their intellectual property while avoiding the risks of a full JV. However, they would lose control over how the technology is used and may face future competition.

Two patterns of JVs that could benefit HC are a production-sharing model, where HC contributes knowledge capital in exchange for supply, and a market-access model where CNI contributes local market knowledge. The key is finding the right model and partner to balance risks and rewards.

With careful planning to evaluate prospective partners, protect IP, share costs, and align strategic interests, HC could find substantial benefits from collaboration with CNI, whether through licensing or a joint venture. However, there are never guarantees of success, so they must go in with eyes open to the possibility of an unsuccessful partnership and be ready to withdraw if needed. Overall, the potential benefits of tapping into CNI's manufacturing and China market access may outweigh the risks if done strategically.
