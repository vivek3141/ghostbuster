Newborn infants possess a combination of innate and acquired knowledge about the world. While newborns demonstrate remarkable capabilities for perceiving and interacting with the world from the moment they are born, their understanding is also shaped by experiences, interactions, and learning that begin during gestation and continue after birth. 

Newborns show a preference for human faces within 30 minutes after birth, suggesting an innate predisposition for social interaction and connection. They will track moving faces and make eye contact, showing an attentiveness to human gestures and expressions. Newborns can imitate some basic facial expressions like mouth opening or tongue protrusion, indicating an innate ability to perceive and mimic human emotional expressions. They also prefer their mother’s face, voice, and smell, demonstrating the impact of prenatal experiences in shaping newborn preferences and the importance of early bonding and attachment.

However, newborns also have much to learn through interactions with caregivers and environments. They rely on communication and social interaction to comprehend other people’s intentions, feelings, and thoughts. Through interactions with caregivers, newborns learn to recognize signals, interpret facial expressions and tones of voice, and eventually understand that other people have their own perspectives, desires, and beliefs. These social-cognitive abilities are foundational to developing empathy and navigating human relationships. 

While newborns show a preference for human speech, especially their mother’s voice, language comprehension develops through social interaction. Newborns have to learn the phonemes, vocabulary, grammar, and meaning within a language, a process that requires exposure to language and active engagement with speakers. Similarly, newborns may be born with an innate motivation to grasp and manipulate objects, but transforming those reflexes into purposeful actions and coordinating perception with action requires practice and learning. Through grasping, mouthing, and banging objects, infants learn about three-dimensional shapes, textures, sounds, consequences of actions, and physical properties of the world.

In conclusion, newborns demonstrate a mix of innate predispositions, preferences, and learning capabilities as well as a reliance on social interaction and communication to comprehend the world. Their understanding is shaped by a combination of evolution and experiences, both pre- and postnatal. Newborns are primed to perceive, interact with, and learn about people and objects from birth, but cultivating those innate capabilities into a sophisticated understanding of their physical and social environments is a developmental process that unfolds over their first years of life through nurturing, communicative interactions with the world around them. Overall, newborns knowledge of the world is neither strictly innate nor strictly acquired but emerges out of an interplay between the two.
