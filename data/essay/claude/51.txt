As we age, our cognitive abilities tend to decline across several domains, including selective attention. Selective attention refers to our ability to focus on relevant information and ignore irrelevant distractors. There are several age-related deficits in selective attention that provide insight into theories of cognitive aging and also suggest ways to help improve cognitive functioning and quality of life in older adults.

One key deficit is that older adults struggle with inhibiting irrelevant information, which makes them more susceptible to distraction. Their attentional control weakens with age, making it harder to ignore distracting stimuli in the environment. This difficulty with inhibition is consistent with general theories of cognitive aging like the frontal lobe hypothesis, which proposes that age-related decline in frontal lobe function leads to impaired inhibitory control. Supporting this, research shows older adults have less activation in prefrontal control regions during selective attention tasks. Age-related deficits in inhibition also help explain why older adults perform more poorly on focused attention tasks with many distractors, like dichotic listening tasks. Understanding this deficit suggests interventions that can help, like training exercises focused on improving inhibition and attentional control. 

Another deficit is that older adults show declined visual selective attention, especially in the periphery. Their useful field of view tends to narrow with age, reducing their ability to selectively attend to peripheral visual information. This peripheral decline is predicted by theories like the sensory deficit hypothesis of aging, which proposes that age-related decline in sensory abilities leads to impaired higher-level cognitive skills that rely on perception. The useful field of view task directly measures how well people can selectively attend to and identify targets in the periphery, demonstrating substantial age-related declines. However, research shows that the useful field of view can be expanded with training, suggesting interventions for improving visual selective attention in older adults.

A third deficit is that older adults struggle more with dividing their attention between multiple streams of information. When they have to monitor and respond to two tasks at once, their performance on both tasks suffers. This difficulty with divided attention is consistent with resource theories of aging like the attenuated processing resources hypothesis, which proposes that aging reduces the total cognitive resources available for difficult mental tasks. Supporting this, research shows older adults exhibit reduced activation in key attention networks when performing divided attention tasks. However, the performance costs of divided attention can be reduced with practice, suggesting that dual-task training and practice interventions may help ameliorate these deficits in older adults.   

In summary, normal aging is associated with significant deficits in selective attention, including weakened attentional inhibition, decline of the useful visual field, and impaired divided attention. These deficits provide evidence for theories of cognitive aging related to frontal lobe function, sensory decline, and reduced processing resources. They also suggest practical interventions, like attentional control training, useful field of view training, and dual-task practice that could help improve selective attention and support healthy cognitive aging. Compensating for these selective attention deficits through cognitive training and practice interventions offers promise for maintaining and improving functioning in older adulthood.
