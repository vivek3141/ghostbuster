Businesses that sell products and services to other businesses, known as Business to Business or B2B companies, must develop a keen understanding of business buying behavior to effectively market their offerings. B2B demand has some distinct characteristics compared to consumer demand that require tailored marketing strategies. Companies like Fujitsu have adapted their marketing orientation and approaches to specifically target business clients by addressing their unique needs and procurement processes.

The most significant aspect of business buying behavior for B2B companies to understand is that purchase decisions are made by groups, not individuals. While consumers generally make intuitive buying choices based on personal preferences, B2B purchases are reasoned and analytical decisions made by committees that represent various functions. These cross-functional teams evaluate options based on the priorities of different departments. They scrutinize product specifications, costs, and the impact on operations. Emotional appeals that work for consumer marketing are ineffective. B2B marketers must make a strong, data-driven case to multiple stakeholders. 

B2B demand is also highly sensitive to specifications. Business products and services must seamlessly integrate into existing systems and processes. As a result, B2B offerings are usually customized to precise requirements. Companies like Fujitsu develop modular components and platforms that can be tailored to individual clients. They work closely with customers to determine optimal configurations and specifications. B2B marketing focuses on demonstrating ability to meet requirements rather than highlighting standardized features.

The B2B procurement process itself is also elongated and complex. While consumers can make impulse buys, B2B purchases follow a lengthy sequence of needs assessment, request for proposals, bidding, testing, and negotiations before a selection is made. B2B companies must have highly responsive sales and customer service teams to guide clients through the process. They need to provide consultative value by advising customers on options and helping determine solutions. B2B marketing involves long-term nurturing of relationships and trust-building. 

Fujitsu has recognized these characteristics of B2B demand in developing its marketing orientation. They emphasize a partnership approach, closely collaborating with clients to customize competitive solutions. They focus marketing on content and tools that allow clients to configure options and determine ideal system designs themselves. With a modular, scalable portfolio, they can create tailored solutions to meet unique specifications, even for large-scale projects. They also invest heavily in account management, with sales and service teams providing guidance during the complex B2B procurement process.  

In summary, the nature of business buying behavior requires B2B companies to demonstrate a marketing orientation attentive to key aspects like group decision-making, specific requirements, and lengthy procurements. By addressing these characteristics, companies like Fujitsu that sell complex solutions and services to other businesses can thrive. A targeted B2B marketing approach produces better outcomes than simply modifying consumer-focused strategies. With the right understanding of business clients and their needs, B2B companies can achieve a tight fit between demand and supply.
