A debate has long existed regarding the precise origins of racism and slavery in America. Did racism and a belief in the superiority of one race over another exist prior to the rise of the institution of racial slavery? Or were racist attitudes a consequence of the growth of slavery and America's growing dependence on the slave labor of black Africans? Both sides make compelling arguments that are complex, intertwined, and not easily disentangled. I argue that while racism likely existed prior to the rise of the African slave trade it was greatly exacerbated and institutionalized after, and because of, slavery.

Slavery dates back thousands of years, but the enslavement and widespread ownership of humans based primarily on their race was a unique American phenomenon. Humans throughout time have always found reasons to justify the enslavement of others, whether due to their defeat in war, religion, nationality or ethnicity. The enslavement of black Africans was no different in that there were existing prejudices that made their systematic oppression and bondage somehow acceptable and justified in the minds of white colonists, even though any group of people can be found struggling on the bottom of social hierarchies. However, the black-white racial dynamic and belief in an inherent white superiority over blacks grew exponentially with the growth of the plantation system and the slave trade .

Racism, as in a sense of prejudice and bias against those of a different race, likely existed in some form in the early American colonies, as in any society that has contact with groups perceived as 'other.'  Some historians point to examples of discrimination against free blacks and Native Americans, as well as legal codes that used racial labels and distinctions well before slavery took hold. However, these prejudices were relatively minor and the distinctions were fluid and inconsistently applied. Racism became systematic and institutionalized in law and policy as slavery grew and the plantation economy depended on a strict racial divide to justify and enforce the brutal system. 

The development of the slave codes cemented the social and legal distinctions between the races. These codes stripped black slaves of their humanity and any rights, justifying their condition with claims of inherent inferiority. The racial ideology that justified slavery was further backed by flawed scientific theories, religious justifications and social hierarchies that placed whites, especially Anglo-Saxons, at the top. This belief system deemed blacks as morally, intellectually and culturally inferior to justify an economic system that treated them as property. Slavery would simply not have been sustainable without a systematic racism to uphold it.

In contrast, some historians argue that racism was primarily a means to an end - a way to rationalize the cruelty of slavery and the vast wealth accumulated through the free labor of black slaves. The need to reconcile the idea of equality and justice for all with the reality of slavery necessitated the belief in black inferiority. From this view, racism emerged to justify an economic system, not the other way around. Slavery may have initially been more about class and power, but evolved into a racial system to legitimize itself.

There are merits to arguments on both sides. However, the evidence suggests that while biases and prejudices predated slavery, racism as a systematic ideology used to justify the oppression and dehumanization of blacks arose alongside and in support of the institution of slavery. Slavery may have initially been more about labor and economics, but it could not persist without racism. The two grew and fed off each other, with slavery relying on racism to rationalize its cruelty, and racism evolving to justify the continuing practice of slavery. In the end, the origins are inextricably tied and difficult to separate. But racism as a widespread and institutional force, I argue, was a consequence of slavery rather than a precursor.
