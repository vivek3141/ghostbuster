The speakers in Pablo Neruda's "Tonight I Can Write" and William Butler Yeats' "When You Are Old" express their affection for their muses through strategic poetic elements that reflect their respective cultures. Neruda's poem is characterized by fluid, melodious lines that convey passion and vitality, mirroring Latin American artistic traditions. In contrast, Yeats' poem has a more formal structure with rhythmic rigidity, reflecting an Anglo-Irish literary aesthetic.

Neruda's poem features phonemes and rhyming patterns that give the poem a singing, lyrical quality which evokes the vivacity of Latin American literature. The poem abounds in soft consonant and vowel sounds like "m", "l", and "o" that roll off the tongue: "The night is shattered/and the blue stars shiver in the distance." Neruda also uses rhyming couplets like "my soul/the lighthouse, your name/the flame" that make the poem melodic. This fluidity and musicality mirrors hallmarks of Latin American literature that often emphasizes passion and vibrancy. 

In contrast, Yeats' poem has a stricter form with an ABABBBCBC pattern. The poem also favors harder consonant sounds, as in "when", "old", and "told". Instead of couplets, Yeats uses full rhyme between stanzas, as in "gold/cold". This more rigid structure reflects the Anglo-Irish poetic tradition, which values order, control, and formality. The stiffer sound patterns also make the overall tone more somber compared to the joyful sounds in Neruda's poem.

Neruda's poem has a breathless, effusive quality due to its long, flowing sentences: "In the dead of night...The bushes crackle in the dark, under my feet in the dark, to hear the sea breath to the shore, and back of the wheeling stars a silence tread noises among the leaves..." These long sentences convey the narrator's passion through their continuous, uninterrupted flow and their mimetic quality, reflecting the swelling and receding of the sea.

In contrast, Yeats' sentences are predominantly short and declarative: "And bending down beside the glowing bars, Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled..." These shorter sentences give the poem a measured, regretful tone, reflective of the mournful subject matter of lost love and aging. The brief, halted bursts of sentence structure also contrast with Neruda's extended, rhapsodic sentences, paralleling the difference between a youthful, energetic tone and an older, wistful one.  

While Neruda's poem makes ripe use of metaphorical language comparing the sea and the night to his beloved, Yeats' metaphors focus on the fading of beauty in age. Neruda refers to "the blue stars [that] shiver in the distance" and the "dead of night", implicitly connecting his thriving passion to the sea and night through metaphor. Yeats more explicitly compares his beloved's aging face to a "forest's autumn foliage after frost." These metaphors reflect the dominant themes in each poem of intense, youthful love in Neruda's work versus regretful reminiscence of lost love in Yeats'. 

In conclusion, Neruda and Yeats employ vastly different poetic tools that mirror the artistic milieus they come from and underscore the tones they aim to effect. The melodious fluidity of Neruda's poem reflects the vitality of Latin American culture, while the measured control in Yeats' poem mirrors Anglo-Irish formality. Their metaphors, sentence structure, and sound patterns coalesce to highlight the joyful sensuality of new love in Neruda's work and the mournful nostalgia in Yeats' work. Through a nuanced analysis of these elements, we gain a deeper understanding of how poetic devices can powerfully reflect and shape cultural sensibilities.
