Meaning is a foundational concept in language and philosophy of language. There have been many attempts to provide an account of meaning. Four of the most prominent theories are the Gricean theory, verificationist theory, linguistic externalism, and the causal theory. Each provides a distinct perspective on how to understand meaning and has positive and negative aspects worth considering. 

The Gricean theory of meaning, developed by Paul Grice, understands meaning in terms of speaker intention. According to Grice, the meaning of an utterance is the intended point the speaker is trying to get across by making that utterance. The positive aspect of this view is that it provides a straightforward explanation for how we understand implicit points and conversational implicatures. However, a key problem with this theory is that meaning seems to depend on mental states in the speaker's head rather than being grounded in the language itself. The theory also struggles to account for the meaning of linguistic expressions that lack a clear speaker intention, such as logical connectives.

The verificationist theory of meaning, associated with the logical positivists, holds that the meaning of a sentence is the method by which it is empirically verified. On this view, cognitive meaning is linked to sensory experience. The main advantage of this theory is that it provides an objective grounding for meaning in terms of an intersubjective connection between language and experience. However, the theory is limited because not all meaningful sentences can be conclusively verified (or falsified) by sensory experience. It also fails to account for meaning in abstract domains detached from immediate experience.

Linguistic externalism argues that the meaning of linguistic expressions is at least partly dependent on external factors such as the social and physical context. According to externalism, meanings are not entirely in the head but are spread across the context in which the language is embedded. The key benefit of this view is that it can account for how meanings can be shared between individuals and change over time due to shifts in context. However, critics argue that it makes meaning too epistemically inaccessible since speakers may lack awareness of all the contextual factors that determine meaning.

Finally, the causal theory of meaning holds that the meaning of a word or other representation is determined by the thing in the world that represents. Specifically, meaning is the entity that stands in an appropriate causal relation with the representation. The main strength of this theory is that it provides an objective grounding for meaning in the external world. However, the theory struggles to account for meaning in abstract domains where there is no clear thing being represented. It also cannot account for situations where there are multiple candidates for what stands in the appropriate causal relation.

In summary, while each theory aims to capture the essence of linguistic meaning, none are without their limitations. A plausible overall theory of meaning may need to incorporate insights from multiple perspectives to solve the puzzles that any single theory alone cannot adequately address. With a combined theoretical approach, progress can be made on understanding meaning and how it relates to this profound yet elusive concept we call language.
