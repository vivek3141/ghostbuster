Robert Nozick and John Rawls were two of the most prominent liberal political philosophers of the 20th century. While both philosophers aimed to establish theories of justice within liberal theory, their conceptions of justice differed in fundamental ways. Nozick advocated for a minimal libertarian state based on natural rights and laissez-faire capitalism. In contrast, Rawls argued for a social democratic welfare state aimed at benefiting the least well-off members of society.  

Nozick proposed an 'entitlement theory' of justice based on the principles of justice in acquisition, justice in transfer, and rectification of injustice. According to Nozick, individuals are entitled to whatever holdings and property they acquire through free exchange with others, as long as the initial acquisition of holdings was just. The role of the state should be minimal, limited to enforcing contracts and protecting individuals and their property. Nozick's entitlement theory thus implies a laissez-faire capitalist system with minimal redistribution. This has major implications for inequality, as there would be no mechanism to address the unequal distribution of resources and wealth in society.  

Rawls' theory of justice was based on the thought experiment of the 'original position' behind a 'veil of ignorance'. He proposed two principles of justice: equal basic rights and liberties, and any social and economic inequalities must benefit the least well-off. Rawls argued for the primacy of liberty and equality of opportunity. However, he also accepted the need for redistribution to benefit the poor. Rawls' difference principle implied the need for a social minimum and safety net. Still, his theory has been critiqued for not adequately addressing the problem of relative poverty.

From a communitarian perspective, Rawls' theory is overly individualistic. Rawls focused on justice for individuals and largely ignored the communities and relationships in which individuals are embedded. His theory lacked recognition of obligations to communities, families and future generations. In contrast, Nozick's entitlement theory embraced an radically individualistic theory that ignored social connections and obligations altogether. 

In conclusion, while Nozick and Rawls shared a commitment to liberalism and justice, their conceptions of justice differed in fundamental ways. Nozick advocated for a libertarian 'minimal state' based on natural rights, whereas Rawls proposed a social democratic welfare state aimed at benefiting the least well-off. Nozick's theory implied little concern for relative poverty and inequality, while Rawls aimed for equality of opportunity and a social minimum. Both theories have been critiqued for their treatment (or lack thereof) of social relationships, obligations and communities. Overall, this debate reflected the tension in liberal theory between individualism and social obligation.
