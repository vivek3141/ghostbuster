Pennyroyal oil is extracted from the Mentha pulegium plant, commonly known as pennyroyal. To extract and purify the essential oil, a steam distillation method can be employed. The pennyroyal plant material is placed in a still with a steam generator. The steam passes through the plant material, vaporizing the volatile compounds that contain the essential oils. The vapor then travels into a condenser, where it is cooled and condenses into a liquid that contains both water and the essential oils. This distillate is collected in a flask. As the distillate separates into an oil layer on top of a water layer, the essential oil can be siphoned off.

To characterize and determine the purity of the extracted pennyroyal essential oil, several analytical techniques can be utilized. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) can identify the chemical components and compounds present in the oil by separating the individual chemicals by their retention time in the GC column and then further analyzing them with MS to determine their molecular weight and structure. The GC-MS results can then be compared to known reference standards to assess the purity and identity of the major constituents of pennyroyal oil, such as pulegone, menthone, and neomenthol. GC-MS can also help determine if any contaminants or adulterants are present.

Determining the purity of the pennyroyal essential oil poses some challenges. The oil may contain trace impurities that are difficult to detect even with sensitive instrumentation. Minor constituents in the oil that are not matched to reference standards will also be challenging to identify and quantify. These unknowns can affect the overall purity determination. To address these challenges, purifying the oil further using additional distillation steps can help remove more impurities. Comparing the oil sample to a known reference standard of high purity pennyroyal oil can also help determine its purity. Employing additional analytical techniques, such as high performance liquid chromatography, can provide more information about the oil's chemical composition and improve purity assessment. 

The experiment could be improved by using higher quality plant material and optimizing the distillation procedure to maximize oil yield and purity. Trace analysis techniques like GC-MS could also be optimized to increase sensitivity and minimize interference. Other useful analytical techniques include Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to analyze the functional groups of the compounds in the oil and determine if the spectrum matches that of pure pennyroyal oil. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy could also be employed to further analyze the oil by determining the carbon and proton skeleton of its molecules.

In summary, steam distillation and GC-MS analysis were used to extract, purify and characterize pennyroyal essential oil. Challenges in determining purity were addressed through comparing results to known reference standards, additional distillation and employing more analytical techniques like HPLC, FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. Optimizing the experiment and utilizing a wider range of analytical methods can provide a more comprehensive analysis and characterization of the pennyroyal essential oil.
