From the 15th to 16th centuries, European explorers encountered a wide range of cultures across the world that were dramatically different from their own. In trying to understand these unfamiliar peoples, Europeans developed complex systems of perception and classification that were shaped by a variety of factors. Terms like "pagan" and "noble savage" were employed to portray extra-Europeans in both positive and negative lights, reflective of Europeans' ambivalence and sense of superiority towards foreign cultures. Genealogy also played an important role, as Europeans sought to establish common ancestral ties that could link unfamiliar peoples to the Western tradition.  

Upon first contact, Europeans were struck by the cultural differences that separated them from extra-Europeans. Unfamiliar religious practices in particular were seen as threatening, leading extra-Europeans to be labeled as "pagans" - heathens who worshipped false idols and lacked true faith. The Aztecs, for instance, were described by the conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo as "great idolaters" who sacrificed humans to appease their gods. Such accounts portrayed pagans as savage, barbaric, and in need of conversion to Christianity. 

At the same time, some Europeans admired qualities of native peoples and constructed the notion of the "noble savage" - the innocent primitive who had not been corrupted by civilization. The French essayist Michel de Montaigne idealized native Brazilians as inhabiting a pure state of nature, writing that "these nations seem to me barbarous in this sense, that they have been fashioned very little by the human mind, and are still very close to their original naturalness." The noble savage represented a romanticized view of human possibility prior to societal conventions.

Both the pagan and noble savage concepts reflected the general sense of European superiority over foreign cultures that lacked civilization, Christianity, and written traditions. However, as exploration expanded, this superiority was challenged by the realization that some extra-European civilizations were highly complex. In response, genealogy became an important tool for linking unfamiliar peoples to Biblical tradition and constructing a common humanity. The historian Jean Bodin proposed that inhabitants of the New World originally descended from Noah, but somehow became separated over time. By proposing ancestral connections, genealogy helped make the unfamiliar more familiar.

In conclusion, Europeans classified and understood extra-European peoples through a diverse range of perceptions that incorporated feelings of superiority, admiration, and ancestral kinship. Terms like "pagan" and "noble savage" reflected contrasting views of foreign cultures, while theories of genealogy allowed Europeans to relate unfamiliar peoples to a shared tradition and understand them in a familiar framework. Although shaped by varied and complex motivations, European perceptions and classifications of the Other during this era worked to assimilate extra-European peoples into a Western cultural consciousness on European terms.
