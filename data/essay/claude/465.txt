The strength and radicalism of the working class left in Chile and Argentina diverged significantly  in the mid-20th century. By the 1950s, the Chilean working class had become strongly aligned with the Communist Party and militant trade unions, engaging in direct action and violent strikes. In contrast, much of the Argentine working class supported the populist regime of Juan Perón, viewing Peronism as the political movement that best represented their interests. 

Several factors contributed to these differences. First, the urban identities and living conditions of workers in Chile and Argentina shaped their political views and tactics. Chilean workers were crowded into cramped, substandard housing in Santiago and other cities, living and working in close proximity. This facilitated the spread of radical ideologies and organizing. Argentine workers, on the other hand, had greater access to social programs and public services under Perón that improved their living standards, engendering support for his regime.

Second, labor laws and policies in each country impacted the strength and radicalization of the working class. In Chile, restrictive laws banned communist parties and trade unions for parts of the early 20th century. When these restrictions were lifted, a surge of organization led to the formation of militant trade unions like the Confederation of Chilean Workers (CTCH). Repression bred radicalism. In Argentina, on the other hand, Perón enacted progressive labor laws that granted workers rights to organize and bargain collectively. The General Confederation of Labor (CGT), allied with Perón, became the largest trade union federation in Latin America. Material gains and political inclusion moderated the Argentine working class.

Finally, the rhetoric and appeals of political leaders shaped working class identities in each country. In Chile, communist and socialist leaders framed capitalism as the enemy and called for revolution, resonating with workers facing poverty and oppression. In Argentina, Perón fashioned an narrative of class collaboration and Argentine nationalism that united workers and employers under his populist movement. Perón provided tangible benefits to workers, winning their strong support. 

In conclusion, urban conditions, labor policies, and political rhetoric combined to radicalize the Chilean working class and tie the Argentine working class to Peronism. Militant unions and Marxist ideologies thrived in Chile, while improved living standards and inclusion in Perón’s coalition moderated the Argentine working class. These factors cultivated two very different kinds of leftism that would endure in Chile and Argentina for decades. Overall, the strength of the left depended on the avenues available for the working class to express its voice and secure its interests.
