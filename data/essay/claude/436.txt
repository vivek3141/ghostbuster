The two main areas of project management that are the focus of this critical appraisal are risk management and planning and control of activities. Effectively managing risk and planning project activities are crucial to the success of any project. 

Risk management involves identifying potential risks that could impact the project, analyzing and evaluating those risks, and developing and implementing strategies to address them. If risks are not properly managed, they can jeopardize the success of the project. There are several common risks that project managers must consider, including risks related to scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, and external events. To manage these risks, project managers often develop a risk management plan that outlines how risks will be identified, assessed, and mitigated. They also frequently use tools like risk registers to log and track risks and risk mitigation procedures. Adapting risk management to the specific management strategy or context of a project is important. The level of risk assessment and response needs to match the complexity and priorities of the project. Projects that are more complex or risky may require very formal and rigorous risk management processes, whereas projects with less uncertainty may only need light or informal risk management. Project managers must tailor their risk management approach to the unique needs and constraints of the project.

Planning and controlling activities refers to the processes of planning the specific activities required to complete the project, implementing and monitoring those activities, and taking corrective action as needed to keep the project on track. This includes developing detailed schedules, budgets, and plans for resource allocation as well as regular monitoring of progress, costs, resource utilization, quality, and other key performance indicators. If performance deviates significantly from the plan, the project manager must determine the source of the variance and make appropriate changes and corrections. Like risk management, the level of planning and control needs to match the needs of the project. More complex projects typically require very detailed plans and tight control mechanisms, while simpler projects may require only high-level plans and loose monitoring. Project managers need to determine the right level of planning and control for their particular project. 

In summary, risk management and planning and control are two of the most important areas of focus in project management. Adapting the approach to risk management and control to the specific project context is key to success. With the right level of risk assessment and mitigation as well as detailed yet flexible plans and control mechanisms, project managers can position their projects for successful outcomes. A one-size-fits-all approach will not workâ€”the project management methodology needs to fit the project. Careful tailoring of risk management and control strategies to the complexity and priorities of the project will help ensure optimal project performance.
