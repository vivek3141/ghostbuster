The British were defeated by the American colonists during the Revolutionary War, despite having a far more seasoned army and greater wealth. There were several reasons for this upset of conventional military thinking.

First, the British military leadership underestimated the challenges posed by fighting a war across the Atlantic in a hostile environment. The British army had to transport troops and supplies over 3000 miles across the ocean, a difficult logistical challenge. The colonists, on the other hand, could depend on local supplies and were fighting on their native soil. The British commanders also failed to account for the harsh climate of North America and the difficulty of conducting military campaigns over long distances in undeveloped territory. Unlike in Europe, the lack of infrastructure and difficult geography in America made it harder to quickly mass or move troops.

Second, the British military failed to adapt their traditional tactics to this new environment. They were accustomed to fighting conventional European wars and relied heavily on bayonet charges and frontal assaults. These tactics proved disastrous against the guerrilla warfare and skirmishing tactics adopted by the colonists. The colonists' sharpshooters and irregular fighters made it difficult for the British to leverage their numerical superiority. The British also had trouble suppressing dissident populations and suffered losses from frequent ambushes. The colonists exploited their knowledge of the terrain to stage hit-and-run attacks that took a psychological toll on the British troops.

Third, the British failed to gain the loyalty and support of colonists. They assumed that the mere threat of military action would cow most colonists into submission, but this did not happen. Many colonists resented new British taxes and policies and were committed to the ideals of liberty and self-governance. The British also wrongly assumed that Loyalists would provide the majority of support, but the numbers of Loyalists were much lower than anticipated. The lack of local support meant the British had trouble gathering intelligence on the rebels or supplementing their troops. They were fighting in hostile and unfamiliar territory without allies.
