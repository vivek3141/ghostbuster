An Ethical Dilemma: Respecting Patient Autonomy in Practice 

As a student nurse on clinical placement, I encountered an ethical dilemma that challenged my understanding of patient autonomy and advocacy. The situation involved a patient, Mr. Smith, who had been admitted with congestive heart failure and an infection. His condition was serious but stable, and the treating team recommended an invasive procedure to improve his heart function. However, Mr. Smith was expressing strong views against it, citing his religious beliefs and desire to avoid further intervention. The team believed the procedure was in his best medical interests despite the risks. I was uncertain whether to support the patient’s wishes or the medical recommendation.

Autonomy refers to the ability to self-govern according to one’s values and beliefs (Beauchamp & Childress, 2013). It is a fundamental principle in healthcare ethics, enshrined in laws and policies granting patients the right to informed consent or refusal of treatment (Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia, 2018). However, in practice patient autonomy can conflict with beneficence, whereby healthcare professionals feel obligated to provide interventions that maximise patient wellbeing (Johnstone, 2016). This was the central tension in Mr Smith’s case.

On the one hand, as an advocate I felt duty-bound to defend and promote Mr Smith’s autonomy to self-determine his treatment or lack thereof, as is his legal right. My role was to ensure his voice was heard and preferences respected to the fullest degree possible (Spicker, 2011). On the other hand, the medical team were equally determined to act beneficently by pursuing a life-saving procedure. Their recommendation aligned with my goal as a nurse to provide best care and optimal health outcomes for patients. However, overriding Mr Smith’s clearly expressed wishes could damage his trust in the healthcare system and undermine his basic rights (Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia, 2018).

In deliberating this dilemma, I reflected on literature emphasising the importance of shared decision making and person-centred practice (Muller, 2010). The team could have taken more time to understand Mr Smith’s perspective, address his concerns, and find a solution that both respected his autonomy and fulfilled their duty of care. Research shows accommodation and compromise are possible when patients and practitioners engage collaboratively (Entwistle, Carter, Cribb & McCaffery, 2010). However, the urgency of Mr Smith’s condition limited the opportunity for protracted discussion and his staunch views presented a difficult barrier.   

Ultimately, I believe the most ethical resolution was to support Mr Smith’s refusal of the recommended procedure. While not medically optimal, it upheld his right to autonomous choice in accordance with personal values. The team’s duty to beneficence was not diminished but had to be balanced against respect for patient autonomy, with the final decision resting with the patient. Continuous respect for autonomy is foundational in nursing to establish trust and meaningful partnerships between practitioners and those they serve (Spicker, 2011).  

This experience highlighted for me the complex interplay between principles in practice and the ambiguities of “right” answers. My learning will influence how I approach ethical dilemmas in future to give higher priority to patient perspectives and shared decision making. However, I also recognise there may again be situations where professional duty calls for advocacy contrary to patient wishes due to serious risks or legal obligations. I will strive to sustain transparency and open communication to reconcile autonomy and beneficence wherever possible.

In summary, the ethical dilemma of Mr Smith’s care illuminated tensions between respecting patient autonomy and acting beneficently according to medical judgement. Supporting his autonomy was the ethically warranted choice, despite limitations, to uphold his rights and dignity. My role as patient advocate in promoting an autonomy-based resolution has spurred reflection on how to ethically navigate comparable situations where values and duties do not align. With a commitment to shared partnership and trust, autonomy and beneficence can be balanced through seeking common ground and understanding alternative perspectives. This experience has been formative in shaping my developing identity as a nurse empowered to support patients’ self-determination above all else.
