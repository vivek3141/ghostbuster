Mancur Olson's theory of how democracy and good governance can lead to economic growth seems to apply well to the divergent experiences of China under the Qing dynasty and Western Europe since the late Middle Ages. In China, the Qing regime was an autocratic system with weak property rights and high corruption, leading to economic stagnation. In contrast, Western Europe saw the rise of more democratic institutions, stronger property rights, and reduced corruption, enabling an economic takeoff.

The Qing dynasty ruled China from 1644 to 1912. It was an autocratic system centered around the emperor, with little representation for citizens or limits on the ruler's power. Under the Qing, property rights were not strongly enforced, and arbitrary confiscation of property was common. Corruption was also widespread, as government officials extracted bribes and kickbacks. According to Olson's theory, these conditions undermine economic incentives and growth. 

In Western Europe, especially Britain, more democratic institutions emerged over time, with expanding voting rights, representation in government, and constraints on rulers' authority. Property rights were also better protected under common law, and corruption declined. Olson argues that as these democratic reforms took place, special interests had less influence and economic policies favored broader prosperity. This enabled greater security of property and contracts, a business environment less distorted by bribes, and overall higher economic dynamism and growth.

The economic experiences of China and Western Europe during this period reflect these differences in institutions and governance. China's economy stagnated under the Qing, with little growth in per capita income. In Britain, the economy took off, with rising trade, commerce, and per capita GDP. While other factors were also at play, China's autocratic system and weak property rights likely stifled growth, whereas Britain's democratic reforms and secure property rights encouraged it. 

In conclusion, Olson's theory articulating the link between democracy, good governance, and economic success seems to explain well the divergent paths of China and Britain during this era. China's autocracy and weak institutions failed to provide the secure environment for commerce and growth that emerged in Britain with democratic reforms and stronger property rights. Overall, the extent to which a society's institutions and policies foster economic opportunity and incentive - as Olson argues - can have a substantial impact on its prosperity and development.
