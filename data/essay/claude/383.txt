The Volkswagen Beetle is one of the most successful and iconic cars of all time. Over 21.5 million Beetles were manufactured and sold worldwide between 1938 and 2003. The Beetle design was the brainchild of Ferdinand Porsche in the 1930s. Porsche was commissioned by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler to develop an affordable car for the German public. The initial design was meant to have rear engine and rear wheel drive to maximize interior space. The first prototypes were built in 1935. 

Full-scale production of the Beetle began in Wolfsburg, Germany in 1938. The car was called the KdF-Wagen, with the acronym KdF standing for "Kraft durch Freude" or "Strength Through Joy." World War II interrupted production, but after the war, the factory recommenced operations and the car was renamed the Volkswagen Type 1. In the postwar era, the Beetle became a symbol of accessible mobility in West Germany. By the mid-1950s, Volkswagen was producing over 1 million Beetles.

The Beetle began gaining worldwide popularity in the 1950s and 1960s. It was marketed as an affordable, reliable, and durable import vehicle. The unusual rounded shape and sparse design gave it a distinctive appearance that resonated with many consumers. Volkswagen began importing Beetles to the U.S. in 1949 and they were an instant success, with over 500,000 sold by the mid-1960s. The Beetle epitomized simplicity in design and drivability, which many found appealing compared to the oversized American cars of the era. 

The Beetle continued to sell well through the 1970s, but sales began declining in the 1980s and 1990s due to competition from more modern designs. Volkswagen ended production of the Beetle in Germany in 1978, but it continued for a few more years in other countries like Mexico and Brazil. The final Beetle model rolled off the production line in Puebla, Mexico in July 2003.

The Beetle is considered an automotive icon because of its unique design, affordability, and ambitious production numbers that allowed so many people to own a car for the first time. It has come to symbolize practicality, dependability, and simplicity. The Beetleâ€™s instantly recognizable shape is still popular today, with Volkswagen re-releasing the Beetle with a modern design in 1998 and again in 2011. More than eight decades after its first production, the Beetle continues to hold a special place in automotive history and popular culture. Overall, the Beetle deserves its status as one of the best-selling and most influential cars of all time.
