Delinquency and offending among girls is a complex and nuanced issue that cannot be explained by any single theory or factor. There are a number of debates surrounding the causes and impacts of female juvenile delinquency, as well as controversy over the differential treatment of boys and girls by society and the justice system. Historically, research into delinquency has been male-centric, with studies largely focused on boys and relying on stereotypical assumptions about gender. However, more recent research has started to unpack the complex relationships between gender, societal perceptions of gender, and delinquent behavior in girls.

One key debate centers around the role of parenting and family environment in contributing to delinquency. Research has found links between harsh, neglectful, or abusive parenting and higher risks of delinquency for both boys and girls. However, the impact of particular parenting styles may differ by gender. For example, some research suggests that lack of parental supervision and weak parental attachment is more strongly linked to delinquency for girls compared to boys. Differential parenting of boys and girls from an early age, including encouraging different types of play and the development of different skills and behavioral traits, may also contribute to divergent pathways to delinquency. However, the research on gender differences in parenting and family influence is mixed, highlighting the complexity of these relationships.

 Another debate concerns the use of different terminology and double standards when discussing and punishing delinquency in boys compared to girls. Historically, the label of ‘delinquent’ has been primarily applied to boys, while girls exhibiting the same behaviors have been more often labeled as 'wayward' or 'troubled'. Girls also tend to be treated more leniently by the justice system for similar offenses, due to the perception that they pose less of a threat to society and that their behaviors are more redeemable. It has been argued that this gendered labeling and differential treatment amounts to an inappropriate ‘chivalry’ within the justice system that fails to recognize the severity of some girls’ offenses.
