Both networks and finance play a crucial role in the success and growth of small businesses. However, networks are more fundamental, especially in the early stages of development. Finance becomes more important for sustaining long-term growth, but the availability of capital means little without connections to mobilize it. 

Small firms often struggle with lack of resources and credibility due to their size and newness. Their small scale and limited track record make it difficult to gain access to funding from banks and investors. Networks help to overcome some of these challenges by providing connections, advice, and collaboration. Through networks, small business owners can tap into the knowledge and experience of others, gain referrals and new customers, find potential partners or employees, and enhance their legitimacy and reputation. These benefits are most valuable when firms are first starting out and trying to gain a foothold.

While networks facilitate access to resources and growth opportunities, finance provides the actual funds to seize them. Capital is essential for hiring staff, purchasing materials, investing in new equipment, and expanding into new markets. However, for small new firms with little collateral, capital can be hard to obtain without strong networks. Loan officers and investors are more willing to provide funding when small firms come through a trusted referral or have built relationships and credibility through their networks.

Several models of small firm growth, including the network model and the financial model, demonstrate how networks and finance work together. In the network model, firms leverage connections to access resources and fuel growth. But networks are most effective when combined with finance, as capital is still needed to fully exploit network benefits. Conversely, the financial model focuses on using external funding sources for growth, but the availability of capital depends heavily on having networks to source it. 

In conclusion, while both networks and finance are integral to the success and sustainability of small businesses, networks play a more fundamental role upon initial founding. They provide a foundation for gaining access to resources, building credibility, and securing outside funding. Finance is essential for actualizing growth opportunities, but its importance comes to fruition mainly through the links and relationships that networks establish. The growth of small firms depends on the interplay between networking and financing, not one or the other alone. Overall, networks and finance should be viewed as complementary forces that, when combined, drive the establishment and endurance of small businesses.
