Franz Joseph Gall and William James were two pioneering thinkers who shaped the early development of psychology in the 19th century. Though they came from very different backgrounds and pursued psychology in distinct ways, they shared a conviction that the mind could be studied scientifically. 

Gall was born in Germany in 1758 into a well-educated family. His interest in psychology emerged from observing classmates in school and noticing that those with certain skull shapes tended to have specific character traits. This led Gall to theorize that different parts of the brain are responsible for distinct mental faculties, a view known as localization of function. To provide evidence for his theories, Gall collected over 120 skulls from prisons, asylums, and morgues to compare with the characters and abilities of the deceased. Though controversial, Gall's work promoted the idea that the brain is the organ of the mind.

In contrast, James was born into a wealthy family in New York City in 1842. He studied medicine at Harvard but struggled with health problems and a lack of purpose. After reading Charles Darwin, James found meaning in psychology and set out to apply scientific methods to the mysteries of human consciousness and will. James believed psychology should focus on how the mind works to adapt to the environment. He advocated introspection, or systematic self-reflection, as a way to gain insight into mental processes. 

While Gall relied primarily on phrenology, the study of skull shapes, James used introspection and philosophical argumentation. Gall literally dissected physical brains to make inferences about the mind, whereas James figuratively dissected his own mental experiences. However, both aimed to place psychology on a scientific footing during an era when it was still a branch of philosophy.

In terms of presenting their ideas, Gall wrote extensive theoretical treatises and lectured publicly, though his talks were very detailed and lasted up to 15 hours. James was renowned for his articulate and engaging writing style, as evidenced in his two seminal works, Principles of Psychology (1890) and Varieties of Religious Experience (1902). Gall's theories were ridiculed by many contemporaries and later disproven, whereas James's works are still influential today.

Both Gall and James criticized the weaknesses they perceived in each other's methods. Gall argued that introspection alone was insufficient to understand the brain's complex workings. James insisted phrenology's simplistic mapping of mental faculties onto skull features was unscientific. Ironically, though coming from opposing viewpoints, their combined work demonstrated that psychology could be studied through multiple methods, both objective and subjective.

In conclusion, while Gall and James differed substantially in their theoretical viewpoints, educational backgrounds, and choice of techniques, they shared a vision for establishing psychology as an independent field of scientific inquiry. Their pioneering approaches to studying the mind, whether by examining the brain itself or the mind's own processes, helped define psychology's identity as distinct from philosophy. Though criticized in their time, Gall and James were instrumental in facilitating psychology's development into a modern scientific discipline.
