There is growing evidence that the special effects capabilities of the Elizabethan stage, particularly the Blackfriars playhouse, were more advanced than previously considered. Historians have often assumed that the Elizabethan stage was largely bare or simplistic, relying primarily on the imagination of the audience. However, recent scholarship has revealed the playhouses of the time, especially the indoor Blackfriars theatre, employed innovative special effects using mechanical devices, props, costumes, and artificial lighting that brought a sense of spectacle and wonder to performances.

The unique layout and audience arrangement of the Blackfriars playhouse enabled more elaborate special effects that would have been difficult to achieve at the Globe. The Blackfriars was a smaller, indoor theatre that utilized artificial lighting, including candles and lanterns, which gave theatre companies more control over the performance environment. The Globe, on the other hand, was an open-air amphitheatre without a roof, relying solely on natural light. The smaller space of the Blackfriars and ability to manipulate lighting allowed for more intimate and subtle performances with complex staging. The audience was also seated on multiple levels, with some in boxes overlooking the stage, creating ideal sightlines for special effects and stunts. 

Artificial lighting was essential to facilitating special effects at the Blackfriars. Candles and lanterns could be used to create dramatic shadows and silhouette effects, manipulate the visibility and sense of depth on stage, highlight certain actors or objects, and even startle the audience with sudden light changes. Controlled lighting also enabled practical effects like smoke and fog that would have quickly dissipated outdoors. Though indoor theatres like the Blackfriars have often been associated more with acoustic than visual effects, artificial lighting was a key tool for experimenting with innovative special effects.

In conclusion, there is compelling evidence that the special effects employed in Elizabethan theatres, especially at indoor playhouses like the Blackfriars, were remarkably advanced and relied on a multifaceted approach encompassing staging, mechanical devices, props, costumes, lighting, and the space itself. While Shakespeare's Globe has become an icon of Elizabethan theatre, the Blackfriars playhouse demonstrates the level of sophistication and experimentation that was possible at the time through creative use of artificial lighting and an innovative theatre design that brought spectacle and drama to performances in new ways. The effects and techniques used would have required both technological skill and a sense of theatricality that deserves more recognition and study. Overall, the Elizabethan stage had a range of special effects which, particularly in the case of the Blackfriars playhouse, were highly imaginative and transformative.
