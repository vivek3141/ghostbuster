Effective hand washing is the single most important technique to reduce healthcare-associated infections in hospitals and health care settings. Proper hand hygiene is considered the primary preventive measure in reducing infections that can be transmitted by direct contact between patients and healthcare workers. According to the World Health Organization, hand washing is considered a "do-it-yourself" vaccineâ€”it involves using soap and running water for at least 20 seconds to wash hands and surfaces like counters and cutting boards.

The most effective hand washing technique for reducing infections in hospitals is using alcohol-based hand rubs, especially in between patient contacts. The advantages of alcohol-based hand rubs are that they are more convenient and effective compared to the traditional hand washing with soap and water. Alcohol rubs kill many types of bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA. They also eliminate the need for water and are less irritating to hands compared to frequent hand washing. Several studies have shown that improved hand hygiene using alcohol hand rubs can lead to a reduction of healthcare-associated infections of up to 40% in hospital settings.

To establish the significance of the effectiveness of alcohol hand rubs or any hand hygiene technique, a randomized controlled trial needs to be conducted. This involves randomly assigning different hand washing interventions to different groups of healthcare workers and patients and evaluating the rates of infections in each group. For the trial to be valid, the sample size needs to be large enough to generate meaningful results. Important factors to consider include: 

1) Properly defining the intervention groups, including a control group with the standard hand washing procedure. The groups should be similar in all other aspects of patient care.

2) Blinding participants and researchers to avoid bias. This can be achieved by using coded bottles for different hand rubbing solutions so people do not know which group they have been assigned to. 

3) Standardizing other infection control practices across groups like use of gloves, gowns, and disinfectants. This ensures that hand hygiene technique is the only variable factor between groups.

4) Collecting and analyzing data on infection rates, compliance with hand hygiene, and other parameters to determine statistical significance. Surveillance should be ongoing to account for seasonal variations in infection rates. 

5) Monitoring for potential confounding factors like differences in patient risk factors between groups and accounting for them in the analysis. Patient demographics and length of hospital stay can influence infection rates.
 
In summary, alcohol-based hand rubs represent the most effective hand washing technique to reduce bacterial infections acquired in hospitals according to evidence from multiple studies. Conducting a rigorous randomized controlled trial is key to establishing the significance and validity of these results by controlling for confounding variables and minimizing biases. Proper trial design and data collection are essential to determining the effectiveness of any hand washing intervention.
