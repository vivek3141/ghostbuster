The introduction of sugar production in Jamaica and Barbados in the 17th century spurred not just an agricultural revolution but also a profound social revolution in those societies. In a relatively short period of time, the economies and social structures of the Caribbean colonies were transformed by the rise of sugar plantations and the boom in the Atlantic slave trade required to sustain them. 

Prior to the 1640s, the early English settlers in Jamaica and Barbados grew crops like cotton, tobacco, and indigo on small farms using primarily white indentured servants as labor. However, the introduction of sugar cane cultivation and the technology to produce sugar crystals on an industrial scale changed the islands dramatically. The production of sugar was highly labor-intensive, requiring large numbers of workers to plant, harvest, transport, and process the cane. The demand for labor drove the expansion of the transatlantic slave trade, with hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans brought to the islands against their will.

The sugar plantations were immensely profitable commercial enterprises, and they transformed the societal structure of the islands. There emerged a new class of wealthy planters who gained economic, social, and political dominance. They built grand manor houses, adopted an aristocratic lifestyle, and came to control the local assemblies. At the same time, there was a large underclass of enslaved and oppressed Afro-Caribbean workers who endured harsh living conditions and backbreaking labor in the cane fields and boiling houses. 

The massive importation and concentration of enslaved workers also transformed cultural and religious practices in the Caribbean. New Afro-Caribbean religious beliefs and rituals emerged, blending African and Christian traditions. Music, dance, foodways, and languages were also influenced by this mixing of cultures. At the same time, more repressive laws were put in place by white elites to exert control over the enslaved populations, including bans on drumming, limitations on movement, and the criminalization of non-Christian religious practices.

In conclusion, the introduction of sugar plantations and mass slavery in Jamaica and Barbados in the 17th century brought not just an agricultural revolution based on new crops and technology. It also ushered in a social revolution that remade the demographics, hierarchies, and cultural practices of these island societies and shaped a system of economic, social, and political relations predicated on racial inequality and the oppression of enslaved black populations. The effects of these changes would persist for centuries. Overall, the rise of sugar and slavery was a transformative yet turbulent period that marked the beginnings of the Anglo-Caribbean world.
