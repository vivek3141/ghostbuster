The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in the United Kingdom considers enforcement powers to be central to promoting competition. Enforcement powers of competition authorities are necessary to monitor markets, determine violations, and penalize companies when necessary. These powers have evolved considerably since the implementation of the UK's Competition Act 1998, the EU's Regulation 1/2003/EC, and the Enterprise Act 2002. 

Under the Competition Act 1998, the OFT was given enforcement powers to monitor markets, review mergers, investigate abuse of dominant positions, and penalize cartels and anti-competitive agreements. Its authority was limited to cases that exceeded national thresholds and jurisdictional issues with the European Commission complicated enforcement. The EU's Regulation 1/2003/EC, enacted in 2003, gave the EC and OFT concurrent powers. The Enterprise Act 2002 expanded the OFT's powers to impose higher penalties, order divestitures, and award consumer redress in markets where anti-competitive conduct was found. 

The OFT's enforcement abilities have thus grown substantially with the passage of these three acts. Especially important is the power to impose high penalties, which increases the deterrent effect. The civil standard of proof also makes it easier to sanction infringing companies. At the same time, Regulation 1/2003/EC complicated the relationship between national competition authorities like the OFT and the EC. Overlapping jurisdiction has required greater cooperation and information sharing. Both the OFT and EC have the power to review mergers and conduct sector enquiries under this regulation.
	
In conclusion, enforcement powers are critical to effective competition policy. The OFT's powers have significantly strengthened over time, especially with the ability to levy higher fines and order redress. However, its relationship with the EC continues to evolve. Regulation 1/2003/EC gave both organizations concurrent powers over anti-competitive conduct, requiring ongoing coordination. Stronger enforcement abilities at the national and EU level, along with greater cooperation, have increased deterrence and benefited consumers through more competitive markets in the UK and Europe. Overall, enforcement powers remain essential to promoting competition.
