Theories and approaches to studying gendered language have evolved significantly over time along with broader social changes. Early research largely focused on the differences in men's and women's speech, investigating language as a reflection of gender identity. More recent postmodern perspectives have challenged these traditional views, recognizing language as a multifunctional system that constructs gender identity.  

Early approaches were influenced by the idea that gender is innate and binary. Researchers analyzed distinctions in vocabulary, grammar, and speech acts, attributing differences to inherent gendered qualities. For example, "women's language" was seen as polite, emotional, and subordinate, reflecting women's nature. These studies have been widely critiqued for promoting harmful stereotypes.

Sociolinguistic approaches focused on gender as a social construct. Language was viewed as a reflection of gender norms and power dynamics in a community. Studies explored how differences in speech reinforced asymmetrical gender roles but could be manipulated depending on context. For example, some studies found that power and solidarity in conversation depend more on relative social status than the gender of interlocutors. 

Postmodern theories recognize gender and language as interdependent social systems. Language both constructs and is constructed by gender identity in an ongoing process. Each utterance carries traces of social meanings which the interlocutors actively negotiate. Power is seen as contextual and fluid rather than predetermined based on gender.

Research on communicative competence and intersectionality has further explored how language, gender, and other aspects of identity interact. Studies show how people skillfully manage language to project a desired gendered identity that fits the social context. A person may emphasize or downplay certain aspects of their identity using culturally-specific linguistic systems to gain power or connection.

Future research will likely further integrate postmodern and critical theories, applying an increasingly relational view of language, gender, and power. Studies may focus more on agency and accountability, investigating how people can challenge systemic inequalities through subversive or transgressive speech and by exposing hidden biases in everyday discourse. There will likely be continued interest in how technology and media are transforming gender and language. Overall, the field is moving away from simplistic binaries and generalizations toward more complex, inclusive theories of how language shapes and is shaped by human social experiences.
