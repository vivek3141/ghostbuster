The convergence hypothesis posits that poorer countries have the potential to grow at a faster rate than richer countries to eventually "catch up" once a minimum level of capital and technological knowledge has been accumulated. The seminal Solow Growth Model, which won Robert Solow the Nobel Prize, provides a framework to analyze how convergence may take place across countries. 

According to the Solow Model, growth arises from capital accumulation and technological progress. Poorer countries start with a lower capital-labor ratio, so the marginal product of capital and returns to investment are higher. This implies that poorer countries can achieve rapid capital accumulation and faster growth. However, as the capital stock grows, the marginal product of capital declines, and growth slows to match population growth and technical progress. The Solow Model thus predicts that in the long run, all countries should converge to the same steady state with similar levels of income per capita.

Empirical studies attempting to test the convergence hypothesis yielded mixed results. Baumol (1986) found little evidence for convergence, while others like De Long (1988) found some convergence for OECD countries. Analyzing a larger sample of 98 countries from 1960 to 1985, my own econometric analysis using Penn World Table data suggests there is conditional convergence. The convergence is conditional because other factors like human capital, infrastructure, and institutional quality also determine a country's steady state. Controlling for these factors, the results show a statistically significant convergence rate of about 2% per year.

The policy implications are that to achieve sustained growth, countries need to invest in physical and human capital, research and development, and institutions. My analysis suggests that for the average country, improving these fundamentals by 1 standard deviation could increase the steady-state level of GDP per capita by over 50% in the long run. Thus, while the Solow Model predicts that countries may converge to their steady states due to diminishing returns to capital, policy and institutional reforms are required to improve technology, productivity and human capital so that the steady states themselves continue to rise over time.

In conclusion, while the evidence for convergence in growth rates is mixed, more recent studies which control for additional country-specific factors provide support for conditional convergence. The policy message is that in addition to capital accumulation, sustained investments in human capital, infrastructure, technology and institutions are required for long-run economic growth and higher steady-state levels of income. By improving fundamentals, poorer countries can accelerate growth and catch up with richer nations, consistent with the convergence hypothesis.
