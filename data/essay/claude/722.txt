The Victorian era in England was marked by rapid industrialization and social upheaval. The Industrial Revolution began to accelerate in the early 19th century, fundamentally changing the economic and physical landscape of London and other cities. As people from the countryside migrated to cities and factory towns for work, social structures and class dynamics started to shift. In the midst of these massive societal changes, Victorian novelists like Charles Dickens, the Brontë sisters, and George Eliot explored the tensions and conflicts between the classes and between men and women. They used symbolic geography and descriptions of disparate landscapes to powerfully illustrate these social divisions.

Charles Dickens was a keen observer of the changes transforming London during the Victorian era. In his novel Bleak House, Dickens contrasts the bleak, polluted streets of London with the idyllic countryside to symbolize the divide between the upper and lower classes. The aristocratic Lady Dedlock lives a life of leisure and beauty at her country estate, while the poor crossed-sweeper, Jo, scrapes by an impoverished existence navigating the filthy London streets. The two characters come from completely different worlds, represented by these contrasting landscapes. The fog and mud of London signify the grim plight of the urban poor, separated from the green pastures of the wealthy rural gentry. 

The Brontë sisters also used symbolic geography and dramatic contrasting landscapes in their novels. In Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë, the settings of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights represent the clash between refinement and passion, civilization and nature, and femininity and masculinity. Thrushcross Grange signifies Catherine Earnshaw's transition to ladyhood and acceptance of social conventions, while Wuthering Heights represents her deep connection to Heathcliff and ungoverned nature. The two spaces are geographically close but metaphorically worlds apart, much like the star-crossed lovers Catherine and Heathcliff.

Similarly, in Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre, the contrast between Lowood Institution, Thornfield Hall, and Ferndean Manor tracks Jane's journey to find her place as an independent and free-thinking woman. Each location represents different stages of her development and conflicts with patriarchal Victorian society. Only at Ferndean, a secluded but comfortable estate, is she finally able to find freedom and equality with Mr. Rochester. The landscapes in the novel become symbols for Jane's inner life and her struggles to reconcile her strong will with the strict gender roles of her time.

In conclusion, Victorian novelists like Dickens, Emily Brontë, and Charlotte Brontë used landscapes and symbolic geography in their works to represent the social conflicts of their era. Descriptions of the harsh conditions of cities versus the idyllic countryside illustrated class differences and divisions. Contrasting spaces were also used to signify tensions between passion and reason, nature and civilization, and masculine and feminine ideals. These symbolic landscapes gave the authors a powerful way to explore the anxieties and constraints experienced by many Victorians living through a period of immense cultural change. Overall, geography served as an evocative metaphorical tool for conveying the societal complexities of the 19th century in England.
