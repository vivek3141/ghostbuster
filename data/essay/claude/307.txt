Modern society is defined by several distinctive characteristics that differentiate it from previous eras. Some of the key criteria that define modernity and that England exhibited in its transition to a modern society include:

• Rapid technological and scientific progress. Modern societies experienced an accelerated pace of technological innovation and scientific discovery. This included advancements in computing, engineering, and medicine that vastly improved standards of living and longevity. England was at the forefront of the Scientific Revolution and the Industrial Revolution, with influential thinkers like Isaac Newton and groundbreaking inventions like the steam engine. These technological and scientific leaps forward contributed to a sense of constant progress and change.  

• Rise of capitalism and market economies. Modern societies transitioned to capitalist market economies centered around the private ownership of property and free exchange in competitive markets. Traditional economic systems based on barter, trade, and subsistence farming were replaced by economies dominated by industrial production and the accumulation of capital. England pioneered many of the elements of modern market economies with its robust financial system, investments in equipment and factories, and transition from an agrarian to industrial economy. 

• Increased personal freedom and individualism. Pre-modern societies were typically defined by rigid social hierarchies and little social mobility. In contrast, modern societies placed a higher value on individual freedom, equality of opportunity, and self-determination. People had more freedom to choose their occupations, religion, and life paths based on their personal interests and talents. England transitioned from a feudal system with strict social classes to a society with more social mobility and greater personal liberties.

• Spread of Enlightenment ideals. The Enlightenment introduced ideals like reason, science, progress, and universal rights—all of which shaped modern society. Thinkers promoted concepts of rationality, empiricism, and skepticism in contrast with traditional religious doctrines. These Enlightenment values were instrumental in driving social and political reforms. England was the epicenter of the Enlightenment, and Enlightenment philosophers like John Locke directly influenced liberalism and politics.

• Secularization and changed role of religion. Modern societies witnessed a shift toward more secular institutions and a reduced role for traditional religious authorities. While religion remained influential, it was more commonly confined to the private sphere. In England, the Church of England broke from the Catholic Church, and religious dissenters gained more freedom and political rights over time. 

In conclusion, England met the key criteria of technological progress, capitalism, individualism, Enlightenment values, and secularization that define modernity. By pioneering the Scientific Revolution, Industrial Revolution, and Enlightenment, England emerged as a model of a modern society marked by rapid change, scientific reasoning, and liberal ideals. Overall, modern society represented a radical break from previous social orders, with innovation, freedom, and progress as its hallmarks.
