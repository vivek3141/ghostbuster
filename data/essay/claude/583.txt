Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet's 1829 paper on the convergence of Fourier series was a pivotal moment in the development of Fourier analysis. Dirichlet built upon the foundational work of Joseph Fourier and devised a precise set of conditions that a periodic function must satisfy in order for its Fourier series to converge to the function.  

Fourier had shown that any periodic function can be represented by a series of sines and cosines—its Fourier series. However, Fourier did not rigorously prove that the Fourier series of a function would converge to the function itself. This gap was addressed by Dirichlet, who provided a precise set of sufficient conditions for convergence. Specifically, Dirichlet showed that the Fourier series of a function f(x) will converge to f(x) at all points if:

1) f(x) has a finite number of maxima and minima in the interval from 0 to 2π; 

2) f(x) has a finite number of discontinuities in that interval; and  

3) f(x) does not grow faster than exponentially at the endpoints of the interval.  

These simple conditions were a major breakthrough and marked a turning point at which Fourier analysis moved from a exciting new discovery to a rigorous mathematical theory. With Dirichlet's work, mathematicians finally had a framework for determining when the infinite series that make up a Fourier series would converge and represent the function of interest.

The significance of Dirichlet's paper is hard to overstate. His conditions for convergence addressed a major open question in Fourier analysis and mathematics more broadly—under what circumstances do infinite series converge? With a precise set of sufficient conditions in hand, mathematicians could now rigorously prove the convergence of Fourier series for a wide class of functions. Dirichlet's work paved the way for more advanced results in harmonic analysis, including the more sophisticated convergence tests of Lipschitz, Holder, and others. Overall, Dirichlet brought mathematical rigor to an important new field and built a foundation for further progress.

In summary, Dirichlet's 1829 paper established precise sufficient conditions for the convergence of Fourier series to the functions they represent. By showing that functions with a limited number of maxima, minima and discontinuities, and which do not grow too quickly, have convergent Fourier series, Dirichlet addressed a major open question and helped establish Fourier analysis as a mathematically rigorous theory. Dirichlet's work was a pivotal moment that enabled significant subsequent progress in harmonic analysis and signal processing.
