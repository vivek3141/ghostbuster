Determining whether a theory is scientific or pseudoscientific has been a long-standing challenge in philosophy of science. Several philosophers have proposed demarcation criteria to differentiate science from non-science. Karl Popper proposed the falsification criterion, that for a theory to be scientific it must be falsifiable. Thomas Kuhn proposed the puzzle-solving criterion, that science progresses through paradigm shifts to solve conceptual puzzles. Imre Lakatos proposed hard core theories protected by an auxiliary belt of auxiliary hypotheses. And Paul Thagard examined why astrology fails to meet scientific criteria. 

Popper's falsification criterion states that for a theory to be scientific, it must be falsifiable - able to be proven false through observations or experiments. According to Popper, pseudosciences like astrology are not falsifiable because they can always be adjusted to fit new evidence. While falsification is an important part of science, it is too simplistic as a demarcation criterion. Many scientific theories are hard to falsify in practice and scientists do not always abandon theories when faced with falsifying evidence. 

Kuhn's puzzle-solving criterion sees science as progressing through revolutions that shift scientific paradigms. Normal science operates within a paradigm, solving puzzles that fit existing theories. When too many anomalies accumulate, scientific revolutions occur that lead to new paradigms. This view captures some elements of how science works in practice. However, it is difficult to determine what counts as a puzzle or paradigm shift. Pseudosciences can also experience shifts to new theories without becoming genuinely scientific.

Lakatos proposed evaluating research programs rather than individual theories. A scientific research program has a hard core of basic principles surrounded by a protective belt of auxiliary hypotheses. The hard core is preserved, while the protective belt is modified and expanded. For Lakatos, astrology lacks a progressive problem-shift and has too much ad hoc modification of its protective belt. However, determining what counts as ad hoc modification or a progressive problem-shift can still be subjective. 

Thagard examined why astrology should not be considered scientifically valid. He noted that astrology lacks key criteria like explanatory coherence, which requires that a theory mesh well with other currently accepted theories. Astrology also lacks predictive success, practical applications, and conceptual coherence since there is no mechanism explaining how the positions of stars and planets could influence human lives. However, proponents of astrology could argue that it still meets some conditions of science and more criteria are needed to definitely prove it is pseudoscience.

In conclusion, while falsification, puzzle-solving, hard cores, and explanatory coherence all capture important aspects of science, there is no definitive and universal set of criteria to differentiate science from non-science. Demarcation will always remain fuzzy. However, for a theory to be considered scientifically valid, some key conditions must be met: It must be consistent with existing scientific theories and knowledge. It must offer explanations and mechanisms, not just descriptions and predictions. It must lead to new discoveries and applications. And it must aim to be empirically testable and falsifiable, even if practical limitations exist. When these conditions are lacking, the likelihood of a theory being genuinely scientific diminishes. The debate on demarcation continues, but these types of criteria point the way to determining what science should aim for to meet accepted standards of validity.
