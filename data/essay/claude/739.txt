William Blake's poetry exemplifies the Romantic era's view of nature as a living, spiritual entity that symbolizes deeper meaning and transcendent truths. For the Romantic poets, nature was not something separate or external to be observed, but an essential interconnected part of existence, the very "life of things." In Blake's poem "The Rose," natural imagery is used to represent spiritual and political ideas that critique contemporary society.  

The rose in Blake's poem is a central symbol for creativity, beauty, and pure spiritual vision. The rose is described as "sickly" due to being in a "vale of soul-making," implying that it represents ideal beauty and creative vision in a fallen, mortal world. The speaker tells the rose, "thou shalt never die," suggesting the eternal, immortal nature of creative imagination and spiritual vision. The rose is a symbol for the poetic imagination and capacity for spiritual vision and insight that transcends the mortal body.

The worm and the fly that attack the rose represent physical decay and corruption that threaten spiritual vision. The worm is a symbol for materialism and the tendency to value the physical over the spiritual. The fly represents pestilence, disease, and the petty concerns of daily life that distract from higher vision. Their attack on the rose shows how spiritual vision is assailed by materialism and mundane concerns. The speaker defends the rose from these threats, using his "silken" words - poetry and creative expression - as a shield. Creativity and spiritual vision must be protected and nurtured.

The garden in which the rose grows is a symbolic Eden of natural beauty and spiritual vision. However, it is separated from the "paths of men" by a "wall of green," showing how this vision is cut off from wider society. The "silver Thames" flowing by the garden may represent poetic inspiration or spiritual nourishment. The garden is a utopian space for cultivating vision and imagination, set apart from a wider society lacking in spiritual nourishment or vision.

The poem suggests that society attacks and suppresses the imagination, purity of vision, and spiritual nourishment that the natural world represents. The rose is "sick" in a "vale of soul-making" because society does not value creativity, beauty, and transcendent vision. The worm and fly are pervasive threats that represent how base materialism and petty concerns overwhelm spiritual vision. The walled garden protects a utopian space for cultivating vision, set apart from paths of men who lack access to inspiration and imagination.

In conclusion, Blake uses natural imagery in "The Rose" to develop a poetic symbolism representing creativity, spiritual vision and freedom. The rose symbolizes an eternal creative imagination and capacity for vision that transcends mortality. However, the rose is sickly in a fallen mortal world where society attacks vision and imagination. The worm and fly represent threats to spirituality from materialism, pettiness and mundane concerns. The garden is a utopian space protecting vision and creativity, walled off from those lacking inspiration. Through this rich poetic symbolism, Blake develops a critique of society's suppression of vision and imagination, using nature to represent spiritual and creative freedom.
