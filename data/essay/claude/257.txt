Laura has several legal options available to her to recover damages from Slowe and Wheezy Bus Company for the injuries and losses she suffered as a result of their negligence. The primary options would be to file a claim for breach of contract, negligence, or under the consumer protection legislation including the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999.

A claim for breach of contract would arise from the fact that Laura purchased a bus ticket from Slowe and Wheezy, constituting a contract for safe carriage. By crashing the bus and injuring Laura, Slowe and Wheezy breached the implied terms of that contract. Laura could recover the cost of her ticket and potentially additional damages. However, Slowe and Wheezy would likely argue that their liability is limited under the terms of the contract, for example by any exclusions or limitations of liability in the fine print on the back of the bus ticket.

A negligence claim would allege that Slowe and Wheezy owed Laura a duty of care as a passenger on their bus, that they breached that duty of care through the negligent driving and operation of the bus, and that this breach caused the crash that resulted in Laura’s injuries. To succeed in a negligence claim, Laura would need to show that the bus driver’s actions fell below the standard of reasonable care of a bus driver. If successful, Laura could recover damages for her injuries and any other losses. Slowe and Wheezy may defend the claim by arguing the crash was not caused by any negligence on their part.

The unfair contract terms legislation would apply to the bus ticket contract between Laura and Slowe and Wheezy. The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 renders unenforceable any contractual terms that seek to limit liability for negligence causing personal injury or death. Therefore, Slowe and Wheezy would not be able to rely on any exclusion or limitation of liability in the bus ticket contract to defend against Laura’s negligence claim.  

The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 provides further protection to consumers like Laura in standard form contracts with businesses like Slowe and Wheezy. Under these regulations, any "unfair" contractual term that causes a significant imbalance to the detriment of the consumer is not binding. Laura could argue that any broad clause excluding or limiting Slowe and Wheezy's liability would satisfy this test and therefore not bind Laura or prevent her from recovering full damages under her negligence claim.

In conclusion, Laura has substantive grounds to initiate claims against Slowe and Wheezy for breach of contract and negligence arising from their poor driving and operation of the bus that crashed and caused Laura’s injuries. The unfair contract terms legislation strengthens Laura's position by rendering ineffective any contractual clauses that seek to exempt Slowe and Wheezy from liability. By pursuing all available options, Laura has a reasonable prospect of recovering damages from Slowe and Wheezy.
