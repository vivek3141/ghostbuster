The Twin Earth thought experiment, proposed by Hilary Putnam, aims to show that the meanings of thoughts and mental concepts depend on features of the external world, not just on what is happening inside someone's head. Putnam argues that this supports an Externalist view of mental content, rather than an Internalist account where meaning depends solely on what is internally represented in the mind. However, Putnam's thought experiment is flawed and does not conclusively prove that Externalism is the only viable account of meaning and mental content. 

Putnam asks us to imagine a Twin Earth that is identical to Earth, except that the substance the residents call 'water' has a different chemical makeup, being XYZ rather than H2O. He argues that when an Earthian and Twin Earthian use the word 'water', they mean different things, even though they have identical internal experiences. The content of their mental concepts depends on the watery stuff in their environment, not just on how it appears to them. This, Putnam claims, shows that meaning "ain't in the head".

Tyler Burge extends this argument with his thought experiment involving 'arthritis' and a counterfactual society in which the illness commonly referred to as 'arthritis' is rheumatoid arthritis rather than osteoarthritis. Burge argues that for someone in this society, the meaning of their concept 'arthritis' would differ, even if their internal conceptual structure was the same as ours. Like Putnam, Burge takes this to show that External factors determine meaning and mental content.

However, there are issues with these thought experiments that suggest Internalism remains a viable account of meaning. Firstly, Putnam's scenario is underdescribed, and there are interpretations on which the Twin Earthian and Earthian mean the same thing. If their concepts pick out whatever substance plays the water-role in their environment, their meanings may be equivalent. The difference in chemical composition is irrelevant. An Internalist can argue that the shared functional/ phenomenological properties of the substances determine their sameness of meaning.  

Secondly, Burge's thought experiment relies on an unjustified intuition that bodily illnesses have their meanings fixed by experts, not individuals' internal concepts. But individuals are not beholden to experts in determining the meanings of their own concepts. An Internalist can argue that for the person in the counterfactual society, 'arthritis' retains its usual meaning, referring to the internal bodily condition they associate with that term, regardless of any medical reclassification.       

Finally, Externalist accounts struggle to explain certain intuitions about meaning and mental content, like the intuition that two individuals could have the same belief while their environments differ dramatically. Externalism also struggles with the phenomenon of systematic misrepresentation, where people's thoughts fail to correspond to the actual features of their environment. These considerations suggest individuals' internal representations play a key role in determining meaning and mental content.

In conclusion, while Putnam and Burge's thought experiments are ingenious, they do not conclusively show that Externalism is the only viable theory of meaning and mental content. Internalism remains an attractive view, and a plausible account of meaning may incorporate both Internalist and Externalist insights, recognizing the interdependence of internal concepts and external factors in determining the contents of our thoughts. The debate around Externalism and Internalism continues, with rational arguments on both sides.
