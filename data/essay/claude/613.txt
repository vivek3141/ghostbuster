Describe a Time Working with Group to Create a Product 

One experience in my life where I worked with a group to create a product was for a group project in my history class. The task was for our group of four students was to create an informative pamphlet about a topic related to industrialization in the 19th century in the United States. Our group opted to create a pamphlet about the rise of trains and railroads during this time period and their impact. 

To begin the project, we first had to decide how to allocate the work evenly among the four group members. We determined that each person would be responsible for researching and writing up one section of the pamphlet: the invention and early history of trains, how they were developed into railroads and spread across the country, how they impacted various industries like agriculture and trade, and how they changed life for citizens in both positive and negative ways. By dividing the work into four discrete sections, it made the workload feel more manageable for each person.

With the divisions established, we each set out to research our particular area. We searched for books, academic papers, and reputable websites to learn more about the topic. I was responsible for covering how trains and railroads impacted trade and commerce in the 19th century. I read about how they enabled faster transport of goods across longer distances, how they opened up new routes of trade within the United States and internationally with their connection to ports and waterways, and how certain industries were able to grow and flourish with the affordable and efficient transport of materials and products. 

After completing our research, we reconvened as a group to share what we each had learned. We discussed how our different sections could be woven together into a cohesive pamphlet and how each personâ€™s work built upon and related to the others. We collaborated on the best way to sequence the four sections, and then each drafted our written sections. We gave each other feedback on initial drafts and incorporated that into our final drafts. We also worked together to create an eye-catching pamphlet design, including illustrations, photos, and complementary fonts and colors. 

With the content and design complete, we finalized our pamphlet by printing, folding, and distributing copies to our classmates. When reviewing and grading the projects, our teacher remarked that he learned a great deal from our informative pamphlet and that we did an excellent job not just describing trains but also demonstrating how significantly they shaped the growth of America during the Industrial Revolution. I felt a real sense of accomplishment in creating something that taught others and received such positive feedback. Overall, this experience showed me the value of collaborative work when each person contributes their skills and shares the workload. Working as a group, we achieved far more than we could have done working individually. Our final product was the result of effective communication, division of work, and true collaboration.
