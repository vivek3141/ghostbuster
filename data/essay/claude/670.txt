David has several arguments he could advance to seek a remedy for the loss of his photos. First, he could argue that the storage company was negligent in how they handled and stored his property, leading to its damage. As David's property was in their care and control, they had a duty to take reasonable measures to ensure its safe storage and handling. The failure of their systems for detecting and preventing issues like excessive heat or water damage constitutes a breach of this duty, making them liable for negligence. 

However, the storage company will likely counter that they made reasonable efforts to provide suitable storage conditions and maintain their facilities, and issues like excessive heat or water damage were outside of their control or ability to predict. They may also point to limitations of liability in the storage contract David signed. Unless David can show clearly unreasonable conduct, a negligence claim may be difficult to prove.

A second argument is that the storage company breached the terms of the bailment contract which requires the safe storage and return of the property in the condition it was received. By failing to protect the photos from damage, they failed to uphold their contractual obligations. However, again the storage company will point to contractual limitations of liability and argue that in the absence of gross negligence, their liability is limited. They may also argue that the contract only requires the return of the storage medium, like photo slides or prints, and does not guarantee the condition or quality of the intellectual property stored within.

A final argument is that the loss of the irreplaceable photos caused David substantial emotional distress and anguish. However, claims of emotional distress and anguish are difficult to quantify and liability may be limited. The likely outcome depends on the specific laws of David's jurisdiction, but overall, while David may be able to recover some portion of the financial costs to recreate the prints, full recovery for the intangible value of lost memories and irreplaceable photos may be challenging. In the end, a settlement to avoid protracted litigation may provide the most expedient, if imperfect, solution.
