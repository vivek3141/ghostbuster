The concept of the "ambivalent empowerment" of women in ethnic conflicts refers to the paradox that women can both experience increased rights and authority on the one hand, but also increased oppression and violence on the other during ethnic conflicts. This ambivalent empowerment has been seen in several case studies of ethnic conflicts, including Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and Sri Lanka. 

In Rwanda during the 1994 genocide, Hutu extremists mobilized and empowered Hutu women to participate in the mass killing of Tutsis. Hutu women were active participants in the genocide, with some taking leadership roles in death squads and militias. However, Tutsi women were subjected to systematic rape and sexual violence by Hutu extremists as a tool of war and subjugation. After the genocide, the new Tutsi-led government promoted new rights and opportunities for women. But many Hutu and Tutsi women were left traumatized and marginalized. This represents the paradox of women's empowerment during conflict in Rwanda.

In the ethnic conflicts that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, Serbian women experienced increased empowerment through participation in Serbian nationalist movements and militias. However, Bosniak (Muslim), Croat, and Kosovar Albanian women were subjected to systematic rape, torture, and violence by Serbian forces. The patriarchal values that dominated all ethnic groups in the former Yugoslavia meant that women continued to face discrimination and limited rights within their own communities even as they were mobilized for nationalist causes during the conflicts. 

In Sri Lanka's long civil war between Sinhalese nationalists and Tamil separatists, women on both sides occupied new roles in the public sphere through participation in militias, violent protests, and suicide bombings. But they continued to face violence, oppression and limited rights within their own ethnic communities. Tamil women living under the authoritarian rule of the Tamil Tigers faced forced recruitment, restrictions on movement and marriage, and violence. And Sinhalese women, while gaining more political voice, still faced discrimination, abuse and oppression in Sri Lanka's patriarchal culture.

In conclusion, the case studies show that the concept of ambivalent empowerment - women gaining some new power and authority during ethnic conflicts, even as they face continued or increased oppression and violence - applies in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and Sri Lanka. Women may occupy new roles in the public sphere during such conflicts, but often continue to lack true equality and agency within their own communities. The empowerment they do gain is limited, ambiguous and often serves the ends of male ethnic leaders rather than reflecting real transformation in women's own rights and status. Overall, these case studies show the complexity of women's experiences in ethnic conflicts.
