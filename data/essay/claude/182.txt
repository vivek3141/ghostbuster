Duality in reasoning refers to the notion that humans have two distinct systems or modes of thinking that operate simultaneously and interact with each other. The existence and nature of dual-process theories of thinking and reasoning have been the topic of much research and debate in cognitive psychology. There is evidence that individuals can demonstrate two different types of reasoning in different contexts, suggesting the possibility of "dual systems" controlling our thought processes. 

The first system is fast, intuitive, automatic, and unconscious. It is often called System 1. The second system is slow, conscious, rule-based, and logical. It is often called System 2. According to the dual-process theory, System 1 is quick, heuristic, and biased while System 2 is analytical, systematic, and deliberative. System 1 is thought to develop early and operate in a bottom-up fashion, whereas System 2 evolves gradually and works in a top-down manner.

There are several lines of evidence that support the theory of dual systems of reasoning. For example, experiments on disrupting attention and time constraints during reasoning tasks show that limiting cognitive resources restricts System 2 thinking, leading individuals to rely more heavily on quick intuitions of System 1. Neuroscientific studies also show that different types of reasoning activate distinct neural networks, suggesting they represent two different cognitive systems. Moreover, developmental studies show that the ability to resist intuitive judgments and engage in logical reasoning emerges gradually over childhood, consistent with the notion of two separate cognitive systems coming online at different points in development.

Sloman (1996) proposed that the two systems map onto different kinds of reasoning processes. System 1 is an "associative" system that produces rapid intuitions, while System 2 is a "rule-based" system that performs slow, logical reasoning and deliberate judgment. However, this theory incorrectly implies that logical reasoning cannot be intuitive or automatic. It also lacks a mechanism for explaining how the systems interact. In contrast, Stanovich and West (2000) described the systems in terms of different types of cognition: an autonomous set of systems including perception and intuitive belief (System 1) versus an analytic system that relies on working memory and cognitive decoupling (System 2). This theory provides a more integrated model of how the systems interact but still does not fully capture the difference between types of reasoning.

In conclusion, dual-process theories argue that humans have two separate systems of reasoning that collaborate and compete to influence our judgments and decision making. Considerable evidence supports the broad notion of duality in the mind. However, more work is needed to clarify the distinction between different kinds of reasoning and address limitations in existing dual-process theories. A full understanding of the relationship between intuition, analysis, and higher-level cognition remains an open and actively debated question in psychology.
