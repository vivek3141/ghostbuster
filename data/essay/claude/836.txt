Occupational Therapy is a health profession dedicated to enabling people of all abilities to participate in necessary and meaningful activities of their daily lives. Occupational Therapists (OTs) use purposeful activities and evidence-based interventions to promote health and wellness. OTs complete a master’s degree or clinical doctorate in Occupational Therapy, over 2 to 3 years of graduate study that includes theoretical coursework as well as hands-on fieldwork experiences. 

OTs take a holistic approach to care and evaluate how an individual’s illnesses, injuries, or disabilities impact their ability to do basic daily activities and participate in social interactions. OTs then develop customized treatment plans of therapeutic activities and adaptations to help patients reach their maximum level of independence and quality of life. Some examples of areas OTs work on include self-care (e.g. dressing, bathing), leisure/play (e.g. sports, hobbies), sleep and rest, and social participation (e.g. parenting, work). OTs utilize a variety of rehabilitative techniques, tools and equipment including orthotics, splints, and environmental modifications. OT is different from physical therapy which focuses primarily on physical movement and mobility. OT also differs from nursing, speech language pathology and recreational therapy in its unique focus on occupation, activity and function.

During their degrees and in practice, OTs gain experience in assessing patients, developing and implementing interventions, collaborating with health professionals, and educating families and caregivers. For example, in pediatrics they may use play activities to improve social skills or sensory integration. In acute care they could recommend wheelchair positioning or adaptive equipment to enable daily activities. In mental health, OTs utilize cognitive exercises and crafts to improve functioning and mood. In some settings, OTs supervise occupational therapy assistants who aid in the implementation of interventions. 

Prior life experiences, such as work experiences, volunteering or gap years can strengthen an application to an Occupational Therapy program. For example, volunteering with children, older adults or disabled groups provides relevant experience that helps in understanding occupational needs and the role of an OT. A gap year spent gaining such experience, traveling or pursuing interests and hobbies can also cultivate useful skills for a career focused on helping people engage in meaningful activities.

In summary, Occupational Therapy is a client-centered field focused on meaningful occupation, adaptation and quality of life. OT utilizes purposeful activity and evidence-based interventions tailored to individual needs. OTs have varied and fulfilling careers, with opportunities to work with all populations, in numerous settings. Relevant experiences prior to studying OT, such as gap years, can strengthen an application and provide a unique perspective to guide an OT career aimed at enabling people of all abilities to live life to its fullest.
