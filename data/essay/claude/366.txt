The bonus and commission system for salespeople at Holtzbrinck Publishers Holdings Limited has both strengths and weaknesses. On the positive side, commissions and bonuses can incentivize salespeople to work harder to generate more sales and revenue for the company. The company sets quarterly sales targets and financially rewards those salespeople who meet or exceed those targets with a bonus or a higher commission rate. This system aligns the financial interests of the salespeople with the financial interests of the company. Salespeople who exceed targets and earn higher compensation will see a direct benefit to themselves for helping the company boost its sales and profits.

However, there are some downsides and weaknesses to the bonus and commission system. First, the system can encourage greed and unhealthy internal competition amongst the sales team. Salespeople may engage in unethical behavior like stealing clients from colleagues or making sales misrepresentations just to earn a bonus. This can damage workplace culture and team dynamics. Second, the system links compensation too closely to short-term results which can promote a short-term mindset among salespeople rather than encouraging longer-term relationship building and strategic thinking. Salespeople may be inclined to push for quick sales to earn a bonus even if the sale is not in the best interests of the client or the long-term interests of the company.  

Changes in quarterly targets from quarter to quarter can have a significant impact on the number of salespeople earning bonuses. If targets are increased substantially from one quarter to the next, it is less likely that the same proportion of salespeople will meet the new higher targets and earn bonuses. Some who earned bonuses in the previous quarter may miss out in the current quarter. Conversely, if quarterly targets are lowered, more salespeople are likely to exceed the targets and qualify for bonuses. While changes in targets aim to motivate salespeople to work harder, frequent or unrealistic changes in targets can also lead to frustration, stress, and disengagement over the long run.

In conclusion, while commissions and bonuses are useful motivators and help align the incentives of salespeople with the company's priorities, the system needs to be balanced and fair. Unhealthy internal competition, short-term thinking, and frequent changes in targets can undermine employee morale, motivation, and trust in the system. The compensation system would benefit from also rewarding salespeople for longer-term performance, client relationship building, teamwork, and ethical behavior. With the right balance of incentives and rewards, Holtzbrinck can leverage the bonus and commission system to maximize sales in a sustainable way.
