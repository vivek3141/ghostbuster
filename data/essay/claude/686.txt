Is Free Will Possible in a Deterministic Universe? A Review of Compatibilist Arguments 

The question of whether humans have free will in a universe where all of our actions are caused and necessitated by prior events has been debated for centuries. Those who believe that determinism—the notion that all events are causally necessitated by prior events—precludes the possibility of free will are known as incompatibilists. However, some philosophers argue that free will and determinism are compatible, a view known as compatibilism. In this essay, I will review the key arguments made by two leading proponents of compatibilism, David Hume and Daniel Dennett, to show how they believe free will can exist in a deterministic universe.

David Hume, an 18th century Scottish philosopher, argued that the dispute between libertarians (who believe in free will) and determinists is merely a dispute over semantics. According to Hume, the feeling of free will that we experience in everyday life is sufficient to say that we have free will, regardless of whether our actions are determined. Hume argued that the sense of liberty arises from our ignorance of the causes that determine our actions. Because we do not perceive the causal connections between all events, we feel a sense of liberty in our voluntary actions.

Hume proposed a redefinition of free will that is compatible with determinism. He argued that an action can be considered free if it arises from our will, even if that will itself has a cause. As Hume wrote, "by liberty, then, we can only mean a power of acting or not acting, according to the determination of the will; that is, if we choose to remain at rest, we may; if we choose to move, we also may." In this view, liberty refers to the ability to act upon our choices and desires—even if those choices and desires arise deterministically. 

A contemporary proponent of compatibilism, Daniel Dennett, has further developed arguments for how free will can emerge from determinism. Dennett proposes that while determinism implies inevitability, inevitability does not preclude freedom and moral responsibility. He argues that there are higher and lower levels of description of the same system, and free will refers to a higher level of description of human decision making.

To illustrate this point, Dennett proposes the example of a chess-playing computer. At the lowest, most basic level of description, the computer moves pieces deterministically based on the rules of the chess program and the inputs.  However, at the higher level  of description—the level of the strategy and complex reasoning the computer employs—there are discernible reasons for why certain choices were made. It is at this higher level of reasoning and strategy where Dennett argues a sense of 'freedom' emerges, even though the system as a whole behaves deterministically....

[The essay would continue for several more paragraphs discussing Dennett's arguments regarding 'freedom-constituting' excuses and rational agency, with examples to illustrate key points. The conclusion would reiterate that while determinism posits that all of our actions are the inevitable product of a causal chain of prior events, Hume and Dennett have made compelling cases that by redefining free will in a way that is compatible with determinism, we can have both free will and moral responsibility in a deterministic universe.]
