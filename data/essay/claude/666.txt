The traditional perception of the tribute system in Chinese history is that China's foreign relations were dominated by a hierarchical system of tribute tied to the Sinocentric worldview. In this view, neighboring states and peoples acknowledged China's superior civilization by sending regular tribute missions to the Chinese emperor. These missions would bring local goods and perform rituals that affirmed China's dominant international position. The tribute system was a key way for China to assert cultural, political and economic dominance over its neighbors. 

Recent research, however, has challenged this traditional interpretation and understanding of the tribute system. Scholars now see the tribute system as more reciprocal and flexible. Tribute missions served diverse purposes for both China and its neighbors. For China's neighbors, sending tribute was a way to gain trade benefits, secure peace and stability on the borders, and gain diplomatic recognition and prestige. For China, accepting tribute affirmed its status but also provided economic and geopolitical benefits. The goods and exotic animals, plants and luxury items that came with the tribute missions were valued at the Chinese court. Tribute also helped China gather intelligence about its neighbors and the broader region.

The traditional perception of the tribute system suggests China's foreign relations were defined by its hierarchical dominance over subservient neighbors who acknowledged China's superiority. In reality, the system was more symbiotic and mutually beneficial. China's neighbors actively sought connections with the Chinese court and sending tribute was a way to cultivate diplomatic and economic ties, not just demonstrate submission. For China's part, it gained as much as it gave from the tribute system. It gained knowledge, goods, stability and prestige that served both symbolic and practical needs.

The traditional view also implies that China dictated the terms of the tribute system and that its neighbors had to follow Chinese protocols. But in fact, China often had to accommodate the interests and customs of different groups. The nature and frequency of tribute missions varied widely depending on the group. Some sent lavish missions on a tightly regulated schedule, others sent missions sporadically when it suited their needs. The goods offered as tribute were usually locally available items, not standardized Chinese expectations. 

In sum, while the tribute system was tied to China's self-perception as the dominant civilization, it was not as rigid or as defined by Chinese interests as previously thought. Recent research shows it was a reciprocal system that benefited both China and its neighbors in diverse ways. Both China and those sending tribute had autonomy and pursued their own political and economic interests through the system. The traditional narrative of Chinese dominance and other states' deference is too simplistic. The tribute system was built on mutual interests as much as Chinese hierarchy and shaped by both Chinese and foreign motivations.
