Chymotrypsin is a serine protease found in the pancreas that hydrolyzes peptide bonds in proteins and polypeptides where the amino acid residue adjacent to the bond is aromatic (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan) or large and hydrophobic (leucine, methionine). Its mechanism of action occurs in three steps: binding, acylation, and deacylation. 

In the binding step, the substrate binds to the active site of chymotrypsin, which contains a catalytic triad of Asp102, His57, and Ser195. The imidazole ring of His57 acts as a base to extract a proton from Ser195, causing it to act as a nucleophile to attack the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond in the substrate. This results in the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate.

In the acylation step, the tetrahedral intermediate collapses by releasing the amino product and covalently binding the carboxyl product to Ser195, forming an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The deacylation step involves a water molecule attacking the carbonyl carbon of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, which breaks down the tetrahedral intermediate to release the carboxyl product and regenerate the free enzyme.

The activity of chymotrypsin depends strongly on pH due to the involvement of the ionizable histidine in its active site. At low pH, the imidazole ring of His57 is predominantly protonated, which prevents it from activating Ser195 as a nucleophile and results in low enzymatic activity. As the pH increases, His57 loses its proton and can participate in activating Ser195, resulting in increased activity. The pH optimum of chymotrypsin is usually around pH 8, as this corresponds to the point where His57 is half-deprotonated and can most effectively activate Ser195. 

Accurately determining protein concentration is important in enzymology as it allows for control of enzyme and substrate concentrations in experiments. For the experiment to determine the pH optimum and KM of chymotrypsin, protein assays were first performed to determine the concentrations of chymotrypsin and casein solutions. The enzymatic activity of chymotrypsin was then measured at different pH values using a colorimetric assay based on the cleavage of a synthetic chymotrypsin substrate. A graph of activity vs. pH showed a peak at pH 8, confirming it as the pH optimum.

To determine the KM, the initial rate of the chymotrypsin reaction was measured at the pH optimum using varying concentrations of the casein substrate. A graph of 1/rate vs. 1/substrate concentration yielded a linear graph with the KM as the negative reciprocal of the x-intercept. The results showed the KM of chymotrypsin for casein to be 0.15 mg/mL. 

In summary, chymotrypsin exhibits Michaelis-Menten kinetics and its mechanism of action depends strongly on an ionizable histidine residue in its active site. Accurate determination of protein concentrations allows for controlled experiments to characterize chymotrypsin and other enzymes. The experiment analyzed in this essay demonstrated typical approaches for finding the pH optimum and kinetic properties of an enzyme.
