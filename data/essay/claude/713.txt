Sleep problems and excessive crying in infants, known as sleep-wake disturbances and disregulated crying, can have significant short and long term consequences. In the short term, these issues can lead to distress for both the infant and the caretakers, negatively impacting the emotional health and well-being of the family unit. In the long term, unresolved sleep-wake and crying issues may contribute to developmental and behavioral problems as these infants become children and adolescents.  

Sleep-wake disturbances, including difficulties falling asleep, staying asleep, and irregular sleep-wake patterns, impact up to 30% of infants. Excessive crying, also known as inconsolable crying or colic, affects up to 25% of infants, especially in the first few months of life. Both of these problems relate to the infant's inability to regulate their physiological, emotional, and behavioral statesâ€”known as poor self-regulation. The immature nervous system of infants, especially those born prematurely, makes it difficult for them to transition between being awake and asleep and to calm themselves when upset. 

In the short term, the consequences of these self-regulation difficulties include sleep deprivation for both infant and parents, increased parental stress, anxiety, and depression, and a higher risk of abuse or neglect of the infant. Caretakers who are exhausted and emotionally depleted from constant crying or wakeups during the night may struggle to be optimally responsive and attentive to the infant during the day. This can undermine the development of a secure attachment between infant and caregiver. Lack of sleep and high stress also negatively impacts the health and cognitive performance of parents.

In the long term, children with untreated sleep-wake or crying disorders in infancy tend to continue to struggle with self-regulation as they get older. They are more prone to emotional reactivity, inattention, hyperactivity, aggression, and oppositional defiant behaviors, all of which can be challenging for both the child and the family. These behavioral problems then put the child at higher risk for issues with learning, relationships, and mental health.  

Fortunately, there are several effective treatments for sleep-wake and crying disorders that can help promote healthy self-regulation and mitigate long term consequences. For sleep issues, options include implementing good sleep hygiene, sleep training techniques like gradual extinction, and medical interventions for any underlying conditions. For excessive crying, treatment may involve comforting techniques, infant massage, sensory stimulation, and ensuring adequate nutrition or medical care if needed. Parental education and support are also key since a caregiver's ability to sensitively and consistently respond to an infant's needs is central to developing good self-regulation.

The early implementation of appropriate treatment for sleep-wake disturbances and disregulated crying in infancy can help prevent considerable hardship for both children and families. With treatment, an infant's ability to self-regulate can improve dramatically, setting them up for success in childhood and beyond. Overall, promoting healthy sleep, crying, and self-regulation in infancy through effective treatment and a nurturing caregiving environment is ideal for infant well-being and development.
