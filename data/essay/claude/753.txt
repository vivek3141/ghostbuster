To identify my career aspirations of opening an inclusive fusion bakery, I first analyzed my key interests and values. I have always been passionate about baking and trying recipes from different cultures. After graduating with a degree in Hospitality Management, I gained experience in various roles at a prestigious international hotel company. However, I felt unfulfilled in my strategic management position and craved more creativity and autonomy in my work. 

Entrepreneurship seemed the perfect path to align my interests and values. I began researching how to start my own business and chose a bakery as I wanted to share my passion for international flavors and bring people together over food. To create an action plan, I conducted market research to assess demand and competitor offerings. I found an underserved niche for a bakery incorporating diverse cultures into each product. 

With a clear vision, I developed a business plan detailing my mission, target market, marketing and operational strategies. I built financial projections to secure funding and left my job to focus on launching the bakery. I knew finding investors and loans would require conveying my motivation and competence. I updated my CV to emphasize relevant experience, skills, and quantifiable accomplishments that would translate to running a successful bakery.

In my covering letter, I expressed my vision for an inclusive community space where people could discover and share different traditions over high-quality fusion pastries and breads. I discussed the expertise I had gained in strategic management but a desire to directly impact customers through an entrepreneurial endeavor. I wanted to take pride in serving freshest, skillfully crafted goods while providing a unique multicultural experience unlike anywhere else. My passion and original concept were key selling points to secure the necessary funding to make my vision a reality.  

With a solid plan and funding in place, I gained valuable hands-on experience by interning at specialty bakeries to strengthen my baking techniques and learn sustainable business practices. I built relationships with suppliers for the highest quality, locally-sourced ingredients. I found a retail space and designed an interior reflecting my brand ethos. After months of preparation, my bakery opened smoothly and has since become a hub for community, culture, and quality. Starting my own socially-conscious business has been the most fulfilling decision in combining my interests, values, and desire to make a positive impact. My career aspirations led me to an action plan and perseverance to achieve entrepreneurial success on my own terms.
