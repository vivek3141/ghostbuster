The Shapiro-Stiglitz shirking model is an economic theory that models the relationship between unemployment levels and the wage rate in an economy. The key insight of the model is that when the unemployment rate is low, firms have to pay higher wages to discourage workers from shirking on the job. The model shows how an equilibrium level of unemployment and wages can emerge in an economy based on the costs of monitoring worker effort and the benefits of shirking for workers.  

The Shapiro-Stiglitz model makes several key assumptions. First, it assumes that there is imperfect and costly monitoring of worker effort by firms. It is difficult and expensive for firms to directly observe how hard each worker is working at all times. Second, the model assumes that there are benefits to workers from shirking, such as leisure on the job. Workers have an incentive to work less than the optimal effort level desired by the firm. Finally, the model assumes that firms can use the threat of unemployment to motivate workers not to shirk. If workers are caught shirking, they can be fired, so the higher the unemployment rate, the less inclined workers are to risk shirking.

The main variables in the model are the unemployment rate, the wage level, the costs of worker monitoring, the level of worker shirking, and the benefits of shirking for workers. The equilibrium in the model is achieved at a wage and unemployment rate where workers receive fair compensation for their effort but also have incentives not to shirk due to a reasonable fear of unemployment. At very low unemployment rates, the costs of monitoring required to prevent rampant shirking become prohibitive for firms. At very high unemployment, workers are so fearful of job loss that they accept very low compensation.

Empirical research provides some support for the Shapiro-Stiglitz model. Studies show that when local labor markets tighten, wages tend to increase, which is consistent with firms raising wages to limit shirking. Research also shows that worker productivity and effort levels do tend to decline when labor markets are slack, suggesting that the threat of unemployment does help incentivize worker effort. However, the empirical evidence is mixed, and there are many factors that determine wages and unemployment in real-world economies.

In conclusion, the Shapiro-Stiglitz shirking model provides a theoretical framework for understanding the relationship between unemployment and wages based on worker incentives and monitoring costs within firms. While simplified, the model highlights how labor market dynamics can emerge from asymmetric information and principal-agent problems within employment relationships. The model has received some empirical support, but there remain many open questions about how other factors influence wage-setting and joblessness in economies.
