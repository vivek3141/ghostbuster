What advantages do infants have in learning language and how do these innate preferences aid in mastering their native language?  

Infants are born with several innate abilities that provide advantages for learning language. These abilities help infants attune to the sounds and patterns of the language they are exposed to from birth and helps them eventually master their native language with ease. 

One key advantage infants have is the ability to distinguish between the phonemes, or basic sounds, of any language. Infants can perceive the full range of human speech sounds, but they lose this ability over time through a process known as perceptual narrowing. As infants are exposed to their native language, they get better at perceiving the phonemic distinctions that are meaningful in that language. For example, English-learning infants get better at perceiving the difference between /r/ and /l/ sounds, while Japanese infants, whose language does not distinguish between those sounds, lose that ability. Perceptual narrowing helps infants focus on the sounds that are most important for their language.

A second advantage for infants is their sensitivity to frequently occurring sounds and sound combinations in language. Infants can detect subtle statistical patterns in the speech they are exposed to. For example, infants as young as 2 days old prefer the sounds of their mother’s native language over other languages. They can also detect more complex patterns, like the fact that in English, ‘tr’ together is more frequent than ‘tl’. These statistical learning abilities help infants identify the basic building blocks of their language.  

A third advantage is that infants have a natural preference for the rhythms and melodies of the language they are exposed to from infancy. Infants are born with a sensitivity to speech rhythms that common in world languages, but they narrow in on the particular rhythmic properties of their native language over the first year of life. For example, infants exposed to English develop a preference for stress-timed rhythms, while Spanish-exposed infants prefer syllable-timed rhythms. These rhythmic preferences help infants acquire the rules for combining syllables and words in their language.

Together, these innate abilities give infants advantages for attuning to the unique sounds, rhythms, and patterns of their native language. Once they have narrowed in on the properties of their native language, infants can then learn words, grammar, and the complex rules for how to combine words into meaningful sentences. While mastering language is a lengthy process that extends well into childhood and beyond, infants' innate skills provide a crucial starting point for acquiring their native tongue during the earliest stages of development. Their perceptual abilities, statistical learning skills, and rhythmic preferences pave the way for learning the language to which they are exposed as newborns. These very early sensitivities and biases help ensure that infants stay on the right path to mastering their native language.
