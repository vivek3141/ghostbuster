During the early modern period in Europe, spanning from the late 15th century to the late 18th century, the role of common people in politics was complex and varied significantly across time and place. On the one hand, most political power officially rested with monarchs and ruling elites. Yet on the other hand, the people participated in politics through both formal and informal means, influencing policy and expressing dissent when needed. Overall, scholars interpret the role of the people in early modern politics as growing over time, with an increasing voice and presence from the 16th century onward due to factors like the Protestant Reformation. However, the extent of popular participation still varied based on numerous social, cultural, and institutional realities.

To understand the role of the people, we must first define 'politics' in the context of early modern Europe. Politics referred to more than just matters of the state or government institutions. It encompassed "all areas of collective decision making and activity," including local matters like poverty relief or crime prevention. While common people had little direct power over central government institutions, they were involved in local and communal politics. They also expressed dissatisfaction with rulers and policies through riots, protests, and rebellions. So, we must consider politics broadly to fully assess the role of early modern European people. 

In terms of formal participation, common people in towns and cities had opportunities to vote for and serve in representative assemblies. However, only small percentages of people actually enjoyed such rights, typically affluent property owners and merchants. Rural peasants rarely had any formal political rights or representation. Over time, revolutions led to demands for more representative institutions with wider suffrage, as in the English Civil Wars in the 1640s and 1650s. Still, most political power remained concentrated among elites.

Informal participation, on the other hand, included attending public ceremonies, voicing grievances with petitions or protests, rioting, and other forms of unrest. Such extra-institutional participation allowed even disenfranchised common folk to influence rulers and policies. The people thus demonstrated a nascent form of public opinion in politics. However, the diversity of early modern Europe made popular participation uneven. Cultural, religious, and economic differences across countries and regions shaped how and how much the people got involved. 

In conclusion, the role of common Europeans in politics during the early modern period was complex and evolving. While most formal power rested with rulers and institutions, the people shaped politics through informal participation and an emerging public voice. Yet the extent of popular involvement varied greatly based on the diversity of societies across time and place. As politics came to encompass more areas of life beyond government, people at all levels of society found ways to influence collective decision making, though often not through official means. Scholars thus interpret the political role of early modern common people as constrained but gradually growing, reflecting the tumults of a period marked by both rigid inequalities as well as radical calls for liberty and representation.
