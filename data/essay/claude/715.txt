The international human right to adequate housing presents an opportunity for strategic litigation in domestic courts to help improve local housing conditions. This right is recognized in international law in several key treaties, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The right to housing is the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity. It encompasses having safe, affordable, habitable, accessible and culturally appropriate shelter. 

However, the right to housing faces several challenges in terms of being used directly in domestic courts. First, many countries have not yet incorporated economic and social rights, like the right to housing, into their constitutions or domestic law. Without this incorporation, it is difficult to argue for the justiciability and enforceability of the right. Even when incorporated, rights may be subject to progressive realization based on available resources, limiting their enforceability.

Second, litigation strategies relying on international law are often complex, requiring technical legal arguments that can be difficult to understand. This can pose challenges for communities and public interest lawyers to deploy. Courts may also be hesitant to apply international law directly without an established precedent of doing so. 

Despite these challenges, using the right to housing in domestic litigation still has significant benefits as an advocacy strategy. It helps raise awareness about the existence of this right, which can apply moral and political pressure even when not directly enforceable. It helps highlight issues of homelessness, lack of affordable housing, forced evictions and poor living conditions as human rights issues. This framing can shift public discourse and understanding.

Even when not fully justiciable, the right to housing can still inform judicial decisions and be used to interpret domestic law. It provides a framework for assessing whether government policies, programs and spending related to housing are meeting basic human rights standards. Litigation, even if unsuccessful, often spurs policy changes simply by highlighting an issue.

In conclusion, while the international right to adequate housing faces obstacles to direct enforcement in domestic courts, it remains a useful advocacy tool to help address and improve housing deprivation and poor conditions. At a minimum, it helps reframe housing issues as human rights issues, which can drive political and social change over the long run. With continuous advocacy, it may also become more justiciable and enforceable in domestic legal systems. Overall, it provides an ethical and legal basis for demanding improved government responses to housing needs.
