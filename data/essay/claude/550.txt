There were several key divisions within black politics in the 1960s that undermined the movement at times and weakened its overall impact. Two of the most significant divisions were between advocates of nonviolent civil disobedience versus more militant and confrontational tactics, and between integrationists who focused primarily on racial equality versus nationalists who emphasized self-determination and empowerment of the black community.

The division over tactics—nonviolent civil disobedience versus more militant confrontation—was one of the earliest splits. Groups like the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) promoted nonviolent tactics following the model of Martin Luther King Jr. and the early civil rights movement. However, as the 1960s progressed and the pace of change seemed too slow, many activists grew frustrated with nonviolence and adopted more militant tactics like those promoted by the Black Panther Party. The Panthers believed that nonviolence was not working and that the government would only respond to violence and confrontation. This split over tactics caused a rift in the movement and turned some public opinion against the civil rights struggle.  

The division between integrationists and nationalists was in some ways even more significant. Integrationists like Martin Luther King Jr. believed the primary goal should be achieving equal rights and opportunities for African Americans within mainstream American society. Nationalists like Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam argued that integration into white society was neither possible nor desirable. They advocated instead for building up and empowering the separate black community through self-determination and black-owned institutions. This split represented a profound philosophical disagreement over the aims and identity of the movement. It resulted in mutual distrust and hostility at times between various groups.

These internal divisions severely weakened the black freedom struggle in the 1960s. They caused rival groups to directly and openly antagonize one another at times rather than uniting against the common foe of racism. They split supporters,redirected energy and resources toward internal disputes, and projected an image of disarray or extremism to those outside the movement. The divisions also made it easier for the government to discredit more militant groups, portray the Movement as uncooperative and unappealing to the mainstream, and justify increasingly harsh crackdowns against civil rights activists and protest activity.     

While the civil rights movement made huge strides in defeating Jim Crow and advancing the cause of racial equality in spite of these divisions, one wonders what more might have been achieved with a more united front. The divisions sapped moral authority and momentum from the movement, gave political cover for opponents and moderates to avoid taking action, and diverted valuable resources and energy to address factional disputes rather than targeting institutional racism. The story of black politics in the 1960s is an inspiring one of empowerment and progress against long odds, but it is also a cautionary tale about the way internal struggles can undermine even the most righteous and important causes.
