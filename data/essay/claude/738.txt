Religious scripture, intended to provide spiritual guidance and moral direction, has often been interpreted and appropriated in ways that depart from authors' original intent. When scripture is manipulated and taken out of context to justify oppression and control, it takes on a dystopic character. Two famous works of dystopic fiction, Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale and George Orwell's 1984, explore how totalitarian regimes can twist and weaponize religious texts and beliefs to exert power over citizens.

In The Handmaid's Tale, the authoritarian theocratic government of Gilead justifies its harsh policies by appropriating segments of the Bible, especially passages focused on fertility, childbirth, and traditional gender roles. The leaders pick and choose verses that align with their patriarchal and militant ideology, like those that emphasize women's subservience and duty to procreate, while ignoring other teachings about love, compassion, and freedom. The handmaids are indoctrinated with these distorted interpretations of scripture to accept their place and duty. Atwood suggests that any ideology, whether religious or secular, can become oppressive and dystopic when wielded by ruthless autocrats who deliberately exploit and misapply it to deprive people of liberty and dignity. 

Similarly, in 1984, the Party exploits notions of infallibility, inerrancy, and devotion to justify its complete control over citizens' thoughts and behaviors. References to "the immortal principles of Ingsoc" and "our infallible and all-powerful leader" are intended to evoke religious fervor and discourage critical thought. The Two Minutes Hate, group confessions, and other rituals depicted in the novel resemble religious services re-purposed for brainwashing and ideological manipulation. Like Gilead's leaders, the Party establishes its dystopia by first twisting beliefs and values that could otherwise provide meaning â€“ and then demanding rigid conformity to those corrupted principles.

In both works, the ruling powers recognize that to gain control, they must control meaning itself. They appropriate religious scripture and notions of infallibility, but twist them to serve their own political ends. By doing so, they can demand absolute and unquestioning loyalty from citizens, attacking critical thought itself. Atwood and Orwell suggest that any ideology, religious or otherwise,
