The proposed study aims to explore midwives’ experiences with hand hygiene practices and their attitudes towards clinical guidelines on infection control. The study seeks to gain insights into the factors that influence midwives’ compliance with hand hygiene recommendations and standard precautions. The key research questions this study will address are: 

1) What are midwives’ current hand hygiene practices when caring for women during labor and childbirth? Do they follow the recommended practices from clinical guidelines for hand washing, hand sanitizing, glove use, etc.? If not, what are the barriers preventing them from following the guidelines?

2) What are midwives’ views and attitudes towards clinical guidelines on infection control and hand hygiene? Do they believe the guidelines are practical and useful for their setting? Do they think adhering to the guidelines makes a meaningful difference in patient safety and outcomes? Their attitudes and beliefs will provide context for their practices.

3) What factors in the labor and delivery environment make it challenging for midwives to maintain good hand hygiene? Possible factors may include high workload and time pressures, lack of sinks or hand sanitizers, poor design of facilities, lack of supplies, etc. Identifying these barriers will help in developing solutions to improve practices.

4) Do midwives feel they have adequate training, resources, and support to follow hand hygiene guidelines? If not, what additional support do they need to improve their compliance? Providing education and training may be key to changing habits and behaviors.  

In summary, this study aims to gain a holistic understanding of the hand hygiene practices and challenges of midwives during labor and childbirth. By answering these research questions, the study can uncover the barriers to compliance with clinical guidelines and find solutions to facilitate behavior change through education, resources, environmental modifications, and other interventions. Improving hand hygiene at this critical point of care can help reduce infection transmission to mothers and newborns, thus improving health outcomes. The insights gained from this study will help improve midwifery practices, enhance patient safety, and strengthen the quality of care provided to mothers and newborns.
