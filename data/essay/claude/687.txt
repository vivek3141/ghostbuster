The sublime is a key concept explored in 18th century philosophy. The meaning of the sublime refers to experiences that inspired awe, beauty, and a sense of transcendence due to their immenseness or grandeur. Two influential thinkers who explored the sublime in the 1700s were Edmund Burke and Immanuel Kant. While they both analyzed the sublime, they differed in their views on the differences between the beautiful and sublime, the source of pleasure in sublime experiences, and the role of imagination. Their theories helped establish the sublime as a pivotal idea in aesthetic philosophy.

According to Burke, the beautiful and sublime are distinct emotions that evoke different feelings. Beauty results from smoothness, delicacy, and gradual variation, giving rise to feelings of cheerfulness and pleasure. The sublime, on the other hand, produces astonishment through experiences of vastness, infinity, magnificence, obscurity, power, privation, difficulty, and magnificence. The sublime causes feelings of awe, terror, and pain that arise from a sense of the infinite and obscure. Whereas the beautiful is pleasing and invites approach, the sublime inspires reverence and even horror due to its might and obscurity. For Kant, the beautiful and sublime are not entirely separate but exist on a continuum based on the intensity of aesthetic experience. While the beautiful gives rise to a harmonious free play of understanding and imagination, the sublime results in a feeling of boundlessness where imagination fails to comprehend what understanding presents to it. The beautiful invites freedom of play whereas the sublime induces a joyful blockage of understanding and a feeling of universal harmony. Though Kant views the sublime as an extension of beauty, he agrees with Burke that the sublime is marked by boundlessness whereas the beautiful has bounds. 

For Burke, the pleasure in sublime experiences arises from the passion caused by an encounter with obscurity, terror, or privation that does not actually threaten the body. The sublime “delights the eye but hurts the mind,” arousing feelings of terror and obscurity that are painfully delightful because we know we are in no real danger. The sublime shows the weakness of our minds in grappling with the infinite, reminding us of the limits of our capacity for comprehension. For Kant, the pleasure in the sublime stems from our ability to transcend sensible limitations and access supersensible ideas like freedom, God, and immortality. The sublime gives us a moral feeling of being superior to nature by showing that our reason is unbounded by the constraints of sensibility. We can find sublimity even in formless nature because we use aesthetic ideas to symbolize the supersensible, giving us access to another dimension of meaning. The sublime is therefore a “symbol of morality” that gives us a sense of spiritual or transcendent greatness.

Burke and Kant also differed in their views on the role of imagination in the sublime. For Burke, imagination and judgment play a key role in experiencing sublimity. We imaginatively reconstruct the obscure ideas and forms we perceive to grasp them and feel terror in so doing. The imagination strives to comprehend infinity but fails, creating a blend of pleasure and pain. For Kant, imagination also initially fails to present a coherent concept of boundlessness in sublime experiences. But through the use of aesthetic ideas of reason, the imagination finds a symbolic way of intimating boundlessness and attaining a moral feeling of the supersensible. The imagination finds a measure of success in using aesthetic ideas symbolically, even though it cannot entirely grasp the suprasensible ideas of God, freedom, and immortality. So for Burke, the imagination struggles but ultimately fails in grasping the sublime, while for Kant, the imagination succeeds in symbolizing the suprasensible through aesthetic ideas of reason.

Finally, Burke's theory of the man-made sublime extended the idea of the sublime to new domains like art, poetry, and rhetoric. For Burke, artistic creations like Milton's Paradise Lost or Michelangelo's paintings could induce an experience of grandeur, obscurity and infinity akin to that found in untamed nature. The sublime style in writing and speech that makes “great things ... brought within the compass of easy conception” stirs the passion and elevates the mind. The artistic sublime depends upon the creative use of language, metaphor, and suggestion to stimulate latent ideas that gesture towards the infinite, incomprehensible and emotionally stirring. Burke's articulation of a man-made sublime through art, literature and language supplemented theories of the sublime in rugged nature, demonstrating its breadth of philosophical significance.  

In conclusion, Burke and Kant developed influential theories of the sublime in the 18th century that centered on experiences of grandeur, obscurity and boundlessness which expand the mind and spirit. They explored differences between the beautiful and sublime, the source of pleasure in sublime experience, and the role of imagination in comprehending the sublime. Burke extended the theory of the sublime to art and language, showing how these could stirringly suggest the infinite. Their philosophies established the sublime as a key concept in aesthetics that pointed to new ways of grasping the relationship between mind, emotion, morality and the world.
