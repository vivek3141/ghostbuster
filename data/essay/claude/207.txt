Felicity and Amy's attempted theft of mobile phones on a train could expose them to criminal liability for several offenses. Most directly, their actions likely constitute attempted theft, which is a crime itself even when the underlying theft is not completed. Attempted theft requires intent to steal property from another, and an overt act beyond mere preparation towards completing the theft. Here, Felicity and Amy developed a plan to steal phones from passengers on a train, they boarded the train intending to carry out the plan, and they took overt steps towards stealing the phones such as choosing potential victims. Therefore, they would likely be found guilty of attempted theft.

Felicity and Amy also likely conspired together to commit theft, and as such could face conspiracy charges. Conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more persons to commit an unlawful act, as well as an intent to carry out the conspiracy and an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. Felicity and Amy clearly reached an agreement to steal the phones together, they intended to follow through with their plan, and their act of boarding the train and choosing victims constitutes overt acts to advance their conspiracy. Because a conspiracy to commit theft is itself a crime, they could be found guilty even though the thefts were not completed.  

Felicity could also face criminal charges related to their interaction with Delia on the train. Her actions towards Delia, pushing her violently as she accused her of theft and causing her to fall, could qualify as manslaughter if Delia died as a result. Manslaughter requires an unlawful act that is dangerous to human life, committed with malice, and results in death. Pushing someone forcefully inside a moving train is an unlawful act that endangers life, and Felicity's actions suggested at least implied malice in recklessly disregarding the risk to Delia's safety. If Delia had died from injuries suffered in the fall, Felicity's actions would likely constitute unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter.

In terms of attempted theft, the law seeks to punish those who are clearly determined to carry out an offense, even when they ultimately fail or are prevented from doing so. Therefore, the current law of attempts, which allows prosecution and punishment based primarily on the attempter's intent and overt actions, appropriately addresses the culpability of those like Felicity and Amy. The fact that they were ultimately unable to steal the phones due a confrontation by passengers and the arrival of police does not mitigate their initial attempt and determination to carry out the thefts. They chose to undertake a course of action that would have resulted in harm to victims but for intervention by others, so their attempted theft should still be subject to criminal consequences.  

In conclusion, Felicity and Amy exhibited several forms of criminal liability in their attempted theft on the train. They could face charges for attempted theft based on their overt actions and clear intent to steal victims' phones. They also likely conspired together to commit theft, which is a separate criminal act. Felicity, in particular, could face charges for manslaughter if her violent confrontation of Delia contributed to Delia's death. And while they ultimately failed to achieve their goal due to outside intervention, the current law of attempts appropriately considers their initial actions and intent sufficient to warrant criminal punishment. Their unsuccessful attempt does diminish their culpability and liability for attempting to victimize passengers on the train.
