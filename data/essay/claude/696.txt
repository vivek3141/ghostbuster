The common law has been influenced by a multitude of philosophies and theologies over its long development. Two of the most significant have been the Judaeo-Christian tradition and the classical Graeco-Roman tradition. The influence of Judaeo-Christian theology is considered by many scholars to have been profound, shaping core principles such as the centrality of individual rights, equality before the law, and due process. However, the symbolic nature of the common law should not be understated, as it developed in a way that wove together disparate influences to create a new whole. 

The Judeo-Christian tradition placed a strong emphasis on the inherent worth and rights of the individual. The Bible depicts humans as made in God's image, and therefore invested with a kind of divine dignity. This conception helped inspire key common law principles like habeas corpus - the right of the individual not to be unlawfully detained. The Bible also emphasized mercy, forgiveness, and charity as virtues, which may have encouraged a more rehabilitative impulse within the English justice system compared to the harsh retributivism of Rome.

In contrast, the classical Graeco-Roman tradition was less concerned with the individual and more focused on the health of the state. In Roman law, the paterfamilias had extensive authority over his household, including the right to kill members of his family. The Roman state was also adept at using torture to extract confessions and employed brutal punishments like crucifixion. These methods seem far removed from the common law's later prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments and its emphasis on due process and fair procedure.

However, while Judeo-Christian ideals were undoubtedly influential, some scholars argue that their impact on the early common law was more limited than is often portrayed. The medieval period saw a synthesis of diverse customs, traditions, and jurisprudences, not the straightforward adoption of Biblical principles. The symbolic nature of the common law - its gradual accumulation of precedents and authoritative voices, coalescing into custom - meant it wove together strands from various sources, producing a new fabric. Its genius was blending, adapting, and reinterpreting, not slavish adherence to dogma.

In conclusion, Judaeo-Christian theology was immensely significant in shaping core values that later animated the common law. However, the common law itself developed in an organic fashion, merging different influences, metaphors, and symbols into a whole that was more than the sum of its parts. While it reflected Judeo-Christian ideals like the dignity of the individual, it did so in a characteristically tangled, indirect fashion. The common law's syncretic nature should not be underestimated, even as we recognize major tributaries like the river of Judeo-Christian thought that undeniably fed its development.
