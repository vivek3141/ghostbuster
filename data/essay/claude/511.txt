Parmenides's poem On Nature presents two distinct metaphysical paths to truth: the Way of Truth and the Way of Seeming. The Way of Truth argues for an ultimate reality that is unchanging, motionless, eternal, and unified. All sensory perceptions of change, plurality, and differentiation are argued to be illusory. This notion of a unitary, unchanging being is a radical claim that departs from conventional beliefs and perceptions of the world. Within the poem, however, Parmenides also includes a lengthy description of the cosmos in the Way of Seeming that incorporates change, motion, plurality, differentiation, and disparate elements - all the features he argued against in the Way of Truth. 

There are a few possible reasons why Parmenides may have included the Way of Seeming in his poem despite its apparent contradiction of his central monistic argument. First, Parmenides may have wanted to provide an account of the cosmos and natural world that accorded with conventional beliefs and perceptions, even if he did not believe this was ultimately real or true. By incorporating the Way of Seeming, Parmenides could have made his radical claims in the Way of Truth more palatable and comprehensible to his readers. They would have a familiar cosmological framework to situate his abstract metaphysical ideas within.

Second, Parmenides may have included the Way of Seeming as a rhetorical device to highlight the illusory nature of sense experience and the physical world. By presenting a detailed cosmology only to argue that it represents the 'way of seeming' rather than truth, Parmenides stresses how the world we perceive is deceptive and misleading. The inclusion of the Way of Seeming could have been intended to reinforce Parmenides's argument that only the unitary, unchanging being presented in the Way of Truth represents ultimate reality.

Finally, some scholars argue that Parmenides did not actually view the Way of Truth and Way of Seeming as contradictory or mutually exclusive. Rather, Parmenides may have seen them as complimentary paths to knowledge that represented different levels of insight. The Way of Seeming corresponds to the level of perception and belief, while the Way of Truth represents the deeper understanding gained through reason. Both accounts are in some sense 'true' - they just represent different ways of conceptualizing and describing the world. 

In conclusion, there are several plausible reasons why Parmenides included the apparently contradictory Way of Seeming in his poem On Nature. The Way of Seeming could have made his radical monism more comprehensible, served as a rhetorical device to highlight the illusory nature of plurality and change, or represented a different level of insight rather than an outright contradiction of the Way of Truth. By incorporating both paths, Parmenides produced a rich and compelling vision of metaphysics and cosmology in his influential poem.
