There are several factors that contribute to high unemployment rates in Europe, particularly in the four largest economies of Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. High union power and coverage, generous unemployment benefits, a larger share of long-term unemployed, as well as low labor mobility and high taxes are major influences on unemployment in these countries. 

Unions are very powerful in Europe and have significant influence over wages and working conditions. Union membership is widespread, covering over half the workforce in many countries. While unions aim to protect workers' rights, their negotiating power often results in wages that are misaligned with labor market demands. When unions are able to negotiate wages that exceed the equilibrium market rate, it leads to higher costs for businesses and reduces the incentive for companies to hire more workers. High union coverage and militancy have been shown to increase unemployment rates in Europe.

Most European countries offer generous unemployment benefits, including long durations of support. While benefits are intended to provide temporary financial relief for those between jobs, lengthy benefit periods can reduce the motivation for unemployed individuals to actively search for new work. Studies show a clear link between the generosity and duration of unemployment benefits and higher unemployment rates across Europe. The benefits provide little incentive for recipients to obtain new jobs, especially if the pay or conditions do not match their previous employment.

The proportion of long-term unemployed, those who have been out of work for 12 months or more, is significantly higher in Europe compared to other regions. The long-term unemployed have a much harder time finding new jobs, as their skills and workplace networks deteriorate over time and employers view them as riskier hires. They also face declining motivation to search for jobs the longer they are unemployed. The high rates of long-term unemployment trap many European workers in a cycle of joblessness that is difficult to escape, contributing to persistently high unemployment overall. 

Labor mobility refers to the ability and willingness of workers to move to new locations for job opportunities. Mobility is lower in Europe due to cultural and institutional barriers, including language differences, a strong preference for local employment, and lack of recognition of qualifications across countries. Low mobility means unemployed workers cannot easily move to regions where more jobs are available. This results in imbalances in the labor market, where unemployment remains high in some areas while job vacancies are unfilled elsewhere in the region. Policies to improve cross-border mobility within the EU could help address unemployment disparities.
