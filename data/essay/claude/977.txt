In 1928, Alexander Fleming, a Scottish biologist and pharmacologist, made a serendipitous discovery that would revolutionize medicine. While studying staphylococcus bacteria in his laboratory at St. Mary's Hospital in London, Fleming noticed that a petri dish he had left open had become contaminated with a mold. Around the mold, there was a ring in which the bacterial growth was inhibited. Fleming realized that the mold, later identified as Penicillium notatum, was producing a substance that prevented the growth of bacteria.  

Fleming named this substance penicillin. He conducted some experiments that showed penicillin could kill many types of harmful bacteria without damage to human cells. Although Fleming published his initial findings, penicillin was not developed as an effective antibiotic drug until over a decade later. It took Howard Florey, Ernst Chain, and Norman Heatley to figure out how to purify and mass-produce penicillin. Once World War II began, Florey and Chain convinced the U.S. and British governments to support research and production of penicillin, recognizing it could be crucial for treating injured soldiers. 

By 1945, penicillin became available for civilian use and was hailed as a "miracle drug." It enabled doctors and surgeons to treat bacterial infections that had previously been difficult or impossible to cure. Conditions like pneumonia, rheumatic fever, and streptococcal infections could now be treated effectively. Penicillin also allowed for advances in surgery, as the risk of infection decreased enormously. It led to new treatments for diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea. The era of antibiotics had begun.

Penicillin and subsequent generations of antibiotics have saved millions of lives by allowing doctors to treat and cure infectious diseases and make surgeries safer. However, their widespread overuse and misuse have also contributed to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Still, the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming was a watershed moment in medicine that fundamentally and irrevocably changed the way doctors prevent and treat disease. Its impact on human health in the 20th century and beyond cannot be overstated.
