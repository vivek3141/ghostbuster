The poets Simon Armitage and the Earl of Rochester, also known as John Wilmot, explore the themes of love and relationships in their poetry. However, they take quite different approaches through their use of language and poetic techniques. 

Armitage adopts a more romantic and idealized view of love and relationships. In his poem “Valentine”, he uses highly positive language to describe his love for his partner. He says her smile “lights the cockles of my heart” and her appearance is like a “heaven torn open”. This hyperbolic language conveys the intensity of his feelings and the almost spiritual nature of his love. His promises to “pluck twenty seashells from the shore” and pick “the stars like orange pips” emphasize his desire to give her beautiful gifts, thus highlighting his devotion and dedication. The poem takes the traditional form of loving praise in celebrating his partner’s beauty and virtues.

In contrast, Wilmot takes a cynical and mocking stance on love and relationships in his poem “A Satyr against Reason and Mankind”. The harsh and bitter language satirizes the idealism of the romantic poets. He describes woman as merely "the pleasure of the fleeting hour" and criticizes man as a "vain animal" who believes he acts based on reason when he is truly "Slave to his passion, errant in his will". The repetition of "his passion" and "his will" emphasizes how selfish human desire and impulse dominates reason. The poem suggests relationships are purely physical and humans are foolish to think they can be governed by logic.  

While Armitage and Wilmot explore similar themes, their poems convey very different views on love and relationships through their choice of language, imagery, and form. Armitage takes an idealistic and romantic view whereas Wilmot adopts a cynical and critical perspective. Their poems thus present opposing interpretations of the human experience. Overall, comparing the poems highlights how poets can craft language and poetic techniques to represent vastly different understandings of common themes.
