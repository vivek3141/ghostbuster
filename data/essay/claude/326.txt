Working memory refers to the cognitive system that temporarily stores and manipulates information needed for complex tasks such as comprehension, learning, and reasoning. Working memory has three main components: the phonological loop, visuo-spatial sketchpad, and central executive. 

The phonological loop processes auditory and verbal information. It consists of two parts: a phonological store that holds speech-based information for a few seconds, and an articulatory rehearsal process that can refresh this information through subvocal speech to prevent its decay. The phonological loop's role in working memory was demonstrated in a study by Baddeley in 1975. In the study, participants had to recall lists of words, digits, and nonwords after several seconds. Results showed that words were easiest to recall due to the phonological loop, followed by digits which can be verbally rehearsed, and lastly nonwords which are harder to rehearse and thus quickly decay from the phonological store. This provided evidence that the phonological loop uses articulatory rehearsal to maintain verbal information.

The visuo-spatial sketchpad manipulates visual and spatial information. It can construct and manipulate mental images, shapes, and locations. Logie and Marchetti's study in 1991 showed the role of the visuo-spatial sketchpad in working memory. Participants viewed a matrix of dots for a brief time and then had to determine if a dot had changed position. Some participants had to repeat a visually or spatially irrelevant sound (to block the phonological loop) or move their fingers (to block central executive functions) during the dot matrix and delay period. Results showed the visuo-spatial sketchpad was still able to maintain the dot locations, evidenced by unchanged performance. This suggests the sketchpad operates independent of the phonological loop and central executive.

The central executive is the component of working memory responsible for attentional control and coordination of the phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad. It directs attention to relevant information, suppresses irrelevant information, and manipulates information in the slave systems. The central executive also interfaces with long-term memory. A study by Baddeley, Chincotta and Adlam in 2001 investigated the role of the central executive in the `digit-span` task where lists of digits have to be recalled in order. When participants had to repeat the digits in reverse order, requiring more central executive control to manipulate the information, their digit span was reduced compared to repeating the same digits in forward order. This shows the central executive is required to coordinate complex tasks.

In summary, the phonological loop, visuo-spatial sketchpad, and central executive are the three components of working memory. The phonological loop processes verbal and auditory information through articulatory rehearsal, the visuo-spatial sketchpad manipulates visual and spatial information, and the central executive directs attention and coordinates the slave systems. Various experiments provide evidence for the roles of each component in temporarily storing and manipulating information for cognitive tasks.
