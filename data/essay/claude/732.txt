Joseph Conrad's novella "Heart of Darkness" is a complex narrative that explores profound themes in a postmodern context, especially those of identity, truth, and subjectivity. Written at the dawn of the 20th century but published as modernist sensibilities were taking hold, the text anticipates many of the concerns of postmodernity. In particular, Conrad examines the way individual identity is constructed and truth is contextual through his protagonist Marlow's journey into the "heart of darkness" in colonial Congo. Marlow's encounters with the horror and darkness of human nature peel away the layers of his own constructed identity and reveal the fluid and contingent nature of truth. 

The text suggests that identity is not fixed or essential but rather is shaped by social and historical circumstances. This view aligns with Michel Foucault's conception of identity as an effect of power relations in a given society. One's subject position emerges from the discourses and social practices that categorize and label individuals. In the novella, Marlow is a complex character whose own identity is troubled and ambiguous. He exists in a space between cultures as a result of his time living abroad, and he does not neatly fit into any category. His very name, "Marlow," is a play on "marrow" that suggests an indistinct core. Marlow's liminal identity allows him to move between the worlds of imperialism and savagery, civilization and wilderness. However, his encounters in the Congo ultimately reveal the hollowness of the categories that shape identity. The presumed dichotomy between "civilized" Europeans and "savage" Africans collapses as Marlow witnesses the cruelty and barbarism of supposedly enlightened men like the Station Manager. Identity proves to be a façade that obscures the primal darkness within all human beings.

Marlow's journey also exposes the contingency of truth and the way it depends on one's perspective or "way of seeing." This view shares affinities with Lacan's theory of the fragmented self and Freud's idea that the unconscious mind is structured around repression and concealment. Marlow begins his tale confident in his ability to see and know the truth, but he increasingly questions the very possibility of truth as he descends into the jungle. His attempts to understand Africa through its geography and history reveal only "emptiness...the knowledge of which fades out into darkness." Truth melts away in the heart of darkness, and Marlow is left in a state of radical uncertainty. He begins to understand that what constitutes truth depends on one's position or gaze. This is represented through the motif of limited and obscured vision in the text. The darkness of the jungle and the fog that surrounds the steamer prevent Marlow from seeing clearly and highlight the fact that his perspective is merely one way of seeing, not truth itself.

In conclusion, Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" anticipates many postmodern ideas through its treatment of identity, truth, and human consciousness. Marlow's journey into the African interior illustrates how identity is constructed and truth depends on one's way of seeing. The text suggests these concepts emerge from the social practices and power structures in a given society rather than from human nature itself. Questioning the stability of identity, truth, and meaning, the novella reflects a view of the self as fragmented, decentered, and obscured—a view that finds resonance in postmodernism as well as in the theories of thinkers like Foucault, Freud, and Lacan. Overall, Conrad's narrative serves as a powerful examination of epistemological uncertainty that has enduring relevance in the postmodern era.
