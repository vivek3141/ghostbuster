There are several types of spatial analysis used in geography to understand patterns and relationships in geographic data. The three primary types are descriptive spatial analysis, which describes spatial patterns, inferential spatial analysis, which tests statistical hypotheses about spatial patterns, and predictive spatial analysis which uses spatial data to predict values at unsampled locations or times. 

Descriptive spatial analysis involves describing the location and attributes of geographic features, as well as spatial patterns and associations. Simple descriptions of location include latitude and longitude coordinates or map coordinates to show where features are positioned. Descriptions of attributes capture properties of the features such as names, sizes, or types of land use. Spatial pattern analysis examines the arrangement and clustering of features in space. For example, a geographer could analyze the pattern of businesses of a particular type in a city to identify clusters of similar businesses. Spatial association analysis measures the strength of relationship between locations, such as how the frequency of vehicle accidents is associated with intersections or how rates of cancer correlate with location of toxic waste sites. These types of descriptive analysis form the basis for understanding geographic data and spatial relationships.

Inferential spatial analysis uses statistical techniques to determine the likelihood that spatial patterns or associations observed in the data are not due to random chance alone. Common techniques include spatial autocorrelation which measures the correlation of values within a distance range, and hot spot analysis which tests if clusters of high or low values are statistically significant hot or cold spots. These techniques are used to analyze geographic data to determine, for example, if clustering in disease rates reflects true underlying spatial processes or if it could reasonably have occurred by random chance. Inferential analysis allows geographers to make judgments about the statistical significance of spatial patterns.

Finally, predictive spatial analysis uses spatial data and statistical techniques to predict values at unsampled locations. For example, spatial interpolation methods such as inverse distance weighting and kriging use measured values at a limited number of locations to predict values at unsampled points across an area. Regression models can also incorporate geographic variables to spatially predict a dependent variable. Predictive models allow geographers to estimate spatial patterns even with limited data, which is useful for applications such as estimating climate change impacts across landscapes or determining future disease risk areas based on current disease clusters.

In summary, descriptive, inferential, and predictive spatial analysis are fundamental tools for geography. These techniques are critical for understanding spatial relationships, determining the significance of geographic patterns, and estimating values across space. Combined, these types of spatial analysis provide a powerful set of methods for gaining insights from spatial data.
