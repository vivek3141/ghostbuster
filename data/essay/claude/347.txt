According to the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, a monopoly leads to an inefficient allocation of resources because the monopolist does not price their goods or services at marginal cost. In a competitive market, firms will produce up to the point where marginal cost equals marginal revenue and price equals marginal cost. This outcome is known as allocative efficiency because resources are allocated in a way that maximizes total surplus for all parties. 

Under a monopoly, the firm has significant market power and faces a downward-sloping demand curve. The monopolist can increase its profits by restricting output and raising prices above marginal cost. At the profit-maximizing quantity, marginal revenue will equal marginal cost but price will exceed marginal cost. This outcome is inefficient because there are gains from trade that go unrealized - the wedge between price and marginal cost represents lost surplus for consumers.

The size of this wedge depends on several factors. In a partial equilibrium setting, it depends on the price elasticity of demand. When demand is relatively inelastic, the monopolist can raise prices substantially above marginal cost without seeing a large drop in sales. The less elastic the demand, the greater the difference between price and marginal cost. The wedge also depends on the level of fixed costs. With high fixed costs, the monopolist must charge higher prices to break even, leading to a bigger gap between price and marginal cost.

In a general equilibrium setting, the size of the wedge depends on interactions with other markets. For example, if the monopolist's product is a key input for other industries, raising prices will have knock-on effects economy-wide, forcing those dependent firms to also raise prices. This can lead to higher inflation and a bigger wedge. The overall welfare loss depends on such general equilibrium effects.

Some examples that illustrate these concepts include pharmaceutical companies that hold patents on life-saving drugs, allowing them to charge very high markups over marginal cost. Natural monopolies like utilities also provide examples of large wedges, as they require high fixed costs and often face inelastic demand. The welfare loss from monopoly is a key reason why governments regulate utilities and limit the market power of firms in some sectors.

In summary, the presence of a monopoly leads to inefficient resource allocation because the monopolist distorts the price mechanism by setting price above marginal cost. The size of this wedge depends on several factors including the elasticity of demand, level of fixed costs, and general equilibrium effects. Government intervention is often required to reduce the inefficiencies of monopoly and promote a more equitable and Pareto optimal outcome.
