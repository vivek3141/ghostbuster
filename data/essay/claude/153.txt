There has been significant progress in recent decades in understanding the molecular mechanisms that determine cell fate specification in the pregastrulation embryo. Studies in model organisms such as Drosophila, Xenopus, zebrafish, and the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have revealed that cell fate determination relies on the precise regulation of gene expression. The expression of specific transcription factors, signaling pathways, and other key molecules are tightly regulated in space and time, leading to the differentiation of undifferentiated embryonic cells into cells of the mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm germ layers.

C. elegans provides an excellent model to study the molecular basis of cell fate specification in the early embryo. The C. elegans embryo contains only a few precursor cells that generate all postembryonic cells. The cell lineage is largely invariant between individuals, providing a simple blueprint to study cell fate determination. Powerful molecular tools including RNA interference allow for the systematic perturbation of gene function in the embryo. Embryogenesis in C. elegans is also very rapid, with cell fate decisions made within a few hours of fertilization, facilitating detailed analysis. 

Studies in C. elegans have identified key transcription factors, regulatory elements, and signaling pathways involved in cell fate determination. For example, the end-1 and end-3 transcription factors are required for endoderm development. The tbx-2 transcription factor determines the fate of mesodermal blastomeres. The Wnt/β-catenin asymmetry pathway generates differences between the anterior and posterior of the embryo that are required to specify ectoderm and endomesoderm. Mutations in these genes result in embryos lacking entire germ layers and tissues. 

C. elegans also provides temporal resolution to study the order of molecular events in cell fate determination. For instance, Wnt/β-catenin signaling occurs before and is required for the asymmetric expression of end-1/end-3. end-1/end-3 expression then induces downstream targets that execute the endoderm fate. Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, it is possible to visualize the dynamics of these molecular determinants in living embryos with single-cell resolution. Mathematical modeling and computational analysis of these dynamics have provided insights into the robustness and logic underlying cell fate decisions.

In summary, significant progress has been made in understanding how transcription factors, signaling pathways, and other molecules specify cell fates in the early embryo before gastrulation. The free-living nematode C. elegans provides a powerful model to study these molecular mechanisms systematically owing to its simple and well-characterized embryogenesis, genetic tractability, and live imaging capabilities. Continued research in C. elegans and other model organisms promises to yield a comprehensive picture of how the precise regulation of gene expression in space and time determines cell identity in embryonic development.
