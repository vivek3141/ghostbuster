Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit begins with a lengthy introduction that outlines his philosophical project and addresses several issues, including the challenge of skepticism. Hegel sees skepticism as posing a serious threat to obtaining secure knowledge, as the skeptic argues we cannot know whether our beliefs actually correspond to reality. In the introduction, Hegel lays out his methodological approach to overcoming skepticism and establishing an epistemologically secure philosophical system. 

To begin, Hegel acknowledges that any pursuit of knowledge must start from a position of not having knowledge - otherwise, there would be no need to embark on the pursuit. This fact seems to lend credence to the skeptic's argument. However, Hegel argues that “pure knowing” without content is itself empty and meaningless. All knowledge must have some object of knowledge, some content or concept that we are knowing about. The skeptic's claim to know that we cannot know anything is itself contradictory and absurd. This argument helps Hegel avoid falling into the pitfall of absolute skepticism.

Having avoided absolute skepticism, Hegel turns to addressing more moderate forms of skepticism that accept we can have knowledge of appearances or representations, but deny we can know reality itself. Hegel argues that the distinction between appearance and reality is itself suspect, as we have no access to a “reality” outside of or beyond appearances. All we have are appearances, and we cannot presume there is some true reality “behind” them that we cannot grasp. Hegel writes, “The true shape in which truth exists can only be the scientific system of such truth.” By “scientific system,” Hegel means a systematic ordering and relating of concepts and categories of thought. Such a system does not get us outside of thought to an ultimate reality, but organizes thought itself.

Hegel’s methodological approach to overcoming skepticism and establishing knowledge follows from this argument. His method is not to ground all knowledge in some unquestionable first principle or in sense data, but to organize knowledge through a rational system of thought that incorporates and explains all appearances, experiences, and concepts. His system is epistemologically secure because it makes no appeal to anything outside of or beyond thought itself. The standards for assessing knowledge are immanently derived from the coherence, comprehensiveness, and rationality of the system itself.

In conclusion, Hegel aims to overcome skepticism and ensure secure knowledge through a methodological approach of constructing a rational system of thought that provides a comprehensive conceptual framework for explaining knowledge, experience, and reality as a whole. By grounding truth in "the scientific system of truth" rather than in an unknowable reality beyond thought, Hegel believes he can achieve epistemological certainty without falling prey to the threats of skepticism. His Phenomenology of Spirit thus aims to demonstrate how such a systematic science of knowledge can be developed.
