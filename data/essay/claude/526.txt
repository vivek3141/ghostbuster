The Philips Curve represents the trade-off between inflation and unemployment in an economy. It suggests that lower unemployment can be achieved by increasing aggregate demand, but this often leads to higher inflation. Conversely, lower inflation can be achieved at the cost of higher unemployment. This inverse relationship has implications for macroeconomic policymaking. 

In the postwar era, the Philips Curve held true for many economies like the UK and US. Policymakers aimed to balance the twin evils of inflation and unemployment, with an optimal balance in the 1960s with low inflation and unemployment. However, in the 1970s stagflation hit - the simultaneous rise of inflation and unemployment - breaking down the traditional Philips Curve trade-off. Supply shocks from oil crises led to cost-push inflation, even as unemployment rose due to weak aggregate demand. 

Today, the Philips Curve relationship is more complex. In the UK, inflation has been stable around the 2% target since the 1990s but unemployment has fluctuated. Low and stable inflation was achieved through operational independence of the Bank of England, allowing it to curb price pressures with interest rate changes before inflationary expectations became entrenched. However, the UK saw unemployment fall to historic lows in the 2000s without much inflation, suggesting the curve had shifted outwards. 

In the US, the relationship also seems to have weakened. Inflation has remained low while unemployment reached 50-year lows before the COVID-19 crisis. However, some argue that 4-6% unemployment in the US may now represent 'full employment' where further falls start to generate wage and price pressures. If true, the Philips Curve still holds but the parameters have changed.  

Overall, the traditional inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment posited by the Philips Curve still holds true in the long run for most economies. However, the short-term trade-off is more complex, and the curve itself shifts over time with changes in expectations, policies and supply conditions. Policymakers still grapple with balancing inflation and employment, but now have more tools to achieve stable prices without destabilizing real economic activity. The implications are that policymaking has become more nuanced, but no less challenging.
