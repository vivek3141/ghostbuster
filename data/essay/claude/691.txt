The urban riots that erupted in Britain during the 1980s had deep roots in the postwar social, political, and economic conditions in the country. Broad structural changes in British society since the Second World War created deep tensions and inequalities that boiled over during the 1980s. The decline of manufacturing jobs, slowing economic growth, reductions in welfare benefits, rising unemployment, and the concentration of poverty in urban areas created a precarious situation for the British working class. At the same time, rising rates of immigration and the persistence of racial prejudices led to social and economic marginalization of Britain's minority communities. 

 The precarious conditions of the British working class during the 1980s can be understood through the concept of the "moral economy." According to historian E.P. Thompson, the moral economy refers to the expectations that crowds hold about the responsibilities of authorities and about the distribution of key resources. The moral economy relies on a sense of economic justice and fairness. For working-class communities in 1980s Britain, the moral economy had been severely disrupted. Government policies had made it increasingly difficult for families to earn a living, receive public assistance, and meet basic needs. This violated the moral economy and created anger toward the Thatcher government.

The short-term triggers for the riots were specific incidents of aggressive policing in minority neighborhoods. However, the broader causes of unrest were the racial tensions and social marginalization faced by Britain's minority communities. Discrimination in employment and housing was widespread, and racial prejudices were common in British society. Minority communities were also frequently the target of aggressive policing tactics. The St. Pauls riot in Bristol in 1980 and the Brixton riot in London in 1981 were direct responses to police raids and crackdowns in predominantly Afro-Caribbean neighborhoods.                

The government, media, and police responded to the riots in ways that reflected their ideological views and exposed the racial and class prejudices in British society. The Thatcher government blamed the unrest on lawlessness and a "general moral decline," refusing to acknowledge the role of social conditions and economic issues. The media frequently used racist language and stereotypes in their coverage of the riots, especially those in predominantly minority areas. The aggressive policing tactics that often triggered the riots also reflected the prejudices of the police, who disproportionately targeted minority groups.

In summary, the British urban riots of the 1980s were the product of worsening social, political and economic conditions that had been building since the postwar period. The decline of manufacturing, rise of unemployment, reduction of welfare benefits, and concentration of poverty in urban areas violated the moral economy of the British working class. For minority groups, racial prejudices, discrimination, police harassment, and social marginalization contributed to unrest. The government, media, and police responses exposed their ideological perspectives and tendency to blame unrest on moral decline rather than address legitimate grievances. The riots represented a form of collective political expression for communities whose voices were going unheard.
