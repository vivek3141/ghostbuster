The analysis of infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra as well as thin layer chromatography plates enable chemists to determine if a chemical synthesis reaction has been successful or not. Each of these techniques provides information about different characteristics of the target product to assess its successful creation.

Infrared or IR spectroscopy measures the absorption of infrared light by the chemical bonds in a molecule to detect their stretching and bending. The spectrum produced shows peaks at precise frequencies that are characteristic of the molecular bonds present in the sample. A comparison of the IR spectra of the reactants and the final product can confirm that the synthesis reaction has proceeded as intended. The appearance of new peaks corresponding to the desired product and the absence of peaks corresponding to the starting materials indicate the complete conversion of the reactants into the target compound. Any significant deviation from the expected spectra suggests that impurities or side products have formed and that the reaction was not completely successful.

Nuclear magnetic resonance or NMR spectroscopy exploits the magnetic properties of specific nuclei in molecules. It can determine the number and type of different hydrogen or carbon atoms in an organic compound. The number, location, and environment of these atoms can be used to deduce the molecular structure of the product. A properly synthesized compound will yield an NMR spectrum that matches the predicted structure of the product. Any inconsistencies like extra peaks, missing peaks, or peaks at the wrong chemical shift indicate that the desired product was not obtained. 

Finally, thin layer chromatography or TLC allows the separation and qualitative analysis of compounds based on their polarity and binding affinity. Different substances will have different retention factors and migrate to different points on the TLC plate. By comparing the TLC results of the reaction mixture to those of known standards, the number of products and their approximate concentrations can be determined. A single spot at the same retention factor as the expected product signifies a successful synthesis reaction with a high purity and yield. Multiple spots or spots at different retention factors suggest unwanted side products have formed.

In conclusion, a combination of IR, NMR, and TLC analyses provide a wealth of data to evaluate the success of a chemical synthesis reaction. Matching results between the experimental and expected spectra and TLC profiles signify that the desired product was obtained with high purity. Deviations from the anticipated results imply that side reactions occurred or the mechanism did not proceed as predicted, indicating an unsuccessful synthesis. Overall, these techniques are invaluable tools for assessing the outcome of organic synthesis reactions.
