My experiences observing and teaching at King Henry VIII School in Coventry, UK over the past month have been highly insightful and formative in developing my understanding of effective teaching practices. During my time at the school, I was able to observe experienced mathematics teachers across different year levels, and teach two lessons myself: a probability lesson to Year 8 students and an investigation lesson to Year 10 students.  

The Year 8 probability lesson focused on introducing the basic concepts of probability, including theoretical and experimental probability, sample spaces, and probability trees. I structured the lesson to actively engage students through real-world examples and interactive tasks. For instance, to introduce theoretical probability, I had students determine the probability of rolling certain numbers on a six-sided die. We then moved on to experimental probability, with students designing and conducting an experiment using the dice to empirically determine the probabilities. Using interactive web-based simulations and physical manipulatives like dice, cards and spinners brought the probabilities to life for the students.  

A key challenge I faced in this lesson was differentiating for students with a range of abilities and learning needs. The class contained students working above and below the expected level for their year, as well as students with special learning needs. To differentiate, I provided extra guidance and scaffolding for students who needed more support, gave more challenging extensions for advanced students, and tailored the pacing and level of questioning for different ability groups. For example, students who grasped the initial concepts quickly were given the challenge of determining probabilities for rolling multiple dice, while students who needed more guidance worked through additional examples with me.

The Year 10 investigation lesson required students to apply their knowledge of geometry, algebra and statistics to determine the most efficient way to fence off a section of land. Working in groups, students needed to consider the costs of different fencing materials, determine the perimeter and area of different shapes that could enclose the land, and evaluate the options to find the most cost-effective solution.   

This open-ended task presented opportunities for differentiation through the level of guidance and scaffolding provided to each group. Higher-ability groups were given minimal input so they could explore more complex solutions, while groups needing more support were guided through the initial stages of the investigation with targeted questioning to help them identify variables and strategies to try. A key challenge was facilitating the progress of all groups given their diverse abilities and paces of working. By regularly checking in on each group’s progress and providing tailored guidance, I was able to support each group’s learning according to their needs.

Through these teaching experiences, I gained valuable insight into strategies for engaging students, managing a classroom, differentiating for diverse learners, and facilitating rich learning opportunities. The skilled teachers I observed employed similar strategies, demonstrating their efficacy. While teaching presents many challenges, particularly in catering for students with a range of abilities and needs, it is an immensely rewarding experience to guide students in their learning and growth. My time at King Henry VIII School has reinforced my goal of becoming an effective mathematics teacher who provides tailored support and challenging opportunities for all students to thrive.
