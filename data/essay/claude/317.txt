The Law of One Price (LOOP) and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) are two prominent theories in international economics that explain the relationship between exchange rates and price levels across countries. The LOOP posits that the price of a homogenous good should be the same in two countries once the exchange rate is taken into account. In other words, the LOOP suggests that any differences in the domestic currency prices of comparable goods should be offset by a proportional change in the nominal exchange rate.  PPP extends the LOOP to cover the baskets of goods by arguing that the exchange rate between two countries should adjust to equate the price levels of broad baskets of goods and services.

However, there are several issues with these theories in fully explaining exchange rate movements. First, the assumptions behind the LOOP and PPP are quite stringent. They require goods to be homogeneous, markets to be frictionless with free flow of goods and capital, and competitive conditions. In reality, goods are often differentiated, transportation costs and trade barriers exist, and there are elements of market power. These factors prevent perfect arbitrage and price equalization, violating the LOOP. 

Second, price stickiness poses another challenge. Domestic prices do not instantaneously adjust to exchange rate changes as assumed in the LOOP and PPP. This means purchasing power can deviate from parity for a significant period of time, and exchange rates can be misaligned relative to the PPP benchmark. Third, the composition of price indices used in the PPP analysis can differ substantially across countries and may not be representative of a country’s overall price level. This also contributes to deviations from PPP.

The implications are that the LOOP and PPP should not be expected to hold in the short run as exchange rates are also determined by factors other than price levels, such as interest rates, income, speculation, and capital flows. However, because price levels are ultimately constrained by economic forces in the long run, PPP could act as a benchmark for assessing if exchange rates are in equilibrium and exchange rate misalignment. When combined with monetary theories like the Monetary Approach to Exchange Rates, PPP suggests that a country with a relatively high inflation rate should see its currency depreciate against other currencies over time.

PPP also allows for the calculation of real exchange rates (RERs) by adjusting nominal exchange rates for relative price levels between countries. The RER measures the relative purchasing power of countries and is important for assessing international competitiveness. A high RER means a country’s goods and services are more expensive relative to other nations, which may lead to falling exports and a widening current account deficit over time. Policymakers thus often aim for a stable and competitive RER conducive to export promotion and economic growth.

In summary, while the LOOP and PPP hypotheses provide useful theoretical frameworks for understanding exchange rate determination in the long run and calculating real exchange rates, there are several reasons why they do not reliably hold or translate into an exact one-to-one short-run relationship. Exchange rates are also influenced by many other factors in open economies and global markets. Still, these theories remain cornerstones of open macroeconomic analysis of exchange rates and international price competitiveness.
