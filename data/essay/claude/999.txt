Pattern grammar refers to the study of the frequent and systematic occurrences of lexical, grammatical, semantic, and discursive patterns in language. Corpus linguistics, the analysis of large collections of authentic language data, provides powerful tools for identifying and theorizing about these patterns. By examining historical corpora, we now understand that language is highly “phraseological”—that is, structured around the usage of common patterns, from lexical bundles to idioms to collocations. This recognition poses challenges for fields like lexicography, education, and psycholinguistics, which have traditionally focused on individual words and rules. 

The analysis of historical corpora has revealed that language change is often a result of the rise and spread of patterns. For example, the increasing use of the progressive in 19th century English was linked to the spread of “be + -ing” as a common pattern in various constructions. Lexical changes are also linked to patterns, as certain word combinations become more frequent and new meanings emerge from those combinations. Language is not composed of discrete words combined through open choice and governed by strict rules; rather, it relies heavily on the use of prefabricated patterns and idioms that provide efficiency, cohesion, and cultural expression.

The open choice principle suggests that language users have a vast array of options to choose from when constructing an utterance, but corpus analysis shows this is an illusion. In reality, language production and comprehension rely strongly on the activation and stringing together of ready-made patterns, as per the idiom principle. While speakers feel they are choosing words freely, their choices are strongly influenced by entrenched, conventionalized patterns in the language. These principles contribute to our understanding of how meaning arises from the relationship between words in recurrent patterns, not just from the meanings of individual words. 

Defining and predicting the relationship between patterns and meaning is extremely difficult, however. Patterns interact with context in complex ways, and a single pattern may have a range of sometimes contradictory meanings, or shades of meaning, depending on the context. The meaning and function of a pattern also depends on its relationship to, and interaction with, other patterns used in the same context. And as patterns spread through a community of speakers, their meanings often gradually shift and diversify. The relationship between patterns and meaning is therefore dynamic, complex, and challenging to pin down with certainty. But recognizing the fundamental role of pattern grammar helps us better understand meaning as something that emerges from linguistic patterns and how they are woven together in context.
