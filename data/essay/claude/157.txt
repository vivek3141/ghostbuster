The Dutch Republic and Industrial Britain experienced economic growth during the 17th to 19th centuries that exhibited some characteristics of modern economic growth as defined by economist Simon Kuznets. However, there were also important differences in the nature and extent of their economic transformations. 

Kuznets defined modern economic growth as a long-term rise in per capita income and productivity, growth of markets and specialization, and a transition from agricultural to industrial societies. The Dutch Republic experienced sustained economic expansion and rising standards of living from the late 1500s through much of the 17th century, driven by its dominance in global trade and finance as well as greater specialization and market integration in some sectors. However, the majority of the Dutch population remained rural and in agriculture. In contrast, Britain's Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s and 1800s produced more rapid and widespread structural changes, with a massive movement of labor from agriculture to industry and the growth of new manufacturing technologies, transportation systems, and industrial centers.

A key strength of the Dutch economy was its prosperous maritime trade, which provided capital for investments in other sectors and contributed to a rising standard of living. The Dutch dominated global shipping and commodity trade for much of the 1600s. They had trading outposts around the world and a large merchant fleet. Trade promoted the accumulation of capital among merchants and financiers. It also spurred growth in shipbuilding, port activities, and warehousing. However, the Dutch economy remained heavily dependent on global trade, and when competition from Britain and France intensified in the 1700s, Dutch trade and wealth declined.

In Britain, the transition to mechanized factory production and the steam engine revolutionized manufacturing in industries like textiles, iron, and coal. This drove the growth of new industrial cities and a massive reallocation of labor. Agriculture employed about 75% of the British workforce in 1700 but just 22% by 1851. Productivity rose sharply in both agriculture and manufacturing. Transportation improved with canal and railway systems to distribute goods. An additional strength of the British industrial economy was its relative openness to technical and social innovations. 

However, the Dutch Republic had a strong institutional framework to support commerce, with a stock exchange, modern financial instruments, and an accessible system of commercial law. The Dutch also had a relatively high degree of religious and intellectual tolerance, though political power was concentrated among the wealthy merchant class. The British system was more rigidly hierarchical and aristocratic. The economic changes came with social upheaval, poor living conditions for workers, and air and water pollution in industrial areas.

In conclusion, while the Netherlands achieved substantial economic growth and rising standards of living between 1500 and 1700, Britain's Industrial Revolution produced a faster and more sweeping transition to a modern industrial society in the late 1700s and early 1800s. The Dutch were pioneers in global trade, finance, and proto-industrialization, but their economy remained more commercial than industrial and the majority of people continued to farm. Britain forged a model of industrial capitalism that reshaped work, transportation, and daily life, though it also introduced new forms of squalor and inequality. On balance, Britain emerged as the first nation to develop a truly modern and industrialized economy.
