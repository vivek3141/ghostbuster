Societal attitudes and a multitude of factors influenced the dietary patterns of poor households in the nineteenth century. At the time, the diets of the poor were typically characterized by cheap staples like bread, potatoes, and porridge. Meat, fish, fresh fruits and vegetables were luxuries rarely enjoyed by the impoverished. Several factors shaped these limited diets.

First, poverty itself was a major determinant of diet. The poor simply could not afford more nutritious and diverse foods. Their limited incomes were primarily spent on basic staples to stave off hunger. There was little left for “luxury” items. Additionally, food preservation techniques were limited, making many foods perishable and seasonal. The poor were stuck eating what was cheaply and locally available, often grains, root vegetables, and little else.

Second, there were misguided beliefs about nutrition that influenced attitudes. Many thought the poor were destined to eat simple diets, and that richer foods might be unhealthy or gluttonous for their constitution. There were also incorrect beliefs that certain foods like potatoes, bread, or porridge were sufficiently nutritious on their own. These attitues justified and reinforced the limited diets of the poor.

Technological innovation, scientific progress, and social change in the early 20th century led to gradual improvements in diet. Advancements like canning, refrigeration, and rail transport made more foods available year-round and lowered costs. New scientific findings revealed the importance of protein, calories, vitamins, and minerals in the diet. As the public understood nutrition better, there was more effort to provide the poor with more varied and nutritious foods.

Government policies and programs also slowly improved the diets of the poor in the early 20th century. School meal programs provided children with balanced meals. Importantly, World War II drove further government intervention to improve nutrition. With many men enlisting in the military, the government worked to ensure that people on the home front were well fed and fit to contribute to the war effort. Rationing, nutrition standards, and subsidies were put in place to promote balanced diets . After the war, these interventions and innovations drove continued improvement in nutrition.

Mass media, public health campaigns, and community health programs helped educate the public on nutrition, influencing attitudes that better diets were important for all, including the poor. Over time, social views evolved to see diet as a matter of public health and equality, rather than individual moral character. Gradually, there grew an expectation that in an affluent society, even the poor deserved access to nutritious affordable food.

In conclusion, many societal factors shaped the diets of the poor in the 19th and early 20th century, including poverty itself, limited technology and science, misguided attitudes, and minimal government intervention. But over decades, new infrastructure, scientific discoveries, social change, policy shifts, and education programs improved access to better nutrition for all. By the mid-20th century, views and factors were aligning to make improved diet a matter of health, equality and social justice.
