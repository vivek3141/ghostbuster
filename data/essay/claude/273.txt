The Treaty of Rome in 1957 established the European Economic Community (EEC), which later became the European Union (EU). The key aim of the EEC was to create a single market within Europe that would allow for the free movement of goods, services, capital, and labor. The objectives and mechanisms that were put in place to achieve this single market have had a profound impact on European trade and integration. 

The primary objective of the Treaty of Rome was to increase economic integration and cooperation among member states, especially in the areas of trade and commerce. By dismantling barriers to trade and opening borders, the EEC sought to promote increased exchange of goods and services. The mechanisms used to achieve this included the removal of tariffs and quotas on trade between member states, allowing for duty-free transport of goods across borders. This created a much larger market for European companies and increased economic efficiency.

A related objective was to stimulate economic growth within the EEC region. By expanding the size of potential markets for member state economies, the single market was meant to encourage greater production, investment, and innovation. The mechanisms for achieving this included not just the removal of trade barriers but also the harmonization of technical standards and regulations across countries. Common standards allowed companies to achieve economies of scale and streamlined the flow of trade across borders.

Another key objective was to enhance competition within the EEC. By opening national markets to competitors from other member states, monopolies and concentrated industries would face more competition, which in turn would benefit consumers through lower prices and more choice. Rules around competition policy and antitrust were established to prevent abuse of market power.

Finally, the Treaty aimed to strengthen economic integration and interdependence among member states. By merging national markets into a single market, the economies and industries of member states would become more integrated and interdependent over time. This integration and interdependence were seen as ways to promote cooperation and reduce conflict among European countries. 

In conclusion, the main objectives of the single market established by the Treaty of Rome were to increase trade, stimulate economic growth, enhance competition, and deepen economic integration among member states. The removal of trade barriers, harmonization of laws and standards, common competition policy, and free movement of goods and services were the primary mechanisms used to achieve these objectives. The single market has been largely successful in meeting its aims and has shaped the future of economic and political cooperation in Europe.
