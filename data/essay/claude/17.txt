There was a significant gap between the theory and practice of the social position of women in early modern England. In theory, concepts of patriarchy, coverture, and the household economy positioned women as subordinate to men within the family and constrained their legal and economic rights. However, in practice, many women found ways to exert various kinds of agency and power. The gap between theory and practice existed for several reasons: the inherent inconsistencies in patriarchal ideology, the pragmatic needs of households and economies that gave women roles and responsibilities, and the active resistance of some women to their theoretical subordination. 

The patriarchal theory of the early modern period held that women were weaker, irrational, and naturally subordinate to men. However, this theory contradicted the lived experiences of many women. Women played vital economic roles, managed complex households, raised children, and even pursued their own business interestsâ€”all of which required intelligence, hard work, and leadership. The patriarchal ideal did not match the skills and competence that many women demonstrated in their daily lives.    

The legal theory of coverture held that women's legal identity was "covered" by their husbands upon marriage. In practice, however, coverture did not erase married women's property ownership, economic activity, and legal agency. Married women retained their maiden names in business, managed property in their own names, and initiated lawsuits on their own behalf. Widows and unmarried women also operated largely outside the restrictions of coverture. The law aimed for women's legal invisibility but could not overcome women's actual property holdings, social standing, and economic participation.

The theory of the household economy held that the family functioned as an interdependent unit with the male head of household earning, controlling, and distributing resources. In practice, many women participated actively in household economies through market trading, craft production, and estate management. As deputies for men, some women gained significant management experience and economic authority. Households depended greatly on women's labor and skill, empowering women in ways that contradicted the theory of strict patriarchal control.

Some early modern women also actively resisted their theoretical subordination through challenges to patriarchal authority, coverture restrictions, and limited household roles. Outspoken women in the English Civil War period defended women's intellectual equality, natural rights, and moral authority. Some women pursued separations, divorces, and annulments in defiance of patriarchal marriage. A few women lived openly lesbian lifestyles that flouted expectations of women's sexual and domestic subservience to men.  

In conclusion, the gap between theory and practice in women's social position stemmed from the unavoidable contradictions between ideological ideals and lived experiences in patriarchal society. The demands of the household economy and the determination of enterprising women to gain more influence and independence also undermined the neat categorizations of patriarchal theory. While women faced enormous constraints, the disjuncture between theory and practice afforded them avenues to exercise agency, cultivate authority, and shape their lives in early modern England. Overall, the complex realities of women's lives defied the simplistic theoretical constructs that aimed to keep women subordinate.
