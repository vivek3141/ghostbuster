Tort law covers several important areas of civil law regarding harms and injuries. Three central areas of tort law are negligence, strict liability, and intentional torts. Within each area, the law aims to determine whether one party should be held legally responsible for damages caused to another party. However, tort law faces several challenges in promoting efficiency and coherence due to inconsistencies across jurisdictions and unclear standards of liability.  

In negligence claims, tort law evaluates whether one party failed to exercise a reasonable standard of care and caution to avoid causing harm to another. The core question is whether the action or inaction of the alleged tortfeasor falls below the standard of a “reasonably prudent person” in that situation. Negligence law seeks to hold people liable for a lack of due care that causes injury, but it faces challenges in consistently and coherently applying the vague “reasonable person” standard across diverse circumstances. Juries are tasked with determining liability based on a fuzzy standard, leading to inconsistent outcomes.

Strict liability in torts holds parties liable for harms caused by inherently dangerous activities, even when reasonable care is exercised. For example, the use or handling of explosives may trigger strict liability. Because liability does not depend on proving negligence, strict liability aims to incentive utmost caution for dangerous activities and ensure that victims can recover damages. However, determining what constitutes an “inherently dangerous” activity that warrants strict liability is an ambiguous standard that varies significantly across jurisdictions. 

Intentional torts refer to harms purposefully caused through acts such as assault, battery, trespass, and fraud. In these cases, the intent to cause harm establishes liability, though the victim must still prove damages. Intentional tort law deters malicious behavior, but faces challenges such as unclear standards for consent and inadvertent causation of harm through a deliberate act.

In summary, tort law encompasses negligence, strict liability, and intentional torts—each addressing an important domain of harm and responsibility but facing issues with coherence and consistency. To improve tort law, jurisdictions could work to harmonize standards of liability, clarify ambiguous concepts like “reasonable care” and “inherently dangerous activities,” and pass legislation to address new types of harms. While perfect consistency may be impossible, reducing major discrepancies across jurisdictions and providing clearer guidance could make the U.S. tort system fairer and more efficient. Overall, tort law aims to determine responsibility for civil wrongs, but could better achieve its goals through focused legal reforms.
