The proposed new offence of corporate manslaughter, also known as corporate killing, aims to establish criminal liability for organizations when there are gross failures in the management of health and safety that lead to fatal accidents. Under the current law, it is difficult to prosecute organizations for manslaughter as the "identification doctrine" requires prosecutors to prove that a "controlling mind" of senior individuals were grossly negligent. The new offence of corporate killing removes this requirement and enables organizations as a whole to be prosecuted for management failures.

In the case of Vince's death after falling from scaffolding, the organization BloggsBuild Limited could potentially be prosecuted for corporate killing if there were gross breaches of health and safety regulations. Individuals would not necessarily need to be identified as culpable and could avoid prosecution. The new offence therefore strengthens the accountability of organizations for major incidents involving fatalities by making it easier to prosecute them. Rather than needing to prove the guilt of specific controlling minds, the prosecution would only need to show that there were serious management failures within the organization that caused the death.

However, some argue that removing the requirement to identify culpable individuals could undermine personal responsibility and fail to achieve meaningful accountability. Although organizations may face major fines, individual managers and directors might escape sanctions and continue unsafe practices. The offence may also primarily punish shareholders by reducing profits rather than meaningfully reforming negligent management. There is a risk that organizations may treat fines as a "cost of doing business" rather than spurring them to systematically improve health and safety practices. 

To address these limitations, the new offence needs to be accompanied by a wider set of legislative changes and enforcement mechanisms. Large fines need to be combined with remedial orders requiring organizations to reform health and safety management and report regularly to external monitors. Prosecution of individuals should still be pursued where possible based on evidence of serious personal failings. Directors should also face disqualification for proven neglect of their health and safety responsibilities. These additional measures are necessary to ensure that the offence of corporate killing achieves real changes in organizational culture and deters irresponsible management.

In conclusion, the proposed offence of corporate killing is a step towards stronger accountability for organizational failures that cost lives. However, its effectiveness relies on it being part of a wider, integrated strategy for health and safety enforcement. Major incidents must lead not only to fines but also mandatory improvement programs, individual sanctions where warranted, and potentially the removal of directors who preside over gross management negligence. Corporate killing legislation needs to spur comprehensive reforms, not treat avoidable deaths as a cost that can simply be mitigated through financial penalties alone. With the right supporting framework, this new offence can be a pivotal tool for regulators in promoting safer organizational practices.
