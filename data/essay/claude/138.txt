Free indirect discourse is a literary technique where the narrative voice adopts the thoughts or speech patterns of a character without attribution. In other words, the third person narrator conveys the subjectivity of a character through their tone and voice while not explicitly stating that the words or thoughts belong to the character. This allows the narrative to shift between an objective, omniscient voice and the subjective perspective of the characters. 

Gustave Flaubert employs free indirect discourse throughout his novel Madame Bovary to provide insights into the inner thoughts and emotions of his characters, particularly Emma Bovary. While much of the novel is told through an ostensibly objective third person narrator, Flaubert frequently shifts into Emma's perspective through free indirect discourse. For example, early in the novel when Emma's daughter Berthe is born, the narrator says, "A girl, as expected. The father's disappointment was hardly disguised." Although this seems like the narrator's objective observation, the mention of "the father's disappointment" subtly shifts to Emma's perspective, as only she would know of her husband Charles's disappointment at not having a son.

Later, when Emma begins her affair with Rodolphe, Flaubert uses free indirect discourse to convey Emma's whirlwind of emotions. The narrator states, "He played it amazingly well. To listen to other men, gracious though they are, was nothing compared to it. His voice went through her flesh like a caress." Although this description is not explicitly attributed to Emma's thoughts, the highly subjective and sensory language, especially the simile comparing Rodolphe's voice to a caress, reflects Emma's point of view and emotions rather than the narrator's. The use of free indirect discourse here draws the reader into Emma's experience and her intoxication with her new lover.

Toward the end of the novel, Emma's thoughts become increasingly frantic and disjointed as she struggles with the consequences of her affairs and mounting debts. Flaubert adopts Emma's fragmented perspective through free indirect discourse, as in the following passage: "Death was a temptation. There was something beautiful about it, as if it crowned desire - or cut it short. The sun breaking through the trees dazzled her, and... She tried to think of something else while she walked quickly along the lane bordered by hedges." The choppy sentences and trailing off thoughts convey Emma's troubled state of mind, even as the passage maintains the pretense of an objective narrator.

Through his deft use of free indirect discourse, Flaubert is able to slip in and out of Emma Bovary's subjectivity, providing insight into her perspectives and emotions without explicitly stating that these are her thoughts. This technique, combined with Flaubert's meticulously crafted objective narrative voice, allows the reader to feel deeply connected to Emma's experience while also maintaining a distance afforded by the detached narrator. The result is a deeply moving yet carefully crafted glimpse into Emma's psyche.
