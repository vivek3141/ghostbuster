Associations are a key concept in Alexis de Tocqueville’s theory of democracy and American civil society. For Tocqueville, associations are voluntary organizations formed by individuals to pursue common interests or goals. They uphold the importance of the individual by providing outlets for people to freely express themselves and shape the groups they are a part of. However, associations also maintain a sense of cooperation and community by bringing people together around shared purposes. Overall, associations prevent alienation and tyranny in democracy by giving individuals opportunities to participate actively in society and shape their communities.

Tocqueville believed that associations are crucial for upholding the importance of individual freedom and self-government in democracies. Democracies aim to maximize individual liberty and equality, but taken to the extreme this could result in a form of “democratic despotism” where individuality is crushed under the will of the majority. However, associations provide spaces for individuals to freely express themselves and maintain their unique identities. As Tocqueville wrote, “Feelings and opinions are recruited, the heart is enlarged, and the human mind is developed by no other means than by the reciprocal influence of men upon each other.” Associations also allow individuals to exercise self-government by giving them opportunities to shape the rules and leadership of the groups they join. Overall, associations uphold the democratic values of individualism and liberty by giving people outlets to nurture their uniqueness, express themselves freely, and take an active role in shaping their communities.

While valuing individual freedom, associations also foster a sense of cooperation and shared purpose that binds democratic society together. Tocqueville feared that an extreme focus on individualism could breed indifference to the common good and alienate people from each other. However, by joining together in associations, individuals recognize their interdependence and forge meaningful connections. As Tocqueville wrote, “Feelings and opinions are recruited, the heart is enlarged, and the human mind is developed by no other means than by the reciprocal influence of men upon each other.” Participating in associations exposes people to new ideas and helps them see issues from multiple perspectives. This nurtures open-mindedness, empathy, and a commitment to finding common ground. Overall, associations promote the democratic values of equality, cooperation, and civic responsibility by bringing diverse individuals together around shared interests and forging social bonds based on mutual understanding.

Associations also prevent alienation and tyranny in democracies by giving citizens opportunities to actively participate in society and shape their communities. If individuals withdraw from public life and become apathetic or distrustful in their fellow citizens, this can breed alienation and make a society ripe for tyranny. However, by participating in associations, individuals engage with their communities and develop a sense of political efficacy. They see that through cooperation, they can shape the groups they inhabit and influence the world around them. Tocqueville believed that this spirit of participation and citizenship would translate to the broader political sphere, helping individuals see that self-government is possible. Overall, associations foster democratic participation and empower citizens by giving them opportunities to get involved in their communities, cooperate with others, and make their voices heard.

In sum, associations uphold the democratic values of individualism, community, and self-government. They give individuals spaces to express themselves freely while forging meaningful connections with others around shared purposes. By promoting participation, civic responsibility, and a spirit of empowerment, associations help prevent alienation and create a society where tyranny is hard to establish. For Tocqueville, associations represent the vibrancy of American civil society and democracy itself. Overall, they show how the values of liberty and equality can be combined to maximize both individual freedom and the common good.
