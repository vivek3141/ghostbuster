There are several factors, both internal and external, that have affected the slow progress of institutional economic cooperation in East Asia.  Realist approaches to international relations, vast economic disparities between countries, and underlying political tensions have all served as obstacles to greater regional cooperation. 

A realist perspective focuses on competition between self-interested nation-states and an inherent distrust in the intentions of other countries. This approach does not easily accommodate multinational cooperation or shared interests. Many East Asian countries adopted realist foreign policies for much of the 20th century, focusing on relative gains over other countries and distrusting regional cooperation. These attitudes have been hard to shake and have made meaningful cooperation difficult. Realism also suggests that countries will not cooperate unless there are clear benefits to their own nation, making cooperation on broader, regional interests challenging.

There are also vast economic disparities between East Asian countries that complicate cooperation. Wealthier countries like Japan and South Korea have little economic incentive to cooperate with less developed neighbors like Cambodia, Laos, or Myanmar. Poorer countries fear economic domination by the wealthier states. These disparities have made it difficult to find common ground or shared interests to build cooperation upon. There is a lack of political will for wealth redistribution or investment in less developed nations.

Underlying political tensions, prejudices, and historical animosities have also posed challenges. Regional rivalries, territorial disputes, and a lack of shared political values have fostered distrust. Countries like China, Japan, and South Korea, in particular, have long-standing political disagreements that fuel regional tensions. Nationalism in many East Asian states has focused on differences and rivalries rather than similarities and shared interests with neighbors.

To overcome these obstacles and promote regional economic cooperation, East Asian countries must shift perspectives and policies. Adopting more liberal approaches to international cooperation that focus on mutual benefits and shared interests can help reduce distrust and tensions. Making serious efforts to reduce economic disparities through trade agreements, investments, and aid can give countries more incentive to cooperate. And improving political relationships by resolving historic tensions and territorial disputes, as well as promoting cultural exchanges, can help foster a more cooperative atmosphere. Regional institutions should also be strengthened to facilitate increased economic cooperation over time. 

With changes in attitudes and policies, the obstacles posed by realism, economic disparities, and political tensions can be mitigated. But overcoming these factors will require political will and a long-term commitment to regional cooperation by East Asian countries. With time and consistent efforts, economic cooperation can be achieved.
