Chemimix Pty Ltd is facing rising demand for its general household cleaning products and is deciding how to best meet this increased demand and expand its production. There are a few options the firm is assessing, including: expanding its current facility and equipment, setting up a new production plant nearby using the same technology, building an entirely new modern facility utilizing updated technology, or outsourcing part of its production to a local contract manufacturer. 

After analyzing the options, the recommended path forward for Chemimix is to build a new modern production facility with updated technology. This option, while requiring the largest upfront capital investment, provides the greatest long-term benefits and opportunities for the company. By investing in a new facility, Chemimix can significantly increase its production capacity and efficiency, enabling it to meet rising demand and grow the business. Newer equipment and technology will allow more standardization and automation of the production process, reducing costs and improving quality over time. This will position Chemimix with a competitive advantage to gain more market share from its rivals.

In order to maximize the benefits of the new facility, Chemimix should implement a clear production schedule that details how the plant will reach and sustain peak operation. The schedule should specify key milestone targets for manufacturing and packaging its three main product lines in the new space. Responsibilities for all staff, from management to machine operators, should be clearly outlined with accountability and incentives tied to schedule adherence and performance. Strict quality controls with routine audits at each stage of production should also be included as the purpose of the new technology investment can be undermined by subpar process implementation or oversight. 

Some specific recommendations to include in the production schedule:   

1) Run an initial trial of the production and bottling equipment to ensure proper functionality before full operations commence. Adjust machinery settings or order replacements parts as needed.  

2) Ramp up production over a 6-12 month period to effectively train staff, optimize processes and equipment settings, and ensure quality standards are met at higher volumes. Start at 50-75% of maximum capacity and increase by 10% monthly.

3) Design the facility layout and material flows to minimize transfer distances between processes. This reduces time delays and maximizes output. Re-configure the layout as needed based on learnings from initial trials and ramp up. 

4) Institute a rigorous quality control audit schedule, especially when increasing to a new volume level. Address any issues immediately to prevent accumulation of defects.

5) Provide detailed standard operating procedures for each machine and process, including emergency stoppage protocols. Train all operators thoroughly with refresher training every six months.  

By following a well-designed production schedule for its new facility, Chemimix can achieve an efficient, high quality operation that will generate significant benefits and position the firm for substantial growth. The recommendations provided aim to assist Chemimix in developing a schedule that will optimize its investment in new technology and equipment, enabling increased market share and long-term success.
