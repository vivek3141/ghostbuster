In the Protagoras and Gorgias dialogues, Plato presents Socrates' contrasting accounts of pleasure and its relationship to the good life. In the Protagoras, Socrates argues that pleasure is the ultimate good that all knowledge and virtue aims at. However, in the Gorgias, Socrates rejects this hedonistic view and argues that pleasure and good are distinct. Through these contrasting accounts, Plato uses Socrates to show hedonism's allure and shortcomings, ultimately rejecting it in favor of an objective morality anchored in reason.

In the Protagoras, Socrates defends a hedonistic ethic where pleasure is the highest good. He argues that all human actions aim at pleasure, claiming, "both warlike mettle...and every action are undertaken on account of the pleasure that is obtained" (Protagoras, 351c). Actions are undertaken "because we are attracted by the pleasure, and we desert them because we experience pain" (351e). Virtue is extrinsic to pleasure, and its value lies only in its ability to bring pleasure. While Callicles rejects temperance and self-control as means to hedonistic ends, Socrates retains these virtues by arguing they lead to maximal pleasure when we consider both the present and long-term (356a). Hence, Socrates champions a refined hedonism where intellect guides us to the most pleasant life.

In contrast, in the Gorgias Socrates rejects this hedonistic view. He argues that good and pleasure are distinct, claiming, "The pleasant and the good...are not the same...for pleasure is always changeable, whereas the good is invariable" (Gorgias, 498e). Here Socrates sees pleasure as fleeting and unstable, subject to individual proclivities and circumstance, whereas the good is objective and eternal. The pleasant life, focused solely on gratifying desires, is condemned as slavish. Socrates argues, "No one who was not under the guidance of true education and reason rushes headlong into things that pleasure, fear or desire may impel him" (500e). Only reason can guide one to the good life. Virtue is not a means to pleasure but its source. Socrates distinguishes "true pleasure" from mere bodily pleasure, with true pleasure arising from the good, "the reality, reason, intelligence and virtue" (501d). The pleasant life devoid of virtue yields a "pleasure ruined (κατεαγότα) by its divorce from intelligence" (501e). Hence, in the Gorgias Socrates rejects hedonism for an objective morality found in reason and virtue. 

Through these contrasting accounts, Plato uses Socrates to show hedonism's initial allure but ultimate shortcomings. In the Protagoras, Socrates presents a refined hedonism that retains virtue, aligning pleasure and the good. But in the Gorgias, Socrates argues this view is untenable, as pleasure and the good prove distinct. Pleasure proves too ephemeral and circumstantial to ground morality. Only reason provides an objective standard.

The significance of Socrates' arguments is that Plato rejects hedonism in favor of an objective ethics. Plato sees the human relationship to pleasure as complex, acknowledging its role in everyday actions yet denying it is the final good. Humanity needs guidance from reason to resolve these tendencies and follow virtue. Hence, Plato presents Socrates' contrasting accounts of pleasure across dialogues to show hedonism's appeal and why it ultimately fails, defending an objective morality found in reason instead.
