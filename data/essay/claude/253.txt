The Roffey Bros. v Mott, Hall and Jackman Ltd [1991] case impacted the doctrine of consideration in English contract law by potentially broadening the scope of what constitutes valid consideration. While the ruling could be seen as causing further ambiguity or complexity, it also provides some clarity in a narrow set of circumstances where a pre-existing duty is involved.

The key issue in the Roffey Bros. case was whether the additional payments offered by the defendants to the claimants for satisfactory completion of work constituted valid consideration, given that the claimants were already obligated by an existing contract to complete the work. The court ruled that the additional payments did constitute valid consideration, even though the claimants were already bound by a pre-existing duty to fulfill the contract, because the payments were not a sham and represented a practical benefit to the claimants. 

This ruling could be seen as introducing ambiguity because it suggests that any benefit beyond what is formally bargained for in the original contract could constitute consideration. This broad definition could call into question whether a wide range of small additional benefits, favors or promises offered in relation to a contract actually represent enforceable consideration, threatening to render the doctrine meaningless. However, the ruling applies specifically to circumstances where a pre-existing contractual duty exists, so the potential ambiguity may be constrained.

The ruling could also be seen as providing clarity in circumstances involving pre-existing contractual duties. By focusing on whether the promise or benefit confers a practical benefit or advantage on the promisee, beyond what was originally bargained for, the court gave a workable definition for determining valid consideration in this narrow set of cases. While the original contract defines what the parties are legally bound to, the ruling suggests additional consideration exists where a new promise, benefit or advantage is meaningfully valuable to the promisee in a practical sense, incentivizing them to fulfill their existing obligations.  

In conclusion, while the Roffey Bros. case could be seen as problematically expanding the definition of consideration in English contract law or introducing ambiguity, it provides a pragmatic clarification for determining valid consideration specifically in cases involving pre-existing contractual duties. By requiring that a new promise, benefit or advantage represent a practical value or advantage to the promisee, beyond the original bargain, the ruling gives courts a reasonable basis to find valid consideration even where a party is already legally obligated to fulfill a prior contract. On balance, the Roffey Bros. case has had a positive impact by addressing a previously uncertain area of the doctrine of consideration.
