There are several policies used by governments to stabilize their economies during downturns or market failures. Three of the major policy tools are fiscal policy, monetary policy, and supply-side policies. Fiscal policy involves changing government spending or tax levels to impact aggregate demand in the economy. When the economy is weak, governments can increase spending or cut taxes to stimulate demand and spur economic growth. Conversely, when the economy is strong, they can slow growth by increasing taxes or decreasing spending. In the UK, the government increased spending in response to the 2008 global financial crisis, for example.

Monetary policy refers to actions taken by a nation's central bank to influence the amount of money and credit in circulation and interest rates. The Bank of England (BoE), the UK's central bank, can lower interest rates or increase money supply during an economic downturn to boost business and consumer spending. It can also raise interest rates during high inflation to help stabilize prices. The BoE slashed interest rates during the financial crisis and also engaged in quantitative easing to inject money supply.

Supply-side policies aim to improve the efficiency and flexibility of supply in an economy. Policies such as reducing regulation, privatization of government-owned enterprises, and tax reforms are designed to boost productivity and incentives for work and investment. The UK government has privatized many industries since the 1980s and cut both individual and corporate tax rates to support businesses and economic growth.  

In summary, the UK has actively employed fiscal, monetary, and supply-side policies over many decades to manage the macroeconomy during times of both weak and strong growth. Overall, policymakers have many tools at their disposal to help stabilize the British economy throughout economic upswings and downturns. The specific policies and actions taken depend on the underlying condition of the economy and constraint of policy limits at that point in time.
