In Edward Thomas's poem "The Long Small Room", the poet employs several linguistic techniques which help convey the themes of age and the passage of time. 

First, the repeated use of the long vowel sounds, especially the 'o' sound, help create a sense of lengthening and prolonging, mirroring the elongated room described in the title and the slow passing of time. For example, in the first stanza alone, we see "long", "old", "sloped", "stone", "fold", "small", "only", and "poets". The predominance of these long vowels gives the reader the impression of being slowly drawn out. Even the shape and structure of the poem on the page, with its long lines and lack of definite stanza form, contributes to this effect.

Second, the use of assonance, consonance and alliteration also help emphasize the themes of time and ageing. The repetition of the 's' sound in "long small" and "less lonely", or the 'l' sound in "long small" and "will lean" create a sense of prolonged musing. The alliteration in "bare brown" and "bent backs" also links time and the aging body. These repetitive aural effects cause the reader to move slowly through the poem, akin to the old poets in their "long small room".

Third, the use of listing and repetition highlights the unstoppable momentum of passing time. The "bare brown, bare white, bare grey" walls, the "bent backs and heads" of the old poets, the "dreams, stories, ciphers, riddles", all come together to represent the accumulation of years. The anaphora in "but not" - "But not for hours...But not" - also stresses what will eventually come to pass over time.  The imagery of "snow falling" and a "ripe apple falling" are muted but resonate, symbolizing the arrival of winter and the end of life's seasons.

Through creative use of long vowels, assonance, consonance, alliteration, listing and repetition, Thomas crafts a poetic reflection on time, ageing and mortality. The "long small room" becomes a metaphor for the finite space of life, yet also a shared space of memory, wisdom and art that can transcend time's passing. The old poets at their table appear in a liminal space, caught between the quickening nightfall outside and the dimming firelight within, representing the transient nature of life poised between the finite and infinite. Using poetic technique with a painterly eye, Thomas thus transforms a literal long small room into a portrait of human existence and a meditation on time's unceasing flow.
