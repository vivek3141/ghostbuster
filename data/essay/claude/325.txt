The rules of standing determine whether an individual is entitled to seek legal redress in the courts for a perceived wrong or harm. To have standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate that they have sufficient interest in and connection to the subject matter of the complaint. There are several criteria that must be met to establish standing:

1. The plaintiff must have suffered an injury or harm that is actual or imminent, not hypothetical. There must be a concrete detriment, not just an abstract interest in the issue. In James's case, the new planning policy will allegedly directly result in increased noise pollution, a fall in property value, and the lack of opportunity for prior consultation. If these harms can be demonstrated to be actual or highly likely, not just speculative, this would satisfy the injury requirement. 

2. The injury must be fairly traceable to the defendant's challenged behavior or conduct. There must be a causal connection between what the defendant did or failed to do and the harm experienced by the plaintiff. Here, James would need to show that the new planning policy directly resulted in the increased noise and loss in property value. If there are other contributing factors, his claim of standing may be weakened.

3. The injury must be redressable through court action. The court must be able to remedy the harm in some way through its decisions or orders. James would be seeking revocation or amendment of the new planning policy to address his grievances, so redressability would be satisfied.  

In addition to these constitutional standing requirements, many courts apply the concept of "special damage" for private individuals challenging public authority action. To have standing in these cases, the plaintiff must show damage that is different in kind from the general public. James's complaints about increased noise pollution and loss of property value could potentially qualify as special damage if these harms impact him in a more concentrated or severe way than most residents. If the new planning policy affects most people in a trivial or minor way, but has a more significant impact on James, this may be sufficient to constitute special damage.

With respect to the rights James seeks to protect, these would include his rights to procedural fairness in dealing with public authorities, enjoyment of private property, and protection of land ownership. James would argue that the implementation of the new planning policy without consultation violated principles of natural justice and open government. The increase in noise pollution and decrease in property value could be framed as interferences with his rights to use and enjoy his private property. Reform of the policy could be sought to uphold and reinforce these rights and principles.

In terms of legal avenues, James has several options to pursue. He could initiate judicial review proceedings to challenge the manner in which the planning policy was devised and adopted. Alternately, he could bring a private nuisance lawsuit against the relevant government department for the unreasonable noise and disturbance resulting from the policy change. He may also have a claim under property law for injurious affection if he can prove substantial loss in property value. Each option has challenges, such as proving sufficient standing, special damage, or negligence. But if James has evidence to support his grievances, judicial review and injurious affection appear to be the causes of action with the highest chance of success based on the facts provided.

In conclusion, standing is a key threshold issue that must be addressed before a plaintiff can proceed to seek a legal remedy. James would need to show his complaints about increased noise, loss in property value, and lack of consultation meet the tests for standing by pointing to actual or imminent harm, a causal link to the new planning policy, and possible redress through the court. If his damage can be characterized as "special" relative to the general public, his standing will be strengthened. By framing the issues around procedural rights and protection of property ownership, James can make a persuasive case, but still faces significant obstacles in overcoming procedural hurdles and achieving a favorable outcome. Overall, while standing appears to exist, success remains challenging given the nature of the claim.
