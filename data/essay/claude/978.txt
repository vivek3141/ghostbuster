Differential stains are staining techniques used to detect differences in the biochemical and structural properties of bacteria. They allow us to classify and identify bacteria based on these properties. The most common differential stains are the Gram stain, Acid-fast stain, spore stain, and capsule stain.  

The Gram stain is one of the most frequently used differential stains. It differentiates bacteria into Gram-positive and Gram-negative groups based on cell wall structure. Gram-positive cells have a thick layer of peptidoglycan in their cell walls which retains the primary stain crystal violet, appearing purple under the microscope. Gram-negative cells have a thinner peptidoglycan layer and an additional outer membrane, which prevents the retention of crystal violet. They appear pink or red after counterstaining with safranin. The Gram stain is a very useful first step in bacterial identification, though factors like age, washing, and poor fixing can impact its accuracy. 

The Acid-fast stain is used to differentiate Mycobacteria like M. tuberculosis which have waxy mycolic acid in their cell walls. They retain primary carbolfuchsin dye even when washed with acid-alcohol, appearing bright red. Non-acid-fast bacteria lose the primary stain and appear blue when counterstained. The acid-fast stain contains carbolfuchsin as the primary stain and methylene blue as the counterstain.

Bacterial spores can be detected using the spore stain. Spores have a protective coating that retains the primary malachite green stain. Bacterial cells remain unstained. Spores appear green, while the rest of the cell appears clear. The spore stain uses malachite green as the primary stain. The presence of spores within cells indicates the bacterial ability to form spores for survival.  

The capsule stain is used to assess if bacteria have a capsule layer outside their cell wall. The capsule allows bacteria to be more virulent by evading host defenses. In the capsule stain, the capsule retains a biological dye like India ink, Congo red or Anthony's stain and appears as a clear halo around the red or blue stained bacterial cell. The capsule stain is useful in identifying capsulated pathogenic bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae.

In summary, differential stains allow us to detect key structural and biochemical properties of bacteria for identification and classification. The Gram and Acid-fast stains differentiate based on cell wall structure. The spore and capsule stains detect the presence of spores and capsules, which provide survival advantages to certain bacteria. Differential staining is a fundamental technique in bacteriology.
