Infant and child mortality rates in India remain higher than in most other developing countries, despite progress made in recent decades. There are several socioeconomic, healthcare access, and environmental factors influencing these mortality rates that policy makers must address in order reduce them further. 

A key factor negatively impacting infant and child mortality in India is poverty and low levels of maternal education. Families living in poverty often cannot afford adequate nutrition, sanitation, and healthcare for infants and children, contributing to higher mortality risks. Maternal education is also strongly associated with child health outcomes, as more educated mothers are better equipped to provide essential care and seek out health services when needed. According to analyses of data from 520 districts in India, infant mortality rates were found to be significantly higher in poorer districts and those with lower rates of maternal literacy. To address this, policy interventions aimed at reducing poverty and improving education and empowerment of women would likely help lower mortality rates.

Lack of access to essential healthcare services is another contributor to high infant and child mortality in India. Many Indians live in rural areas far from health facilities and lack access to doctors, hospitals, and medicines. Data analyses show that infant and child mortality rates tend to be higher in rural districts in India that lack health infrastructure and where a lower percentage of births are attended by skilled healthcare workers. Increased investment in healthcare, with a focus on improving facilities, training more healthcare workers, and making services available and affordable in rural and remote areas, could help remedy this issue. 

Environmental factors like lack of access to clean water and sanitation also significantly impact infant and child health outcomes in India. Contaminated drinking water and poor sanitation facilitate the spread of diseases like diarrhea, malaria, and pneumoniaâ€”major causes of death for infants and children. Mortality rates tend to be higher in districts with lower access to improved water and sanitation. Policies and programs to expand access to clean water and improved sanitation and hygiene would help address these environmental health issues.

In summary, by addressing poverty and lack of maternal education, limited healthcare access, and poor environmental conditions like lack of access to clean water and sanitation that contribute to high infant and child mortality rates in India, policy makers can help achieve further reductions in mortality.  Cross-sectional data analyses provide insights into factors correlated with mortality rates across India's districts that can help shape actionable policies and targeted interventions to improve child health outcomes. With comprehensive action across these areas, India stands to reduce infant and child mortality and advance progress toward Sustainable Development Goals for health and well-being.
