The institution of marriage has gone through significant changes since 1979 in both legal and demographic terms. Legally, unmarried couples have gained many of the rights and benefits that were once reserved only for married couples, including inheritance, medical decision making, and tax benefits. Demographically, marriage rates have declined and cohabitation has become much more common. These trends have led some to question whether marriage still serves a useful purpose or has become obsolete. However, marriage continues to provide both legal and social benefits that unmarried relationships do not.  

Legally, the rights and benefits of marriage have been extended to unmarried couples through mechanisms like domestic partnerships, civil unions, and common law marriage. Unmarried couples can now gain rights like hospital visitation, inheritance, and tax benefits that were once limited to married spouses. However, marriage still provides certain legal protections that unmarried relationships do not. Spouses have automatic rights to inheritance, medical decision making, and insurance benefits that unmarried partners often have to take legal steps to put into place. Spouses also have certain protections in the event of divorce, like the equitable division of property, that unmarried couples do not have access to. So while legal remedies have been extended to unmarried couples, marriage remains the most comprehensive legal relationship status.

Demographically, marriage rates have declined significantly while cohabitation has become much more widespread. The number of unmarried couples living together has increased twelvefold since 1979. Some view these trends as evidence that marriage is outdated or less desirable than in the past. However, research shows that cohabiting relationships tend to be less stable and secure than marriages. Cohabiting couples have higher breakup rates, even when controlling for factors like education level or income. Marriages also continue to provide social benefits that cohabitation alone may not, such as signaling commitment to family and community. So while demographic changes show a move away from marriage, it still serves useful social purposes.

In conclusion, while legal rights have been extended to unmarried couples and marriage rates have declined, the institution of marriage still serves important purposes, both legally and socially. Legally, marriage provides the most comprehensive set of rights and protections for partners. Socially, marriage signals a level of commitment that cohabitation alone may not. For these reasons, marriage remains a relevant social institution, even considering the significant changes that have occurred since 1979. Marriage may look different today, but it continues to serve useful functions that unmarried relationships do not fully replicate.
