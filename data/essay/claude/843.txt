Aphra Behn uses rhyme, meter, and metaphor in her poem "The Willing Mistress" to express the themes of indecision and longing. The conflicted emotions and tangled thoughts of the speaker are reflected throughout the poem in these poetic devices. 

The rhyming quatrains of alternating masculine and feminine endings create a rhythmic quality that echoes the restless beating of the speaker's heart as she weighs her decision. The rhythm moves the reader through the winding journey of the speaker's mind at a pace that reinforces her anxiety and indecision. The repetition of rhyme also gives the sense of circling thoughts that return again and again to the central dilemma.

The varying meter, shifting between iambic pentameter, tetrameter, and trimeter, demonstrates the speaker's wavering resolve. The lines shorten and lengthen as her moods change from resolute to doubtful. The metrical variations subtly reflect the momentum of her thoughts. When she seems decided, the lines lengthen and the stresses grow firm, as in "I'll go, vain Coward, shake off this uneasie play,/And give my self as freely." But when doubts assail her, the lines shorten and the stresses soften, as in "To make me happy; shall I the Favour do?" The inconsistent meter creates an unsteady cadence, just as the speaker's own steps falter between action and inaction.

Behn's use of metaphor also reinforces the themes of irresolution and longing. The speaker's love is metaphorically compared to both "Day" and "Night," highlighting her confused and changeable passions. Her indecision is metaphorically conveyed through natural symbols of transition, like "Evening" and "Twilight." References to "hin[dering]" and "Advanc[ing]" her desires imply her hesitant steps between restraint and indulgence. The "Mists" that obscure her view represent the tangled web of emotions that cloud her thoughts. All of these metaphors point to her intermediate state of longing for fulfillment and longing for escape, caught between yearning for her lover's "soft embrace" and the "Dangers" that also entice her wandering soul.

In conclusion, Behn skillfully employs rhyme, meter, and metaphor in "The Willing Mistress" to articulate the speaker's conflicted experience of indecision and longing. The rhythms, cadences, and imagery of the poem vividly capture a mind lost in the haze of desire and a heart torn between the familiar and the unknown. The poetic devices highlight the central human experience of struggling to find clarity in the fog of emotions and passions. Overall, the poem is a compelling portrait of the restlessness of a woman caught between duty and love.
