The American Revolution and the subsequent declaration of independence from Great Britain was the result of a combination of factors in the 1760s and 1770s. Three of the most significant factors were growing economic tensions, ideological differences, and parliamentary taxation policies that Americans saw as unlawful. Over the course of these decades, as resentment over British policies built up, independence started to become an inevitability for those seeking drastic change. 

Economic tensions were rising in this period due to trade policies like the Navigation Acts that restricted American trade and required goods to be shipped on British ships. The molasses tax and Townshend Acts also placed taxes on imported goods. These policies were seen as unfair economic burdens by American colonists and led to protests like the Boston Massacre in 1770. The British also sought more control over the colonial economy and change the semi-autonomous relationship that had existed before. This increasing economic interference and taxation without proper representation in Parliament caused resentment.

There were also growing ideological differences between Americans and the British Parliament. The colonists had developed a sense of American identity separate from British identity. They valued their rights as Englishmen but believed those rights were not properly protected by Parliament an ocean away. Writings like Thomas Paine's "Common Sense" fueled revolutionary fervor by arguing for independence based on natural rights. The British saw the colonies as subservient while Americans wanted an equal partnership in the British Empire.

Parliamentary policies like the Stamp Act, Townshend Acts, and Intolerable Acts were also a driving force behind the independence movement. These acts placed taxes on paper goods and imports and closed Boston Harbor after the Boston Tea Party protest. Americans argued that Parliament did not have the right to levy taxes on them without proper representation. Protests often turned violent, and by 1774, the colonists formed the First Continental Congress to coordinate opposition.

By 1775, the factors fueling resentment had built up to the point that war broke out in Massachusetts, marking the start of the Revolutionary War. The publication of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 made it official that the 13 American colonies saw themselves as sovereign and independent states. A long war still remained, but independence had become inevitable as British and American positions had diverged and trust in the Empire had eroded beyond repair. Years of cumulative tensions set the stage for the colonists to take the drastic action of declaring independence to secure liberty on their own terms.
