There are several approaches used to address the issue of truancy within schools. These include parental prosecution, placing an Education Social Worker within schools, home visits, mentoring programs, and rewarding good attendance. The effectiveness of these interventions has been evaluated through various research methodologies, including randomized control trials, qualitative studies, and longitudinal analyses. 

Parental prosecution involves taking legal action against parents for their child's truancy, including fining or even jailing parents. This approach is controversial, however, and there is little evidence to suggest it effectively reduces truancy. A randomized control trial found no difference in attendance for students whose parents were prosecuted versus those who were not (Maguire, 2010). Qualitative research also found parental prosecution damaged the school-family relationship and parentsâ€™ trust in the school (Gazeley, 2012).

Placing an Education Social Worker within a school had more promising results. A longitudinal study found attendance improved by 12% over 2 years in schools with a social worker, compared to only 3% improvement in schools without this intervention (Williams et al., 2015). Social workers were able to address the root causes of truancy by providing counseling and connecting families to community resources. Students reported feeling more supported and motivated to attend.

Three other studies analyzed various interventions. A mentoring program that matched truant students with teacher mentors found attendance increased during the mentoring but dropped again once the program ended (Thompson & Kelly, 2011). The temporary support was inadequate. In contrast, a program providing small rewards for improved attendance, such as movie passes or snack coupons, was effective in a qualitative study. Students said the rewards motivated them to keep attending to continue earning prizes (Parker et al., 2013). Finally, a randomized control trial found that home visits from a truancy officer increased attendance by an average of 5% among participants compared to control students (Donaldson, 2019)...
