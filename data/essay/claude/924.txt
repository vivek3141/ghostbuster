The human skeleton comprises over 200 bones that provide structure and support for the body. The bones are perfectly designed through evolution to withstand the different forces placed upon them. The types of bones and their structures vary based on the stresses and strains they endure.

The three main types of bones in the human body are long bones, short bones, and flat bones. Long bones are longer than they are wide, such as the humerus and femur. They are primarily found in the limbs where they provide mobility and support. Long bones have a hollow medullary cavity and are filled with yellow bone marrow. They are composed of compact bone tissue surrounding the medullary cavity and at both ends, with spongy bone tissue in between. The compact bone tissue is dense and strong to resist bending and compressive forces, while the spongy bone tissue is light and porous to resist impact forces. 

Short bones are roughly cube-shaped, such as wrist and ankle bones. They primarily provide stability and limited motion. Short bones are composed primarily of spongy bone tissue covered by a thin layer of compact bone. The spongy bone helps dissipate forces in many directions. Flat bones, such as the ribs and skull, provide structure and protection. They are composed of two layers of compact bone tissue that surround spongy bone tissue. The thick compact bone layers resist compressive and bending forces from impacts or muscle activity.

The structural designs of the bones are well adapted to withstand the forces placed on them. For example, long bones are optimally shaped to resist strong bending forces and the forces of body weight while remaining lightweight. Their hollow medullary cavity removes excess mass while the thick compact bone at the ends resists compressive forces. The narrowing at the midsection of long bones also helps reduce stress concentrations. Short bones are structured for multi-directional forces and have greater flexibility due to their high spongy bone content and thin compact bone shell. Flat bones provide maximum surface area due to their broad, thin shape, while resisting fracture from impacts through their double layers of compact bone on either side of spongy bone.

In summary, the skeleton has a diversity of bone types suited through evolution to withstand the forces from different functions, locations, weights, motions, and impacts. The highly adapted structures of long bones, short bones, and flat bones demonstrate the remarkable mechanical design that enables mobility and protection.
