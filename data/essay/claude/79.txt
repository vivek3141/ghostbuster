Attachment theory originated with the work of John Bowlby in the middle of the 20th century. Bowlby proposed that attachment, the emotional bond between an infant and their primary caregiver, was essential for healthy development. He observed that infants become attached to caregivers who are sensitive and responsive, and that maternal separation or loss could have severe consequences. Based on his observations, Bowlby postulated that attachment is instinctual and helps ensure infant survival. 

Key concepts in attachment theory include the attachment behavioral system, different styles of attachment, and the idea of the inner working model. The attachment behavioral system refers to a set of innate behaviors in infants, such as crying, smiling, and grasping, that serve to bind the primary caregiver to the infant. As infants develop, they form an attachment style based on the responsiveness of the caregiver. Ainsworth identified three main attachment styles: secure, avoidant, and anxious/ambivalent. The inner working model refers to a mental representation infants develop of themselves and their primary caregivers based on their early attachment experiences. This influences how infants come to view themselves and form relationships.

Attachment theory has been applied and studied in various disciplines. In psychology, research on attachment styles has found links between secure attachment and better relationships, self-esteem, and mental health. Attachment theory has also been applied in child development, education, social work, and healthcare. For example, attachment theory may inform interventions for children with behavioral issues or guidance for foster parents. Understanding a childâ€™s attachment style and history can provide insight into their development and relationships.

While very influential, attachment theory is not without its critics. Some argue that attachment is not as innately programmed as Bowlby suggested and is more influenced by experience. The theory is also criticized for being too focused on the mother-infant bond and not accounting enough for cultural differences in child-rearing. Attachment theory has also been accused of "mother-blaming" when interventions focus too narrowly on the mother's own attachment style or parenting qualities. 

In response to these criticisms, attachment theory has evolved over time. Researchers now recognize that fathers and other caregivers also shape attachment, and that cultural values play a role in how attachment develops. The theory has expanded beyond childhood and is now applied to attachment across the lifespan, including attachment to friends, romantic partners, and between adults. Contemporary research has revealed many more nuances in how attachment works. Overall, while attachment theory began over 60 years ago, it continues to evolve and expand its insights into human development, relationships, and well-being.
