Group processes can have a significant impact on both individual behavior and group performance. There are several theories that provide support for the influence of group dynamics on individuals and groups. However, there are also arguments that group processes do not necessarily override individual traits and that group performance depends on more than just group dynamics alone.

Social facilitation theory suggests that the presence of others can improve individual performance on simple or well-practiced tasks but worsen performance on complex or unfamiliar tasks. The arousal caused by being watched leads to distraction for difficult tasks but can energize individuals for easy tasks. This shows how group processes like evaluation apprehension can directly impact individual behavior and performance. However, this theory also indicates that group influence depends on the nature and difficulty of the tasks, implying group processes do not always dominate.  

Groupthink refers to poor decision making that results from group pressures to conform and reach consensus. Irving Janis proposed that groupthink arises from strong group cohesion and insulation from outside opinions. It leads groups to ignore alternatives, fail to adequately evaluate options, and make irrational decisions. Groupthink demonstrates how the desire to maintain group harmony and cohesion can negatively impact group performance and decision making. However, groupthink does not inevitably arise from group dynamics; it also depends on leadership style, time pressures, and the presence of dissenting voices.

Social identity theory states that individuals derive their self-concept and esteem from the social groups they belong to. This motivates individuals to act in a way that benefits their group and conform to its norms. For example, experiments show individuals readily favor members of their own group over outsiders. While social identity impacts individual behavior, individuals vary in how strongly they identify with a group. Group performance also depends on intergroup dynamics, not just within-group processes.  

In conclusion, there are strong arguments and evidence that group dynamics significantly influence both individual behavior and group performance. However, group processes do not act alone. They interact with individual characteristics and traits as well as other contextual factors. Group performance depends on a multitude of inputs, including but not limited to group dynamics. Overall, group processes should not be viewed as the sole or necessarily primary driver of individual behavior and group outcomes. With balanced consideration of multiple perspectives, we can develop a nuanced understanding of group dynamics and performance.
