The Neoclassical literary movement in Europe from roughly 1660 to 1798 sought to emulate the arts of classical antiquity, like those of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Specifically, in terms of playwriting and poetry, the Neoclassical movement looked to Aristotle's Poetics as an ideal model for the arts. Within Aristotle's Poetics were outlined the "Three Unities" - unity of action, unity of place, and unity of time. Unity of action meant a play should have one main plot or action, without any distracting subplots. Unity of place meant a play's action should take place in a single location, without significant movement or scene changes. Unity of time meant a play should take place within no more than 24 hours. 

Playwrights of the Neoclassical era strove to adhere to these unities to emulate the classical arts outlined in the Poetics, but they also sought flexibility to create their own works of art. The unity of action was seen as the most important, and few plays strictly followed the unities of place and time. The unity of action or single plot was seen as necessary to avoid confusing the audience or distracting from the central theme or moral of the story. Strict adherence to unities of place and time, however, could seem unnatural. Having an entire play take place in a single day, for example, didn't always fit with the themes or plot that an author might want to convey.

Jean Racine's French tragedy Phaedra is an example of this. It takes place in a single palace setting, adhering to the unity of place, but the time span of the play is several days, ignoring the 24-hour unity of time. Racine realized that confining the play to a single day would seem contrived and make the plot implausible. Moliere's play Tartuffe also mostly respects the unities of place and action, taking place in a single household and focusing on a central plot of deception. However, the play seems to span at least two days, again disregarding the unity of time.

English playwrights like William Shakespeare were even more willing to disregard the strict unities to achieve a desired dramatic effect. Shakespeare's plays often encompass many different settings, years of a character's life, and multiple subplots - as in King Lear or The Tempest. Ben Jonson, by contrast, was typically more faithful to the classical unities in his plays. His Volpone takes place in Venice over the course of a single day, focusing on a central plot of greed and deception.  In general, though, English drama moved more steadily away from the unities than French drama.

In conclusion, while Neoclassical playwrights looked to Aristotle's Poetics and the Three Unities as an ideal model, in practice they sought flexibility to craft entertaining and meaningful works of art. The unity of action was viewed as most critical, to give plays coherence and clarity of theme or moral. But the unities of place and time were often seen as unnatural constraints, and were frequently dispensed with or modified to suit an author's particular story or plot. The Neoclassical era's emulation of classical forms was an influence and starting point, but playwrights were also innovating and shaping drama to their own purposes and creative visions. Reasonable deviations from strict rules were necessary to achieve that end.
