The aims of the haemagglutination and haemagglutination inhibition assay are to identify viruses by detecting the presence or absence of antibodies against a virus in a blood sample. The haemagglutination assay detects the ability of viruses to agglutinate red blood cells, indicating the presence of a virus. The haemagglutination inhibition assay detects the ability of antibodies to inhibit the agglutination of red blood cells by a virus, indicating a previous exposure to that virus.

In the haemagglutination assay, viruses that can agglutinate red blood cells, such as influenza viruses and others, are used to detect their presence in a sample. The viruses are diluted in a serial dilution and mixed with a standardized amount of red blood cells. If haemagglutination occurs at a specific dilution, this confirms the presence of the virus in the original sample. The highest dilution at which agglutination occurs is the haemagglutination titre, which quantifies the amount of virus present. 

In the haemagglutination inhibition assay, antibodies against a specific virus in a serum sample are detected based on their ability to inhibit the agglutination of red blood cells by that virus. The serum sample is diluted in a serial dilution and each dilution is mixed with a standardized amount of red blood cells and virus. The highest dilution of serum at which inhibition of haemagglutination occurs is the haemagglutination inhibition titre. It indicates the presence and titre of specific antibodies against that virus in the serum.

Comparing the results of the haemagglutination assay and haemagglutination inhibition assay allows the identification of viruses. A positive haemagglutination test with a negative haemagglutination inhibition test indicates acute or recent infection with a virus. A positive haemagglutination test with a positive haemagglutination inhibition test indicates past infection or immunization with a virus. Both negative tests indicate no recent or past infection with that virus.

In summary, the haemagglutination and haemagglutination inhibition assays are useful for the identification and quantification of viruses and antibodies in blood samples based on the ability of viruses to agglutinate red blood cells and the ability of antibodies to inhibit this agglutination. By detecting the presence or absence of viruses and antibodies, these assays allow the identification of viral infections.
