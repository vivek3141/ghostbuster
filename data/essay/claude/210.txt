Ronald Dworkin rejected the American Legal Realists' critique of formalism and sought to develop a theory of law that integrated formalism with a natural law approach based on principles. For Dworkin, formalism was necessary to provide predictability and constraint on judicial discretion, but judges should also consider moral principles when deciding hard cases.

The American Legal Realists argued that formalism, with its emphasis on logically deducing decisions from abstract rules, was an illusion. They claimed judges actually decided cases based on their personal and policy preferences, then rationalized their decisions with logical reasoning. The Realists believed formalism provides a facade of consistency and predictability while masking considerable judicial discretion. 

Dworkin rejected the Realists' position that law is merely the commands of the sovereign or the preferences of judges. Instead, he argued law also includes moral principles that provide the "right answer" in hard cases, even when rules run out. However, Dworkin did not believe judges should have unfettered discretion to decide cases based on their own moral philosophies. He sought to develop an approach limiting discretion while still allowing consideration of principles.

Dworkin's theory of "law as integrity" holds that law is an interpretive concept comprising both rules and principles. Judges should identify the principles that best fit and justify the existing rules and precedents, then apply those principles to decide hard cases. Principles constrain judicial discretion while allowing morally justifiable decisions. But judges must reason from within the law, not impose their own moral philosophies.

Dworkin believes judges should strive to articulate a single theory that provides the best moral justification for existing law and precedent. This "right answer" integrates rules and principles into a coherent whole. Judges show "integrity" by deciding cases based on this moral reading of the law, not their own views. Dworkin's approach limits discretion by insisting judges reason from within the internal morality of the law, not their own philosophies.

Dworkin's theory also maintains predictability by requiring judges to consider how their rulings will fit with precedent and the moral principles that justify the system as a whole. Decisions based on integrated moral principles are more predictable than if based on judges’ preferences alone. Dworkin argues the appearance of discretion arises from difficulty discerning the right answer, not actual discretion. His approach aims to constrain discretion while still allowing morally justified rulings, addressing criticisms of both formalism and judicial activism.

In conclusion, Dworkin rejected the Realist critique of formalism and sought to integrate formalism with a natural law theory based on moral principles. His theory of law as integrity allows consideration of principles in hard cases but constrains judicial discretion through requiring judges to reason from within the law. By insisting on a single right answer that fits and justifies precedent and rules, Dworkin attempted to limit discretion and subjectivity while still addressing the need for morally sound decisions. Dworkin’s theory aims to achieve both consistency and justified flexibility within the law.
