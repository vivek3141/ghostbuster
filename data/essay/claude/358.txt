The expansion and deepening of the European Union over the past few decades has brought both significant benefits as well as potential drawbacks to the member states and their citizens. On the economic front, the creation of the EU Single Market in 1992 and the expansion of the EU to include many former Eastern bloc countries in 2004 and 2007 have increased economic opportunities and efficiency. The free movement of goods, capital, services, and labor has reduced barriers to trade and commerce across national borders, enabling greater specialization and gains from trade. EU businesses and consumers now have access to a wider range of goods and services at lower cost. The mobility of labor across the EU has also allowed workers to move to locations with greater job opportunities and higher wages. 

However, economic convergence has been slow, and economic disparities between richer and poorer member states remain wide. The EU budget, which redistributes funds from wealthier to poorer members, is small relative to the size of the Single Market. There is a risk that the free movement of labor can lead to brain drain from poorer to wealthier countries. The single currency, the euro, also poses challenges as the central bank sets a single monetary policy for diverse economies, and members cannot adjust exchange rates to suit their needs. 

Socially and politically, the expansion of the EU has fostered a stronger European identity as people travel, work, and live in other member countries. However, significant cultural differences remain, and there are risks of social tensions from large migratory flows across borders. The EU also faces a democratic deficit as bureaucrats in Brussels propose and enforce rules that significantly impact national governments and citizens. 

If the EU had instead established only a free trade area or joined the European Free Trade Association, there may have been fewer economic benefits but also fewer costs and risks. A free trade area typically only eliminates tariffs on goods between members but does not aim for the free movement of labor or capital and does not require regulatory harmonization across members. This limits the economic gains from specialization and trade but provides more flexibility and independence for members to set their own policies.

In conclusion, while the expansion and strengthening of the EU Single Market has brought economic and social benefits through increased trade, mobility, and cooperation, there are also meaningful costs and drawbacks in terms of economic imbalances, social tensions, and a democratic deficit. An alternative model based solely on a free trade area might have provided economic gains with fewer costs to national sovereignty and independence. Overall, there are good arguments on both sides, and reasonable people can disagree on the appropriate scope and reach of European integration.
