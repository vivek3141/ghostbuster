Private asylums in the 18th and 19th centuries were largely unregulated and were rife with scandals and poor management practices. The desire for profit and lack of oversight led many asylum owners to subject patients to deplorable living conditions, physical restraints, and dubious medical practices in the name of “treatment.”

One of the most well-known asylum scandals was at Bethlem Royal Hospital in London, known colloquially as “Bedlam.” In 1815, a parliamentary inquiry found deplorable conditions at the hospital including overcrowding, physical restraint of patients, and lack of proper medical care. Patients were treated more like animals than human beings. After public outcry, reforms were put in place, but problems persisted for decades. Many other private asylums had similarly poor conditions, with patients subjected to restraints, confined to small spaces, and receiving little actual medical treatment. 

Asylum owners were primarily motivated by profit, not patient well-being. Asylums would accept anyone exhibiting any kind of abnormal behavior, as long as families were willing to pay. Patients were often restrained or confined not due to medical need but simply for the convenience of the staff. “Treatments” like purging, bloodletting, and sedation were employed not because they were medically effective but because they gave the appearance of active medical care. Owners lied to families about patient progress and conditions to keep funds flowing in.

There was little government oversight of asylums during this time. Asylums were essentially self-regulated, and few licensing or inspection requirements were in place. This allowed deplorable conditions to persist without consequences. When reports of scandals or abuse did emerge, asylum owners faced few punishments and largely escaped reform. They were able to push back against criticism by arguing that they were providing a necessary public service by caring for the mentally ill.

Only in the mid-19th century did the government begin mandating inspections, licensing, and minimum standards for asylums. This led to some closures of the most egregious institutions and gradual reforms in the remaining asylums. However, problems with overcrowding, lack of proper medical care, and abuse of patients would continue into the 20th century before more widespread reforms were enacted. In summary, private asylums of the 18th and 19th centuries were characterized by scandal, mismanagement, lack of standards, and greed—all of which led to the immense suffering of countless patients over this period.
