There are several alternative proposals a restaurant manager can implement to improve the financial performance and competitive position of their operation.

First, the manager should focus on building strong, loyal relationships with customers. They can do this by training staff on providing excellent customer service, greeting regular customers by name, and rewarding loyal customers through comped meals or special events. Building personal connections and loyalty will lead customers to return more often and spread positive word-of-mouth about their experience. 

Second, the manager should foster a positive company culture and empower employees. By treating staff well through fair compensation, reasonable hours, and a respectful work environment, employees will be happier and provide better service. Employees should also be encouraged to provide feedback and ideas to improve operations. An engaged, empowered staff will lead to less turnover and higher-quality customer interactions.

Third, the manager can drive more customers through targeted marketing strategies like social media ads, partnerships with local organizations, and participating in community events. They should focus marketing efforts on their key customer segments and the experiences or cuisine that set them apart. Events and promotions should aim not just to increase short-term sales but also raise brand awareness and form new customer relationships.

Fourth, the manager should optimize capacity utilization through data analysis. By tracking key metrics like sales by day of week and time of day, table turnover rates, and server productivity, the manager can adjust staffing levels, hours of operation, and seating arrangements to maximize revenue. They may find certain days or time periods are underutilized and run promotions during those periods. Or they may need to make changes to turn over tables more quickly during peak periods. 

In conclusion, building customer and employee relationships, empowering staff, utilizing targeted marketing, and optimizing capacity are four alternative proposals a restaurant manager can use to gain a competitive advantage and improve the financial success of their operation. By implementing a combination of these strategies, the manager can boost customer loyalty, increase traffic and sales, streamline operations, and create a sustainable competitive edge.
