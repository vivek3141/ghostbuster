Realism as an artistic movement aimed to present life as it really is on stage. Realist playwrights attempted to depict events and characters in a lifelike, plausible manner without idealization. However, Realism has its limitations, especially for political theatre groups and playwrights interested in subverting dominant ideologies or depicting extreme human experiences. 

Realism's focus on surface details, psychological complexity, and linear narratives does not lend itself well to articulating political arguments or rendering traumatic events legible. The experiences of war, violence, and human atrocity often defy Realism’s emphasis on coherence, plausibility, and mundane details. Realism struggles to make sense of events that themselves do not make sense.

The play Blasted by Sarah Kane demonstrates how non-Realist forms can better capture traumatic events. The play depicts the horror of civil war in an unnamed country, transitioning abruptly from a naturalistic first half set in a hotel room to a surreal second half of death and destruction. The jagged transitions and illogical leaps in space, time, and logic reflect the disorientation of war. By abandoning Realism, the play renders the trauma of war comprehensible.  

The theatre company Theatre Workshop similarly found that Realism was inadequate for their purposes. Founded in the 1930s with socialist aims, Theatre Workshop sought to use theatre as a tool for political education and consciousness raising. However, they found that Realism was unable to effectively communicate the traumatic experience of World War I and advance their leftist arguments.

Theatre Workshop moved into more experimental forms, incorporating multimedia, direct audience address, dream scenes, and Expressionistic sets and costumes. Their production of Oh, What a Lovely War! used ironic musical and cinematic conventions to make sense of the madness of World War I. These surreal and absurdist elements allowed the show to powerfully advance an anti-war argument in a way Realism could not.

In conclusion, while Realism aims to present life as it is really lived, it has significant limitations in its ability to coherently articulate trauma or promote ideological arguments. Its linear narratives and mundane details fail to capture the illogic of human violence and suffering. Playwrights and companies interested in subversion or understanding atrocity have thus turned to non-Realist forms better equipped to make the confusing legible and advance an argument. Kane’s Blasted and Theatre Workshop’s productions demonstrate how abandonment of strict Realism opens new possibilities for political theatre and understanding extreme events.
