As the group leader for a project in my business class, I learned a great deal about leadership, team dynamics, and entrepreneurship. My initial approach coming into the project was quite directive, as I wanted to ensure that things started off on the right track. However, over time, I came to understand the importance of empowering teammates by giving them ownership and trusting in their abilities. 

When the class was first assigned this project, I eagerly volunteered to be the group leader. In my mind, the leader was the person ultimately responsible for ensuring the success of the team, so I wanted to make sure I could steer us in the right direction. At our first meeting, I came in with a very structured agenda that mapped out timelines for key milestones and delegated specific tasks to each member. Looking back, this approach was probably a bit overkill and didn't give my teammates much say in how we proceeded or what roles they would play. However, as a Type A person, having concrete next steps and accountability made me feel more comfortable in this new leadership position.

A week later at our next check-in, I could sense some frustration from a couple members of the group. They felt I hadn't given them enough voice in determining what we would work on or how, and that I was being overly rigid in my expectations. At first, I felt defensive, as I had put a lot of work into developing what I thought was an organized plan of attack. But after reflecting, I realized they were right - I wasn't being a collaborative leader but rather dictating what to do. I apologized to the group and asked for their input on a revised plan. With their feedback, we restructured some timelines, re-delegated a few tasks, and agreed to make future decisions together as a team.  

Over the remainder of the project, I made an effort to be a more empowering leader. I solicited regular feedback to make sure all voices were heard.  I trusted my teammates to get work done on their timelines and in their own ways. And I looked for opportunities to give them more ownership over the direction of the project. The end result was extremely successful, and I realized an entrepreneurial team is most innovative and impactful when its members feel autonomous and valued. My biggest takeaway from this experience was learning the power of empowering others - as a leader, success is best achieved by bringing out the best in your teammates rather than imposing your will on them. By loosening my grip on control and empowering my team, we were able to accomplish far more together than I could have directed alone. 

In sum, this project taught me the importance of an empowering leadership style, flexible planning, regular feedback, and valuing diverse perspectives. My initial approach was flawed, but through openness to feedback and a willingness to reflect and adapt, I was able to become the kind of leader who could enable our team to thrive. These are lessons I will carry with me for any future team endeavor.
