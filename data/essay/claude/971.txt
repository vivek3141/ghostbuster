Sitcoms often utilize pragmatic frameworks, including Grice’s conversational maxims, Brown and Levinson’s Politeness theory, and Leech’s Politeness Maxims, to achieve the expected humorous effect in their scripts. The popular American sitcom “Friends” is an excellent example of how these pragmatic tools are employed creatively and strategically to elicit audience laughter. 

Grice’s conversational maxims relate to the cooperative principle, whereby conversational contributions should be purposeful, truthful, relevant, and clear. Flouting these maxims in sitcoms can create comedic irony and absurdity. In a scene from “Friends”, Monica, Rachel and Phoebe are lambasting their friend Ross about saving a mouse from a glue trap but then accidentally killing it. Ross defends that he “was just trying to be a good friend” to the mouse. Phoebe quips: “Aw, you're like a cute, fuzzy little unintentional kitten killer.” This flouts the maxim of relevance, juxtaposing the irrelevant concept of “kitten killer” for comedic effect. The non sequitur also adds to the absurdity and irony, making the audience laugh at Phoebe’s exaggerated comparison.

Politeness theory focuses on the conflict between two speakers’ needs to be efficient and indirect. Character harassment and teasing are common mechanisms by which this conflict elicits humor in sitcoms. In another “Friends” episode, Joey and Chandler harass Ross by singing “I'm Bein' Kind”, a song mocking Ross’s failed relationships. Although intended as a joke, the singing also flouts the tact maxim by embarrassing Ross and highlighting his romantic inadequacies. The rudeness is softened by the casual, friendly dynamic between the characters, conveying that the insults are said in jest and with the goal of amusing rather than offending Ross – and the audience. 

Leech’s Politeness Maxims relate to tact, generosity, approbation, modesty, agreement, and sympathy. Flouting these maxims in clever or ironic ways is a common source of humor in sitcoms. In one episode, Rachel makes her famous English trifle for Thanksgiving, but the recipe pages get stuck together, creating a disastrous combination of beef and custard. When asked how it tastes, Joey replies: “It tastes like feet!”, exploiting the comedy in flouting the tact and approbation maxims. However, because Rachel acknowledges the trifle tastes awful, Joey’s comment also reinforces the friendship and honesty between the characters, softening the rudeness and making the audience laugh with Joey rather than at Rachel.

In conclusion, the sitcom “Friends” utilizes pragmatic frameworks like Grice’s maxims, Politeness theory, and Leech’s maxims in innovative ways to craft comedic scenarios and witty dialogue. Flouting these pragmatic principles and manipulating the conflict between efficiency and politeness create situations and interactions that elicit laughs from the audience. A close analysis of “Friends” demonstrates how these tools can be strategically combined for comedic effect.
