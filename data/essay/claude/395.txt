Bergson’s concept of duration lies at the heart of his philosophy. Duration refers to our immediate, pre-reflective experiential temporal flow. It is the intrinsic temporality of consciousness which Bergson contrasts with the spatialized time we construct through abstraction and conceptualization. Bergson argues that duration is a heterogeneous multiplicity, by which he means that each moment in the flow of consciousness penetrates into all the others. This is opposed to the homogeneous multiplicity of space where distinct points are separated in a void and do not interpenetrate. Bergson believes that we have a tendency to spatialize time by superimposing the homogeneous multiplicity of space onto the heterogeneous multiplicity of duration. However, Bergson argues that duration can be intuited through rejecting this habitual spatialization of experience. 

While Bergson’s notion of the heterogeneous multiplicity penetrating duration is meant to capture the continuity of consciousness, it risks suggesting that consciousness consists of a succession of indivisible instants that interpenetrate, rather than a truly continuous flow. If each moment permeates into all the others, are there any divisions between instants at all? Bergson sometimes suggests duration cannot be divided, but at other points refers to life being made of moments that interpenetrate. This ambiguity threatens to undermine his argument that duration is continuous, not atomistic. A stronger articulation of duration as a ceaseless flow without divisions may avoid this problem and more accurately reflect our lived temporal experience.

Bergson argues that our tendency to think spatially rather than duratively is the product of evolutionary processes. As the human organism developed, we gained greater facility with abstract conceptual thought and spatial representation. While initially useful, this capacity for spatial thinking has come to dominate our cognition in a way that obscures the intrinsic temporality of experience. Bergson believes we must make an effort to counter this habitual mode of spatialized thinking through intuition, which allows us to grasp duration directly rather than representing it symbolically with the homogeneous multiplicity of space.

Bergson’s notion of intuition and duration stand in contrast with Kant’s view of space and time as a priori forms of sensible intuition. For Kant, space and time are the necessary preconditions for any experience and structure how we perceive the world. Bergson rejects Kant’s distinction between things-in-themselves and phenomena as theoretically ungrounded, instead seeing consciousness and world as proceeding together in a durational flux. Rather than space and time being absolute, a priori structures of experience, for Bergson they arise through our evolutionary development and tendency to spatialize the temporality of duration. While Kant takes space and time as fixed givens, Bergson sees them as constructions derived from the more fundamental flow of duration.
       
Overall, while Bergson’s philosophy of duration and his two multiplicities aim to capture the lived temporal continuity of consciousness, his ambiguous treatment of duration as both indivisible and divided into moments threatens to undermine this goal. Clarifying duration as a ceaseless, uninterrupted flow may strengthen Bergson’s conceptual framework. His argument that our tendency to spatialize duration arises from evolutionary processes provides an compelling explanation for why we habitually represent time as homogenous space rather than grasping duration intuitively. Comparing Bergson and Kant highlights how sharply opposed their views are on space, time and the nature of experience. Bergson’s notion of duration challenges Kant’s a priori, absolute forms of intuition with a vision of temporality as fundamental and constructions of space arising developmentally. Through refining his notion of duration and providing a clear articulation of how it differs from Kant’s framework, Bergson developed a radical and influential philosophy of time with enduring relevance.
