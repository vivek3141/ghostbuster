Discrimination against migrants in Britain has been an ongoing issue that has led to increased clustering of migrant populations in select geographical areas and types of housing. This clustering has significant effects on the migrant populations by limiting their opportunities for social mobility and integration within British society. The concept of housing class is still relevant today as ethnic minorities continue to face structural barriers that restrict them to certain types of housing and locations.  

Discrimination in the private housing market in Britain is one of the primary drivers of migrant clustering. Landlords and letting agents frequently discriminate against migrants and ethnic minorities, making it difficult for them to secure private rented housing outside of migrant enclaves. Numerous studies using “mystery shopper” techniques have found that ethnic minorities face discrimination in 50-90% of private housing enquiries compared to white British applicants. Racial stereotyping and prejudice lead landlords to view migrants and ethnic minorities as undesirable tenants, causing them to preferentially select white British applicants.

The clustering of migrants into low-income social housing and private rented accommodation in deprived inner-city areas is an inevitable consequence of discrimination in the housing market. With limited options, migrants are forced into housing that is often poorly maintained, overcrowded, and located in neighbourhoods with high poverty rates, poor amenities, and limited opportunity structures. These challenging living conditions detrimentally impact the wellbeing of migrants and their ability to integrate into wider British society.

 The increased demand for housing in migrant enclaves also has the effect of driving up housing prices and rents in those areas. While migrants benefit from the cultural familiarity and community ties within the enclave, the higher cost of living can make it difficult to escape poverty and disadvantage. This acts as a structural barrier that restricts ethnic minorities to clustered areas in a vicious cycle of segregation and deprivation.

While personal discrimination certainly plays a role, structural societal factors including a lack of social housing, poverty, and inequality are the primary drivers pushing migrants into clustered housing and locations. The British government’s failure to provide adequate and accessible social housing for a growing population, lack of rent control policies, and limited public investment in deprived inner-city areas have contributed to the housing crisis faced by migrants and ethnic minorities today. These structural issues intersect with discrimination and lead to the concentrated clustering of migrants into low-income, high-density housing.

In conclusion, discrimination against migrants in Britain’s housing market leads to clustering into deprived inner-city areas and low-quality housing. While this phenomenon was described in the 20th century as “housing class”, the factors underpinning it remain relevant today. Migrants face barriers in both private and social housing that push them into the same disadvantaged neighborhoods. Their constrained choices, in turn, severely limit opportunities for social mobility and integration. Structural reforms in Britain’s housing and immigration policies are needed to remedy this discrimination and promote more equitable access to opportunity for migrant communities. Overall, the concept of “housing class” continues to be a useful means of understanding and differentiating the diverse experiences of ethnic minorities in 21st century Britain.
