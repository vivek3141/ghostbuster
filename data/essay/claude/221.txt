Long-term strategic planning and flexibility are both important for business success, especially in a competitive environment. However, the balance between planning and agility depends on the nature of the business and the pace of change in its industry. 

Companies that prioritize long-term strategic planning often do so because they are in mature, stable industries where change is more gradual. Planning helps these companies establish a clear vision and set of strategic objectives to work towards over the next 3-5 years or more. For example, Royal Dutch Shell, an oil and gas company, is in an industry with slow rates of change. It devotes significant resources to long-term planning around new resource exploration, energy technologies, and diversifying into renewable energy. This approach helps Shell navigate regulatory changes, adapt to climate change risks, and stay ahead of competitors.

In contrast, companies in fast-paced, highly innovative industries tend to value flexibility and agility more highly. Excessive long-term planning can be counterproductive in these environments as plans quickly become outdated. For instance, in the technology sector, strategic plans are often disrupted by rapid changes in technology, customer preferences, and new entrants. Google, an Internet company, is known for its flexible and adaptable culture. Rather than strict long-term plans, Google favors experimentation and adjusting based on frequent feedback and data analysis. This agile approach has allowed Google to swiftly adapt search algorithms, release new products, and enter new technology areas like machine learning and self-driving vehicles. 

While long-term planning and flexibility are both valuable, companies are most successful when they match their strategic approach to the demands of their industry. Mature, stable industries call for more emphasis on planning to set a vision and direction, while fast-changing, disruptive industries benefit more from cultivating organizational agility and flexibility. In reality, for most companies, an ideal balance lies somewhere in the middle - regularly assessing industry changes and adjusting plans to stay on course toward key long-term goals, but also fostering a willingness to experiment, pivot, and adapt as needed. With the accelerating pace of change across all industries, adaptability has become an increasingly critical capability for all companies to develop to survive and thrive. Overall, the most successful businesses utilize both long-term planning and flexibility, focusing on the strategic approach that is the best fit for their unique situation and industry dynamics.
