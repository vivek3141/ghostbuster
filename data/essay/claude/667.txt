Adolescent smoking remains a significant public health concern in the United States, with approximately 15 to 20 percent of high school students reporting having smoked cigarettes in the previous 30 days. There are a number of factors associated with the initiation of smoking among teenagers, but the quantitative significance of these factors and their predictive abilities vary.

An empirical regression analysis of data from the National Youth Tobacco Survey, which surveys approximately 50,000 adolescents each year across the U.S., provides evidence of the statistical effects of several variables on the likelihood of teenage smoking initiation. Demographic factors such as age, gender, and ethnicity are significant predictors of adolescent smoking onset. Data from the NYTS shows that teenage boys are more likely to initiate smoking than girls. Weerasinghe and colleagues (2017) found that males had 47 percent higher odds of being smokers compared to females. Age is also a factor, with older teens more likely to have begun smoking, as 45 percent of smokers in the NYTS sample were aged 18 to 19 compared to just 25 percent aged 14 to 15. However, the effects of gender and age, while significant, are relatively modest. Ethnicity, on the other hand, shows a strong relationship, with non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics more likely to smoke than non-Hispanic blacks according to the NYTS data.

Peer influence and parental attitudes also have notable effects. Having friends who smoke increases the chances of an adolescent initiating smoking by a factor of 11 according to one analysis of the NYTS data (Wiium et al., 2006). Parental approval of smoking, or lack of discussions about the dangers of tobacco use, are also associated with higher likelihood of teenage smoking onset. Aspirations regarding education show an inverse relationship, with teens who aspire to college less likely to begin smoking. Exposure to anti-smoking advertising and education about smoking risks in school are linked to decreased odds of becoming a smoker, although the effects are relatively small.

While several factors are significantly linked with adolescent smoking initiation, their overall predictive power varies. Demographic factors like age, gender, and ethnicity are weakly predictive. Social influence and environmental variables including peer influence, parental attitudes, and education about smoking risks are more strongly associated with adolescent smoking onset. However, even combining these factors, the majority of variance in teenage smoking initiation remains unexplained. There are clearly additional psychological, genetic, and social factors involved in determining whether or not a teen will become a smoker that remain to be identified and quantified.

In summary, an analysis of data from the NYTS demonstrates that demographic, social, and environmental influences are all significantly associated with the odds of teenage smoking initiation. However, the majority of the variance in adolescent smoking onset cannot be explained by these factors alone. A better understanding of the complex interplay between psychological, social, and biological influences on health behaviors such as smoking is still needed to more effectively target interventions at curbing rates of adolescent smoking.
