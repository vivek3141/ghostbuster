The lifecycle of Bovine Enterovirus (BEV) involves several key steps that allow it to replicate within host cells and produce infectious progeny. BEV is a non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus in the Picornaviridae family. Its genome consists of a single open reading frame that encodes a polyprotein which is subsequently cleaved into four structural proteins (VP1-VP4) and seven nonstructural proteins (2A-2C and 3A-3D). 

To begin infection, BEV attaches to specific receptors on the surface of host cells, such as BHK21 cells, which are derived from baby hamster kidney cells. The receptors that BEV attaches to are not definitively known but may include sialic acid-containing glycoproteins and/or integrins. After binding to the appropriate receptors, BEV enters the cells through endocytosis. The low pH inside the endosomes causes a conformational change in the capsid that releases the genomic RNA into the cytoplasm.

Once in the cytoplasm, the viral RNA acts as an mRNA and binds to ribosomes to translate the polyprotein. The polyprotein then cleaves into individual viral proteins through the action of protease enzymes 2A and 3C. The nonstructural proteins form the replication complex to synthesize negative-strand RNA using the positive-strand RNA as a template. The negative-strand RNA then acts as a template to produce many more positive-strand genomic RNAs. 

Structural proteins VP1-VP4 assemble around the newly synthesized positive-strand RNA to form new progeny virions. These progeny accumulate in the cytoplasm until the cell eventually lyses and releases thousands of new infectious BEV particles. The full replication cycle takes about 6-8 hours to complete in BHK21 cells.

An experiment was conducted to analyze the growth kinetics of BEV in BHK21 cells by measuring infectious progeny, intracellular viral RNA, and RNA polymerase activity at various time points post-infection. Cells were infected at a multiplicity of 10 plaque-forming units per cell. Samples were collected at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours post-infection. The results showed that intracellular viral RNA and RNA polymerase activity steadily increased over 12 hours. Infectious progeny remained undetectable until 6 hours, then increased exponentially through 12 hours as new virions were assembled and released, correlating with increasing cytopathic effects.

Some limitations of this experiment include possible human error in the plaque assay quantification of infectious particles and use of only a single cell line. Different cell lines may support BEV replication at varying efficiencies. Additionally, without a negative control it is difficult to conclude that the increases in intracellular viral RNA and polymerase activity were directly due to BEV infection and not due to normal cellular activity or activation by sample preparation.

In summary, BEV follows a typical viral replication lifecycle of attachment, entry, translation of the viral polyprotein, viral genome replication, protein processing and cleavage events, new virion assembly, and release from the host cell. By further understanding the specific details of BEV replication and its interaction with various host cells, BEV may have promising potential as an anti-tumor agent, providing targeted destruction of cancerous cells. Overall, this experiment provided valuable information about the kinetics of BEV growth in BHK21 cells, but additional controls and replications are needed to strengthen the conclusions that can be drawn.
