Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox Ford were two modernist authors who subverted traditional structural designs in their novellas Heart of Darkness and The Good Soldier. Rather than following conventional linear narratives with straightforward chronologies, they employed innovative techniques like nested narratives, unreliable narration, and circular or disjointed timelines. These unconventional structures allowed them to explore themes of subjectivity, the elusiveness of truth, and the limitations of language.

In Heart of Darkness, Conrad employs a nested narrative structure, with the outer frame narrated by a sea captain who relays the inner story of Marlow's journey into the Congo. This structure allows Conrad to explore the unreliability of narratives and the subjectivity of truth. The sea captain acts as an initial filter, and we have to rely on his account of Marlow's story. But even Marlow's first-person narrative is colored by his own biases and limitations. His description of events often seems impressionistic, and we are left unsure of the objective truth of his experiences in the Congo. The nested structure and the filters of the two narrators highlight how difficult it is to achieve a single objective truth.

Ford employs an even more radical undermining of chronology and traditional narrative in The Good Soldier. The story is told through the narration of John Dowell, who reveals events in a disjointed, digressive fashion. There is no clear linear timeline, as Dowell jumps between past and present, circles back to re-tell events, and frequently contradicts himself or admits the unreliability of his memory. Ford uses Dowell's erratic narration to explore how we construct narratives to make sense of events, even if we do not have a full or accurate picture. Dowell's narration seems to reflect the jumble of memories and the self-deceptions that characterize how we understand our own lives. The non-linear, confusing structure of the novella helps create a sense of subjectivity in how we perceive and relate the "truth" about our experiences.   

In conclusion, Conrad and Ford employed unconventional narrative structures, including nested narratives, unreliable narrators, and non-linear timelines. These modernist techniques allowed them to explore themes of subjectivity, the elusiveness of truth, and the imperfect nature of language to represent reality. The nested narrative of Heart of Darkness calls into question the possibility of achieving an objective truth, while the disjointed, digressive narration of The Good Soldier reflects how we construct subjective narratives to understand our own lives and experiences. The innovative structures of these two novellas were instrumental in crafting their portrayals of narration, truth, and meaning.
