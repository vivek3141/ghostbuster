Anthropology faced significant impediments as an emerging social science in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Early anthropologists grappled with a lack of rigorous methods for data collection and analysis, biases and preconceptions that clouded their observations, and limited means of sharing and critiquing each other’s work. However, pioneering theorists made important strides in developing theories and methods that helped establish anthropology as a serious discipline.  

Nineteenth-century anthropology was heavily influenced by evolutionism, the idea that human societies progress unilineally from “primitive” to “civilized.” Anthropologists like Lewis Henry Morgan proposed sequences of cultural evolution that mapped how societies changed over time. However, evolutionism introduced biases that led anthropologists to value some societies over others. It also encouraged speculative theories not grounded in rigorous fieldwork.

Early 20th century theorists like Bronislaw Malinowski, Émile Durkheim, and A.R. Radcliffe-Brown moved away from speculative evolutionism toward empirically-grounded fieldwork and theory. Malinowski pioneered long-term ethnographic fieldwork, living among the Trobriand Islanders for years to gain firsthand knowledge of their culture. He focused on how institutions function to meet human needs, viewing culture as an adaptive system. 

Durkheim examined how social facts like religion and kinship emerge from and shape human interactions. He studied Aboriginal kinship systems to understand how they create social cohesion. Radcliffe-Brown studied kinship and ritual practices across societies to identify common social functions. He saw cultures as integrated wholes that should be understood through synchronic analysis rather than speculative evolutionary histories.

These theorists made several important contributions. First, intensive fieldwork became the hallmark of anthropological method. Malinowski’s immersive work set a precedent for ethnography as the basis for anthropological knowledge. Second, they moved away from unilineal evolution toward comparative, functionalist analyses that aimed to understand how social institutions fulfill universal human needs across cultures. Finally, they focused on how individuals are shaped by their societies through the transmission of social facts, norms, and values. 

However, some differences remained. Malinowski focused on individuals and the satisfaction of their needs, whereas Durkheim and Radcliffe-Brown emphasized the role of cultural institutions above individuals. Durkheim argued that religion and kinship have social functions independent of physiological needs. Radcliffe-Brown’s structural-functionalism portrayed societies as highly integrated, harmonious wholes governed by “social necessities,” downplaying individual agency and social problems.

In conclusion, early anthropology was hindered by its speculative, value-laden nature but blossomed under the influence of Malinowski, Durkheim, and Radcliffe-Brown. They developed rigorous fieldwork methods, functionalist theories, and comparative analyses that recognized both cultural diversity and certain social necessities as shaping human experience. However, some tensions remained between individualist and institutionalist viewpoints. Overall, these theorists laid the groundwork for social anthropology as a professional, scientific discipline.
