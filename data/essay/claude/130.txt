War is a recurring theme in fiction as it provides immense dramatic potential to explore human experiences of suffering, sacrifice, and moral complexity. In Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front and Lewis Milestone's 1930 film adaptation, the gruesome realities of World War I are portrayed to highlight the futility and horror of war from the perspective of ordinary soldiers. 

In the novel, Paul BÃ¤umer enlists in the German army with his school friends, caught up in the patriotic fervor of the time. However, they soon realize the harsh realities of war as they struggle through the trenches. Remarque spares no detail in describing the mud, lice, stench of death, and constant threat of shelling. The graphic depictions serve to highlight the futile suffering of soldiers who gained only a few yards of territory at most. The vivid portrayal of scenes such as a wounded soldier lingering in no man's land and dying a slow, agonizing death, reinforce the senseless waste of human life.

The film adaptation utilizes visuals to effectively represent the grim battlefield conditions and traumatic experiences. The claustrophobic dugouts, apocalyptic landscapes, and Jerky movements of the handheld cameras mimic the experiences of the protagonist and evoke empathy in the audience for the hopeless situation of the soldiers trapped in a cycle of violence. Both novel and film question the purpose of the fighting at Verdun as the territorial gains seem meaningless relative to massive casualties.

A central theme in both works is the loss of innocence as Paul and his comrades descend into a dehumanized state to cope with the war. At first, the schoolboys enthusiastically enlist, eager for glory and adventure. However, they soon become indifferent to death and focus only on their own survival. The supporting characters are gradually killed off, reflecting the expendability of human life. The only person Paul cares about is his close friend Kat, whose death devastates him and reinforces his realization of the ultimate pointlessness of the fighting.
