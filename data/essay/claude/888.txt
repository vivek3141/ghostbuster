Reflections on Working in a Multidisciplinary Group in Health and Social Care 

Throughout my work in the health and social care field, I have had the opportunity to collaborate in multidisciplinary groups on several occasions. These experiences have provided valuable insights into group dynamics, the challenges of teamwork, and the factors that contribute to successful collaboration. In this essay, I will reflect on my experiences working in one such multidisciplinary group, using Tuckman’s 1965 model of group development and Belbin’s 1981 framework of team roles to analyze the evolution of the group and how the dynamics impacted our work.

The group consisted of six members from different health and social care professions, coming together to develop a new care pathway for elderly patients with multiple chronic conditions. We were at Tuckman’s ‘forming’ stage initially, getting to know each other and settling into our roles. There was enthusiasm for the task, but also some anxiety about how we would work together effectively. At this point, it was not yet clear how responsibilities would be divided or how leadership would emerge. However, there were early signs of Belbin’s ‘coordinator’ and ‘shaper’ roles, with two members taking initiative to organize meetings and delegate initial tasks.

As we began exchanging ideas and debating options, this marked the ‘storming’ stage. There were disagreements on the appropriate scope and focus, reflecting the diversity of perspectives in the group. I found this stage challenging, as conflicts arose and progress was slow. However, it was also a necessary process for developing shared goals and compromising. The ‘coordinator’ and ‘shaper’ roles became more prominent, facilitating productive discussions and steering the group forward. 

Gradually, we entered the ‘norming’ stage, overcoming our differences and establishing norms of cooperation and trust. There was a shared sense of responsibility towards the goal, and members adopted other Belbin roles more naturally, such as ‘monitor-evaluator’ in critiquing options, and ‘resource investigator’ in gathering information. I felt more comfortable raising concerns and suggesting ideas at this point. 

Finally, in the 'performing' stage, we worked collaboratively with a clear sense of shared purpose to achieve our goal. We drew on each other's expertise, learned to address tensions constructively, and made efficient progress. The ‘plant’ role also emerged, with different members offering creative solutions. By the end of this stage, we had created a comprehensive care pathway ready for implementation.

In summary, developing this care pathway was a challenging but rewarding experience that highlighted the importance of progressing through Tuckman’s group stages  and having a balanced range of Belbin’s team roles. Analysis of this experience has reinforced my understanding of effective teamwork in multidisciplinary settings. Overall, I believe recognizing and working with group dynamics, allowing leadership and responsibility to emerge responsibly, and compromising different perspectives were key factors in our success.
