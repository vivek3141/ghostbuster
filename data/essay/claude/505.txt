Gordon’s leadership style and decision making process in the situation with Harry and the forms in the warehouse could have benefitted from several different leadership theories and approaches. Three relevant approaches that could have helped Gordon handle this situation better are the servant leadership style, democratic decision making, and systematic analysis of the root causes of the issue. 

The servant leadership approach focuses on serving the needs of employees and supporting their growth and wellbeing. Gordon could have employed this leadership style by first listening to Harry to understand why he did not file the forms properly and if he needed any additional support or resources to do so. Gordon could have then worked with Harry collaboratively on a solution, rather than punishing him immediately for his mistake. This would have made Harry feel empowered and motivated to correct his error, rather than resentful of Gordon’s authoritative response. Servant leaders aim to serve first, so Gordon should have prioritized listening, understanding, and collaborating with Harry to find a constructive solution.

A democratic decision making process would have also been beneficial in this situation. Rather than making the decision to demand Harry drive several hours to refile the forms on his own, Gordon could have discussed the issue with his team to get their input and buy-in. Gordon could have presented the problem in a non-judgmental manner, outlined the requirements from the client and the company policy, and then asked for ideas from Harry and others on the team for how to remedy the situation in a way that meets the key needs. This discussion and consensus building would have ensured the decision addresses the root causes, considers all perspectives, and has the support of the team to execute. As the leader, Gordon would have the final say, but gathering input from those closest to the problem—in this case Harry—would have produced a much more informed choice.  

Finally, Gordon could have employed systematic analysis to understand the root causes behind why the forms were filed incorrectly. Rather than making an emotional reaction, Gordon should have looked at the processes, workloads, training, and other factors in the warehouse to determine how this error was able to happen. It may have been the case that Harry was overburdened with work, overloaded by complex processes with insufficient guidance, or not properly trained on the documentation procedures. Discussing the sequence of events with Harry that led up to the mistake would have shed light on these underlying issues. Gordon could then make an informed decision on appropriate next steps to correct the root causes, whether additional training, simplifying processes, hiring temporary help, or other measures. Punishing Harry may have addressed the surface issue but would not have fixed the origin of the problem, leaving the door open for future errors. 

In summary, Gordon would have benefitted from employing a servant leadership approach by listening, understanding, and collaborating with Harry. He should have used democratic decision making to gather input and buy-in from his team on how to remedy the situation. And Gordon should have critically analyzed the root causes of why the incorrect filing happened to begin with before deciding on a reactionary solution. By using these leadership theories and decision making processes, Gordon would have handled the situation with Harry and the forms in a much more constructive and sustainable manner.
