Bertolt Brecht's play The Threepenny Opera and Fritz Lang's film M offer strikingly different treatments of crime and justice  in Weimar Germany. While Brecht's work satirizes bourgeois morality and the failings of the justice system using low-level criminal figures in a distorted version of 18th-century London, Lang's film provides a harrowing look at a child murderer driven to his crimes by mental illness and social exclusion in contemporary Berlin. 

Brecht's play follows the exploits of Macheath, a gentleman highwayman, and his criminal gang. However, unlike typical portrayals of dashing rogues, Brecht's Macheath is a lecherous bully who exploits women and the poor. Brecht satirizes the bourgeoisie by making this unsavory figure their hero, highlighting their hypocrisy in glorifying a criminal just because of his class. The justice system also comes under fire, as Macheath escapes the gallows through a series of contrived plot twists and deus ex machinas reflecting the arbitrary nature of the law. Overall, Brecht uses the platform of a "bad boy" story to caricature the moral and legal failings of society.

In contrast, Lang's film M follows a child murderer named Hans Beckert, who is hunted by both the police and the criminal underworld. Rather than a romanticized vision of crime, Lang shows the dark, psychological motivations behind Beckert's actions and the damage they cause. Flashbacks reveal that Beckert was abused as a child and has a compulsion to kill, though he despises himself for it. This nuanced portrayal elicits sympathy for the murderer while not excusing his horrific crimes. Lang thus provides a more probing analysis of the root causes of evil than Brecht's satirical treatment of a petty rogue.  

The criminal spheres in the two works also differ significantly. In The Threepenny Opera, Macheath and his gang represent the lowest rungs of the London underworld, engaging in small-scale robberies and cons. Brecht portrays these petty criminals in an almost whimsical fashion, focusing more on witty songs and banter than any real sense of danger. In contrast, Lang's film deals with murders of innocent children, as well as with organized crime on a metropolitan scale. The criminal underworld that hunts Beckert is a sprawling network involved in racketeering and other sinister dealings throughout the city. This grittier vision of urban crime serves as a disturbing backdrop for Beckert's homicidal tendencies.

In terms of social and economic context, Brecht's work is a critique of the bourgeois values and legal system of 18th-century London, even though it was meant to reflect on Weimar Germany. Lang's film, on the other hand, examines how economic and social upheaval in post-World War I Berlin could contribute to the rise of criminal behavior, directly confronting contemporary issues like unemployment, poverty, and urban drift that were affecting Germany. The film suggests that Beckert may not have become a murderer if he had not been subject to societal failings and personal trauma from a young age. By acknowledging these extenuating circumstances, Lang shows more nuance in his understanding of crime's relation to the broader society than the satirical Brecht.

In conclusion, while Brecht's The Threepenny Opera and Lang's M are both seminal works addressing crime and justice in Weimar Germany, they offer radically different visions of criminal spheres, motivations, and responsibility. Brecht employs petty thieves and a rigged legal system to mock bourgeois morality, whereas Lang provides a haunting character study of a murderer caught between his own mental torment and the pitfalls of a dysfunctional society. Together, these works demonstrate the diversity of artistic responses to crime, punishment, and social conditions in the Weimar era.
