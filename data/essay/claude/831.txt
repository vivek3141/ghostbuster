The poem "Not a Nice Place" by Jay is a linguistic representation of violence and chaos through its use of lexis, phonetic patterning, and structural fragmentation.  

One of the most prominent ways the poem establishes a mood of disorder is through its use of lexical choices that connote violence and danger. Words like "smashed," "stabbed," "bitten," "attack," "threat," and "fear" recur throughout the poem, creating an ominous tone. The repetition of "smashed" in the first stanza, "Smashed bottles lie in corners, / Smashed windows stare like blinded eyes," gives the impression of widespread destruction and careless abandon. The personification of the "blinded eyes" of the windows further highlights the indiscriminate nature of the damage.

The poem also relies on harsh-sounding consonant clusters and a fast-paced rhythm to evoke a sense of chaos. The repetition of "smashed" is an example, with the crass consonant cluster "sm" followed by the abrasive "ash." Lines like "Threats are screamed, the walls are stained, / Damp filth and litter fill the drain" also use an abundance of hard "t", "k", and "d" sounds in quick succession to mimic the tumult of the scene. The rapidity of lines with mostly monosyllabic words, for example "Fear walks quick. The night walks weird.," also gives the impression of events happening in a disorderly hurry.

Finally, the lack of a predictable form or structure in the poem reflects the theme of chaos. The poem does not follow a regular rhyme scheme or metre. The lengths of lines and stanzas are irregular, with the first stanza containing six lines while the second only has two lines. This creates a disjointed and fragmented effect which resonates with the disorderly scene being depicted. The lack of coherence in the poem's structure thereby reflects the lack of coherence in the world it portrays.

In summary, the poem "Not a Nice Place" successfully establishes a mood of violence and chaos through its linguistic features. Lexical choices that denote danger and destruction, harsh phonetic elements that mimic clamor and pandemonium, and an irregular form all contribute to the poem's representation of disorder. The poem is a reflection of violence through its embodiment of chaos across all aspects of language.
