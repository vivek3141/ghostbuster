Patients with rheumatoid arthritis of the hand experience significant challenges in maintaining an exercise and splinting regime as prescribed by occupational therapists. A naturalistic, phenomenological research approach can be used to explore the lived experiences of these patients and understand the factors influencing their adherence to treatment. 

To explore these questions, semi-structured interviews with participants can be conducted to gain insights into their experiences with the treatment regime from their own perspectives. Open-ended questions will allow participants to describe their experiences in their own words. Participant diaries kept by the patients over a period of time will provide a longitudinal record of their experiences, challenges, feelings, and reactions to the treatment. Researcher diaries kept by the interviewers will capture their own reflections and insights gained through the process. These multiple data sources will enable triangulation to verify and enrich the findings.

Several ethical considerations must be addressed. Informed consent must be obtained from all participants after explaining the research objectives and what their participation will involve. Participants must understand that their participation is voluntary and they can withdraw at any time. Confidentiality must be ensured by removing any identifying information from the data and securely storing all records. The potential benefits of gaining valuable insights into patients’ experiences and identifying strategies to improve adherence to treatment must be weighed against any discomfort to participants. The research must be approved by an ethics review board.

To fully understand patients’ experiences, a naturalistic inquiry with a phenomenological emphasis on subjective experiences and meaning making is appropriate. Multiple qualitative data collection methods will be used to gather rich descriptions of the participants’ lived experiences of coping with the treatment regime for rheumatoid arthritis in their own words. By exploring both positive experiences that encourage adherence as well as challenges that discourage adherence, the research aims to identify factors influencing patients’ compliance with treatment to inform improved practice.
