The German model of corporate governance has some distinctive features compared to the Anglo-Saxon model dominant in the US and UK. In the German model, corporations have a two-tier board structure, with a supervisory board overseeing a management board. The supervisory board includes both shareholder and labor representatives, reflecting the view that corporations have obligations to multiple stakeholders, not just shareholders. Major German corporations also have large blockholders, like families and banks, holding significant ownership stakes. 

However, there are several factors that can undermine the stability and effectiveness of the German model of corporate governance. First, the role and influence of labor representatives on supervisory boards have been declining. Labor unions have faced general declines in membership and power in recent decades. They have had more difficulty getting their representatives elected to supervisory boards. Without strong labor voices, supervisory boards may focus more narrowly on shareholder interests rather than balancing the interests of multiple stakeholders.

Second, the size and influence of blockholders have also been declining in Germany. Family ownership of major corporations has become more diluted over time. And German banks, traditionally large investors in German corporations, have faced pressures to reduce their ownership stakes, in part due to regulatory changes. With more dispersed share ownership, corporations become more subject to pressures to maximize short-term share prices rather than take a long-term, stakeholder-oriented approach. 

Third, there is a risk of insularity in German corporate networks. Directors frequently serve on multiple boards, and many directors come from within tightly-knit business networks. While this can promote cooperation, it also means that new ideas and voices are less likely to penetrate boardrooms. Fresh perspectives are valuable in encouraging innovation and adapting to new challenges.

Finally, German corporations continue to be dominated by men, especially in leadership roles. Almost all members of executive boards and supervisory boards are male. Lack of gender diversity deprives companies of key talent and different perspectives. It also runs counter to principles of equal opportunity and social justice. Calls have increased for German companies to make real efforts to recruit, promote, and appoint more women to leadership roles.

In conclusion, the German model of corporate governance faces several serious challenges that could undermine its distinctiveness and effectiveness. Addressing issues like strengthening worker voices, limiting over-dependence on blockholders, diversifying board networks, and improving gender diversity would help Germany maintain its stakeholder-oriented approach to corporate governance. Failing to make progress on these issues risks convergence toward an Anglo-Saxon shareholder primacy model.
