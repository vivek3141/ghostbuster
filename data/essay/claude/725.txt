Slavery was a sensitive and contentious issue during the Romantic era in Britain, spanning from approximately 1770 to 1850. While slavery and the slave trade were still legal and widely practiced, there were growing abolitionist movements speaking out against the atrocities and inhumanity of slavery. Many literary works of the time grappled with slavery in complex and nuanced ways. Two such works that addressed slavery in compelling but very different ways are Jane Austen's novel Mansfield Park, published in 1814, and The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, an autobiographical slave narrative published in 1789 by the former slave Olaudah Equiano. 

While Austen's novels are typically preoccupied with the gentry and landed classes of early 19th-century England, Mansfield Park tackles the issue of slavery and its relation to English identity in a sublimated yet highly symbolic manner. The grand estate of Mansfield Park is supported by plantations in Antigua that rely on slave labor. However, slavery remains largely in the background and Austen focuses more on the moral education of the protagonist Fanny Price. By symbolically linking the cultivation and improvement of Fanny to the plantations in Antigua, Austen suggests a parallel between slavery and the restrictive patriarchal system that limits women's freedom and independence. The subtle way Austen introduces the issue allows readers to draw their own conclusions about the morality of slavery and its entanglement with English society.

In contrast, Equiano's slave narrative represents a direct and confrontational attack on slavery. His first-hand account of the horrors of slavery, including being kidnapped as a child in Africa, enduring the Middle Passage, and being enslaved in the West Indies, exposed the brutality of the institution to a wide readership. Equiano's narrative helped fuel the abolitionist movement and was instrumental in turning British public opinion against slavery. Unlike Austen's oblique and metaphorical treatment of slavery, Equiano gave slavery a human face and voiced the suffering of slaves in a vivid and emotionally affecting manner. His narrative disrupted the common rationalizations for slavery, making it difficult for readers to remain complacent or indifferent. 

Both Mansfield Park and The Interesting Narrative express the authors' strong moral condemnation of slavery, though they employ very different narrative strategies. Austen's subtlety allowed her critique to evade possible controversy and backlash, whereas Equiano's direct approach sought to provoke readers through a confrontational account of slavery's evils. Despite their different methods, both works were radical in their own right, questioning slavery at a time when abolitionism was still on the fringes of society. Through the theme of slavery, these works exposed the greed, hypocrisy and human suffering that underpinned England's status as an imperial superpower. They remain powerful examples of how Romantic literature explored in humane and enlightened ways the pressing social issues of the time.
