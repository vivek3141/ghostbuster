The utilitarian conception of justice, as articulated by philosophers like Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, holds that the most just action is the one that maximizes overall utility or happiness. This approach aims to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In contrast, John Rawls's theory of "justice as fairness" focuses on ensuring fair and equitable treatment of individuals, especially the most disadvantaged members of society.  

The utilitarian conception of justice has the advantage of aiming for outcomes that yield the maximum aggregate welfare or benefit. By focusing on maximizing the overall happiness or satisfaction in society, the utilitarian approach can justify decisions that improve overall well-being. However, a key weakness is that it can justify unfair distributions or policies that negatively impact minorities or disadvantaged groups as long as total utility increases. The interests of individuals can be sacrificed for the greater good of the whole. Rawls argues that this is unjust and that a fair system of justice must protect the basic rights and needs of every individual.

Rawls's theory of "justice as fairness" addresses this weakness by focusing on the equitable and just treatment of all members of society, especially the least advantaged. Rawls argues for the adoption of principles of justice that would be agreed upon in a hypothetical "original position" behind a "veil of ignorance." Not knowing their own personal circumstances, individuals would choose principles that ensure fair and reasonable treatment for all. This results in guaranteeing basic rights, liberties, and meeting the basic needs of every individual. However, a potential criticism of Rawls's theory is that by focusing so intently on the least advantaged members of society, it does not sufficiently take into account the overall welfare of the community as a whole. In some cases, the aggregate well-being may be enhanced by policies that do not maximize the position of the least well off.

In conclusion, while the utilitarian conception of justice aims for the greatest good for the greatest number, Rawls's theory of "justice as fairness" provides a superior alternative by ensuring the just and equitable treatment of all members of society, especially the most disadvantaged. The utilitarian approach risks justifying unfairness and a lack of concern for individual rights in the pursuit of maximum aggregate welfare. Rawls's theory addresses these ethical shortcomings by requiring principles of justice that guarantee fairness and protect the basic needs and rights of every individual. Overall, Rawls's conception of justice as fairness is superior in that it is consistent with fundamental ethical principles of justice, equality, and human rights. At the same time, a desirable system of justice should not ignore overall societal welfare and thus some consideration of aggregate outcomes remains important as well. A balanced perspective that incorporates both utilitarian and fairness-based considerations may be needed for the most ethical and just governance.
