There are three broad functional categories of English that are interconnected: semantics, grammar, and pragmatics. Within these categories lies the area of modality, which refers to the level of certainty, obligation, or likelihood expressed  in an utterance. Modality can be conveyed through words, phrases, and grammatical structures.

Semantics deals with the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. Different modal verbs, adverbs, and adjectives are used to express modality in English, such as may, must, possibly, necessarily, likely, unlikely. These words and phrases vary in the degree of modality conveyed, from possibility to necessity and weak obligation to strong obligation. For example, the modal verb may indicates possibility while must indicates obligation or necessity. Adverbs like possibly show weak or intermediate levels of modality while necessarily shows a strong level.

Grammar refers to the rules of a language, including syntax and morphology. Within English grammar, modal verbs are a means for expressing modality. The modal verbs commonly used for this purpose in English are can/could, may/might, shall/should, will/would, and must. These modals appear before another verb and can convey meanings such as ability, permission, possibility, obligation, prediction, necessity, and volition. For example, the sentence "I should go to work early tomorrow" uses the modal verb should to express weak obligation. Morphological features like modal auxiliaries are also used for modality, as in the phrase "I'm going to go" which expresses volition or intention.

Pragmatics focuses on the context and function behind language, looking at how modality is used in actual discourse and communication. Speakers use modality to convey stances, express opinions and arguments, engage in politeness strategies, provide guidance or advice, and more. For example, a sentence like "You must try this new restaurant I found" uses a strong modal (must) to indicate obligation as a way of providing a recommendation. Modality is fundamental to how we interact through language.

There is a clear relationship between form and function when it comes to modality. The type of modal used, whether a verb, adverb, adjective or other linguistic feature, determines the level or type of modality conveyed. Stronger modals indicate higher necessity or obligation while weaker ones convey possibility or permission. Modality cannot be expressed without formal elements in a language.

Mood and modality are distinct categories, though related. Mood refers to the syntactic marking of modality in some languages through verbal inflections. English only has two moods marked morphologically on verbs: the indicative and imperative. However, modality in English is primarily expressed through modal verbs, auxiliaries, and other lexical items. Some grammarians view modality as a semantic system, some as pragmatic, and others as straddling semantics and pragmatics. Regardless of definition, modality is a complex linguistic phenomenon fundamental to human interaction and discourse.
