When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected President of the United States in 1932, both nations were still suffering the devastating consequences of the Great Depression. Mass unemployment, economic stagnation and social turmoil plagued both societies. In response, the Nazi and New Deal governments embarked on ambitious programs of social and economic reforms aimed at recovery and stabilizing their nations. However, while there were some similarities in their approaches, the Nazi reforms were far more extreme, repressive and ultimately transformed Germany into a totalitarian dictatorship. 

Both the Nazi and New Deal governments focused on job creation to reduce mass unemployment which was over 30% in Germany and 25% in the US at the time. The Nazis implemented massive public works programs, building roads, buildings and autobahns. They also pursued rearmament and expanding the military to create more jobs. The New Deal created agencies like the Civilian Conservation Corps, Public Works Administration and Works Progress Administration which employed millions in public works projects, though not on the scale of Nazi Germany. However, the Nazis went much further in controlling labor, abolishing trade unions and establishing the German Labor Front to regiment the workforce. The New Deal, on the other hand, passed legislation protecting labor rights, like the Wagner Act of 1935.

Industrial recovery was also a priority for both governments. The Nazis provided subsidies and incentives for key industries like steel, coal and automobile production. They also pursued an autarky policy, restricting foreign trade and investment to stimulate domestic industries. The New Deal also bailed out industries, regulated production and prices, and the National Recovery Administration set industrial codes to boost production and prices. However, the US policies were not as rigidly enforced as in Germany and preserved more room for private business autonomy. The Nazis effectively seized control of economic decision making, subordinating private industry to the state in service of rearmament and autarky. 

Both governments also expanded social welfare and insurance programs. The Nazis established the People's Welfare organization for healthcare, unemployment insurance, pensions and leisure programs. Roosevelt also passed Social Security, expanded welfare, provided relief for the poor and unemployed, and established regulatory agencies over food, drugs and banking. However, social welfare was more universal and generous in Germany, aimed at winning popular support. In the US, programs were more modest due to opposition from business interests and a desire to preserve private enterprise.

There were marked differences in state relations with interest groups as well. The Nazis abolished trade unions and all political opposition, giving them a free hand to control workers and pursue radical policies without dissent. The New Deal faced opposition from the conservative Supreme Court, Republicans and business interests who saw some reforms as threatening private property and free enterprise. The US system of checks and balances and democratic norms put constraints on how far Roosevelt could push in reforming capitalism. The Nazis had no such limitations in forging their command economy.  

In conclusion, while Roosevelt and Hitler came to power at similar times during the Depression and expanded government intervention to stimulate recovery, their societies took diverging paths. The totalitarian Nazi regime was able to achieve full employment and recovery sooner through extreme control, disempowerment of opposition and militarization of society beyond what democracies would tolerate. The New Deal extended social and economic relief and recovery through democratic institutions and preserving civil liberties - a balancing act democracies must endure in times of crisis. Both experiences shaped modern debates on the role of government and its relationship to society and the economy.
