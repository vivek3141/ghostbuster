Tetrachromacy is the condition of possessing four types of functioning color cone cells in the eyes, instead of the normal three color cones. This allows tetrachromats to see a wider range of colors compared to trichromats. Anomalous trichromacy refers to having three functioning color cones but with altered sensitivities, resulting in slightly different color perception. In humans, tetrachromacy and anomalous trichromacy are linked to the X chromosome, as the genes for medium- and long-wavelength sensitive cones are located on the X chromosome. 

Females have two X chromosomes, while males have only one X and one Y chromosome. In females, one X chromosome in each cell is randomly inactivated early in embryonic development, a process known as X inactivation. This results in different color cone cells being expressed in different parts of the retina and brain. In heterozygous female carriers of anomalies in the red and green color cone pigments, this X inactivation can lead to tetrachromatic vision if the inactivation results in both normal and anomalous color cones being functionally expressed in the retina.

The most common form of anomalous trichromacy is deuteranomaly, in which the medium-wavelength-sensitive (M) cones express a shifted red (L) pigment. This results in reduced sensitivity to green light. In heterozygous females (M/L), the random inactivation of one X chromosome means that in some parts of the retina the normal M pigment may be expressed, while in other parts the shifted L pigment may be expressed instead. This can enable trichromatic color discrimination in the former parts, and enhanced red-green color discrimination in the latter parts. This mosaic expression of normal and shifted color pigments in the retina effectively gives such females four distinct color channels - the hallmark of tetrachromatic vision.

Evidence for enhanced color discrimination in heterozygous females comes from studies demonstrating improved color discrimination along the red-green axis, improved color memory and naming, and higher color aptitude. Subjective reports from potential tetrachromats also indicate seeing a wider variety and richer diversity of colors, more so than in typical trichromatic individuals. Combined, this evidence supports a mechanism of X-linked tetrachromacy from the random inactivation of X chromosomes carrying normal and anomalous red and green color pigments in heterozygous female carriers. Overall, the manifestation of the fourth, shifted "red" photoreceptor in addition to the normal set of cones leads to enhanced color perception and discrimination in ways that provide both empirical as well as anecdotal evidence for tetrachromatic vision.
