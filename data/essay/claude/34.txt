The Russian Civil War was one of the deadliest conflicts of the early twentieth century, lasting from 1917 to 1922. The war is commonly viewed as a struggle between the Bolshevik Red Army and the anti-communist White Army. However, the involvement of neutral peasant groups known as the Greens challenged this simplistic narrative and complicated the factors driving the conflict. There were several key factors that contributed to the eruption of the Russian Civil War, including political instability, foreign intervention, economic turmoil, and popular uprisings that rejected both Bolshevik and White control.   

The February Revolution of 1917 led to the overthrow of Tsar Nicholas II and the Russian monarchy that had ruled for centuries. The provisional government that replaced the Tsar was weak and fractured, unable to enact real reforms or provide stability. The Bolshevik coup in October 1917 further undermined any central political authority, as Vladimir Lenin and the communist Reds seized control of Petrograd and Moscow. This power vacuum and instability contributed to the conditions that allowed the civil war to break out. Various political and military groups vied to fill the authority vacuum, from pro-Tsarist Whites to independence movements.   

Foreign powers also intervened in the civil war, supporting the anti-communist Whites and intensifying the conflict. Forces from Britain, France, the United States and others allied with White generals in hopes of defeating the Reds, undermining the Bolshevik regime, and possibly reshaping Russia's politics to their benefit. For example, Britain sent naval forces to blockade Russia's coasts, the U.S. sent troops to Arkhangelsk and Vladivostok, and France and Britain supported White leaders. Foreign involvement escalated the scale and destructiveness of the fighting, as the Reds mobilized to counter foreign interventions and gain allies of their own.

The Russian economy was also in shambles after years of fighting in World War I, contributing to the unrest that fueled the civil war. Agricultural output had declined drastically, and food shortages were rampant in cities. Hyperinflation and the collapse of infrastructure made economic conditions dire. The Bolshevik promise to redistribute land and resources to the peasants attracted some support. At the same time, their harsh policies and forced requisitions of grain and supplies also incited unrest and resistance. Economic troubles destabilized society and intensified grievances, fueling the spread of violence.   

Finally, and most importantly, the Russian peasantry formed independent Green armies that opposed both the Reds and the Whites, escalating and complicating the war. The Greens were primarily concerned with protecting their local villages and obtaining land, food, and autonomy. They resisted and revolted against the Reds' policy of "war communism" that requisitioned supplies and nationalized land, as well as White armies passing through their territory. The Greens complicated the notion of the civil war as a fight between Reds and Whites. They resisted both sides at times and allied with either side at others, mainly acting based on their own interests. The Greens' uprisings and fighting were a significant factor fueling violence, unrest, and the scale of the conflict.      

In conclusion, the Russian Civil War was the result of the political instability, foreign interventions, economic troubles, and independent peasant uprisings. The Greens were not strictly anti-Bolshevik but acted based primarily on their local interests, resisting control from both the communist Reds and the pro-Tsarist Whites. They demonstrate that the conflict was not as straightforward as a war between Reds and Whites, but was driven by a variety of forces that shaped its outcome and immense destruction. Overall, no single factor caused the Russian Civil War, but the combination of political, social and economic turmoil that followed the Russian Revolution, as well as the proliferation of armed groups vying for power, led to the outbreak of violence.
