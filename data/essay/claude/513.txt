Evaluate Mao's legacy, specifically focusing on his economic policies, and examine how these policies relate to communist ideology. Consider the perceptions of party leaders and the people during Mao's time in office, as well as changes since Mao's death. Additionally, take into account the difficulties in establishing true communism and the economic calculation problem. 

Mao Zedong had an immense impact on China during his time as leader of the Communist Party, from 1949 until his death in 1976. His radical economic policies sought to rapidly transform China into a communist society but often failed to meet the promises of communist ideology and caused tremendous suffering. Mao's economic legacy is complex and contested, with supporters pointing to increased industrialization and critics decrying policies that led to famine and disrupted livelihoods.

Mao's early economic policies aligned with Marxist doctrine, focusing on collectivization of agriculture and rapid industrialization. The first Five-Year Plan (1953-1957) emphasized heavy industry growth, with the government taking control of major economic sectors. The Great Leap Forward (1958-1962) went further, attempting to transform China into a communist utopia through forced collectivization and unrealistic production quotas. However, these policies were disasters, as agricultural collectivization led to famine and the unrealistic industrial targets caused economic turmoil. Despite the failures of the Great Leap Forward, Mao maintained his cult of personality and power within the Communist Party.

In the mid-1960s, Mao launched the Cultural Revolution, shutting down schools and economic institutions to purged dissidents and reassert ideological control. The violence and chaos of the Cultural Revolution further weakened the economy. By Mao's death, China was isolated and impoverished, having failed to achieve a functioning communist system.

Following Mao's death, Deng Xiaoping and other leaders pushed for economic reforms and opening up to foreign investment. They recognized the failures of Mao's radical policies and sought to develop a "socialist market economy." Agriculture was decollectivized, and industrial production became more market-driven and globally integrated. These reforms rapidly improved living standards and economic growth. In evaluating Mao's legacy, the post-Mao Communist Party has had to balance his prestige as a revolutionary leader with the recognition that his radical policies were disastrous failures that did not achieve a communist utopia.

Mao's time as China's paramount leader highlights the vast difficulties in establishing a communist system. The collectivization and central planning that Mao pushed failed due to the economic calculation problem: the inability of governments to efficiently allocate resources without market mechanisms. Mao's cult of personality and desire for ideological control also led to irrational policies divorced from economic realities. For these reasons, China's communist system largely failed until market reforms were introduced after Mao's death.

In conclusion, Mao's economic legacy is highly contested. He sought rapid communist transformation of China but instead oversaw policies that caused tremendous suffering and failed to achieve their goals. His legacy serves as a warning for the immense challenges of imposing ideological visions without consideration of economic realities. At the same time, the prestige of Mao's cult of personality has given the Communist Party political legitimacy, even as they have moved far from his radical vision. Mao's complex legacy continues to shape China today.
