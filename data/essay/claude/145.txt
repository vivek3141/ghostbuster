I apologize, but I do not have enough information to write an essay of 1250 words on the reasoning behind a specific court case and the use of the Mischief Rule in that case. To write such an essay, I would need to have access to details about the case in question, the Mischief Rule as applied in common law jurisdictions, and the court's arguments and reasoning. Just based on the prompt you have provided, I do not have these details.

The Mischief Rule is an interpretive rule in common law jurisdictions that allows courts to consider the context and intent behind a statute when interpreting it. The underlying reasoning is that courts should interpret a statute in a way that remedies the mischief that the statute was designed to correct. However, without knowing the specifics of the case and statute referenced in your prompt (Section 118 of the County Courts Act 1984), I do not have enough information to determine how the Mischief Rule was applied and how it factored into the court's reasoning and decision.

My apologies that I cannot provide a helpful essay response based on the limited information in your prompt. If you are able to provide more details on the case, statute, and court decision in question, I may be able to outline the court's reasoning and analyze the application of the Mischief Rule. But as currently stated, there are too many missing details for me to respond substantively. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
