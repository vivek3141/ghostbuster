Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS is a potentially fatal respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV virus. SARS impacts respiratory function and gas exchange in the lungs by damaging pneumocytes, causing airspace consolidation, pulmonary edema, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and hypoxemia. 

SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV, which is believed to have originally infected animals like civet cats and then spread to humans. The SARS outbreak began in China in 2002 and resulted in over 8,000 cases and 774 deaths across 37 countries before being contained in 2004. The pathogenic effects of SARS begin when the SARS-CoV virus enters the lungs through inhalation and infects epithelial cells in the lower respiratory tract, especially pneumocytes. Pneumocytes are cells in the alveoli responsible for gas exchange, and destruction of these cells impairs respiratory function.

On a histological level, SARS causes diffuse alveolar damage including cell necrosis, pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial inflammation. Pulmonary edema refers to fluid accumulation in the lungs, which reduces the diffusion capacity of the lungs and inhibits gas exchange. The inflammation and fluid in the interstitium, the connective tissue surrounding alveoli, cause ventilation/perfusion mismatch. This means that air flow in the lungs (ventilation) does not match blood flow (perfusion) in the capillaries, resulting in wasted ventilation and impaired oxygenation of the blood. 

The damage to pneumocytes and pulmonary edema also leads to airspace consolidation, where air spaces in the lungs fill with fluid and inflammatory cells. This reduces overall lung volume and compliance, making it difficult for patients to inhale fully. Consolidation also inhibits gas diffusion by blocking oxygen from reaching the bloodstream and carbon dioxide from exiting the bloodstream. These impairments in gas exchange and mechanics of respiration manifest clinically as shortness of breath and hypoxemia, or low blood oxygen levels.

In summary, SARS has a significant impact on respiratory function through the infection and destruction of pneumocytes, development of pulmonary edema and air space consolidation, and ventilation/perfusion mismatch. The histological changes in the lungs ultimately impair both oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange, leading to respiratory failure and hypoxemia if not supported medically. This critical illness highlights how delicate the balance of the respiratory system is, and how a novel virus can exploit this vulnerability to devastating effect.
