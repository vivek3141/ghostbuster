The first generation speculative attack model, developed by Paul Krugman in 1979, provides a theoretical framework for explaining how fixed exchange rate regimes can collapse under speculative pressure. However, the model has several limitations in fully capturing the complexity of speculative attacks and currency crises. 

First, the model assumes that a speculative attack is triggered solely by economic fundamentals, such as fiscal and monetary policies that are inconsistent with maintaining the fixed exchange rate. In reality, speculative attacks are often driven by a combination of economic and political factors. For example, the 1992-93 ERM crisis was exacerbated by political uncertainty over European integration and conflicting policy objectives among member countries. The model fails to incorporate these political and policy factors.

Second, the model predicts a sudden and massive speculative attack that leads to an immediate collapse of the fixed exchange rate regime. In practice, most speculative attacks involve waves of gradually intensifying speculative pressure over months or years. For instance, multiple speculative attacks on the Thai baht occurred between 1995 to 1997 before its eventual free float. A gradual and prolonged attack is more difficult to counter as it erodes investor confidence and policymakers’ credibility over time. The basic model does not capture this dynamic process.

Third, the model implies a clear distinction between scenarios of successful defense and unsuccessful collapse. Reality often lies in between, with partial adjustments to the exchange rate and a regime that is precariously maintained for a period. For example, Britain withdrew from the ERM in 1992 but remained in a wide band until fully floating in 1995. The model cannot account for this middle ground of ‘injured’ fixed rates. 

These limitations can be addressed through various extensions to the model. A broader set of economic and political determinants of speculative pressure can be incorporated. The dynamics of protracted speculative attacks and gradual policy adjustments can be modelled using game theory, which analyses strategic interactions between policymakers and speculators. More complex scenarios with band adjustments and temporary suspensions of convertibility can also be considered.

Empirical evidence that can support these model extensions include data on the intensification of political conflicts and deterioration of fundamentals leading up to some currency crises, as well as a documentation of the ’waves’ of speculative pressure for prolonged crises. Data also show that most crises were resolved not by an immediate collapse or defense of the peg but rather a gradual transition to a new regime, whether a float, a wide band, or a completely new peg. Overall, while the first generation model provides crucial insights into the logic of speculative attacks, extensions of both theoretical scope and empirical grounding are needed to fully understand this complex economic phenomenon.
