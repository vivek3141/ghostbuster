There are several key questions that designers must consider when developing a new system, regardless of the specific application or domain. By identifying these critical questions upfront through an open-ended brainstorming process, designers can isolate the most important aspects of the system design and ensure they are effectively addressed. 

One of the first questions to explore is what the purpose or goal of the new system is. Any effective system design must start by defining the problem it is trying to solve or the need it aims to meet. In the case of a National Air Traffic Control System, the goal is to safely and efficiently coordinate aircraft in a country's airspace. With a new engine  design, the purpose could be to increase power output, improve fuel efficiency, or reduce emissions. Clarifying the objective at the outset provides guidance and constraints for all subsequent design decisions.

Another essential question is who the end users of the system will be. In determining the users, designers must consider the roles, responsibilities, skills, and needs of all individuals who will interact with or be impacted by the system. For an air traffic control system, this includes air traffic controllers, commercial and private pilots, airport ground crews, and passengers. For an engine, users could include vehicle manufacturers, mechanics, and vehicle owners. Understanding the users informs critical design choices around interfaces, accessibility, training, and functionality.

A third important question examines what the key functions and requirements of the system are to achieve its stated purpose. This question begins to define the capabilities and specifications of the design. An air traffic control system, for example, requires functions for communicating with aircraft, tracking aircraft locations, maintaining safe separation distances between aircraft, coordinating take-offs and landings, displaying aircraft positions, and recording aircraft data. An engine design requires functions for air intake, fuel injection, ignition, exhaust, cooling, lubrication, and power transmission at minimum. Determining the necessary functions provides a framework for the initial high-level design.  

Using an open brainstorming approach, with input from a diverse set of experts and stakeholders, to explore these types of fundamental questions around purpose, users, and requirements helps isolate the most critical design factors before delving into potential solutions. For an air traffic control system, brainstorming with commercial pilots, air traffic controllers, aerospace engineers, and software designers would provide a range of perspectives to define what is needed. Similarly, for an engine, input from automotive engineers, environmental experts, manufacturers, and consumers could drive a broad consideration of design objectives and priorities.  

Considering the example of redesigning a National Air Traffic Control System, the key questions around purpose, users, and requirements could be explored through a series of collaborative brainstorming sessions. The goal is highlighted as increasing the safety, efficiency, and capacity of aircraft management in national airspace. The primary users are identified as air traffic controllers, pilots, and passengers. And essential functions are defined as communication with aircraft, tracking aircraft positions, ensuring safe separation, coordinating take-offs and landings, displaying aircraft locations, and recording aircraft data.   

With these questions as a foundation, high-level design sketches could emerge for a renewed system with new technologies like satellite navigation, automated aircraft separation, electronic data interchange between aircraft and the ground, and digitized voice and data communications. Additional brainstorming around the operational concepts, human interfaces, software and hardware components, transition challenges, and implementation processes for these new technologies could yield an initial outline for how an updated National Air Traffic Control System might work to achieve the stated objectives. Overall, using brainstorming to first isolate the fundamental questions around purpose, users, and requirements allows for more targeted, effective design exploration.
