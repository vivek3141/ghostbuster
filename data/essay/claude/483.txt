The Spanish conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires in the early 16th century was a pivotal moment in world history that led to the demise of two prominent Native American civilizations. Despite the many similarities between the Aztecs and Incas, including their advanced art, politics, culture, and religion, several key factors enabled only a few hundred Spanish conquistadors to topple empires of millions. 

The most significant advantage the Spanish had over the natives was their superior military technology. The Spanish had steel weapons, cannons, firearms, warships, and attack animals like horses that gave them a lethal tactical edge. In contrast, the Aztecs and Incas relied on wooden clubs, spears, bows and arrows, and had no experience defending against cavalry or cannons. This technology gap allowed the Spanish to overcome the massive numerical superiority of the natives and inflict disproportionate casualties from a distance.

The Spanish were also aided by native dissidents who were subject peoples of the Aztec and Inca empires. These dissident groups deeply resented their overlords and allied with the Spanish to overthrow them. For example, the Tlaxcalans allied with Cortes to defeat the Aztecs, providing over 200,000 native warriors. Pizarro also coopted Inca rivals to topple their empire. These alliances allowed the Spanish to field native armies of their own and gain invaluable local knowledge that contributed to their success.

While the Aztecs and Incas shared some similarities in religion, culture, and arts, there were also key differences that affected how the Spanish interacted with and conquered them. The Aztecs were a militaristic empire centered in Tenochtitlan (modern-day Mexico City) that relied on force and intimidation to subjugate neighboring tribes. The Aztecs practiced human sacrifice and their religion was steeped in violence. In contrast, the Inca Empire was more decentralized and pacifistic. They practiced folk religions and ancestor worship. The Inca did not emphasize military conquest and preferred to assimilate tribes through negotiation and cultural imperialism.  

These differences impacted how the Spanish engaged with them. The violence and human sacrifice of the Aztecs gave the Spanish a moral justification to attack them. The superior defenses and military prowess of Tenochtitlan also required a lengthy siege by Cortes to overcome. The Spanish were able to take advantage of civil war and succession disputes within the Inca Empire to initially befriend the Inca before betraying them, since they were less militarily formidable. Pizarro kidnapped and executed the Inca ruler Atahualpa, dealing them a devastating blow.   

In conclusion, the Spanish were able to conquer the mighty Aztec and Inca empires through a combination of superior technology, alliances with native dissidents, and adaptations to the unique characteristics of each civilization. The hubris of both empires and their failure to unite against the Spanish also facilitated their downfall, highlighting the role of human folly in shaping history. The Spanish victory changed the course of history in the Americas and ushered in centuries of colonial rule.
