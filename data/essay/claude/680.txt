Michel Foucault was one of the most influential thinkers on sexuality and power in the 20th century. Through his books like The History of Sexuality, Volume 1, Foucault challenged dominant views about sexuality that saw it as repressed by power. Instead, Foucault argued that power actively produced discourses and knowledges about sexuality that shaped how individuals came to understand and experience their own sexuality. In particular, Foucault explored how the Catholic practice of confession and the discourses of sexology medicalized and pathologized sex, regulating it through structures of knowledge and power. 

Foucault rejected what he called the “repressive hypothesis”—the idea that sexuality was repressed in the 19th century by bourgeois morality and power. In contrast, Foucault argued that the Victorians were obsessed with sex and produced myriad discourses analyzing and categorizing sexual acts, desires, and identities. Rather than seeing power as only repressive, Foucault viewed it as productive, creating new objects of knowledge like “the homosexual” or “the hysterical woman.” These classifications did not liberate true inner sexual identities but instead produced new categories of self-understanding that individuals internalized.

Foucault explored how specific institutions and practices, like the Catholic confessional, shaped sexual discourse and experience. In confession, individuals were required to divulge their sexual thoughts, desires, and acts to establish their moral purity. This demand for exhaustive self-examination created a sexualized inner self that could be studied and regulated. The confessional also established a model of power based on constant surveillance from the judging gaze of the priest. Individuals thus learned to survey and judge their own interior sexual selves in anticipation of that gaze.

Foucault also examined how sexologists adopted the confessional model in their studies of sexuality. Sexologists claimed scientific objectivity in analyzing human sexuality, but Foucault argued their “scientific” discourses were suffused with moral judgments that pathologized non-normative sexualities. Publications by sexologists established categories like “the homosexual” as a distinct and deviant type of person. These works did not liberate but regulated sexuality by producing a norm of healthy heterosexuality against which all other sexual acts and identities were deemed pathological. 

Foucault’s analysis provides insight into how power shapes sexuality through productive strategies, not just repression. His work illustrates how discourses gain authority not simply through force but by appearing objective or liberating. Foucault also suggests power is diffuse, circulating through all of society, rather than emanating from a central authority. However, Foucault’s theories have been criticized for portraying individuals as passive recipients of societal control and for lacking an analysis of gender and sexual politics. His approach can obscure how marginalized groups actively resist domination and the role of human agency in critique and change.

In conclusion, Foucault was instrumental in developing a theory of power as productive rather than merely repressive. His analyses of the confessional and scientific sexuality discourses illustrate how power constructs sexuality and desire. Foucault articulated a vision of power as circulating through accepted knowledges and norms, rather than centralized in a single authority, providing an important framework for studying the interactions of power, knowledge, and identity. However, subsequent theorists have extended and challenged his approach by emphasizing feminist and queer politics, human agency, and resistance to provide a more politically enabling analysis of sexuality and power.
