Aristotle and John Locke were two of the most influential Empiricist philosophers, who believed that knowledge is gained primarily from experience and observation. While they shared some similar views on the importance of the senses and reason in gaining knowledge, there were also key differences in their philosophical positions. 

Both Aristotle and Locke argued that knowledge begins with sensation. For Aristotle, sensation is the foundation for all knowledge. He believed that the human mind is like a "blank slate" at birth, and we gain all knowledge from the senses. Similarly, Locke argued in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding that the mind is like a "blank paper," and we gain knowledge through experiences that come through the senses. For both philosophers, the senses provide the raw material that the mind then processes through reason and cognition.

However, Aristotle and Locke differed in their views on innate ideas and the role of reason. Aristotle believed that in addition to sense experience, humans have certain innate ideas and first principles that are not learned through the senses. For example, the basic idea that "the whole is greater than the part" is innate. Locke, on the other hand, rejected the notion of innate ideas. He believed that all knowledge comes from sense experience alone, and reason develops ideas by reflecting on what the senses convey. Reason has an important constructive role, but it builds all knowledge from the senses.

Both philosophers made important contributions to theories of substance and categorization. Aristotle proposed that any entity consists of "substance"â€”its essence or true nature. He also developed a system of categorizing substances into groups sharing common attributes. Locke defined substance in a different way, as something that exists independently, rather than an essence. But like Aristotle, Locke believed we gain knowledge through categorizing and conceptualizing substances based on their shared qualities. However, Locke argued such categories are constructs of the human mind, rather than natural kinds as Aristotle believed.

Finally, Aristotle and Locke differed in their views on the role of experimentation. Aristotle was more focused on observation, logic, and speculation than on active experimentation. Locke emphasized the importance of experimentation, especially in natural philosophy, as a way of actively interrogating nature to gain knowledge. Locke helped pave the way for the Scientific Revolution with his arguments for an experimental and evidence-based approach to gaining knowledge about the natural world.

In conclusion, while Aristotle and Locke shared some similar positions as Empiricist philosophers who believed knowledge is gained from experience and sensation, there were significant differences in their views on reason, innate ideas, substance, and the role of experimentation that reflected their own times. Both made lasting contributions to theories of knowledge, perception, and science.
