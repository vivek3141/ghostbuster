Witchcraft and sorcery have held an enduring and significant place in many African societies, despite often being misunderstood and portrayed negatively by outsiders. While witchcraft is frequently thought of as harmful and irrational, it plays an important role in addressing historical, cultural, social, and spiritual concerns for some African communities. 

Witchcraft has deep roots in African history, predating the arrival of Abrahamic religions on the continent. Traditional African religions that center on ancestor worship, spirit possession, and magic have incorporated beliefs in witchcraft for centuries. Even as religions have changed, these cultural roots remain. Those who practice witchcraft, such as sorcerers, witches, and witch doctors, are seen as a connection to these historical African spiritual traditions by some. These practitioners also play roles in rites of passage, healing, divination, and other cultural practices that link communities to their ancestors and past.

Socially, witchcraft serves as a way to explain misfortune and address conflict within African communities. Belief in witchcraft is used to make sense of illness, accidents, unemployment, infertility, and death. It provides a spiritual explanation for random or unexplained suffering. Witchcraft also allows people to ascribe blame for their suffering, often accusing those with whom they have conflicts. Neighbors who do not get along or heirs who feel cheated of inheritance may blame one another of practising witchcraft. While outsiders see this as harmful, within the culture it allows for resolution and rebuilding of social bonds.

Witchcraft also continues to serve a spiritual purpose for believers through practices like divination, spirit possession, and protection spells. Sorcerers and witch doctors provide a means to navigate uncertain futures, communicate with spirits, and defend against evil forces. Their powers are believed to harness spiritual forces to serve and protect the community. The persistence of belief in witchcraft shows that for some Africans the spiritual solace and purpose it provides continues to outweigh the potential harm.

Outsiders frequently view witchcraft in Africa as a destructive, irrational, and backward practice. Colonial powers saw witchcraft as a sign of the perceived primitiveness of Africans and tried to eliminate its practice. Christian missionaries also sought to convert those who believed in witchcraft and saw the belief as incompatible with their faith. Governments often outlaw the most controversial practices. However, despite stigmatization, belief in witchcraft as an integral part of culture, society, and spirituality has endured for many Africans.    

While witchcraft takes on many meanings, at its heart it addresses the fundamental human desires to make sense of the random, place blame in uncertain times, heal suffering, and feel in control of spiritual forces. For many Africans, witchcraft fulfills these needs, and thus remains significant and resilient despite outside condemnation. Overall, witchcraft persists in many African societies because it has historically, culturally and socially become interwoven into the very fabric of certain communities.
