The normalisation thesis refers to the concept that recreational drug use has become a normal part of youth culture and identity. According to Parker et al (1998), the normalisation thesis comprises three central ideas: first, drug use has become more widespread and integrated into youth lifestyles and identity; second, there has been a disconnect between the law and social norms regarding acceptability of drug use; and third, there has been a diversification of drugs available and patterns of drug use.  

The widespread prevalence of drug use amongst youth has reinforced the perception that it is a normal rite of passage. Surveys show the majority of youth have tried an illicit drug by their late teens, with cannabis being the most common (Parker et al 1998). This commonality and integration into youth lifestyle has promoted a sense of normalcy, whereby drug use is seen as just another part of growing up and being young. Parker argues that “drug use has lost much of its marginal and oppositional character; it has become quite simply a part of youth culture” (Parker et al 1998, p.143).

There is also a disparity between legislation and social attitudes on drugs, according to the normalisation thesis. Despite the illegality of substances like cannabis and MDMA, social disapproval has declined and recreational use has been increasingly tolerated, especially in youth culture (Parker et al 1998; Measham et al 2001). This incongruity has further reinforced the notion among youth that drug use is reasonably normal and acceptable. Young people are aware of this disparity, with Parker et al’s (1998) participants expressing the view that certain drugs like cannabis are “not really illegal anymore” and that “the police have given up”. This perception of de facto legalisation and social sanctioning normalises drug use.

Finally, the diversification of drugs and patterns of use has also supported the normalisation thesis. The range of drugs available to young people has proliferated, from cannabis and pills to powders like ketamine and mephedrone (Parker et al 1998; Measham et al 2011). The use of multiple drugs, known as ‘polydrug use’, has also become popular. These trends suggest that normalisation is not just about the prevalence of a particular drug, but rather how “drug use fits into a whole lifestyle in which different drugs are used at different times for different reasons” (Parker et al 1998, p.151). For many youth, drugs have become tools for identity expression, social bonding and pleasure seeking.

An interview with a young adult, say a 23-year-old university student, could provide insight into how normalised attitudes and behaviours around drugs manifest at an individual level. With appropriate informed consent, a semi-structured interview discussing their perceptions and personal experiences of recreational drug use during their youth could yield rich data. For example, they could be asked about the perceived normality or acceptability of certain drugs like cannabis and MDMA among their peers, how this has changed over their lifetime, what factors have influenced their own choices regarding drug use, and how their patterns of use have developed.

There are important ethical considerations when conducting research on illegal behaviours. Anonymity and confidentiality would need to be assured to avoid legal repercussions or reputational damage. The participant would need to provide fully informed consent which outlines the nature of questions about their drug use and their rights. The researcher must establish rapport and trust while also maintaining objectivity. Additionally, in reporting and discussing the interview data, care would be taken to remove potentially identifiable details.

Reflexivity is also essential, as the researcher’s own experiences, attitudes and biases regarding drug use could influence the interview and analysis. These need to be acknowledged and accounted for to produce credible and trustworthy research. Overall, combining theories like the normalisation thesis with qualitative data from interviews can provide powerful insights into the status and experience of normalised drug use among young people today.
