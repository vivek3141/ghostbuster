Traditional yield management techniques have focused on optimizing room revenue at a hotel. However, as hotel businesses have grown more complex, new decision-making approaches have been proposed to improve overall profitability rather than just room revenue. These new approaches take a more holistic view of hotel operations and aim to maximize total hotel profit.

One of the earliest new decision-making approaches was revenue management, which took into account additional revenue streams beyond just rooms like food and beverage, meeting spaces, and other ancillary revenues. Revenue management aims  to optimize pricing and availability across all revenue centers in a hotel to maximize total revenue. This was an improvement over yield managementâ€™s narrow focus on rooms revenue, but revenue management still has some limitations. It does not account for the costs associated with generating the revenue and therefore may not actually maximize profit. 

To address this shortcoming, hotels adopted a profit management approach. The key idea behind profit management is to make pricing and availability decisions that aim to maximize total profit contribution, which is defined as total revenue minus marginal costs. Profit management requires having detailed information on both revenues and costs across all hotel operations so managers can determine how to optimize profit. This data-driven approach is an improvement over revenue management, but profit management may also fall short because marginal costs do not reflect all costs and also do not capture opportunity costs.

Opportunity cost refers to the cost of lost opportunities by allocating resources in a certain way. To account for opportunity costs, some hotels use total hotel profit optimization. This approach aims to maximize total profit while considering all costs - fixed, variable, and opportunity costs. It involves using advanced analytics to model how all of a hotel's pricing, staffing, marketing, and operating decisions impact total profit. By understanding these complex relationships and interactions, hotels can make optimized decisions that maximize profit. 

In summary, there are several techniques proposed to improve decision making beyond traditional yield management. Revenue management takes a broader view of revenue to include food, beverage and other streams. Profit management builds on this by also incorporating marginal costs into the analysis. Total hotel profit optimization is the most advanced approach, using data analytics to gain insights into how all operating decisions interrelate to maximize total profit when considering all costs. The approaches build on one another, with each adding more sophistication. For large, complex hotel operations, total hotel profit optimization is likely the best approach to optimize overall profits. However, smaller hotels may benefit sufficiently from revenue management or profit management approaches due to their simpler business models. In the end, the right choice for any hotel depends on their size, business model complexity, data analytics capabilities, and profit optimization goals.
