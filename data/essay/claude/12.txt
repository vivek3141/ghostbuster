Growth kinetics is the study of bacterial growth in an isolated culture. Scientists can use growth kinetics to examine the different phases of bacterial growth and calculate bacteria growth parameters such as growth rate, generation time, and carrying capacity. These growth parameters are useful for identifying unknown bacteria species in a mixed culture and determining the composition and proportions of bacteria in a sample. 

To study growth kinetics, bacteria are inoculated in a sterile growth medium and incubated at the optimal temperature for growth. The population size is measured over time by counting colony forming units on agar plates or using spectrophotometry to measure turbidity. Four phases of growth are typically observed: lag phase, exponential (log) phase, stationary phase, and death phase. 

In the lag phase, bacteria are acclimating to the new environment but not actively dividing. In the exponential phase, bacteria divide at a constant rate, and the population grows exponentially with time. The generation time, or time required for the population to double, can be calculated from the exponential growth rate. As nutrients deplete and waste products accumulate, growth slows and enters the stationary phase where birth and death rates stabilize at zero population growth. Finally, in the death phase, the death rate exceeds the birth rate, and the population declines.

To identify unknown bacteria in a mixed culture, growth kinetics can be determined for each species individually and compared to the mixed culture. Nine bacteria species—Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes—were studied in isolated cultures. Growth was measured using spectrophotometry, and growth parameters were calculated for each species.

In the mixed culture, the growth curve showed a short lag phase, followed by an exponential phase growth rate of 0.42 hr-1. Based on the generation times of the nine species, this growth rate matched E. coli, P. mirabilis, and S. epidermidis. In the stationary phase, the maximum population density was 1.3x109 cells/mL, matching the carrying capacities of E. coli and P. mirabilis. Microscopy and biochemical tests identified that the mixed culture contained mostly Gram-negative bacteria. From this, it can be concluded that the mixed culture predominantly contained E. coli and P. mirabilis, with a small amount of S. epidermidis.

In summary, studying growth kinetics of isolated bacteria species and comparing to a mixed culture can be used to determine the composition of unknown bacterial samples. By measuring parameters such as growth rate, generation time, and carrying capacity, individual species can be identified and their proportions in the overall population estimated. Culturing and staining methods provide further confirmation to characterize the bacterial composition. Growth kinetics provides a useful methodology for exploring bacterial growth and identifying microbes in environmental and clinical samples.
