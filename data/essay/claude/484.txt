The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan portrays femininity and masculinity in complex and contrasting ways. The narrative follows four mother-daughter duos and their experiences as Chinese-American immigrants. In particular, the stories paint a picture of Chinese women adopting and balancing more submissive "traditional" feminine gender roles with more assertive roles needed to survive and adapt in America. In contrast, Chinese men struggle to adapt to loss of patriarchal power in America and cling to outdated gender stereotypes. 

The mothers in the book were raised in pre-World War 2 China where they learned to be obedient, self-sacrificing, and subordinate to men. Their daughters, however, grow up in America and adopt more modern and assertive feminine roles. An example is Jing-mei "June" Woo, raised by her widowed mother Suyuan to pursue her dreams and talents without restraint. However, Suyuan also teaches June self-sacrificing behavior like giving the bigger, better half of an orange or candy to her twin half-sisters in China. This demonstrates the blend of traditional feminine obedience with modern feminine independence.

The mothers come to America but struggle to adapt to the loss of status and power relative to their husbands. An-mei Hsu's mother was a concubine who disfigured herself to escape a cruel master, demonstrating the plight of powerless women in old China. However, in America An-mei and the other mothers gain more independence and authority over their own lives and households. This transition is difficult for their husbands, like An-mei's husband who clings to outdated patriarchal attitudes. The resulting conflicts portray the masculine struggle to adapt to social changes that undermine male privilege and dominance.  

In contrast, the story of Ying-ying St. Clair and her daughter Lena highlights the masculine inability to understand feminine power. Ying-ying was a bold and rebellious girl in China who learned to hide her "sharp instincts" to please her husband. She tries to teach Lena the same, but Lena fails to understand her mother's subtle feminine power and wisdom.  Lena's Americanized husband likewise dismisses Ying-ying, highlighting the cross-cultural masculine failure to recognize and respect feminine strength.

In conclusion, The Joy Luck Club portrays femininity in transition, as Chinese immigrant women navigate the old culture where they were subordinate to the new, where they are increasingly assertive and empowered. Their husbands and sons, in turn, struggle in the face of these social changes, clinging to outdated stereotypes of masculine dominance and authority. The result is intergenerational and intercultural conflicts that highlight how conceptions of gender roles shape our expectations and understanding of one another. Overall, the book paints a poignant portrait of the feminine journey to empowerment as mothers teach daughters to stand up for themselves in a way they never could.
