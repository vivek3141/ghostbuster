The goals of Routledge's marketing campaign for EMCS are to promote awareness of the interdisciplinary combination of European history and media/communications concepts offered by the journal, increase subscriptions and readership, especially among academics and researchers in the UK and Europe, and increase engagement with and usage of electronic articles and multimedia content on the EMCS website.  

To reach target readers in Europe, Routledge employs a multi-pronged marketing strategy that balances the traditional academic journal in print form with electronic and multimedia publications that are increasingly important for researchers. For the print journal, Routledge targets history and media/communications departments in universities across the UK and Europe, offering trial subscriptions and promoting the interdisciplinary nature of research in the journal that bridges European history and media studies. They also exhibit at major academic conferences to increase visibility and connect with researchers directly.

However, Routledge also recognizes the shift towards electronic resources and open access for academic research. The EMCS website offers electronic access to current and archived journal articles, as well as multimedia content like interactive timelines, image galleries, and video lectures. The website is optimized for search engine visibility, especially among European researchers, and Routledge promotes new electronic content through social media platforms like Twitter that are popular with academics. Email newsletters highlighting recently published e-articles and multimedia also drive traffic and usage of these resources.

To increase subscriptions, in addition to trial offers and conference promotion, Routledge likely offers discounted subscription bundles that include both print and electronic access and may partner with university libraries and library consortia to make EMCS available as part of a package deal. For individual subscribers, especially students, lower-cost electronic-only subscription options are also available.  

In terms of measuring progress, Routledge likely tracks metrics like the number of print subscriptions, e-article downloads, website visitors, citations of EMCS articles, social media engagement, and multimedia usage or time spent on the site. They also probably survey current subscribers periodically to gauge satisfaction and areas for improvement. Social media and email newsletters similarly provide an opportunity for reader feedback and comments on content or the user experience.  

Overall, Routledge aims to position EMCS as an premier interdisciplinary journal and multimedia resource at the intersection of European studies and media/communications. By balancing traditional and electronic forms of publication, offering flexible and discounted subscription models, optimizing online discoverability, engaging with readers at academic events and via social media, promoting multimedia content, and monitoring key metrics and subscriber feedback, the marketing campaign seeks to achieve steady growth in subscriptions, readership, and engagement over time.
