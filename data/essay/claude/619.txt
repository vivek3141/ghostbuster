Clayton Ltd should consider several factors when determining how to fund its expansion into the internet, including the financial condition of the business, cost of different funding options, and impact on operations. Financial ratio analysis can provide insight into the company's ability to repay debt and interest costs of different funding sources. 

First, Clayton Ltd should examine its financial ratios to assess its ability to take on additional debt. Important ratios include the debt-to-equity ratio to determine the company's financial leverage, and interest coverage ratio to assess how easily it can pay interest costs. If these ratios indicate high debt levels and limited ability to pay interest, the company should avoid taking on substantial new debt to fund its expansion. Equity financing through issuance of new shares may be preferable in this scenario.

Second, Clayton Ltd should evaluate the costs of different funding options, including interest rates on debt, any fees associated with loans or lines of credit, and the potential dilution of control/ownership from equity issuance. Debt financing, such as bank loans, typically has lower upfront fees but results in interest costs over the life of the loan. Equity financing avoids interest costs but often comes with higher upfront underwriting and legal fees. The company should choose an option that balances cost with its financial condition.

Third, Clayton Ltd should consider how each funding option might impact business operations. Taking on substantial new debt may limit the company's borrowing ability for other needs and subject it to restrictive covenants. Additionally, interest costs reduce profitability and cash flows. Equity financing avoids these issues but results in a more dispersed ownership structure. The company should opt for a funding source that provides adequate capital with the fewest restrictions and least impact on control and operations.

Finally, Clayton Ltd should factor in its level of liquid assets that could be used to fund part of the expansion. Retained earnings and cash holdings represent low-cost sources of financing that avoid the issues with debt and equity financing. If the company has limited liquid assets, it will need to rely more heavily on external funding sources for its expansion plans. However, even if substantial liquid assets are available, a combination of different funding sources may be used to maximize financial flexibility and stability. 

In summary, Clayton Ltd should consider financial health, costs, business impact, and liquid assets when determining how to fund its expansion. Financial ratio analysis, specifically of debt and liquidity metrics, helps assess which options are most feasible based on the company's ability to repay debt and finance costs. A balanced choice and combination of funding sources is the most prudent approach to support expansion in a financially sustainable way.
