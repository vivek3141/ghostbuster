The Phillips Curve refers to the historical inverse relationship between the level of unemployment and the rate of inflation in an economy. In the short run, the Phillips Curve suggests that lower unemployment is associated with higher inflation, and vice versa. However, this relationship broke down during the 1970s stagflation crisis, when many economies experienced both high unemployment and high inflation at the same time. 

Economists from different schools of thought proposed several theories to explain the breakdown of the Phillips Curve. The Keynesian perspective focused on cost-push factors like the 1973 oil crisis, which caused a sudden rise in production costs and inflationary pressures. The rise in oil prices increased business costs, but businesses were unable to lower wages due to long-term labor contracts. As a result, higher production costs were passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, even as unemployment rose. The Keynesians argued that such supply shocks caused stagflation, rather than a fundamental change in the relationship between inflation and unemployment.

In contrast, monetarists like Milton Friedman argued that excessive money supply growth was the primary culprit behind the 1970s stagflation. According to Friedman, the Federal Reserve had loosened monetary policy too aggressively, causing an excessive rise in nominal demand that fueled inflation. At the same time, the economy was operating near full employment, so the rise in demand only led to higher prices without improving employment. To curb stagflation, Friedman argued for tighter control of money supply to bring inflation under control. 

Finally, the neo-classical school focused on the role of inflation expectations. They argued that during the 1970s, public expectations of higher inflation caused workers and businesses to behave in ways that sustained higher inflation and unemployment. As inflation rose in the late 1960s, people came to expect higher future inflation. Workers demanded higher wages to compensate for expected price rises, while businesses raised prices preemptively. These behaviors caused a wage-price spiral and inertia in inflation, even as the economy weakened. The neo-classicals saw stabilizing inflation expectations as key to restoring the Phillips Curve.

In conclusion, the Phillips Curve relationship broke down due to a combination of factors like oil shocks, excess demand, and entrenched inflation expectations. The crisis highlighted the need for policymakers to consider both aggregate demand and supply-side factors in managing the economy and inflation...
