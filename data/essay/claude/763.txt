Catering Plan for Scholarship Luncheon Fundraiser 

For this catering plan, I will outline the key details for a scholarship fundraiser luncheon event for 200 guests. The luncheon will feature a plated three-course meal showcasing local and organic ingredients. 

Service Style: For an event of this scale, a plated meal service is most appropriate. It allows for an elegant and organized meal service that can be carefully timed and executed. Servers will bring meals to each table at once, with guests selecting their entrée choice in advance. A plated meal also ensures that each guest receives a high-quality, beautifully presented meal. 

Menu: The menu will start with an appetizer of artisanal cheese, meats, and olives along with focaccia bread. The first course will be a seasonal salad with mixed organic greens, roasted beets, walnuts, and an orange vinaigrette. For the main course, guests will choose between pan-seared chicken with wild rice and asparagus or mushroom risotto with truffle oil and parmesan. Dessert will be a classic tiramisu garnished with fresh berries. Organic coffee and tea will also be served. 

Costing: The per-head cost for this menu, including food, staffing, rentals, and gratuity, will be $75. The total cost for the event will be $15,000. High-quality, sustainable ingredients will comprise a significant portion of the budget. Donations and sponsorships will be solicited to subsidize a portion of the costs.

Equipment and Rentals: Additional tables, linens, glassware, flatware, and dinnerware will need to be rented for the event. Display stations and platters will also be needed for the appetizer course. Sterno heaters will be required for keeping the appetizers at proper temperature before service. Espresso machine required for  preparing coffee and tea.

Staff: Executive chef, two sous chefs, event captain, two bartenders, and 12 servers. All staff must have a food safety certification and experience with events of this scale. Staff will assist with setup, service, and cleanup. They will ensure high quality and timely execution of all aspects of the catering plan. 

Quality Control and Storage: Ingredients must be sourced from approved local and sustainable  purveyors. Strict temperature controls will be enforced for both transport and storage of ingredients and prepared dishes before and during the event. Hot foods must remain above 60°C and cold foods below 4°C at all times. All leftover food must be properly packaged and donated after the event in accordance with food safety best practices.  

In summary, success for a plated scholarship fundraiser luncheon of this size relies on careful organization, high-quality sustainable ingredients, experienced staff, and diligent attention to food safety. With the catering plan outlined, guests will enjoy an elegant meal in support of a meaningful cause.
