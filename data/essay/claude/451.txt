Theories have been proposed to explain how children may learn aggressive behavior from viewing aggression in media. The general theory is that children, especially younger ones, emulate the behaviors they observe, a process known as modeling or imitation. Seeing aggressive acts portrayed on screen, the theory goes, teaches children those behaviors and makes aggression seem normal and acceptable.

Research has explored these concerns through both survey studies and experimental methods. Survey research finds a correlation between the amount of television violence children view and their aggressive behavior, especially for younger children. However, correlation does not prove causation. Experiments provide stronger evidence, as they can control variables and establish cause and effect. Many experiments have found that viewing violent media, especially cartoons, leads to more aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behavior in children immediately afterwards. 

The immediate effects of violent television that researchers have found include more aggressive thoughts, angrier feelings, and more aggressive behavior such as hitting or yelling at peers. These impacts tend to be greater for younger children, especially those under 7 years old. Longer-term effects of sustained violent television viewing that are more concerning include an increased tendency toward physical aggression into adolescence and adulthood, acceptance of aggression as normal, and development of an aggressive personality.   

Physical aggression refers to acts that can cause physical harm like hitting, punching or kicking. Indirect aggression refers to non-physical acts like teasing, social exclusion, gossiping and bullying. Both types of aggression are associated with viewing media violence in children, but physical aggression may be of greater concern because of the immediate danger of harm. Indirect aggression, however, can also have severe long-term psychological impacts on victims.

In summary, theories of modeling and social learning propose that children can learn aggressive behaviors from watching them on television. Research supports these theories, finding links between violent television and aggression in children, especially younger kids. Both immediate and long-term effects have been found, with physical aggression of most concern in the short term and the development of an aggressive personality of concern in the long run. Parents should monitor what their children view and set healthy limits to mitigate these impacts, focusing on preventing the potential effects of both physical and indirect aggression.
