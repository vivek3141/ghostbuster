Many humans prefer walking and running as a form of transportation and exercise. The evolution of bipedal locomotion in humans provides several mechanical advantages that drive this preference. A simple mechanical model can describe the forces and energetics involved in human bipedal gait. This model can then be extended to quadrupedal gaits in other animals.

Humans have evolved anatomical adaptions for walking and running on two legs. These include changes to the shape of the spine, pelvis, feet, and legs that allow for efficient upright walking. Walking on two legs frees the hands for carrying objects, using tools, and manipulating the environment. This provides a significant evolutionary advantage over quadrupedal locomotion. In addition, walking and running provide exercise that has benefits for both physical and mental health. The repetitive muscle contractions and impacts during gait help strengthen bones and muscles. The increased heart rate provides aerobic exercise. And the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine during exercise leads to positive mood and stress reduction.

A simple mechanical model of bipedal gait considers the forces acting on the body and the work done by those forces. The primary forces are the ground reaction forces that push the body upwards and forwards. The body's center of mass moves up and down and side to side during each step. The work done by the ground reaction force accelerates the body's center of mass during the step and provides energy to lift and swing the limbs. The energetics of walking and running can be described by calculating the mechanical work per step and the metabolic cost of that work. Efficient gaits minimize energy expenditure.

This simple model can be extended to quadrupedal locomotion by considering the additional supporting limbs. Quadrupeds have a lower center of mass, so less work is required to lift and swing the limbs. However, quadrupeds must still raise their body mass with each step, so the total mechanical work per unit of distance traveled may be higher than in humans. The specific adaptations of the limb anatomy in different quadrupeds also impact their energetic efficiency. Animals that have evolved primarily for cursorial (running) locomotion, like horses, have anatomical specializations that make their galloping gait highly efficient. In contrast, heavy animals that also use their limbs for manipulation or climbing, like bears, tend to have higher energy expenditure during quadrupedal walking and running.

In summary, humans prefer walking and running due to the evolutionary adaptations and advantages of the bipedal gait. A simple mechanical model explains how bipedal walking works and how it can be efficient. This model can be extended to understand quadrupedal locomotion by incorporating additional limbs and considering specific anatomical specializations. Understanding the mechanics behind these forms of locomotion provides insights into both human and animal movement and physiology.
