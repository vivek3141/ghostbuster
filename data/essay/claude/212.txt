Legal and Practical Advice for Mick Regarding Child Support and Contact with His Child

Mick, you have recently been contacted by the child support agency regarding a child you fathered through sperm donation to your friend Delia several years ago. Delia is now seeking child support from you for your biological child. This situation brings up two key issues you need to address: your legal obligations for child support, and your options for establishing contact with your child, if you desire.

Regarding child support, as the biological father you will likely be legally obligated to pay child support for your child. Most courts use guidelines to determine a reasonable child support amount based on factors like your income, Delia's income, the child's needs, and the custody and visitation arrangement. While you may be able to negotiate the amount with Delia, if you cannot agree the court will make a determination. I would advise you to cooperate fully with the child support agency to provide your financial information. Contesting your responsibility is unlikely to be successful given your biological paternity and may only serve to damage your relationship with Delia and your child further. 

On the issue of contact and establishing a relationship with your child, the situation becomes more complex. As a sperm donor, you did not intend to act as a parent to the child, and Delia has been the child's sole legal parent until now. However, as the biological father you may desire to get to know your child. I would advise the following:

First, reflect carefully on what type of relationship you want with your child and why you want contact now. Be open and honest with yourself about your motivations and expectations. 

Second, reach out to Delia directly to express your desire to be in contact with your child. Explain your reflection process and motivation. Be open and receptive to Delia's perspective as the legal parent. Request to start gradually, perhaps by meeting your child or exchanging letters and photos. Let Delia set the pace of contact.

Third, if Delia is not open to contact, you may need to obtain a court order for visitation or contact. However, I would advise pursuing this only as a last resort. Going to court could damage your co-parenting relationship with Delia and cause stress for your child. It may be better to start with indirect forms of contact that Delia will allow, with the hopes of building up to more over time as she becomes comfortable. 

Finally, if contact is established, go slowly, be consistent, and focus on your child's wellbeing. Respect Delia's role as the primary parent. Most of all, appreciate this new opportunity in your life to get to know your child, even if the situation is not what you had envisioned. With time and effort, you may be able to build a meaningful relationship.

In summary, cooperate fully with child support obligations. Take time to reflect on the type of relationship you want with your child. Aim to reach an agreement with Delia gradually and respectfully by communicating openly and honestly as co-parents. Establishing contact may take time and patience, but can be incredibly rewarding. I wish you the very best moving forward. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
