Emotions and memory are deeply intertwined in the human mind. Our moods and feelings have a significant impact on how we create and retrieve memories. When we experience an event, our emotional state shapes how that memory is encoded and stored for later recall. Similarly, when we retrieve a memory, our current emotional and motivational state influences what memories come to mind and how we reconstruct the details. 

Mood congruency is the tendency to recall memories that match our current emotional state. When we are sad, we are more prone to recalling other sad memories. When happy, we tend to remember other happy times. This is partially because emotional states prime us to think about similar concepts and experiences. But mood also actively guides our memory search processes, making memories of the same emotional tenor more accessible. For example, in one study participants were put into a sad, neutral or happy mood and then asked to recall personal memories. Those in a sad mood retrieved more sad memories, neutral mood prompted more varied memories, and happy mood led to recalling more happy memories.

The intensity of our emotions also matters. Powerful, arousing emotional experiences at the time of encoding lead to stronger, more vivid memories. This is known as the arousal effect. We remember emotional events, especially traumatic or intensely meaningful life events, with more details because our mind recognizes the importance of remembering the details for the future. Emotionally charged memories are often etched into our mind, for better or worse. 

The emotion we feel when retrieving a memory further shapes how that memory is reconstructed and re-experienced. We tend to exaggerate the intensity and importance of the emotions we felt during events we recall, in line with our current mood. So the same memory can be recalled quite differently at different times based on transient influences on our mood and motivations. This is why two former friends can remember a shared experience so differentlyâ€”their  later emotions color their memories.   

Inevitably, most memories fade over time through a process called forgetting. But emotional memories resist forgetting and can remain vivid even decades later. This persistence of emotional memories is thought to stem from both their initial potency and their tendency to be reactivated and reinforced through recollection when similar emotional states are experienced again. Each time we retrieve a memory, we must reconstruct it, and it is altered in ways that can amplify the emotion further. This cyclical process gives powerfully emotional memories a longevity that sustains them.

In summary, our memories are in a perpetual state of flux and deeply influenced by emotion. Mood affects how and what we remember at both encoding and retrieval. Emotional arousal drives our ability to build detailed memories, while mood congruency and current feelings shape how memories are searched and reconstructed. The symbiotic relationship between emotion and memory is complex but essential to navigating and learning from the experiences of our lives.
