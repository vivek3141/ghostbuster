There were several reasons why large numbers of women were accused of witchcraft in sixteenth and seventeenth century England. First, women were disproportionately associated with witchcraft in popular belief and culture during this time. Societal and religious notions portrayed women as more susceptible to the Devil's charms and more likely to collude with evil spirits. Women were also often depicted as witches in popular culture like plays, ballads, woodcuts, and pamphlets. This cultural stereotyping made them easy scapegoats when misfortune struck. 

Second, women faced disadvantages in the legal system during this period that made them vulnerable to accusations of witchcraft. They had more limited legal rights and protections compared to men. Women had a harder time defending themselves in court or countering accusations against them. Their weakened legal and social positions meant their reputations and lives were more easily ruined by such charges.

Third, women who were poor, elderly, sickly, mentally ill, or in some way did not conform to societal expectations were frequently accused of witchcraft. Those on the margins of society were more prone to suspicion and hatred from their neighbors. They also lacked social support systems that could have shielded them from specious allegations or defended them if accused. Many accused witches fit into these marginalized categories, suggesting their vulnerability attracted the label of "witch."   

Finally, local power dynamics and personal grudges could also spur witchcraft accusations, especially against women. Accusing one's neighbor of witchcraft was a way to damage their reputation or force them from the community. Disputes over property, romantic relationships, or other local conflicts commonly triggered witchcraft allegations as a way to gain power over a rival or adversary. Women were frequently the objects of such malicious accusations due to their reputations and lack of standing.

In conclusion, the high numbers of women accused of witchcraft reflected their disadvantaged and disempowered status in English society during this period. They faced greater suspicion of witchcraft due to cultural stereotypes, less ability to defend themselves legally, and more vulnerability if they did not conform to social norms. They were also more prone to malicious accusations motivated by local disputes and power plays. These factors, combined with a widespread belief in the dangers of witchcraft, led to the high proportion of women targeted by witch hunts in sixteenth and seventeenth century England.
