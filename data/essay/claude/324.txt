The doctrine of privity in contract law refers to the principle that only parties to a contract can enforce it or benefit from it. Third parties not involved in the formation of the contract have historically had no rights to enforce contractual terms or gain from any benefits. The doctrine of privity emerged in English contract law in the 18th and 19th centuries and  continued to be strictly applied for much of the 20th century. However, its relevance has declined in recent decades due to judicial decisions and statutes expanding third party rights. 

The doctrine of privity was first articulated in the English case of Tweddle v Atkinson in 1861. The court held that a third party beneficiary of a contract lacked standing to sue to enforce it, even though the contract was made for their benefit. This established the principle that only parties to a contract, with "privity of contract" could take action to enforce contractual terms. The doctrine was reaffirmed in the English case of Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd in 1915.

The doctrine of privity aimed to provide certainty in contractual relations and limit litigation from peripheral parties. However, it often produced unjust results, as third parties that were intended beneficiaries of contracts were left unable to enforce them. In response, the English courts and legislature developed exceptions to the doctrine of privity in the mid-20th century. The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 further curtailed the doctrine, giving third party rights to enforce contracts made for their benefit.

The doctrine of privity has also declined in relevance in common law jurisdictions outside England, including the U.S., Canada, and Australia. U.S. courts recognized early exceptions for third party beneficiaries of life insurance contracts, then expanded their rights through the "intended beneficiary" doctrine. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts in 1981 formally recognized third party rights to enforce contracts made for their benefit. Most U.S. states have adopted the Restatement position.

The doctrine of privity is closely related to the doctrine of consideration in contract law. Consideration refers to something of value promised in exchange for a promise. Historically, English courts held that only parties providing consideration were entitled to enforce a contract, aligning with the doctrine of privity. But as privity has declined, the provision of consideration is no longer required to grant third parties the right to enforce contracts made for their benefit. 

In conclusion, the doctrine of privity established an important principle that only parties to a contract could benefit from or enforce it. However, its strict application has declined substantially due to concerns of unjust results and lack of flexibility. Most common law jurisdictions now recognize that third party beneficiaries should have rights to enforce contracts made for their benefit. While privity was once inextricably linked to consideration, these doctrines have now diverged, as consideration is unnecessary to grant third parties a right to enforce contracts. The historical development and current relevance of the doctrine of privity illustrates how contract law evolves to meet the changing needs and expectations of commercial relationships.
