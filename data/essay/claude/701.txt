How Does the Androcentric Nature of Realism in International Relations Contribute to Human Rights Violations?

Realism is one of the dominant schools of thought in international relations. Realists believe that the international system is anarchic, as there is no higher governing authority over nation states. Thus, states must rely on self-help to ensure their own security and survival. Realists argue that states should maximize their power and act in their own self-interest. They view the world as a competitive system where relative gains matter more than absolute gains. 

This realist logic has often justified policies that lead to human rights violations. Because states are concerned primarily with their own security, the rights and well-being of individuals are secondary considerations at best. The androcentric assumptions underlying realism—that states behave like self-interested individuals in an anarchic system—bleed into policies that reflect a narrow, masculinized view of security and self-interest. This contributes to policies that violate human rights in several key ways.

First, the realist logic of survival and self-help justifies violence as a means of maximizing state security. If states exist in a dog-eat-dog world where only power matters, then using force to gain power or defeat rivals is seen as necessary for survival. But the use of force inevitably leads to loss of human life and violations of rights. From interstate wars to civil conflicts to repressive crackdowns on dissent, realism provides justification for policies that violate rights in the name of security. The masculine view of security as victory over rivals enables these abusive practices.

Second, realism encourages states to view individuals and groups as means to an end rather than ends in themselves. If the state is the primary actor and its security is paramount, then the lives and rights of individuals can be sacrificed for the greater good of the state. Repression of dissent, restrictions on civil liberties, torture of alleged enemies, and even genocide are justified when framed as protecting the state. The androcentric logic of realism does not recognize more feminine conceptions of security that prioritize the well-being of individuals. So policies that violate rights are seen as a natural outgrowth of the realist ethos.
