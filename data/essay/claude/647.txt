Temporal discounting describes our tendency to devalue or discount rewards and costs that occur in the future relative to the present moment. For example, when offered the choice between $50 today or $100 a year from today, many people will choose the immediate $50 even though the $100 is objectively the larger amount. This tendency to discount future rewards is related to risk aversion in decision making. Both tendencies arise from limitations in human cognition related to evaluating uncertain and delayed outcomes.

Normative theories of decision making, like expected utility theory, propose that people should make rational decisions by objectively evaluating the outcomes and probabilities of options. According to expected utility theory, a person should be indifferent between receiving $100 today or in one year, since the amount is the same. However, we know from extensive research that people do not follow the prescriptions of expected utility theory and instead exhibit temporal discounting and risk aversion. 

Prospect theory offers a descriptive theory of decision making that captures these behavioral tendencies. According to prospect theory, people evaluate options relative to a reference point, often the status quo, and exhibit loss aversion, where losses loom larger than gains. People also tend to overweigh small probabilities and underweigh moderate and high probabilities. These principles describe in a mathematically precise way the tendencies toward temporal discounting and risk aversion that we observe in human choice behavior. 

In real-world decision making, temporal discounting and risk aversion are important biases to consider as they can lead to poor choices and suboptimal outcomes. Some ways to address these biases include: grouping together outcomes temporally (so that rewards are not too delayed), providing opportunities to learn from delayed experience, using choice architecture to make the implications of temporal discounting and risk aversion more salient, and conducting a "behavioral audit" of major decisions. In some cases, there are also policy tools, like using default rules, that can be implemented to encourage people to make choices aligned with their long-term interests. 

Overall, there are deep relationships between how we value time and how we evaluate risks that lead to systematic biases in human judgment and choice. Recognizing these biases and taking steps to address them can lead to improved decision making at both an individual and societal level. With an understanding of prospect theory and how people deviate from expected utility theory, we can design choice environments, policies, and interventions to encourage more forward-looking choices.
