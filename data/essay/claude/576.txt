Environmental law in the European Union has evolved significantly since the EU was first established. In the early days of the European Economic Community, environmental protection was not a priority. The primary goals were economic growth, trade expansion, and market integration. However, as environmental challenges and public concern grew in the 1970s, the EU began developing a body of environmental law and policy. 

Today, the EU has a substantial volume of environmental legislation and a number of key principles that guide its environmental law. The precautionary principle states that action can be taken against potential environmental harm even without full scientific certainty. The polluter pays principle requires that polluters bear the cost of pollution control and remediation. The integration principle means that environmental protection must be integrated into all EU policies and activities. And the principle of sustainable development aims to balance economic, social, and environmental needs for both present and future generations.

The EU employs several major instruments to achieve its environmental objectives. Environmental directives set binding objectives but leave implementation details to member states. Regulations are directly applicable in member states. Decisions apply to specific parties or situations. The EU can also use market-based instruments like charges, taxes, and tradable permit systems. Enforcement tools include court actions against non-compliant member states.

There are inherent challenges, however, in reconciling economic priorities with environmental goals. Economic growth often depends on activities like trade, transport, agriculture, mining, and industry that can degrade the environment. This can create a paradox where policies aimed at boosting the economy end up undermining environmental protection. The EU struggles with this and tries to advance environmental sustainability while maintaining economic competitiveness. But critics argue more needs to be done to move to a greener economy and more sustainable models of production and consumption. 

In conclusion, EU environmental law has evolved from almost nonexistent to substantial. But reconciling environmental protection and economic growth remains problematic. The EU legal and policy frameworks aim for sustainable development, but achieving a green economy in practice continues to be an elusive goal, demonstrating the paradoxes that arise when balancing economic and environmental priorities. Overall, the evolution of EU environmental law reflects the broader challenge of societies addressing environmental issues while pursuing economic progress.
