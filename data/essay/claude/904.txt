The concept of elasticity plays a crucial role in analyzing the effects of government policies aimed at reducing traffic congestion and encouraging the use of public transport. Elasticity refers to how sensitive consumers are to changes in prices or other factors. Generally speaking, the more elastic the demand for a product or service is, the more consumers will change their behavior in response to price changes or other incentives. 

For transportation policy, there are two main types of elasticity that are relevant: elasticity of demand for driving and elasticity of demand for public transit. If the demand for driving is relatively inelastic, small increases in costs like road tolls, fuel taxes or parking fees will not significantly reduce traffic volumes. People will continue driving because they have little choice or ability to change their behavior. However, if demand for driving is more elastic, the same small changes in costs will result in a more substantial drop in traffic as people find alternative modes of transport or travel less.

Similarly, the elasticity of demand for public transit determines how effective policies to promote bus, rail and other transit options will be. If demand is relatively inelastic, lowering fares or improving services will not do much to increase ridership. But if demand is elastic, the same improvements can drive a large increase in the use of public transport.  Understanding these sources of responsiveness and unresponsiveness is key to developing policies that will effectively achieve environmental and social goals.

For example, many cities implement congestion charging zones that charge vehicles to drive into certain high-traffic city center areas. Whether these charges actually reduce congestion depends on the elasticity of demand for driving during those times and in those places. In London, Stockholm and Singapore, congestion charges were somewhat effective at cutting down traffic in part because demand for driving was still moderately elastic at the time. However, if demand had been highly inelastic, the charges may have had little impact.

The elasticity of demand for public transit is also important for the success of congestion charging. If demand for buses, trains and trams servicing the congestion charge zone is elastic, more people will switch to these modes following the introduction of the charge. But if demand is inelastic, most drivers will simply pay the charge and continue driving, limiting the benefits. Some cities phase in congestion charges gradually or use revenues to improve public transit in the zone to increase its elasticity and effectiveness.

Finally, the elasticity of demand for driving to and from airports can determine the impact of policies such as improved transit connections and increased parking fees. If demand is inelastic because travelers have no other way to get to airports, policies will raise costs without changing behavior much. But if there are good alternatives like airport express buses and trains, demand is more elastic. Improvements to these services can then significantly reduce traffic volumes by encouraging mode shifts. For any policy to manage transportation demand and reduce congestion, understanding the relevant sources of elasticity and inelasticity is vital.
