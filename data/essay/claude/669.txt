The Chancery Division’s role in regulating and developing trusts law in England and Wales changed substantially between 1953 and 2003. In the early part of this period, the Chancery Division took a hands-off approach to trusts law, emphasizing the importance of settlor intent and trustee discretion. However, over time, the court became more willing to intervene in trusts to prevent abuse and ensure equitable outcomes. This changing attitude is reflected in the court’s evolving views on tax avoidance through trusts.  

In the 1950s and 1960s, the Chancery Division emphasized the importance of settlor intent and trustee discretion. Judges were reluctant to interfere in trusts and disturb the settlor’s wishes. For example, in Chapman v Chapman (1954), the court upheld a trust that favored male beneficiaries over females, even though such unequal treatment would be unlawful today. The court also gave trustees wide discretion, as seen in Re Manisty’s Settlement (1974), where trustees were allowed to accumulate and retain income for over 40 years.

However, in the 1970s and 1980s, the Chancery Division began to take a more robust role in regulating trusts. The court demonstrated a willingness to intervene when trusts were being used for tax avoidance. In Barclays Bank v Quistclose (1970), the court established the Quistclose trust to prevent funds from being used for improper tax avoidance purposes. And in McPhail v Doulton (1971), the court formulated the “bad boy” trust, allowing for intervention if trustees were behaving improperly. 

In the 1990s and 2000s, the Chancery Division took an increasingly proactive role in trusts law. The court showed greater awareness of the broader social consequences of its decisions. In Chapman v Chapman (1992), the court overruled its earlier decision, finding that unequal treatment of beneficiaries was unacceptable. The court also began striking down trusts primarily aimed at tax avoidance. In Hitch v Stone (2001), a trust was found void because its sole purpose was to avoid inheritance tax. And in A v T (2003), the court went further, allowing a variation of trust terms specifically to prevent tax avoidance.

In conclusion, over 50 years, the Chancery Division moved from a hands-off, settlor-centered approach to trusts towards a more interventionist role, especially in preventing abuse and tax avoidance. The court demonstrated greater concern for equity, public policy, and the social consequences of its judgments. Through key cases, the Chancery Division shaped trusts law to match changing values in society. Overall, this evolution reflects the court’s renewed vision of its purpose in regulating and developing trusts law.
