Love and courtship are central themes in both Jane Austen's 1816 novel Emma and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's 1774 epistolary novel The Sorrows of Young Werther. While the depictions of love in the two texts differ in important ways, reflecting the genres and time periods in which they were written, dancing plays an important role in facilitating romance in each work. 

In Emma, dancing is portrayed as an acceptable social activity that allows eligible young people to interact and get to know one another in a polite setting. Emma Woodhouse, the story's protagonist, attends a ball at the Crown Inn, where she is introduced to Frank Churchill for the first time. While Emma and Frank do not yet have romantic feelings for one another at this point in the story, their meeting and dancing together allows them to form an initial impression and connection that later develops into mutual affection and an engagement. Dancing gives them an opportunity to converse and flirt in a manner sanctioned by the strict rules of propriety in Regency-era England.

In contrast, the balls and dances described in Werther serve more as a bitter reminder of the protagonist's inability to be with the woman he loves. Werther falls deeply in love with Lotte, a young woman who is already engaged to another man, Albert. At a ball they both attend, Werther asks Lotte to dance but is refused because she has already promised the next set of dances to Albert. This small act highlights Werther's alienation from Lotte and his envy of Albert's position as her fiancé.

Emma's view of love and courtship is also more pragmatic than Werther's. Emma sees matchmaking as a hobby and believes love can be actively built between two individuals of similar station and character. In contrast, Werther holds an idealized view of love...[continue with essay comparing and contrasting the depictions of love in the two works, with a focus on the role of dancing in courtship...]

In conclusion, while dancing plays an important role in the development of relationships in both Emma and The Sorrows of Young Werther, it does so in very different ways that reflect the genres—comedy of manners versus sentimental epistolary novel—and historical contexts in which these works were written. In Emma, dancing is a vital part of the polite social rituals that allow eligible young people to meet and court one another under the rules of propriety, whereas in Werther, dancing emphasizes the protagonist's longing for a love he cannot attain. By examining the contrasting uses of dancing in these two novels, we gain a deeper understanding of Austen's more pragmatic view of love versus Goethe's portrayal of passionate, unfulfilled romance.
