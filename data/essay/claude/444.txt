Slavery persisted in Brazil until 1888, decades after most Western nations had abolished the institution. Several factors allowed slavery to continue in Brazil despite growing external and internal pressures for abolition.  

First, the Brazilian economy was heavily dependent on slave labor, especially in the plantation sectors growing export crops like sugar, coffee, and cotton. Brazilian elites believed that abolition would devastate the economy. Slave owners, known as fazendeiros, formed a powerful lobby that resisted abolition and claimed Brazil's economy would collapse without slavery. The Catholic Church and other institutions that benefited from slavery also supported its continuation.

Second, Brazil received relatively little outside pressure to end slavery compared to other slave societies. Brazil gained independence from Portugal in 1822 but maintained close ties with its former ruler. Portugal did not pressure Brazil to abolish slavery, and the issue received little attention in European circles. Brazil also had a relatively small free black population that could advocate for abolition. The British in particular put heavy pressure on slave societies in their empire and sphere of influence, but Brazil remained outside these areas.

Third, the Brazilian government took measures to improve the slave system and address criticisms in an effort to prolong slavery. These included restrictions on abuse and torture, programs to gradually end the slave trade, and pathways for some slaves to purchase their freedom. The government tried to portray slavery as a benign institution to deflect calls for abolition. Some historians view these measures as token reforms that did little to change the fundamental oppression and violence that characterized slavery in Brazil.   

Finally, many Brazilian elites viewed abolition as a threat to the traditional social order based on racial hierarchies. Slavery promoted ideologies of white supremacy and black inferiority that the elite did not want to lose. Gradual abolition was seen as a way to dismantle slavery slowly without disrupting racial and class hierarchies.

In summary, economic dependence on slavery, little outside pressure, government reforms to improve the slave system, and desires to maintain the racial order allowed slavery to continue in Brazil despite growing opposition. Historians debate the severity of Brazilian slavery, with some portraying it as especially cruel and violent, while others argue slaves had more freedoms and flexibility than in other systems. Overall, slavery inflicted immense suffering, oppression and violence that constituted one of the worst stains on Brazilian history. Its legacy would continue to shape racial ideologies and economic underdevelopment in Brazil for generations.
