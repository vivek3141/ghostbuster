The development of the hotel sector in North America depends on a variety of factors, including government stability, tax rates, employment laws, terrorism threats, and technological advancements. These factors affect the hotel industry's growth in both the United States and Canada, albeit in different ways:

Government stability is crucial for the long-term success of any industry, especially one as capital-intensive as hospitality. In the US, a stable democratic system of government has supported consistent policies for business. While elections bring some uncertainty, drastic policy reversals are unlikely. In Canada, a parliamentary system likewise provides a stable environment for business investment. 

Tax rates significantly impact the hotel sector's profitability and ability to invest in new developments. The US has a relatively low corporate tax rate of 21%, though individual income taxes vary more widely by state. Canada's federal corporate tax rate is higher at 26.5%, while income taxes also differ across provinces. Lower tax rates in the US provide more opportunity for hotel companies to retain and reinvest profits to fund expansion.

Employment laws establish the rules for hiring, training, compensation, and termination of hotel employees. US laws offer employers flexibility in hiring and firing, with limited mandated benefits. Canada's laws provide more employee protections like universal healthcare, paid time off, and notice periods for termination. More stringent rules in Canada can increase costs for hotel operators. However, a healthy social safety net may also boost consumer spending on travel and hospitality.

The threat of terrorism can deter tourism and negatively impact hotel demand, especially for international visitors concerned about their safety. Strict security controls at US airports and borders aim to limit threats but can also make travel more stressful. Canada is viewed as a relatively safe destination with less invasive security measures. While terror attacks remain unlikely in both nations, the perceived threat level may steer some tourists away from US hotels.

Technological advancements like online travel agencies, review sites, and virtual/augmented reality are transforming how people book and experience hotels. US-based companies have pioneered many hospitality technologies, though their platforms are global. Adapting to new innovations requires investment in training, software, infrastructure and more. Tech-savvy hotels can gain a competitive edge and boost operational efficiency, but constant change also brings risks of disruption. Canadian hotels often lag in technology adoption due to smaller scale and resources. Slower progress may provide more stability but could ultimately disadvantage Canadian hotel properties.   

In summary, government stability, tax rates, employment laws, terrorism threats, and technological progress each impact the North American hotel sector in different ways across the United States and Canada. Stable governance and lower taxes spur investment in US hotels, while Canadian hotels benefit from stronger labor laws and less concern over security risks. US hotels tend to lead in technology adoption, though change brings both opportunities and challenges. Understanding these factors and their influence on each country's hospitality industry is key to navigating the complex North American hotel market.
