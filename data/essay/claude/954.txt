The occupational therapy process begins with assessment. Assessment is a crucial first step to gaining an understanding of the client and their occupational needs and performance issues. Assessment in occupational therapy is a collaborative process between the occupational therapist and the client. It aims to identify limitations in occupational performance and participation, as well identify client strengths and values to develop client-centred and meaningful interventions.  

Assessment allows the occupational therapist to gain insight into the client's occupational history, skills, abilities and difficulties. It helps to identify barriers and facilitators of occupational participation and performance. A comprehensive assessment process considers the client's roles, habits, routines, physical and mental abilities, environment, values and interests. Both formal standardized assessments as well as informal interviews and observations are used to develop an understanding of the client's occupational needs.

Assessment is underpinned by theoretical frameworks that inform what and how information is gathered. The most commonly used theories in occupational therapy assessment are the Model of Human Occupation (MOHO) and the Canadian Model of Occupational Performance and Engagement (CMOP-E). These models take a holistic view of the person and emphasize the importance of gaining insight into the person, their environments and occupations. They highlight key constructs such as habits, routines, skills, environment and so on to explore how these enable or hinder occupational participation and performance.

The aim of using theory to underpin assessment is to gain a comprehensive understanding of all factors that influence the client's occupational performance to enable effective and client-centred interventions. Client-centred practice is a key philosophy of occupational therapy. It places the client as the expert of their own situation and experiences. In assessment, this means that the client's priorities, needs and goals direct the process. The occupational therapist listens to the client's perspectives and considers what is most meaningful or relevant to them. Collaboratively, therapist and client then determine key areas to explore further in the assessment.

In summary, assessment is the first step in the occupational therapy process. Comprehensive assessment considers the many factors that contribute to and detract from a client's occupational performance and participation. Assessment is underpinned by key occupational therapy theories and philosophies of practice, especially the aim for client-centred practice. A good assessment lays the foundation for targeted and meaningful occupational therapy intervention and goal setting.
