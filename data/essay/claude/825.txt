The 2001 Japanese animated film Spirited Away, directed by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki, is a fantasy film that features themes of identity, independence, and challenging traditional gender norms. Central to the film's narrative is the young female protagonist Chihiro, a ten-year-old girl who is unprepared and apprehensive following her family's move to the countryside. At the start of the film, Chihiro is sullen, dependent on her parents, and lacks confidence in her own abilities. However, over the course of the film, Chihiro overcomes adversity and grows into a brave, independent, and determined young woman who challenges traditional gender stereotypes of female characters in film, especially Japanese anime. 

Early in the film, Chihiro is depicted as a stereotypical young girl - shy, insecure, and reliant on her parents to make decisions for her. When exploring an abandoned amusement park with her family, Chihiro is hesitant and fearful. She clings to her parents and is distressed when they are turned into pigs due to their gluttony and greed. Chihiro is now alone and must rise to the challenges of freeing her parents from the curse. At first, Chihiro succumbs to feelings of helplessness. However, with the help of Haku, a mysterious boy who works at the bathhouse where her parents are imprisoned, Chihiro begins to gain confidence and independence. Chihiro insists on working at the bathhouse to free her parents, showing her determination and willingness to sacrifice for her loved ones.

Through her work at the bathhouse, Chihiro continues to evolve into a strong, courageous young woman who challenges traditional gender roles. She does not back down in the face of adversity from the other workers, especially the vicious Lin. When Lin and the other workers tell her to give up because the tasks are too difficult, Chihiro persists. She takes on jobs typically reserved for men, like cleaning the massive furnace. Miyazaki subverts the stereotype of the damsel in distress through Chihiro's journey to save her parents herself. Chihiro's transition into a confident, self-assured character culminates when she insists on staying in the spirit world to rescue Haku from the evil witch Yubaba. Chihiro has now become a heroine in her own right, overcoming obstacles through her own skill, courage, and perseverance rather than relying on male characters to rescue her.

In conclusion, the anime film Spirited Away challenges traditional gender roles, particularly those of female characters, through the protagonist Chihiro. Chihiro begins the film as a shy, insecure girl but undergoes a journey of immense growth. Through her determination, courage, and independence in overcoming adversity to save her parents and friends, Chihiro emerges as a strong heroine who subverts stereotypical gender tropes. Director Hayao Miyazaki crafted a feminist narrative that empowers Chihiro and allows her to save herself rather than rely on male saviors. Spirited Away is a landmark film that provides a positive role model for young women through the inspiring character of Chihiro.
