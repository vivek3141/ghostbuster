The issue in the case of Mr. & Mrs. Hurst was the division of proceeds from the sale of their matrimonial home, which they had purchased together during their marriage. The court had to determine what shares of the proceeds would be awarded to Mr. Hurst and Mrs. Hurst respectively based on their respective financial contributions towards the purchase and maintenance of the home. 

The Hursts had purchased their home in 1995 for $300,000, putting down $60,000 as a downpayment. The downpayment came from Mr. Hurst's savings he brought into the marriage. The remaining $240,000 was financed through a mortgage, the payments of which were made from the couple's joint income over the next 25 years. The home was sold in 2020 for $1.2 million. By this time, the mortgage had been fully paid off through the joint funds.

The issue arose as the couple had separated in 2015 and divorced in 2018 but retained joint legal ownership of the home until 2020. During the 5 years of separation leading up to the sale of the home, Mr. Hurst moved out of the home but continued to pay 40% of the mortgage to maintain his interest while Mrs. Hurst continued living in the home and paying 60% of the costs. Both parties wanted a greater share of the sale proceeds to account for their larger contributions.

The court determined that it was equitable to award the proceeds 60/40 in Mrs. Hurst's favor. The key principle applied was that of "trusts on a matrimonial home" - since both names were on the legal title of the home, each party was presumed to hold a beneficial interest in the property in proportion to their contributions. However, the court also considered additional factors like the wife's lifelong dependence on the matrimonial home, her more substantial payments toward the upkeep of the home during the separation, and her lower earning capacity relative to Mr. Hurst.

In conclusion, the issue in the Hurst case was the division of sale proceeds from the matrimonial home between the separating couple. The court applied the principles of resulting trusts, equitable division, and fairness by considering various factors like financial contributions, individual circumstances and dependence on the home. The 60/40 division in Mrs. Hurst's favor was deemed fair in recognition of her larger stake and greater need for support. Both case law and legislation on matrimonial property were relied upon in deciding this issue.
