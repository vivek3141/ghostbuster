Pasteurization has significant effects on the chemistry and quality of fruit juices, particularly apple juice. Pasteurization is the process of briefly heating and then cooling juice to eliminate harmful pathogens.  While pasteurization makes juice safer for consumption, it can also degrade its color, flavor, and texture. Unpasteurized juice, on the other hand, retains more of the original qualities of the fruit but poses risks related to foodborne illness if improperly handled.

Commercial juice processors often use additional processing aids called clearing agents to remove haze-forming compounds like pectin and starch in fruit juices. Pectin and starch naturally occur in fruit juices and can make the juice appear cloudy. Clearing agents like enzymes and filtration physically remove or break down haze-forming particles to produce a clear juice. However, these additional processing steps can strip away flavor and aroma compounds, reducing the overall quality of the juice.

The pH, pectin content, starch content, and total solids can vary significantly between different fruit juices and processing methods. In general, fruit juices have a low pH between 3 to 4 due to the presence of organic acids like malic acid in apples and citric acid in citrus fruits. Pectin and starch, which are polysaccharides, tend to be higher in certain fruits like apples. Total solids refer to the amount of dissolved solids in the juice, including sugars, acids, and polysaccharides. Freshly squeezed juices tend to have more pectin, starch, and total solids compared to processed commercial juices.

For example, freshly squeezed apple juice contains between 0.5 to 1.0% pectin, while commercial clarified apple juice contains only 0.1 to 0.3% pectin. Fresh apple juice also has a higher starch content of 0.3 to 0.5%, whereas commercial juice contains 0.1% or less starch. The lower pectin and starch content in commercial juice contributes to its clear appearance compared to the hazy, turbid appearance of fresh juice. However, the clearing process removes valuable apple solids and results in loss of authentic fresh juice flavor and aroma.

Anti-browning agents are also commonly added to commercial apple juice to prevent oxidation and undesirable color changes during processing and storage. Agents like ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and erythorbic acid help preserve the color and flavor of juice by reducing the activity of the polyphenol oxidase enzymes that cause browning. However, some studies have found that high doses of anti-browning agents could pose health risks, and consumers prefer natural additive-free juices.

In summary, pasteurization and the use of clearing agents significantly affect the chemistry, quality, and safety of commercial fruit juices. Pasteurization eliminates pathogens but degrades natural flavors. Clearing agents remove haze for visual appeal but also strip away valuable fruit solids. Anti-browning agents maintain color but may be unhealthy in high amounts. While commercial juice has advantages in safety and shelf life, fresh unpasteurized juice is superior in quality, nutrition, and natural flavor when consumed immediately. Informed consumers should weigh these factors based on their priorities and tolerance for risk.
