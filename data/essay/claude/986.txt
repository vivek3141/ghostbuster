In October 2005, a study on the nutrient intakes of 67 food and nutrition students (aged 18 to 35 years) at the University of Reading was completed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. The results showed that the students' mean energy intakes were 8.4 MJ for males and 7.2 MJ for females, which were comparable to UK reference values. However, their intakes of some vitamins and minerals were below recommendations. 

For Vitamin C, the students' mean intake was 64 mg for males and 56 mg for females. The Dietary Reference Value (DRV) for Vitamin C is 40 mg per day to prevent deficiency. The Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) is 70 mg per day for males aged 19 to 50 years and 60 mg per day for females of the same age group. Most of the students met the DRV but fell short of the RNI for Vitamin C. For iron, the students' mean intake was 10.8 mg for males and 9.6 mg for females. The RNI for iron is 8.7 mg per day for males aged 19 to 50 years and 14.8 mg per day for females of the same age group. While the males' iron intake was adequate, the females' intake was below the recommendation.

The students' mean sodium intake was 3.1 g for males and 2.3 g for females, higher than the maximum recommendation of 2.4 g or 6 g of salt per day set by the UK government. Excessive sodium consumption can lead to high blood pressure and other health issues. The estimated energy intakes, especially for males, indicate possible under-reporting from some participants which may have also affected the reporting of other nutrients. The students' body weight, physical activity levels, and honesty in recording their dietary intakes are other factors that could have influenced the results.

In summary, while the energy and some nutrient intakes of Reading University students were comparable to national recommendations, their intakes of Vitamin C, iron and sodium highlighted some nutritional issues that warrant further education on healthy eating. The study also demonstrated some limitations in the methodology used for dietary assessment. Overall, the findings provided insight into the dietary habits and nutrient intakes of a sample group of well-educated young adults in the United Kingdom.
