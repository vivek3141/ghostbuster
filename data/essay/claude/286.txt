There are several factors that would need to be considered in assessing the likelihood of success of a judicial review challenging a school's decisions regarding drug offenses for three pupils. The key factors that would impact the outcome of judicial review proceedings for each pupil are:

1. The severity and nature of the drug offense. The more severe the offense, such as possession or supply of illegal drugs, the less likely a judicial review is to overturn the school's decision. Minor offenses, such as being under the influence of drugs, may have a higher chance of success in overturning a harsh penalty like permanent exclusion. The nature of the drug is also relevant - possession of cannabis may be viewed more leniently than possession of Class A drugs like cocaine or heroin.   

2. The evidence available to support the school's decision. If the school has clear evidence to prove the drug offense, such as eyewitness accounts, photographic or video evidence, or a positive drug test, it will be difficult to challenge their decision. Where the evidence is weak or ambiguous, there is more scope to argue that the penalty imposed was too harsh. The reliability and credibility of the evidence can also be challenged during judicial review proceedings.

3. The pupil's circumstances and disciplinary record. The circumstances surrounding the drug offense and the pupil's prior disciplinary record are relevant. For example, a pupil with a previously clean record who made one error of judgement may have a stronger case than a repeat or persistent offender. Personal mitigating circumstances, such as mental health issues, can also support an argument that permanent exclusion was disproportionate. However, a history of disruptive behavior provides context for the school's decision.

4. The procedures followed by the school. If the school did not follow proper procedures when investigating the offense and deciding on penalties, this could undermine their decision during judicial review. For example, if they did not conduct a fair and thorough investigation, give the pupils a chance to give their account, consider all evidence, or take into account mitigating circumstances and the best interests of the pupils. Failure to follow statutory guidance on exclusions may also be used to challenge a school's decision.   

In summary, for Pupil A with a first minor offense but facing permanent exclusion, the likelihood of successfully challenging the school's decision is high due to the disproportionate penalty, lack of significant evidence and their previously good record. For Pupil B, a repeat offender in possession of Class A drugs, the chances of overturning the school's exclusion decision are low given the severity of the offense and their history of poor behavior, even if procedures were not fully followed. For Pupil C, who claimed their drink had been spiked but faced a lengthy suspension, the credibility of this defense and quality of the evidence may be key in determining whether the judicial review is successful. The factors outlined above would weigh on the court's decision for each pupil's case.
