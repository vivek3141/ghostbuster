Evolutionary psychologists attempt to explain many human behaviors and psychological traits as the result of evolutionary adaptations. They argue that natural selection has shaped not only our physical attributes but also our cognitive abilities, emotions, and behaviors to solve recurrent problems faced by our ancestors. Some of the areas evolutionary psychologists have focused on include attraction, mate selection, and sexual behaviors. However, their claims and methods have been criticized on various grounds. 

One area evolutionary psychologists have theorized about is attraction and mate selection. They argue that humans have evolved psychological mechanisms for identifying ideal mates that would maximize reproductive success. For example, evolutionary psychologists claim that men tend to prefer younger mates because youth is a signal of fertility, while women tend to prefer mates of higher status and resources because that would aid in raising offspring. However, critics argue there are many individual and cultural differences in mate preferences that evolutionary psychologists fail to fully account for. Cultural factors and life experiences substantially impact what individuals find attractive in a mate.

Evolutionary psychologists have also theorized about rape, arguing that it may have had adaptive benefits for early humans. For example, some have argued that rape allowed less desirable males to reproduce and pass on their genes when consensual mating was not possible. However, most experts strongly criticize these claims and argue there is little evidence to support theories of rape as an evolved adaptation. Rape is extremely harmful and traumatizing, and in most cases does not lead to reproduction. Cultural and social factors more strongly influence the prevalence of rape. Critics argue these theories normalize and justify sexual violence.

While evolutionary psychologists have provided some plausible theories about the origins of human psychology, their claims are largely speculative. They rely on assumptions about the environment of evolutionary adaptedness that are difficult to test scientifically. They also often fail to adequately account for the role of culture, experience, and development in shaping human psychology and behavior. Evolutionary explanations for complex human behaviors like attraction, mate selection, and rape are controversial and not well supported by evidence. Overall, the evidence for many of the claims made by evolutionary psychologists is mixed, and their theories should be interpreted with caution due to the many criticisms about their approach.  

In summary, while evolutionary perspectives provide an intriguing lens into human psychology and behavior, the claims of evolutionary psychologists are open to debate because of challenges in determining the accuracy of their assumptions and the role of cultural influences. Their theories about attraction, mate selection, and rape in particular are not strongly supported by evidence and risk normalizing harmful behaviors. A balanced and critical analysis of the claims made by evolutionary psychologists shows that their theories are speculative and controversial, even if provocative.
