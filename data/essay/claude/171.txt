Institutions play a crucial role in shaping a country's economic performance and development. Institutions refer to the formal and informal rules of the game in a society, encompassing laws, regulations, norms, and conventions. Institutions impact economic outcomes by influencing the incentives and constraints faced by economic actors like individuals, households, and firms. While institutions are central to economic progress, they are often difficult to reform as they become entrenched and protected by those who benefit from them. However, economic development can still occur without major institutional change through other mechanisms such as greater access to resources and technology. 

Institutions shape economic incentives in profound ways. For example, well-defined and enforced property rights give individuals incentives to invest in and improve their property since they can capture the benefits. In contrast, weak property rights discourage such investment and economic activity. Similarly, government policies and regulations shape the incentives of firms and entrepreneurs to take risks, invest, and innovate. Some institutions like bureaucratic red tape and corruption raise the costs and uncertainty of economic activity, while others promote competition and support free markets.

Although institutions are key to growth, they are often hard to change as they become embedded over time. Existing institutions benefit certain groups who then fight to maintain them. For example, wealthy landowners will resist land reform, and politicians and bureaucrats will oppose anti-corruption efforts that curb their power and privileges. Formal institutions are also linked to informal social norms and cultural attitudes that evolve slowly. Because institutions are interconnected, reforming one institution may require complementary changes to others. All these factors contribute to institutional inertia.

However, economic development can still take place without major institutional reform. Other drivers of growth include greater access to resources through trade, foreign investment, or resource booms; adoption of new technologies that raise productivity; improved human capital through education and skills training;  and policy choices around infrastructure investment, industrial policy, health, education, etc. China, for example, has achieved rapid growth through a gradual process of institutional change combined with large investments in physical and human capital, promotion of technology adoption and manufacturing exports, and selective market reforms. In contrast, Russia has struggled economically despite large-scale institutional changes due to a lack of complementary investments and policies.

In conclusion, while institutions are essential to long-run economic performance, they are often difficult to change in a significant way. However, economic development can still occur through other means even when institutions remain stagnant. The interplay between institutions and other growth determinants shapes a country's economic trajectory. Overall, there are many paths to prosperity, and institutional reform is but one part of the complex process of development.
