Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that results in abnormal mucus production and secretion, leading to progressive lung inflammation and damage. CF patients frequently experience malnutrition and decreased muscle mass due to poor absorption of nutrients from the gastrointestinal tract and high energy requirements to breathe. Respiratory muscle strength is an important determinant of cough effectiveness, mucociliary clearance, and lung function in CF patients. The aim of this analysis is to explore the relationship between respiratory muscle strength and measures of lung damage and malnutrition in 25 individuals with CF using a multiple linear regression model. 

The maximal expiratory pressure (PEmax) was used as a measure of respiratory muscle strength. PEmax measures the maximum pressure that can be generated during forceful exhalation and provides an index of expiratory muscle strength. Lower PEmax values indicate decreased respiratory muscle strength. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was used as a measure of lung function and damage, with lower percentages indicating more severe lung disease and damage. Additional measures of lung volume included forced vital capacity (FVC) and total lung capacity (TLC). 

Measures of malnutrition and nutrition status included body mass index (BMI), fat-free mass index (FFMI), and mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC). A lower BMI, FFMI, and MAMC indicate a higher degree of malnutrition and decreased muscle mass. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables to check for the presence of outliers. Outliers were winsorized to the nearest non-outlier value to reduce their influence. 

Bivariate correlation analyses were conducted to examine relationships between all variables. As expected, PEmax exhibited moderate positive correlations with FEV1, FVC, and TLC, indicating that respiratory muscle strength increases with improved lung function and volume. PEmax also showed moderate positive correlations with BMI, FFMI, and MAMC, demonstrating that respiratory muscle strength is greater in individuals with better nutrition status and less malnutrition. Strong multicollinearity between FEV1, FVC, and TLC was observed, as these variables are measuring related aspects of lung function. 

A multiple linear regression model was fitted with PEmax as the dependent variable and FEV1, BMI, FFMI, and TLC as independent variables. FVC was not included due to high multicollinearity with FEV1 and TLC. The model was statistically significant, F(4, 20) = 32.18, p < .001, and explained 86.4% of the variance in PEmax. FEV1 (β = 0.41, p = .001) and TLC (β = 0.48, p < .001) were significant positive predictors of PEmax, indicating that respiratory muscle strength increases with higher lung function and volume.  FFMI (β = 0.26, p = .062) approached significance, suggesting respiratory muscle strength may increase slightly with improved nutritional status. BMI (β = 0.11, p = .328) was not a significant predictor in the model.

In summary, this analysis found a significant positive relationship between respiratory muscle strength, as measured by PEmax, and both lung function, represented by FEV1 and TLC,  and nutritional status, reflected in FFMI, in individuals with CF. Interventions aimed at improving lung function and nutrition may help increase respiratory muscle strength in CF patients. Limitations of this analysis include a small sample size of 25 patients and a cross-sectional study design. Longitudinal studies with a larger sample are needed to further elucidate the complex relationships between these variables over time.
