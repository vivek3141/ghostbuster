Legionellosis refers to a form of pneumonia caused by bacteria of the genus Legionella. The most well-known species of this genus is Legionella pneumophila, which can lead to a serious pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease. Legionella bacteria are naturally found in freshwater environments like lakes, streams, and rivers. However, they can become a health hazard when they contaminate and grow in human-made water systems like hot tubs, cooling towers, and plumbing in buildings. The Legionella bacteria are transmitted to humans when we inhale aerosolized water droplets contaminated with the bacteria. Once inside the lungs, the bacteria can enter and replicate within human alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells, causing Legionnaires' disease.

The lifecycle of Legionella begins in water sources in the environment, where the bacteria exist in aquatic biofilms and parasitic amoeba. The Legionella bacteria are internalized by the amoeba in the water, where they can replicate. When conditions are right, such as warm temperatures, stagnant water, and the presence of scale or sediment, the bacteria can grow in large numbers. They are then transmitted to humans when we breathe in mist or vapor from the contaminated water source. The bacteria enter the lungs, where they are engulfed by alveolar macrophages but continue to replicate. They also infect and replicate within lung epithelial cells. Within the human cells, the bacteria can evade digestion and use host cell machinery to acquire nutrients and replicate. 

Several factors contribute to the ability of Legionella to survive and replicate within human cells. The bacteria can modulate the maturation of the macrophage phagosome to avoid fusion with lysosomes, as well as inhibit phagosome acidification, which prevents its degradation. The bacteria also secrete effector proteins that manipulate host signaling pathways, enabling the bacteria to replicate within the cell. The bacteria require certain host nutrients like amino acids, fatty acids, and iron to replicate. By acquiring these nutrients from within host cells, the Legionella bacteria gain an advantage for growth.

The symptoms of Legionnaireâ€™s disease, which typically appear 2 to 10 days after infection, include cough, shortness of breath, high fever, muscle aches, and headaches. The disease can range from mild to severe pneumonia and requires hospitalization in some cases. Most individuals recover with appropriate antibiotic treatment, but in about 5 to 30% of cases, the infection can be fatal, especially if treatment is delayed. A milder form of infection called Pontiac fever produces flu-like symptoms that resolve spontaneously within a week. 

Legionellosis can be prevented by implementing water management programs to limit the growth of Legionella in human-made water systems. This includes disinfecting water systems, storing and distributing water at temperatures that do not favor the growth of Legionella, eliminating stagnation, removing excess scale and sediment where Legionella can grow. When outbreaks occur, cleaning and disinfecting the identified water system helps prevent further transmission. For treatment, a class of antibiotics called macrolides, such as azithromycin, is typically used to treat Legionella infections. With appropriate prevention and control measures, legionellosis infections can be avoided.
