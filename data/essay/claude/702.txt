A range of approaches can be used to efficiently synthesize 1,2-diamines from diazetidines, including asymmetric lithiation/electrophilic substitution, cycloaddition, and photochemical reactions. Diazetidines are versatile building blocks as they can undergo a variety of bond-breaking and bond-forming reactions. 

Asymmetric lithiation followed by electrophilic substitution is an effective way to generate 1,2-diamines. Lithium alkoxide bases can selectively abstract a proton from just one of the two neighboring methines, leading to an asymmetric anion which can react stereoselectively with electrophiles such as alkyl halides. The resulting organolithium intermediate can then be protonated to yield 1,2-diamines with high diastereocontrol. The mechanism of deprotonation and electrophile addition is well understood, but recent research has explored more sterically hindered alkoxide bases to improve selectivity and yield.

Diazetidine also readily undergoes [2+2] cycloaddition reactions to form cyclobutanes that can be converted to 1,2-diamines. The mechanism involves a photochemical or thermal generation of a diradical intermediate from the double bonds of the alkene and diazetine, followed by radical combination to form the cyclobutane ring. Although this approach requires extra synthetic steps to reduce and cleave the cyclobutane, recent advances in enantioselective cycloaddition and catalysts have improved its efficiency.  

Photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition using benzophenone sensitizers is a photooxygenation approach to synthesize 1,2-diamines.  Ultraviolet light excites benzophenone, which then transfers energy to triplet oxygen, generating reactive singlet oxygen. The singlet oxygen can oxidatively cleave the diazetidine double bond, and the resulting hydroperoxide intermediate rearranges to the 1,2-diamine. This approach benefits from mild reaction conditions but often gives lower yields due to unwanted side reactions.

In summary, a combination of asymmetric lithiation, cycloaddition, and photooxygenation reactions provide efficient pathways to 1,2-diamines from diazetidines with good control of stereochemistry. Purification techniques such as recrystallization, column chromatography, and HPLC afford the final products in high purity for characterization using NMR, IR and mass spectrometry.
