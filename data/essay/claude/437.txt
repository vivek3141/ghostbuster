Cyber terrorism refers to the use of cyber attacks by terrorist groups or individuals to cause fear, destruction, or harm. It threatens modern society in significant ways. Cyber terrorist attacks can take various forms, including hacking, phishing, malware, and denial-of-service attacks. These attacks target computers and networks to steal data, damage critical infrastructure, disrupt services, and spread propaganda. 

Hacking involves illegally accessing computer networks and systems to steal or modify data. Phishing uses fraudulent messages or websites to steal login credentials and personal information. Malware like viruses, worms, and trojans can damage systems, erase data, and provide backdoor access. Denial-of-service attacks flood networks and servers with traffic to disrupt access. These techniques can be combined for maximum impact. For example, hackers can use stolen login information from a phishing attack to plant malware that erases data in a network.

Critical infrastructure like power grids, transportation systems, financial networks, and emergency services are especially vulnerable to cyber terrorism. By damaging or disrupting these systems, cyber terrorists can undermine a nation's security, economy and public health. For instance, a cyber attack on a power grid can cut off electricity supply, as seen in Ukraine in 2015. Attacking transportation networks can severely hamper mobility. Hacking financial systems can undermine people's trust in financial institutions and electronic transactions. Compromising emergency response networks can hamper disaster relief.  

To defend against cyber terrorism, countries must make cyber security a national priority. They need to harden critical infrastructure by assessing vulnerabilities, updating systems with stronger authentication and encryption, and installing robust monitoring systems. They should require basic cyber hygiene practices like strong passwords, two-factor authentication and regular updates. They must improve threat detection by using machine learning and AI to spot anomalies. They need a coordinated response plan to quickly contain any attacks. 

International cooperation is also necessary given the borderless nature of cyber threats. By sharing information on hacking techniques, malware profiles and phishing tactics, countries can better anticipate and prevent cyber terrorist attacks, or minimize damage. However, attributing cyber attacks and deciding on proportionate responses pose challenges. Offensive actions like retaliatory hacks risk escalating geopolitical tensions. Diplomacy and sanctions require consensus that can be hard to forge.

If a swarming attack combined physical violence with cyber terrorism, the implications would be severe. Bombs detonating while emergency response services are disrupted by cyber attacks would lead to massive loss of life. A multi-city assault where hackers release malware to erase financial data during shooting sprees would result in chaos. The psychological impact of coordinated physical-cyber swarms could undermine public morale and trust in governance. Defending against such hybrid threats requires seamless coordination between cyber, intelligence and law enforcement agencies - a difficult goal for any government to achieve.

In summary, cyber terrorism poses a potent threat to society because of the numerous vulnerabilities in technological infrastructure and the psychological damage of cyber attacks. Defending against this threat requires national resolve, close public-private coordination, and international cooperation on an unprecedented scale. Any swarming with physical violence would have devastating consequences, making the prevention and mitigation of cyber terrorism an urgent priority. Overall, cyber terrorism should not be underestimated in an increasingly digitized world.
