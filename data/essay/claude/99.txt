Policies towards the poor in Elizabethan and Stuart England were shaped significantly by prevailing attitudes that distinguished between the "deserving" and "undeserving" poor. The deserving poor were those who were impoverished due to circumstances beyond their control, such as old age, disability or unemployment. They were seen as morally worthy of charity and assistance. In contrast, the undeserving poor were those who were seen as lazy, unwilling to work, or responsible for their own poverty due to moral failings. Policies sought to provide relief for the deserving poor while punishing the undeserving to compel them to work. 

While moral concerns about charity and the public good played a role, economic interests were also crucial in shaping poor relief policies. The Elizabethan Poor Laws of 1597 and 1601 were passed when poverty rates were rising and vagrancy was increasing. The laws aimed to address the economic problems posed by poverty and vagrancy, including the drain on local resources, threats to social order, and declining availability of cheap labor. The laws distinguished between the impotent poor (deserving) and the able-bodied poor (largely undeserving), and imposed compulsory local poor rates to provide relief for the impotent while putting the able-bodied to work.

The English Poor Laws continued under the early Stuarts, with some modifications that reflected both moral and economic imperatives. The settlement laws made relief a local responsibility based on a person's place of settlement. This aimed to prevent the poor from migrating to find better relief, which addressed economic concerns. On moral grounds, the 1601 law was amended to make relatives legally liable to support the poor. James I also promoted private charity and philanthropy.  

However, the English Civil War and Interregnum period saw more radical poor relief proposals motivated by moral concerns. Some Puritans argued for a right to relief, and proposals included compulsory work schemes to address idleness. After the Restoration, the 1662 Settlement Act allowed local authorities more flexibility in providing relief, though settlement was more easily obtained to reduce forced migration. The 1601 Poor Law lasted over two centuries, balancing moral, social and economic considerations.

In conclusion, while attitudes toward the deserving and undeserving poor were premised on moral judgments, policies towards the poor in this era were motivated both by moral concerns and economic interests. The Poor Laws aimed to support the morally deserving poor while also addressing underlying economic problems associated with poverty. The balance between moral imperatives and economic interests shifted over time based on circumstances. But together they shaped a system that distinguished between types of poverty in its aims to relieve and reform the poor.
