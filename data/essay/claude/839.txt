An occupational therapist (OT) working with Michelle, an 18-year-old with anorexia nervosa, would use interventions and approaches aligned with the Canadian Model of Occupational Performance (CMOP). The CMOP focuses on a person's occupational performance, which is their ability to choose, organize, and perform meaningful activities in their environment. This model also considers the interaction of three components: the person, occupation, and environment.

To treat Michelle, the OT's first priority would be to build rapport and trust to better understand Michelle's unique challenges, needs, and strengths related to her anorexia. The OT would take time to fully understand all aspects that make up Michelle as a person: her values, interests, roles, and daily habits. The OT may use interviews, assessments, and observations to learn how Michelle's illness has impacted her ability to engage in meaningful occupations like self-care, productivity, and leisure as a teenager. 

The OT would focus interventions on Michelle's prioritized needs and work with her to set collaborative and motivational goals to re-engage her in valued occupations. For example, if Michelle wants to return to college, an initial goal may be for her to have the energy for a few classes by improving her nutrition and sleep habits. The OT can recommend practical strategies to achieve this goal like meal planning and relaxation techniques. To overcome Michelle's challenges in this area, the OT would likely recommend a cognitive approach to help Michelle address unhealthy thoughts and behaviors related to food and body image.

Given Michelle's age, independence and social interaction are highly important to her development and well-being. The OT would work to determine what environments or contexts empower Michelle or create barriers to her occupational performance. For instance, Michelle may feel more at ease eating around family and close friends, but avoid eating in public or at college. The OT can suggest starting with small steps like having one meal per week around supportive peers to build toward greater social participation.

Overall, to effectively treat Michelle's anorexia the OT takes a holistic, client-centered approach focused on enabling her occupational performance and overcoming obstacles through theoretical knowledge and practical interventions tailored to Michelle's unique situation and needs. The OT works with Michelle to identify her priorities, set collaborative goals, build skills through cognitive and behavioural strategies, establish supportive environments, and re-engage in meaningful occupationsâ€”especially those related to her roles as a student and friend. This broad, multifaceted approach based on Michelle's strengths and challenges reflects the core principles of the CMOP.
