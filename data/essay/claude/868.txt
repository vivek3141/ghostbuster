Within Sir Thomas Wyatt's poem "Whoso List to Hunt," the poet employs various poetic devices to explore themes of love, faith, commitment, and labor. Through the use of an extended metaphor comparing a lover's pursuit to a hunt, Wyatt is able to illustrate the difficulties and struggles the lover faces in trying to reconnect with his beloved. The metaphor also enables Wyatt to demonstrate the closure the lover aims to find through continued persistence and hard work.

From the beginning of the poem, Wyatt establishes the metaphor comparing the lover's quest for love to a hunt. He writes, "Whoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind, / But as for me, helas, I may no more." Here, the hind represents the woman the lover seeks, and the hunting metaphor is introduced to symbolize the lover's ardent chase of his beloved. However, Wyatt suggests that for him, the hunt is over as he "may no more" continue the pursuit. Still, the metaphor persists through the rest of the poem, as the lover observes the hind and reflects on what he must do to capture her once again.

Through the hunting metaphor, Wyatt is able to highlight the themes of love, faith, commitment, and labor. The lover's unending desire and passion for the hind represent his deep love for her, while his refusal to give up on the hunt reflects his faith in their relationship and commitment to persevering until she is won back. In addition, the hunt itself signifies the difficult work the lover must undertake to overcome various obstacles, alluded to through natural imagery of the hind's swiftness and wariness, and eventually earn her affection once more. The metaphor thus effectively conveys the lover's conflicting experience of both pleasure and hardship in the pursuit of love.  

Wyatt also employs rhyming couplets throughout the poem to propel the metaphorical hunt forward and create a sense of continuity representing the lover's persistence. For instance, the rhyming words "no more" and "before" in the first couplet connect the lover's past and present, implying that while he once was able to hunt, now he "may no more." Yet, the conclusion formed by the final couplet, "at last require / reward of all his pain," suggests that the lover's unflagging efforts will ultimately be rewarded with closure. Through rhyme, Wyatt is able to subtly lead the reader through the lover's journey toward a resolved end.

In summary, Wyatt vividly crafts an elaborate metaphor within his poem to explore profound themes relating to love and relationships. Through poetic devices like rhyming couplets, natural imagery, and metaphors, Wyatt is able to demonstrate a lover's struggle against various challenges to reclaim the woman he deeply cares for, highlighting ideas of passion, faith, hardship and closure. The poem thus illustrates in poetic terms the timeless story of love lost and found.
