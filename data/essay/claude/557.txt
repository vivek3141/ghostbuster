Is custom still a significant source of international law despite its inherent complications and uncertainties?

Custom, defined as the general and consistent practice of states followed from a sense of legal obligation (opinio juris), has historically been a crucial source of international law. However, custom faces inherent challenges, including identifying what constitutes state practice and opinio juris, as well as uncertainties stemming from its slow development and flexibility. Despite these complications, custom remains significant and increasingly relevant in contemporary international law.

Custom plays an important role in shaping international conventions and treaties. Many multilateral treaties are codifications of pre-existing customary rules, including laws of war and laws of the sea. Custom also fills gaps in treaties when they are silent on certain issues, and can influence treaty interpretation through supplementary means of interpretation under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Thus, custom and treaties are interdependent and mutually reinforcing sources of law.

Custom is also vital in regulating the use of force, an area of international law that is not comprehensively codified. The prohibition on the use of force and the right of self-defence are largely customary. While the UN Charter mentions self-defence, its scope and content depend on custom. The customary rules on intervention, reprisals, and necessity/proportionality also govern the use of force. Hence, custom is crucial given the lack of a universal treaty in this field.

Moreover, customary peremptory norms or jus cogens—which include prohibitions on aggression, genocide, torture, and slavery—bind all states and cannot be contracted out of. They reflect universal values and advance human rights, upholding moral standards in international law. The recognition of jus cogens in treaties like the Vienna Convention demonstrates the continued importance of custom.

However, custom faces significant challenges. Identifying state practice requires ensuring that actions represent the state's position, not just political expediency, and ascertaining a sufficient duration, consistency and generality of such practice. Opinio juris is also difficult to establish, especially when states act from a sense of policy, comity or political reality rather than a belief that the action is legally required. The requirement for consistency and universality is problematic for new or changing practices. Custom also develops slowly and provides flexibility, creating uncertainty.

'Soft law' like UN Resolutions, while non-binding, also shape custom by influencing state practice and opinio juris. Resolutions like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights have been codified in treaties or gained customary status, highlighting the role of soft law in the development of custom.

In conclusion, while custom faces substantial challenges, it remains a vital source of international law. Its role in codifying and interpreting treaties, regulating use of force, and upholding jus cogens gives it a central place in international jurisprudence. However, its uncertainties and complications necessitate reliance on treaties and soft law. Custom, therefore, remains significant but is limited in its importance as international law depends increasingly on codification. Overall, custom, treaties and soft law are complementary rather than discrete sources of law.
