Ikea is a furniture company that is distinctly different from most of its traditional competitors. While typical furniture companies focus on providing customized, high-quality, and often high-priced furnishings, Ikea's strategy is to offer low-cost but still high-quality furnishings. Ikea is able to achieve this through a variety of innovative means, including a focus on simplicity, bulk purchasing, and requiring customers to assemble furniture themselves. 

According to Slack et al., there are several key performance objectives for any company: cost, speed, dependability, quality, and flexibility. I will evaluate how Ikea performs on each objective in comparison to its traditional competitors.

In terms of cost, Ikea is the clear leader. Ikea's entire business model is built around providing furniture and home furnishings at an affordable price. Ikea accomplishes this through several strategies. First, Ikea's furniture emphasizes simplicity in design. By simplifying designs, Ikea needs fewer raw materials and components, reducing costs. Second, Ikea purchases raw materials and components in high volumes to get the lowest possible prices from suppliers and then passes on the savings to customers. Finally, Ikea reduces costs by requiring customers to assemble furniture themselves.  

In contrast, traditional furniture companies typically cannot compete on cost. They focus on customized, high-quality, bespoke furniture that requires expert craftsmanship, expensive materials, and substantial overhead to design and build. They must charge higher prices to maintain profitability. So in terms of the cost objective, Ikea clearly outperforms its traditional competitors.

In terms of speed, Ikea also has an advantage. Because Ikea furniture has simple, standardized designs and customers assemble the furniture themselves, Ikea can manufacture and deliver furniture very quickly. Customers can usually take their furniture home the same day. Traditional furniture companies, on the other hand, require a long design and build process for customized furniture. It may take weeks or months for a customer to receive their order. So for the speed objective, Ikea outperforms most competitors.  

For dependability, I would argue that traditional furniture companies have an advantage. Bespoke, expertly-crafted furnishings typically last a lifetime and provide a high degree of dependability and quality. Ikea furniture, while functional and of reasonably good quality given the low price, may not last as long or withstand heavy use as well. However, Ikea's lower prices also mean that replacing furniture is more affordable if needed. So for dependability, traditional competitors may have a slight edge.

In terms of quality, it is difficult to make a determination in favor of either Ikea or traditional furniture companies. Ikea provides furnishings of reasonably high quality given their very low cost. However, high-end, custom-made furniture is typically of the highest quality in terms of materials and craftsmanship. For most customers, the quality level achieved by Ikea at such low cost is "good enough", so I would say Ikea also competes well on the quality objective for its target customers. However, for those wanting the absolute highest-quality furnishings regardless of cost, Ikea may not satisfy.

Finally, for flexibility, Ikea does not perform quite as well as its traditional competitors. Given its focus on simplicity, low-cost, and standardization, Ikea offers a relatively fixed set of furnishings and options. They are not able to provide the level of customization and flexibility that a traditional furniture company can. Customers must choose from Ikea's set of designs and options. Traditional furniture companies are able to craft customized, bespoke pieces tailored to a customer's unique requirements. For those wanting furniture tailored to their distinct needs and tastes, Ikea may not provide enough flexibility. However, for most budget-conscious customers, Ikea offers enough choices to compete well on flexibility.  

In summary, while Ikea and traditional high-end furniture companies have some differences in terms of strategy and positioning, Ikea is able to achieve a level of performance that exceeds traditional competitors in several key objectives: cost, speed, and quality. Despite some disadvantages in dependability and flexibility, Ikea has built a highly successful formula and competes well against even premium furniture brands for most mainstream customers. By emphasizing simplicity, bulk buying power, and customer assembly, Ikea is an innovative leader in affordable yet functional home furnishings. Overall, Ikea has proven that low-cost and high quality do not have to be mutually exclusive.
