The use of parliamentary debates and reports, collectively known as Hansard, as an aid to interpreting legislation, known as statutory construction, is a controversial practice. On the one hand, Hansard provides a rich source of information about the intentions and purposes behind legislation. References to Hansard were expressly allowed in the seminal 1993 House of Lords case Pepper v Hart. However, there are also objections to using Hansard, including concerns about reliability, practicality, and undermining the separation of powers between parliament and the judiciary.  

There are several advantages to using Hansard as an interpretive aid. First, it provides direct evidence of the legislatorsâ€™ intentions and the mischiefs that the legislation was aimed at addressing. Judges can gain valuable insight into the purpose and intended effect of statutes. This helps to resolve ambiguities and ensures the law is applied as intended. Second, use of Hansard recognizes that legislation does not exist in a vacuum but is part of a broader public debate. Examining Hansard gives judges a more complete understanding of the social and political context in which laws were made.

However, there are also significant disadvantages to relying on Hansard. Practically, parliamentary debates can be lengthy, contradictory and open to political posturing. They do not necessarily provide a clear or accurate record of the intentions behind legislation. Politically, use of Hansard could undermine the separation of powers, as the courts rely on statements by politicians to determine legal meaning. This risks having the meaning of law determined by political debates rather than through the proper legislative process. Financially, extensive references to Hansard could lead to increased litigation costs as large amounts of parliamentary material have to be reviewed. 

While the benefits of gaining insight into legislative intent are substantial, the objections to using Hansard also warrant consideration. The key concern is that political debates should not be used to subvert or override the formal legislative process. If references to Hansard were unrestricted, legislation could end up meaning whatever politicians had said about it, rather than what was actually enacted. The courts must be prudent in how they use such material.

Overall, whether or not the benefits of using Hansard outweigh the objections depends on the circumstances of each case and how rigorously the courts evaluate the parliamentary material. If applied cautiously and not treated as determinative, references to Hansard can provide useful context and help achieve outcomes that correspond with the intended effect of legislation. However, courts must be wary not to place undue emphasis on comments made in political debate. The meaning of legislation should depend primarily on the law itself, not the rhetoric surrounding it. Used responsibly, Hansard can be a helpful servant but should not become the master.
