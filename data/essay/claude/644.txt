Money and Happiness: The Complex Relationship According to Economists and Psychologists 

For years, economists operated under the assumption that money buys happiness—that is, as an individual's income increases, so too does their happiness or subjective well-being. This relationship seemed intuitive and was supported by basic economic theory. However, in recent decades, psychologists and behavioral economists have found that the relationship between money and happiness is far more complex than a simple linear correlation. While money is important for happiness to a degree, especially at lower income levels, the relationship weakens significantly at higher levels of income. There are a number of reasons why the money-happiness relationship is not straightforward.

At lower income levels, money absolutely does correlate with happiness. When people struggle to afford basic necessities like food, housing, and healthcare, an increase in income can make a big difference in their well-being and life satisfaction. This is especially true in developing countries where limited access to basic necessities impacts happiness. However, once individuals have enough money to satisfy their basic needs, the relationship between income and happiness weakens. Doubling one's income from $40,000 to $80,000 per year, for example, will not double one's happiness or life satisfaction. This phenomenon is known as the "Easterlin paradox" after economist Richard Easterlin, who found that while rich nations tend to be happier than poor nations, a nation's happiness does not trend upward as incomes rise over time. 

There are a few reasons for the weakening correlation between money and happiness at higher income levels. First, people adapt quickly to changes in their income and material circumstances. Known as "hedonic adaptation," this tendency means that the happiness boost from a raise or new possession is usually temporary. People get accustomed to the new situation and revert to their baseline happiness level. Second, relative wealth plays a significant role in how people perceive their own income and happiness. When everyone's income rises at the same rate, people's relative social standing does not change. Only increases in relative income—having more money than one's peers and neighbors—correlate strongly with happiness. Finally, people often rely on comparisons to wealthier individuals, rather than those less fortunate, which creates an "hedonic treadmill" effect. No amount of increased consumption can keep up with aspirations for an even higher standard of living.

In sum, while money does buy some amount of happiness for those struggling to meet basic needs, the relationship between income and happiness weakens significantly beyond that point. Relative income and social comparisons, hedonic adaptation, and an endless striving for higher standards of living all combine to break the simple link between money and happiness. Both economists and psychologists agree that money alone does not determine happiness—other factors like relationships, experiences, health, and work also strongly influence a person's well-being and life satisfaction. For policymakers and individuals alike, the complex realities of the money-happiness link have important implications that go beyond economic theory. Happiness depends on far more than one's income or absolute wealth.
