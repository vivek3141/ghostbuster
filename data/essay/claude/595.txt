The sociologist Dick Hebdige argues that youth are often viewed as problematic in society due to moral panics and the threat that youth subcultures pose to social order. Hebdige discusses how the media frequently portray youth in a negative light by sensationalizing moral panics about emerging youth cultures. These moral panics tap into wider societal anxieties and fears about youth deviance, even when the actual threat posed by the subculture is minimal. The moral panics also fuel the process of negative labeling, where youth are stereotyped and judged as "folk devils" for their non-normative appearances and behaviors.   

Hebdige examines the British punk subculture to demonstrate how moral panics emerge and negatively impact youth. In the mid-1970s, the punk subculture arose in London, characterized by ripped clothes, punk fashion styles, and an anti-establishment ethos. The media quickly constructed a moral panic around punks, portraying them as threatening to society because of their radical self-expression and rebellion against social norms. The Daily Mirror described punks as "repulsive punk rock vandals" and "public enemy number one." 

This moral panic tapped into wider fears about youth deviance and resistance to authority. However, the actual threat posed by punks was minimal. While some punks engaged in violence and property damage, most were non-violent and simply trying to make a symbolic statement through their fashion and music. Nonetheless, the moral panic resulted in many punks facing harassment, humiliation, and violence. They were negatively labeled as "deviants" and "folk devils" simply due to their unconventional self-expression.

Youth subcultures are often interpreted as problematic because they resist the dominant values and norms of society.  As Dick Hebdige argues, youth subcultures represent "noise" that interrupts the "silent majority" of normative consumer society. The spectacular styles of subcultures are seen as threatening because they visibly reject mainstream aesthetics and values. This is why moral panics frequently emerge around the emergence of new youth subcultures, as they are viewed as a symbolic threat to social order. 

The negative labeling of youth has serious consequences, as it can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy. When youth internalize the negative stereotypes that society assigns to them, it can shape their self-image and influence their behavior to match these stereotypes. They may act out through crime or delinquency, confirming public fears about the threat they pose. Negative labels also justify more intensive policing and surveillance of youth, as well as more punitive responses to youth deviance. This can perpetuate a cycle of deviance as youth face discrimination and lack of opportunity.

In conclusion, Dick Hebdige provides a compelling argument that youth are often problematized in society through moral panics and negative stereotyping. Youth subcultures are frequently portrayed as threatening folk devils that jeopardize social order due to their rejection of mainstream values. However, these interpretations usually arise from wider societal fears and anxieties, rather than an objective assessment of the actual threat posed. The consequences of negative labeling include discrimination, lack of opportunity, and in some cases a turn to deviance. Overall, Hebdige highlights why youth are viewed as problematic and calls for more nuanced understandings of youth subcultures.
