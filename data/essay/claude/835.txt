The occupational behaviour frame of reference focuses on achieving independence and autonomy in one's community through occupation or purposeful activities. For individuals with a moderate learning disability, this frame of reference can be used to develop intervention plans to reach their maximum potential and improve their quality of life. Using the example of May, a short term goal could be learning how to use public transport independently to get to places she enjoys going to. To accomplish this, an intervention could include orientation to the bus route from her home, training on how to purchase a bus ticket, and practicing getting on the right bus and getting off at the correct stop. Once May has demonstrated her competence in doing this independently a few times, this goal could be considered achieved. 

A long term goal for May could be gaining employment, perhaps in a supported volunteer role initially. An intervention plan could consist of help exploring what types of jobs May might be interested in and good at and training for those jobs. For example, if May enjoys working with numbers, a volunteer accounting or bookkeeping position could be a good match. The intervention plan would involve arranging volunteer opportunities in the local community with supervision and support to build her skills. Regular reinforcement and reassessment will be needed to achieve the goal of supported employment and perhaps eventual part-time paid work.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention plan, interviews with May, her husband and the staff at her Day Centre should be conducted to get multiple perspectives. Comparing May's views on her abilities, challenges and goals before and after the intervention plan will show if the goals have been achieved and her quality of life has improved. Speaking with her husband and Day Centre staff will also provide insight into how May's independence and community involvement may have changed as a result of the intervention. Overall, the occupational behaviour frame of reference provides a useful approach to building life skills and reaching one's potential for individuals with a moderate learning disability through purposeful and meaningful activities. With the right support and interventions focused on specific goals, May can achieve greater independence and an improved quality of life.
