The European Council is an institution of the European Union that defines the general political directions and priorities of the EU. It consists of the heads of state or government of the EU member states. The European Council has no legislative power but plays an important strategic role in defining the EU’s priorities and shaping its agenda. 

The European Council meets regularly several times a year and its conclusions are adopted by consensus, reflecting the views of all member states. Although the conclusions are non-binding, they shape the policies and legislative agenda of the EU and its priorities. The European Council sets medium-term strategies such as the Lisbon Strategy in 2000 to make the EU the most competitive economy in the world. It also addresses key issues facing Europe like migration, security, and Brexit. The decisions and priorities set by the European Council have a trickle-down effect on the work of other EU institutions like the Commission which proposes legislation based on the Council’s agenda.

There are differing views on the role and power of the European Council. Some see it as the driving force behind European integration, setting strategic visions for the EU’s development. Critics argue it lacks transparency and legitimacy due to its intergovernmental nature. There have been efforts to strengthen the European Council such as the election of a permanent president in 2009 to provide more continuity. The proposed EU Constitutional Treaty aimed to formally establish the European Council as an EU institution and define its role and composition in the EU’s hierarchy. However, the treaty was rejected and the Lisbon Treaty maintained the informal status of the European Council.

In conclusion, the European Council shapes the political direction and priorities of the European Union. Although it lacks a formal legislative role, its decisions have a significant impact on the EU through setting strategic agendas and visions. There are varying views on how to strengthen the European Council and clarify its role within the EU’s institutional framework which the Constitutional Treaty aimed to address. The European Council remains an influential yet informally defined institution in the EU.
