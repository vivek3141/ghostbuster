In the poem "Alexis and Damon" by Jonathan Swift, the author uses meter and rhyme to highlight the Lady's indecision and internal struggle in choosing between two suitors. The poem is written in iambic pentameter, with each line consisting of ten syllables in an unstressed-stressed rhythmic pattern. The consistent meter creates a flowing and lyrical effect, which mirrors the way the Lady's mind travels between her options in a rhythmic fashion.

The rhyming couplet form of the poem, with consecutive pairs of lines rhyming, also reflects the Lady's seesawing thoughts. The rhyming lines pair the ideas of Alexis and Damon, underscoring how the Lady perceives them as two alternatives between which she wavers. The couplet form gives the poem a sense of forward motion, just as the Lady's mind moves relentlessly between Alexis and Damon.

One of the most pivotal stanzas demonstrates the Lady's struggle through meter and rhyme:

Alexis is gentle, and dresses with taste, 
But Damon has wit, and a shape for delight. 
In raptures Alexis will deeper amaze, 
But Damon's soft passion will shorten the days.

The flowing iambic pentameter pulls the reader along through the Lady's assessments of the two men's qualities. The rhyming pairs like "taste"/"delight" and "amaze"/"days" connect and give equal weight to attributes of each suitor, conveying how the Lady sees them as comparable options. The stanza's conclusion leaves the reader, like the Lady, suspended between the two and unable to settle definitively on one or the other.

In the final six lines, the Lady recognizes that she must make a choice, but remains caught between passion and virtue, Alexis and Damon:

Then let me advise—nor account me too nice—
That beauty and wit may be false and decay;
But virtue alone is the treasure we prize, 
And still shall remain when all else fades away.
Yet passion is pleasing, and virtue severe,
And youth claims indulgence from wisdom's debate

The rhyming pairs continue to link Alexis/virtue and Damon/passion. While the Lady professes that "virtue alone" is most prized, the concluding lines convey that passion and pleasure still strongly tempt her. The flowing meter leads the reader through another cycle of the Lady's debate without indication that she has escaped her state of indecision or resolved her inner conflict. Through skilled use of meter and rhyme, Swift crafts a portrait of the Lady caught between reason and desire, unable to find clear resolution. The poetic form and devices reinforce this central theme of wavering and indecision in the poem.
