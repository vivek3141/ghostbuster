Based on Burt Lanchester's forecasts of costs and cash flows for Malibu  Garden Furniture Ltd's manufacturing and sale of garden chairs in January 2006, I would make the following recommendations:

1. Increase the sales price of the garden chairs to $110 to improve the profit forecast. At the current forecasted sales price of $100 per chair, the profit forecast shows only $90,000 in profit for the month of January based on selling 900 chairs. While revenue would increase to $99,000 if the price increases to $110 per  chair. This would increase profits to $126,000, a 40% increase from the current  forecast. The higher price is still reasonable and competitive based on the high quality and brand recognition of Malibu's garden furniture, so sales volumes are unlikely to decrease significantly due to the price increase.   

2. Decrease production to 700 chairs for the month instead of 900 chairs to improve the cash flow forecast. The cash flow forecast currently shows a net cash outflow of $64,000 for the month due to high costs of production. Reducing production by 200 chairs would decrease costs by $180,000, turning the forecasted cash flow positive with an inflow of $116,000.   The reduced production would not impact sales or revenue in January since there is sufficient inventory to meet the forecasted sales volumes. The improved cash flow from reduced production costs can be used to pay down existing debt or reinvest in operations.

3. Consider decreasing production further if needed based on future sales forecasts. With the recommended price increase and decrease in production, Malibu can achieve higher profits and positive cash flow in January. However, if future months show lower sales forecasts, further cuts to production may be needed to continue improving cash flow. The company should monitor both sales and costs closely to make adjustments to the production schedule.

In summary, by increasing the sales price to $110 per chair and decreasing production to 700  chairs, Malibu Garden Furniture Ltd can substantially improve their profit and cash flow forecasts for January 2006. The profit forecast would increase by 40% due to the higher sales revenue and positive cash flow of $116,000 would be achieved from lower production costs. Recommendations for future months would depend on updated sales forecasts, but controlling costs through efficient production scheduling should remain a high priority. With these recommendations, Malibu Garden Furniture Ltd can start the year with a stronger financial position.
