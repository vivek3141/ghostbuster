Weight regulation in humans is affected by many complex factors, some under an individual's control and some not. The primary factors that contribute to weight regulation include genetics, metabolism, diet, activity level, and other lifestyle factors. However, individuals generally have less control over their weight regulation than they think.

To begin with, genetics plays a significant role in determining a person's weight and propensity to gain or lose weight. Twin studies have shown that body weight is substantially heritable, around 70% influenced by a person's genetics. Certain genes have been identified that can influence appetite regulation, metabolism, and how much fat a person tends to store. For some individuals with a genetic predisposition to obesity, losing weight can be very difficult despite attempting major lifestyle changes. However, genetics alone does not fully determine weight and individuals can still employ lifestyle changes to have an impact.

Metabolism is another factor that contributes to weight regulation but is largely out of an individual's control. A person's basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the rate that their body burns energy at rest and is largely governed by factors like organ size, hormones, and body sizeâ€”not under conscious control. Some people are blessed with a higher BMR, allowing them to eat more without gaining weight, while others have lower BMRs and gain weight more easily. Exercise and diet can affect metabolism over the long run but increasing BMR is challenging to do through lifestyle changes alone.

Diet and activity level are factors that individuals have some control over, but they can be influenced by many external factors as well. Choosing healthy, nutritious foods and watching portion sizes can aid weight loss, but food choices are also strongly affected by availability, affordability, culture, and family environment. An active lifestyle with regular exercise is also key to weight management and losing excess weight. However, today's modern sedentary lifestyle, long work hours, and urban design that discourages walking and biking make it difficult for many to get enough activity. While diet and exercise are in theory under a person's control, in reality there are many barriers to optimal choices.

In summary, while diet and activity level are modifiable factors that individuals can target to regulate their weight, the influence of genetics, metabolism, environment, and other factors mean that for many people control over weight is limited. Losing weight and keeping it off is difficult, as the body seeks to maintain homeostasis and will adapt to changes by slowing metabolism and altering hormones that regulate hunger and satiety. With a complex interplay between so many contributors to weight regulation, most individuals have less control over their weight than commonly assumed. Targeted lifestyle changes and maintaining realistic expectations are most likely to lead to success. Overall, weight regulation is complex with many influencing factors, some within our control and some not. For most people, willpower alone may not be enough.
