Nation states have undoubtedly lost a significant degree of economic dominance in the era of globalization. Several global forces have challenged the economic power and autonomy that states traditionally enjoyed. Capital mobility, multinational corporations (MNCs) and transnational corporations (TNCs), and international organizations have all constrained the economic power of nation states to varying degrees. 

Capital mobility refers to the ability of capital to move across borders. This has been greatly enhanced by globalization, with the liberalization of financial markets and advancements in technology enabling near real-time flows of funds across the globe. This poses challenges to nation states as it is difficult for them to control these cross-border flows and implement policies like capital controls. States have to pivot to attracting capital flows instead of restricting them, compromising their economic independence.

MNCs and TNCs also diminish the economic power of nation states as they are able to conduct economic activity across borders and even shift resources and operations from country to country based on cost and strategic considerations. They are footloose and able to avoid regulations and taxation by nation states. States have to provide incentives like tax breaks, subsidies and lax regulations to attract MNCs and TNCs, again compromising their economic power. 

International organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) establish rules and norms of behavior that constrain nation statesâ€™ economic policies. For example, the WTO prohibits certain subsidies, tariffs and other restrictions that states have traditionally used to protect domestic industries. While states voluntarily join such organizations to gain reciprocal benefits of market access, they give up some economic flexibility and control in the process.

However, nation states are not powerless under globalization. They have adopted a range of strategies to preserve and even strengthen their economic dominance. These include competitive deregulation to attract capital and MNCs, using trade policies like non-tariff barriers in a strategic manner, and participating actively in international organizations to shape rules and economic norms from within. States also form or join regional trade blocs to give them more collective bargaining power on the global stage.

In conclusion, while nation states have lost substantial economic dominance due to global forces like capital mobility, MNCs and international organizations, they maintain a degree of control through shrewd statecraft and policy maneuvers. The tussle for economic power between nation states and global actors remains unsettled, but states who adapt innovatively are able to balance national interests with global realities. Overall, nation states and globalization forces are still grappling with optimal ways to share economic influence and governance on issues that transcend borders.
