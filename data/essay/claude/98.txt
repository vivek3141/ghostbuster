To what extent did the Church of England impose its moral values on society during the transformation from Elizabethan times to the early Stuart era?

The Church of England, or Anglican Church, held considerable power over morality and values in English society during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The Church imposed moral codes and regulations on both public and private life. However, the extent of imposition was not absolute and the Anglican Church's authority was challenged in many ways. 

During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I in the late 1500s, the Anglican Church solidified its role as the official state Church of England after breaking from the Catholic Church. The Act of Supremacy in 1558 named the monarch as the supreme head of the Church of England, giving the crown power over religious doctrine and policy. The Church imposed a set of moral values and religious obligations on English subjects. The Book of Common Prayer outlined approved rituals and practices. The Thirty-Nine Articles defined key aspects of Anglican faith and any deviation was considered heresy. The Church expected all subjects to attend Sunday services and follow its teachings.

The Stuart monarchs in the early 1600s continued to uphold the state religion, with King James I even asserting "divine right of kings" - that his authority came directly from God. The Church imposed strict moral codes on sexuality, marriage, family life, education, gambling, alcohol use, and more. Religious courts like the Court of High Commission enforced religious uniformity and moral discipline. The Church and state worked together to promote moral regulation at both official and popular levels.

However, the imposition of moral values was not absolute. There were dissenting religious groups that rejected Anglican doctrines like the Puritans, as well as non-conforming individuals. Poverty and illiteracy limited the reach of the Church. Moreover, popular culture was not always aligned with official religious values. Many continued folk practices and enjoyed entertainments condemned by the Church like dancing, sports, and festivals. 

There were also political limits on the Church's power. The Church relied on the support of the monarch and Parliament. When King Charles I sought to impose Anglican reforms that moved the Church in a more Protestant direction, it led to conflicts with Parliament and contributed to the English Civil War. After the Restoration of the monarchy, the Church attempted to re-exert control but faced the rise of dissenting Protestant groups and growing religious tolerance.

In conclusion, while the Anglican Church imposed moral and religious values on 16th and 17th century English society to a substantial degree through its position as the state church, its control was not absolute due to political, social, and cultural limits on its authority. The extent of its imposition fluctuated with the religious policies of the ruling monarch and conflicts over church governance and doctrine.  The transformation of English society during this period cannot be attributed to the Church of England alone. There were many other influencing factors that also shaped emerging values in the broader culture and popular life of the people.
