Mathematics has progressed rapidly over the past decade, driven in large part by advances in computing and applied mathematics. Applied mathematics, which studies real-world problems using mathematical tools, has become increasingly important. In France, much mathematical research focuses on applications in areas like engineering, physics, and economics. 

While mathematically elegant and theoretically important, some historical results may have limited practical applicability. For example, Cauchy's binomial theorem provides a general formula for raising binomials to any power, but its representations of functions using infinite series can be problematic for calculating values. Cauchy's work has raised questions about whether functions can be accurately represented using Taylor series expansions.

Mathematics journals have been instrumental in disseminating new discoveries and enabling progress. In early 19th-century Germany, Crelle's Journal provided a platform for mathematicians like Abel to publish groundbreaking work. In 1824, Niels Henrik Abel published a proof that showed that general quintic equations could not be solved by radicals. This was a major discovery that demonstrated the need for new methods beyond those of earlier mathematicians like Gauss.

In recent decades, computing has enabled new branches of applied mathematics and driven mathematical progress. Researchers now use computational tools to solve complex problems, analyze vast amounts of data, and gain insights in many fields. Powerful computers have also facilitated theoretical advances, allowing mathematicians to solve problems that were previously intractable. 

In summary, mathematics has seen significant progress on both theoretical and applied fronts in recent years. Journals and computing have been key enablers of discovery. While mathematicians continue to build on foundational work from predecessors like Cauchy, they are also forging new paths to gain insights and solve 21st-century problems. Overall, mathematics is thriving as a discipline because of its enduring relevance to both practice and theory.
