Participating in the presentations for the Leadership and Communication module has provided me the opportunity to develop critical soft skills that are essential for personal and team effectiveness. The emphasis of the module on self-reflection, open interpretation of topics, and skills development has been particularly valuable in cultivating these abilities.  

One of the key soft skills I have enhanced is communication. The module required delivering multiple presentations on self-selected topics, involving conveying complex ideas to peers and receiving feedback. This process of articulating thoughts, engaging the audience, and adapting to questions has strengthened my oral communication proficiency. I have become more adept at organizing ideas, being concise yet compelling, making eye contact, and tailoring language for impact. These skills translate directly to workplace situations like meetings, negotiations, and client interactions.

Another area of growth is creative thinking. The open-ended nature of presentation topics and the encouragement to explore issues from new angles have expanded my capacity for unstructured ideation and problem-solving. I have developed more comfort in generating novel solutions and looking beyond the obvious. By observing teammates' diverse perspectives, I have also picked up techniques for sparking new ideas through free association of concepts and probing underlying assumptions. These creative thinking skills are highly relevant for innovation, strategic planning, and navigating ambiguity.

While I have made progress, continuous improvement of soft skills requires conscious effort and practice. Going forward, I plan to seek out or create more opportunities to strengthen communication and creative thinking. This could include starting a blog to articulate my thoughts coherently, participating in debates to receive real-time feedback, brainstorming with colleagues on open-ended workplace challenges, and observing inspiring public speakers. I will also reflect regularly on experiences, examine what went well and what could be enhanced, and make incremental changes to my approach. With persistence, these soft skills can become enduring strengths.

In summary, the Leadership and Communication module has meaningfully developed my soft skills through its emphasis on open-ended learning and self-directed growth. I have enhanced communication and creative thinking abilities that are essential for both personal and professional excellence. While further improvement is always possible, I now have a framework for continuous progress through practical experience, reflection, and refinement. Overall, the module has cultivated skills that will serve me well for the long term.
