Traditional class models that divide society into hierarchical categories based on socioeconomic status and level  of wealth or income may not provide a complete picture when examining international tourism. While wealth and income still play a significant role in enabling international travel as a leisure pursuit, factors like globalization, increasing democratization of air travel, and the rise of budget tourism options have made international travel more accessible across class categories. However, inequalities and barriers still persist in international tourism that reflect traditional class divides. 

On the one hand, greater affordability and accessibility of international travel suggest that traditional class models may be outdated or less relevant. Air travel costs have declined in real terms, low-cost carriers have proliferated, and budget accommodation options have emerged around the world. According to the World Tourism Organization, the rise of budget airlines and tourism options has enabled more people from middle and working classes to engage in international leisure travel. Globalization has also exposed more people to foreign cultures and destinations, creating demand for travel across wider segments of populations. 

Democratization of travel has indeed led to greater participation in international tourism across classes. Data shows significant increases in international tourist arrivals over the past few decades, suggesting travel has become more common and mainstream. Surveys of travelers also show a diversity of socioeconomic backgrounds participating in travel abroad. A wider range of travel offerings at multiple price points has undoubtedly contributed to the ability of more people from various class backgrounds to engage in global tourism today.

However, significant inequalities and barriers still persist that reflect traditional class divisions. The majority of international travelers still come from wealthier developed nations, highlighting large discrepancies in ability to travel between developed and developing populations. While air travel may be more affordable and accessible relative to the past, the costs of international airfare and accommodation remain prohibitive for much of the world's poor. Wealthier travelers also have the means to travel more frequently and extensively, visiting multiple destinations in a single trip and engaging in more lavish spending on upscale lodging, dining, and activities. 

Studies show large segments of populations even in developed countries still do not travel abroad, with lack of money cited as the top barrier. Within populations that do travel internationally, higher income individuals dominate in frequency and length of trips taken. Visitation rates to developing world destinations in particular remain largely determined by income,  with wealthier travelers much more able to visit long-haul and developing world destinations, especially for leisure purposes. While budget options facilitate more access, luxury travel remains the domain of the wealthiest classes and is in fact seeing some of the strongest growth.

In conclusion, while traditional models of strict class hierarchies may require updating to account for the democratization of international tourism, significant inequalities remain that reflect the persistent influence of socioeconomic status and income on global travel patterns. Greater affordability and accessibility of travel have enabled more diverse populations to engage in tourism abroad, but higher income individuals and those from wealthier nations still dominate in terms of frequency, distance, duration, and lavishness of travel. More work is needed to enable the benefits  of international tourism to be shared equally across classes both within and between countries. Overall, class remains a highly relevant factor when analyzing inequalities in access to international leisure travel today.
