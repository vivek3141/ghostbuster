In his Critique of Judgment, Immanuel Kant argues that reason allows the human mind to grasp concepts that surpass the limits of imagination, particularly in experiencing the mathematical and dynamic sublimes. For Kant, the imagination has a maximum, finite magnitude it can comprehend, based on the maximum size of images it can form. Reason, however, is capable of conceiving of infinitely large magnitudes through a process of successive addition and expansion. This allows reason to exceed imagination.

Kant first addresses how we can obtain concepts of extremely large magnitudes that seem to surpass imagination. He argues that we cannot have an image or intuition of infinitely large magnitudes, as imagination has a maximum. We can, however, think infinity through the intellectual idea of successive addition: by representing an object and recognizing we can always add more to its size. This process can continue indefinitely, giving us a concept of infinity that surpasses what we can imagine. However, this is merely a concept - we cannot have a corresponding sensible intuition.

For Kant, this method of measuring magnitude through concepts rather than intuition is the aesthetic way of judging size. It has limitations, as without intuition, we cannot assign a precise magnitude or gain a full sense of the object’s size. The aesthetic estimation also cannot be communicated precisely to others. However, it allows reason to conceive the immeasurable, enabling the experience of the mathematical sublime.

Kant holds that we can never have knowledge of an actual infinite as an object. The infinite is not a quantity that we can perceive or grasp totally. However, reason can conceive of the infinite negatively, as that which surpasses any assignable quantity. For Kant, we form the idea of infinity by realizing any finite quantity we posit can be exceeded. The infinite is a concept of reason alone, though it arises in the attempt to grasp sensible objects aesthetically that seem to surpass imagination.

True sublimity for Kant thus refers to the ability of reason to conceive ideas that exceed the imagination, giving us intimations of infinity. The sublime arises when imagination is overcome in grasping an object aesthetically, and reason takes over, forming an idea of absolute greatness not limited to what imagination alone can comprehend. In this way, the sublime displays the ultimate ability of human reason to transcend sensibility, forming concepts not tethered to the constraints of imagination or experience. The sublime reveals our capacity for formulating rational ideas, even those surpassing intuition.  

In conclusion, Kant argues reason allows us to conceive concepts beyond imagination, especially in experiencing the mathematical and dynamic sublime. While imagination has a maximum, finite magnitude, reason can represent infinity through successive addition. Estimating magnitudes aesthetically has limits but gives intimations of the immeasurable. For Kant, true sublimity refers to reason conceiving ideas surpassing imagination, giving a sense of infinity that highlights reason’s transcendence of sensibility. Overall, the sublime reveals our highest cognitive faculty: the ability to form rational ideas independent of experience.
