Max Weber, the renowned German sociologist, argued that the emergence of modern capitalism in Western Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries was significantly influenced by the rise of Protestantism, especially Calvinism. In his famous book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, published in 1904, Weber hypothesized that certain Protestant values and beliefs promoted habits and attitudes that ultimately contributed to the development of capitalism.  

According to Weber, the key factors in the emergence of capitalism were the accumulation and investment of capital, and the rational organization of free labor. Both of these were made possible by a new spirit that emphasized efficiency, rational calculation, and the idea that labor and work were divinely ordained duties. Weber argued that the Protestant Reformation, especially Calvinism, fostered this new spirit. The theological doctrine of predestination in Calvinism—the idea that God has predetermined who will attain salvation—led its followers to look for signs that they counted among the elect. They believed that one sign was the possession of material blessings and financial success. As a result, Calvinists developed a strong ethos that valued hard work, discipline, and efficient use of time and money.

This "Protestant work ethic" encouraged believers to engage in constant labor and accumulate profits for investment rather than spend them on leisure or consumption. The pursuit of wealth became morally justified, even praiseworthy. At the same time, the new Protestant faiths eliminated the medieval Catholic doctrines that prohibited "usury"—that is, the charging of interest on loans. This made the accumulation and investment of capital through lending and finance possible on a large scale. 

For Weber, this combination of the work ethic and the sanctioning of capitalist activity led to the "spirit of capitalism"—the rational pursuit of profit and efficiency for their own sake. This spirit then spread beyond the Protestant communities to society as a whole. The result was the development of modern industrial capitalism, centered first in England, Scotland, and the northern Protestant regions of continental Europe.

In contrast, Weber argued, the predominance of Catholicism and Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Southern and Eastern Europe did not produce the same results. Those faiths lacked a comparable work ethic and did not fully legitimate capitalist accumulation and investment. Thus, capitalism developed much more slowly in Catholic and Orthodox countries. This, according to Weber, explains the "economic divergence" between the capitalist West and the pre-capitalist economies of Southern and Eastern Europe from roughly 1500 to 1900.  

In summary, Weber's thesis is that certain Protestant values and beliefs—especially the Calvinist work ethic and legitimation of capitalist activity—were instrumental in spurring the rise of modern capitalism in Western Europe by creating the mindset, conditions, and "spirit" that promoted rational economic action. The absence of those values and beliefs in Catholic and Orthodox Europe helps explain why capitalism failed to emerge there during the same time period. Overall, Weber provides a seminal argument about how religious ideas influence economic development.
