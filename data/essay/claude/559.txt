EU citizenship was established by the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 to strengthen the connection between citizens and the European Union. It has evolved to become a significant legal status that confers rights and protections on EU citizens. The main functions and significance of EU citizenship relate to facilitating the free movement of people within the EU, granting rights of residence and political participation, and promoting a European identity.

The core right attached to EU citizenship is the freedom of movement within the EU, as established by Article 21 TFEU and Directive 2004/38. This allows EU citizens to travel, work, live and study freely in any EU country. Case law, such as Martinez Sala, Grzelczyk, and Baumbast, has affirmed and clarified the scope of free movement rights for EU citizens and their family members. However, there are limits to free movement, such as requiring that citizens do not become an 'unreasonable burden' on the host state.

EU citizenship also grants the right of residence in EU countries, allowing EU citizens and their family members to live permanently in other member states. Directive 2004/38 specifies the conditions under which EU citizens can exercise their right to reside in another EU country. The right of residence is limited by requiring that citizens fulfill certain conditions around employment, self-sufficiency, and health insurance. The right of residence has been affirmed in cases such as Antonissen.

EU citizenship aims to promote a sense of European identity by granting certain political rights, such as the right to vote in local and European Parliament elections in one's country of residence, and the right to consular protection from other EU countries outside the EU. However, participation in national elections and constitutional referenda are reserved for citizens of the specific member state.

EU citizenship rights also extend to non-EU family members of EU citizens in certain circumstances. Directive 2004/38 outlines the conditions under which non-EU spouses, partners, children, and dependent family members can join or accompany an EU citizen exercising free movement rights. This helps to promote family life and support the free movement of EU citizens. However, rights for non-EU family members are more limited, and their legal status depends on their relationship with the EU citizen.

In conclusion, EU citizenship plays a significant role in Community law by facilitating the free movement of people, granting rights of residence and political participation across borders, and promoting a European identity. Although EU citizenship rights are limited by certain conditions, especially regarding non-EU family members, EU citizenship has strengthened the connection between citizens and the EU project.
