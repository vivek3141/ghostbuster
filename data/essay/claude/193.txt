The Commission of the European Communities (the Commission) is one of the main institutions of the European Union tasked with monitoring the implementation and application of EU law by Member States. Under Article 226 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC), the Commission has the power to take action against Member States that fail to fulfill an obligation under the Treaties. This enforcement mechanism, coupled with the principle of direct effect which allows individuals to invoke EU law provisions before national courts, aims to ensure the effective compliance and protection of EU law across Member States.

There are four main phases to the Commission's enforcement action. First, the Commission conducts a preliminary investigation into potential breaches of EU law. If a breach is found, the Commission issues a letter of formal notice to the Member State detailing the allegation and requesting clarification. If the Member State's response is unsatisfactory, the Commission issues a reasoned opinion, which is a formal request for the Member State to comply with EU law within a specified timeframe, typically 2 months. Failure to comply will result in the Commission bringing the case before the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU). At the CJEU, if the Member State is found in breach, it must take the necessary measures to comply or risk facing financial penalties.

The direct effect of certain EU law provisions allows individuals to invoke those rights in national courts against national measures that are incompatible with EU law. This reinforces the Commission's enforcement role by mobilizing private parties in the enforcement process. Although the Commission has the sole power to initiate infringement proceedings against a Member State, direct effect empowers individuals to protect their EU law rights when national authorities fail to properly implement EU law. This "decentralized" enforcement system reduces the burden on the Commission in terms of monitoring Member State compliance.

In conclusion, through the Article 226 procedure and the principle of direct effect, the Commission plays a crucial role in ensuring the effective enforcement of EU law within the national systems of Member States. While the Commission's enforcement power is limited to initiating infringement proceedings, direct effect amplifies the enforcement process by empowering national courts and individuals. The combination of centralized and decentralized enforcement mechanisms work together to guarantee Member States' compliance with EU obligations and the uniform application of EU law across national borders. Overall, these tools available to the Commission have strengthened the authority of EU law and its impact on the national sphere.
