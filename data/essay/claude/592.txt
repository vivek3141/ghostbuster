The state of nature is a conceptual tool used by political philosophers Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau to analyze the transition of human society from a pre-governmental state to a political society governed by laws and authority. For Hobbes, the state of nature is a hypothetical scenario characterized by anarchy, chaos, and violence. In this condition, there is no concept of justice or morality, and humans are in a constant state of "war of all against all." Life is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." 

To escape this harsh reality, Hobbes argued that individuals come together and establish a social contract, giving up some of their natural rights and freedoms to a sovereign in exchange for protection and security. The sovereign establishes a commonwealth, with absolute authority to enforce laws and quell violence. For Hobbes, nearly any limitation on natural rights can be justified to escape the fear and disorder of the state of nature.

Locke had a more optimistic view of human nature and the state of nature. For him, the state of nature is a state of perfect freedom and equality. However, there are natural laws even in this pre-political state that guarantee certain rights like life, liberty, and property. The state of nature risks falling into disorder, so people establish a social contract and a government to better protect their natural rights. But the government itself is also subject to natural law, and citizens retain the right to overthrow a government that violates natural rights.

Rousseau depicted the state of nature differently as well. For him, the state of nature represents human beings in their natural goodness and independence. However, as societies become more complex and unequal, the state of nature is lost. The social contract is meant to regain the natural freedom and equality through a democratic process where citizens shape the laws that govern them. However, Rousseau acknowledges that society and politics inherently involve a loss of some natural rights in exchange for civil and political rights.

In Leviathan, Hobbes's work describing his political philosophy, he builds upon his notion of the state of nature and the need for the absolute authority of a sovereign to establish a stable commonwealth. The work is named after the biblical sea monster, emphasizing the need for a strong sovereign at the head of the body politic to instill order and security. For Hobbes, the horrors of the state of nature and the fear of death and violence justify an almost unrestrained sovereign with power over all aspects of political and civil life.

Overall, the hypothetical state of nature played an influential role in the political philosophies of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. But their conceptions of human nature led to different accounts of the state of nature and different prescriptions for the proper relationship between the natural state, civil society, and government authority. The state of nature has enduring appeal as a device for understanding human freedoms and the necessity of government. But there remains disagreement over how to balance natural rights with civil order and the extent to which government authority should be constrained.
