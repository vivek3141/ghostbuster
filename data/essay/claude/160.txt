What are the conceptual flaws of neo-realism in international relations?

Neo-realism, also known as structural realism, emerged in the late 1970s and 1980s as an attempt to update classical realism by focusing on the structure of the international system as the primary driver of state behavior. Though it offers a compelling model of the international system, neo-realism has three key conceptual flaws.

The first flaw is that neo-realism overemphasizes the influence of the structure of the international system and ignores domestic factors. Neo-realists argue that states will act to maximize relative power regardless of which political leaders or domestic interests are in power. The state is treated as a black box, its internal dynamics irrelevant to understanding its foreign policy. As a result, neo-realism struggles to explain significant variations in state behavior that are driven by domestic political and economic factors. Countries like the U.S. and Soviet Union during the Cold War did not engage in simply "power maximization"â€”they pursued ideologically driven agendas on the global stage that strongly reflected their differing domestic political systems and values. Neo-realism fails to incorporate domestic politics and interests into its theory.    

The second flaw is that neo-realism adopts an overly rationalist model of the state and state behavior. Neo-realists assume states deliberately and rationally pursue strategies to maximize power in a logical, calculated manner. In reality, states often act in ways that are reactive, emotional, or unpredictable. Leadership misperceptions, bureaucratic politics, and imperfect information  frequently lead states to make suboptimal decisions that do not actually maximize their relative power or security. Rational choice theory, on which neo-realism depends, is an unrealistic model of state behavior and decision making.

A third flaw is that neo-realism portrays the international system as static when in reality it is continually evolving. The theory emerged during the Cold War when bipolarity and superpower competition characterized the global order. However, after the Cold War the international system became more multipolar and globalized. Existing neo-realist arguments largely fail to explain the dynamics of the post-Cold War period and the increasing influence of non-state actors. The theory is tied too closely to the era in which it developed rather than capturing the essence of international relations and state behavior across historical contexts.

In conclusion, while neo-realism offers a compelling theory of international relations focusing on the influences of structure, it has significant conceptual flaws. It ignores domestic factors, relies on an unrealistic rationalist model of the state, and portrays the international system as static. Alternative theories like liberalism, constructivism and globalism address these limitations and provide more persuasive explanations for state behavior and the dynamics of international relations. Overall, neo-realism overreaches in its attempt to reduce international politics to systemic factors alone.
