Insider dealing, where individuals trade securities based on material non-public information for personal gain, undermines investor confidence and fairness in the market. While regulation and criminalization of insider dealing aims to prevent such abusive practices, the current regulatory framework faces significant challenges in effectively detecting and punishing offenders. 

Regulation of insider dealing, including civil penalties and criminal sanctions, deters potential offenders and maintains market integrity. However, there are difficulties in gathering sufficient evidence to build a strong case, especially when traders carefully hide their wrongdoing. The existing disclosure requirements and monitoring systems have limited success in identifying illicit insider trades in real time. Though post-trade analysis could detect suspicious activities, the damage has already been done. Tougher penalties may raise the stakes but do not necessarily translate to higher detection and conviction rates.

Some argue insider dealing should not be subject to criminal sanctions as it is essentially a "victimless" act. This view fails to consider the larger impact on investor and public trust in the system. If left unchecked, insider dealing can severely distort the level playing field and efficient market hypothesis. However, criminal punishments should target the source of inside information, such as corporate executives, rather than traders who may be far removed and unaware of its illegitimate nature. Punishing the wrong parties risks overreach and abuse.

To improve the efficacy of regulation, policymakers should focus on expedited detection of insider trades by using technology and machine learning to analyze huge volumes of data for patterns in real time. They should also increase penalties for obstruction of justice to incentivize whistleblowing and cooperation. Giving regulators more flexibility and resources to investigate suspicious trades thoroughly and across borders promotes efficient enforcement. 

In conclusion, though regulation of insider dealing is imperfect, it remains necessary to protect market integrity. Effectiveness depends less on the severity of penalties than on the ability to catch offenders quickly. With technology and international cooperation, regulators can stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated unlawful trading practices. Overall, the goal should be a fair, transparent and trusted system where illegal insider dealing is not worth the risk.
