Euthanasia refers to the intentional ending of a life to relieve suffering. There are two main types of euthanasia: active euthanasia, where a physician administer lethal drugs to induce death at the patient's request, and passive euthanasia, where life-prolonging medical treatment is withheld or withdrawn, leading to natural death. Physician-assisted suicide refers to the physician providing the means for the patient to end their own life. There are arguments for and against allowing euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.

Those in favor of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide argue that individuals have a right to make autonomous decisions about their end-of-life care and avoid needless suffering. Restricting these practices infringes on patient autonomy and dignity. Moreover, passive euthanasia is already allowed, so active euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are consistent extensions of a patient's right to choose. Opponents counter that euthanasia and assisted suicide violate the Hippocratic Oath that physicians swear to uphold. There are also concerns about the potential for abuse and slippery slopes. Allowing these practices even in limited circumstances, such as for terminally ill patients, could eventually expand to include non-terminally ill or vulnerable patients.

The distinction between acts and omissions is controversial in euthanasia cases. Passive euthanasia (withholding or withdrawing treatment) is viewed by some as merely allowing natural death, whereas active euthanasia (administering lethal drugs) constitutes killing. However, others argue there is no moral difference between the two if the intention is to end life to relieve suffering. The principle of 'double effect' is sometimes used to justify passive euthanasia. It states that an action resulting in a bad effect is morally permitted if the bad effect is not intended and the good effect outweighs the bad effect. However, critics argue that in cases of euthanasia, death is the means to relieve suffering, so the bad effect is intended, undermining the principle.

In conclusion, there are compelling arguments on both sides of the euthanasia debate. The distinctions between active and passive euthanasia and between acts and omissions are complex, with reasonable ethical cases to be made for and against them. The principle of double effect provides limited guidance. Ultimately,...
