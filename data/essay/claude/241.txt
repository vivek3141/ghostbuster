The key questions discussed before the House of Lords in the cases of S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom regarding the retention of fingerprints and DNA samples were whether the blanket policy of retaining such biometric data after individuals had been acquitted of a crime amounted to a violation of their right to privacy as protected under Articles 8 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. There were differing opinions on this issue among the Law Lords. 

Lord Steyn argued that retaining the fingerprints and DNA samples of individuals who had been acquitted of an offense and were deemed innocent amounted to an unjustified interference with their right to privacy. He noted that such data contains sensitive information about a person and retaining it serves to stigmatize innocent people by associating them with criminal records. Lord Steyn argued that the policy of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire to retain all samples and data except in exceptional cases was disproportionate and not necessary in a democratic society.

In contrast, Baroness Hale of Richmond disagreed that retention of biometric data after acquittal amounted to a violation of privacy rights. She argued that while DNA samples and fingerprints do contain private information, they only reveal limited data about a person's identity and characteristics. Retaining such data, even of innocent individuals, helps to aid effective law enforcement by allowing the police to rule out potential suspects during investigations. Baroness Hale also noted that samples and fingerprints are not actually used or checked regularly once retained, but only accessed if a person comes under suspicion of involvement in a future offense. Thus, retention does not necessarily stigmatize or harm individuals.

The arguments for the Chief Constable's policy centered around the benefits of retaining extensive biometric databases for law enforcement. Retaining DNA samples and fingerprints of all individuals, even those acquitted of an offense, allows for a greater pool of data that can be used to aid future criminal investigations by helping to exclude potential suspects or identify culprits. Some argued that if only samples of convicted individuals were retained, it may allow some offenders to escape justice solely due to lack of data. The arguments against the policy focused on civil liberties concerns, especially regarding the right to privacy. Retaining sensitive biometric data of innocent individuals who have been acquitted amounts to unfair stigmatization and a "climate of universal suspicion." Overall, there were compelling arguments on both sides of this issue, regarding the balance between individual privacy rights and public interests of security and law enforcement.
