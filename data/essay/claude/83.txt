The number of thiol groups in the protein ovalbumin can be determined using Ellman’s reagent, which is 5,5’-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) or DTNB. DTNB reacts with free thiol groups to form a mixed disulfide and the yellow-colored anionic product 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate (TNB2-). The increase in absorbance at 412 nm that accompanies this reaction can be used to calculate the total number of thiol groups in ovalbumin. However, the presence of the anionic detergent SDS can negatively impact this measurement by interfering with the reaction between DTNB and thiol groups. 

SDS is often used to denature proteins and break down higher order structure, but its anionic nature means it can bind to positively charged areas of proteins. This binding and unfolding effect of SDS could block access to thiol groups or alter their chemical environment, impacting their reactivity. The SDS micelles could also directly react with DTNB, consuming the reagent and leading to an underestimation of thiol groups. To address this, SDS should be removed from the protein solution prior to measurement. Methods for SDS removal include dialysis, size exclusion chromatography, and organic solvent precipitation. These techniques work by separating the SDS from the protein solution, allowing the protein to refold while removing the interfering detergent.

Refolding of proteins after denaturation is impacted by the primary structure of the polypeptide chain. Certain amino acid sequences are more likely to interact and form stabilizing folds and structures. The formation of disulfide bonds between thiol groups also contributes to proper protein folding and structure. For ovalbumin, its eight disulfide bonds are critical for regaining native structure after denaturation. Studies on protein refolding after chemical denaturation with urea or GdnHCl have shown that dilution or dialysis to remove the denaturant combined with a glutathione redox buffer allows for efficient refolding of ovalbumin with restoration of secondary and tertiary structure. The rate of refolding depends on the concentration of reduced and oxidized glutathione which donate and accept electrons for disulfide bond formation.

In summary, the number of thiol groups in ovalbumin can be measured using DTNB, but SDS interference requires removal of the detergent before accurate measurement can be obtained. Proper refolding of ovalbumin into its native conformation depends on its amino acid sequence and ability to re-form stabilizing interactions like disulfide bonds. Removal of denaturants and providing a suitable redox environment with glutathione are keys to successful refolding of ovalbumin after denaturation. Overall, by eliminating interfering substances, providing an environment conducive for stable fold formation, and giving the protein sufficient time, one can determine the thiol count in ovalbumin and study how its structure is recovered after disruption.
