Recruitment and selection processes are essential to successfully hiring and retaining experienced hospitality and tourism employees. The hospitality industry's competitive job market and high staff turnover means that investing in effective selection and recruitment practices is invaluable to find candidates that match the job requirements and company culture. Best fit and soft human resource management (HRM) approaches that prioritize employee satisfaction and work-life balance can help reduce staff turnover and improve productivity.  

The hospitality industry's seasonal and high-contact nature often makes it difficult to find and retain skilled employees. Common selection practices like reviewing CVs and conducting unstructured interviews tend to favor subjective assessments of candidates. While convenient, these approaches risk overlooking qualified candidates or hiring poor matches. Using evidence-based selection methods like psychometric tests, assessment centers, and structured interviews helps overcome unconscious biases and provides objective assessments of candidates' abilities, values, and fit with the organizational culture. Structured interviews with standardized questions based on a job analysis ensure that all candidates receive a fair evaluation based on the core job requirements. Assessment centers and personality/ability tests provide quantifiable metrics to evaluate candidates objectively based on critical competencies. These innovative selection techniques, when combined with traditional methods, provide a balanced and in-depth analysis of candidates to make the best hiring decisions.

A "best fit" HRM approach, where recruitment and selection practices align with business goals and company culture, is well suited for the hospitality industry. However, a strict focus on corporate objectives risks compromising employee wellbeing and work-life balance, leading to higher staff turnover. "Soft" HRM models like Total Quality Management (TQM) that emphasize employee empowerment, training, and participation can improve job satisfaction, loyalty, and retention. TQM helps identify systemic issues contributing to turnover by continuously monitoring employee feedback to improve work conditions and career development opportunities. This people-centered approach cultivates a mutually supportive relationship between employers and staff.

In summary, innovative and objective selection methods help hospitality organizations make well-informed hiring decisions, while a "best fit" HRM approach ensures new recruits match the company's strategic goals. A "soft" TQM model builds on these strengths by prioritizing employee wellbeing and empowerment to improve retention, productivity, and service quality. Using a balanced combination of traditional and innovative recruitment and selection techniques tailored to organizational needs helps achieve and sustain a highly committed and competent workforce. Overall, effective recruitment and selection is crucial for hospitality companies seeking to gain a competitive advantage through service excellence and customer satisfaction.
