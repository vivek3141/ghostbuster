Consideration and intention to create legal relations are two key elements required to form a legally enforceable contract in English Contract Law. Consideration refers to the exchange of benefits or detriments between parties, while intention to create legal relations refers to the intention to be legally bound by the agreement. 

Although consideration and intention share the purpose of establishing contractual obligations, they differ fundamentally in their functions. Consideration aims to determine whether there was ‘bargained-for exchange' between parties, ensuring there is reciprocity built into the agreement. The doctrine of consideration survives despite criticisms regarding its arbitrary and rigid nature, as courts have applied it flexibly to uphold reasonable agreements. In contrast, intention to create legal relations ascertains parties’ mindsets in entering the agreement and whether they contemplated legal consequences, especially relevant for social and domestic contracts.

Consideration has been subjected to criticisms due its focus on reciprocity instead of the will of parties. However, English courts have demonstrated its flexibility in application, for example, by applying nominal or part-payments to satisfy consideration, or implying consideration from the conduct of parties. It continues to subsist as it helps achieve fairness and prevents unjust enrichment. Nominal consideration also reflects parties’ intention to enter legally binding relations. 

For domestic and social agreements, intention to create legal relations is more crucial in determining whether parties contemplated legal obligations. Courts consider various factors like the type of agreement, level of formality in entering the agreement, relationship between parties, language used, and subsequent conduct. For commercial contracts, an objective intention to be legally bound is assumed. However, for social/family arrangements, a subjective intention must often be ascertained using surrounding circumstances.

In conclusion, while consideration establishes the ‘bargained-for exchange' in a contract, the doctrine of intention examines parties’ mindsets and whether legal consequences were contemplated. Consideration has endured because of its continued usefulness and flexibility in application. Intention is pivotal in assessing domestic/social contracts where parties’ mental states must be determined subjectively. Both doctrines thus play integral yet differing roles in establishing legally enforceable agreements in English law.
