Urban growth and sprawl have had a significant impact on cities and surrounding areas in Britain. As cities have expanded outwards through the development of greenfield sites on the urban fringe, this has put pressure on transportation infrastructure, led to a loss of countryside and agricultural land, and contributed to a lack of affordable housing. 

Public transport has struggled to keep up with the demands of growing populations in urban areas and sprawling cities. New bus routes and rail lines are expensive to build, and low population densities on the outskirts of cities make public transit less viable and efficient. Many residents of these new sprawling developments rely on private vehicles, leading to increased traffic congestion, parking demands, and pollution. 

Population growth, especially in the post-World War II era, has been a major driver of urban sprawl in Britain. As populations have risen in cities, demand for new housing has led to development of greenfield sites as cities expand outwards. Loss of countryside and open spaces is an ongoing concern, as agricultural land and natural habitats are converted for housing and roads. There is a lack of affordable housing in many British cities, in part due to the outward expansion of urban areas rather than higher density redevelopment.

Green belts were established in Britain starting in the 1950s to contain urban sprawl by protecting countryside surrounding cities from development. However, green belts have received criticism as they can drive up housing prices in cities by limiting supply, and they have not prevented continued loss of agricultural land and open spaces over time. There are calls to make green belt land available for affordable housing and new transport links.

New towns were built starting in the 1950s to redirect population growth away from cities. However, many new towns have grown beyond their initial populations and boundaries, and still face issues like lack of transport links to city centers and lack of local employment opportunities. New towns have the potential for further development with increased public transit connections to major cities and promotion of local jobs in new sectors. 

Urban regeneration is important for redirecting growth back into existing urban areas. Redeveloping brownfield sites and underutilized spaces in cities can provide new housing and amenities while reducing the pressure for new development on greenfield sites on the urban fringe. Establishing high-density, mixed-use development with affordable housing and minimizing restrictions on vertical growth can encourage more people to live and work in existing urban spaces rather than in expanding suburbs. 

In conclusion, Britain continues to face challenges associated with balancing urban growth and protecting countryside. Policies such as green belts, new towns, and urban regeneration have had limited success in curbing sprawl and pressure on green spaces. Moving forward, Britain must address issues such as lack of affordable housing, loss of open spaces, inadequate public transit, and access to opportunities in order to build more sustainable cities.
