There are several facets of bias that can affect the judiciary and undermine judicial impartiality. These include pecuniary bias arising from a judge's financial interests, personal bias arising from a judge's relationships or views, and apparent bias where there is a perception of lack of impartiality even if there is none in reality.  

To uphold impartiality and public confidence in the judiciary, legal systems establish grounds to disqualify judges from hearing a case. In the UK, the law on bias as a ground for judicial review is set out in the case of Porter v Magill. The test is whether a fair-minded and informed observer would conclude that there was a real possibility of bias. However, the courts are generally reluctant to expand the grounds of appeal to a judge's social background, since this may lead to "judge-shopping" by parties.

In the context of an Employment Tribunal, the example of a judge who is a member of an organisation that lobbies for workers' rights is pertinent. While the judge's personal views alone would not necessarily indicate bias, if the organisation has actively campaigned on the specific issues before the tribunal, a fair-minded observer may perceive possible bias. As the legal advisor to the employer in this case, I would bring this to the attention of the tribunal and request that the judge recuse themselves to avoid any perception of bias. If the judge refuses, I would seek a judicial review of the decision on the grounds of apparent bias.

It is crucial that justice is not only done, but is seen to be done. An impartial judiciary is the foundation of a fair legal system and public confidence in it. While the grounds for disqualification should not be expanded lightly, judges should recuse themselves from any case where there may be a perception of bias to uphold the integrity of the system. In the example, the judge's membership of a campaigning organisation on its own should not warrant allegations of bias, but in the specific circumstances of the case, the perception of a "real possibility of bias" means the judge should step away from hearing it. Overall, the law as it stands strikes a fair balance, but constant vigilance is needed to protect the ideals of justice and fairness.
