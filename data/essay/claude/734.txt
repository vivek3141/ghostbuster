The Romantic era in English literature spanned the late 18th and early 19th centuries, roughly covering the years 1770 to 1850. The Romantic poets, including William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and John Keats, played a key role in shaping a new aesthetic stance that emphasized creativity, imagination, emotion, and a close connection with nature. Their poetry marked a radical break from the Enlightenment ideals of the previous generation, embracing passion over reason and celebrating the vitality of human consciousness. 

The shift from Neoclassical poetry to Romanticism was a response to the turmoil brought by the French and Industrial Revolutions, and a pushback against the scientific rationalism of the Enlightenment. The Romantic poets reacted against the highly formal and stylized poetry of poets like Alexander Pope, championing more natural and expressive language. They also rejected the notion that poetry should be written to didactic ends or to provide a moral lesson for the reader. Instead, they saw poetry as an outpouring of emotion and imagination, meant to evoke a visceral and personal response in the reader. 

A reverence for nature and intense emotional subjectivity are hallmarks of Romantic poetry. Wordsworth articulated the concept of “emotion recollected in tranquility” as a way to tap into memories and sensory experiences from nature. His poems like “Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey” and “I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud” use depictions of landscapes and natural scenes to explore the inner life of the poet. Similarly, Coleridge’s “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” and “Kubla Khan” employ fantastical and dream-like imagery to evoke a sense of wonder and mystery.

The Romantic poets also emphasized the creative power of the imagination and pushed at the boundaries of poetic form. Byron's epic poem “Don Juan” subverted literary conventions through its satirical and digressive style. Shelley’s “Ozymandias” played with the sonnet form, and his “Ode to the West Wind” invoked dynamic natural metaphors to represent spiritual rebirth and poetic inspiration. Keats's odes, including “On a Grecian Urn” and “To Autumn,” are sensuous celebrations of beauty and art.  

In conclusion, the Romantic poets made a profound impact on 19th century literature through their innovative approach to poetic language, emphasis on imagination and emotion, veneration of nature, and expansion of poetic forms. They ushered in new ways of thinking about creativity, spirituality, and human consciousness that shaped modern conceptions of art and literature.  Their radical vision helped launch a revolution in poetry that endured for generations.
