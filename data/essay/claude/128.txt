A stem and leaf plot shows the distribution of data values by "stemming" or truncating the most significant digits and displaying them on the left side of the plot. The digits to the right of the truncation show the "leaves" or less significant values, displayed to the right of the stems. For instance, in a plot of petiole length in inches with a truncation to the tens digit, the stems would be 3 for values in the 30s, 4 for the 40s, 5 for the 50s, and so on. The "leaves" to the right would show the ones digit, with 3|4 representing a value of 34. 

For log truncation of square root values, the stem and leaf plot would show the distribution of antilog values after taking the square root and truncating to a given digit place value. If truncating to the hundreds place, for example, the stems would represent 100s (1 for 100-199, 2 for 200- 299, etc.) and the leaves would show the tens and ones digits. A value of 325 would be represented by 3|25. This plot would show the overall distribution and central tendency of the square root values to the precision of the truncation.

To make the data more representative of all countries, additional samples from under-represented regions could be obtained. Presumably the initial data came from a sample of certain countries or regions, which introduces sampling bias. Obtaining additional data from countries in Africa, South America, and Asia would make the overall distribution more reflective of the true worldwide values and reduce sampling error. The new samples should come from randomly selected countries in under-represented regions. Simply obtaining more samples from the already well-represented regions would not address the sampling bias. 

There are a few potential limitations of the sample that could be addressed. First, the sample size may be too small to adequately represent worldwide values. Increasing the overall sample size, with additional samples coming from previously under-represented regions, would help minimize this limitation. Second, the data may be clustered around certain regions, reflecting geographical or cultural biases rather than true worldwide values. Random and representative sampling across all regions would address this clustering effect. Finally, certain influential outlier values could skew the distribution. Checking for and possibly removing influential outliers, while taking additional samples to maintain power, would help limit their effect.

In summary, the stem and leaf plot shows a distribution of square root values to the precision of the truncation point. To make the data more globally representative, additional random samples from under-represented regions and countries could be obtained. Possible sampling limitations like small sample size, clustering, and outlier effects may be addressed through further representative sampling, removal of influential outliers, and increasing the overall sample size while maintaining a geographical balance of the data points. By implementing these methods, the stem and leaf plot distribution can be made much more reflective of the variable's true worldwide values.
