The Transnational Capitalist System and Neo-Colonial Globalization 

The contemporary process of globalization is often portrayed as the increasing flow of people, culture, ideas, and commodities across the world. However, globalization is not just an inevitable process driven by new technologies and market forces. Rather, it is a process that is regulated and appropriated by powerful actors in the global system to serve their interests. In particular, the transnational capitalist system, comprised of large multinational corporations and international institutions that facilitate global trade and finance, plays a central role in governing globalization and directing its outcomes.

The transnational capitalist system emerged in the postwar era as capitalist production became increasingly global. Multinational corporations expanded their operations around the world, aided by new transportation and communications technologies as well as liberalized trade policies. They built global supply chains to maximize profits by locating production where costs were lowest. At the same time, international institutions like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Trade Organization (WTO) were established to facilitate global trade and open markets around the world through loans, policies, and agreements. 

Together, these multinational corporations and international institutions formed a transnational capitalist system that governs how globalization unfolds. They shape global flows of goods, services, money and investments in ways that primarily benefit large corporations and financial institutions based in Western countries. In the process, poorer countries in the Global South have become further integrated into the global economy, but in a subordinate position as exporters of cheap labor and raw materials. This has been described as a neo-colonial relationship, where the Global South remains in a state of dependence on and exploitation by the powerful capitalist actors of the Global North.

Multinational corporations have tremendous power to regulate globalization due to their vast economic resources and mobility. They make decisions about where to invest and produce in order to maximize profits, not for the benefit of workers or communities. Governments often feel compelled to comply with the demands of corporations in order to attract investment, offering tax incentives, cheap labor, and weak regulations. Corporations can also threaten to move operations to other locations if governments do not comply. This allows them to dictate the terms under which they will contribute to a countryâ€™s economy.

Developing countries have become particularly exposed to this unequal power dynamic. In need of investment and jobs for economic growth, they end up in a race to the bottom, offering lower and lower costs and standards to appeal to fickle global capital. The availability of cheap labor and resources for export in the Global South has fueled the rising power of multinational corporations. But the profits and benefits of global production networks accrue primarily to executives and shareholders in the Global North, not to workers in developing countries. 

This can be seen with large clothing and electronics brands that produce goods in Asian and Latin American countries through networks of suppliers. While production takes place in the Global South, the majority of profits end up in the Global North, triggering a net transfer of value. Developing countries also become dependent on exporting raw materials like agricultural goods and natural resources in this system. They are subject to the volatility of global commodity prices and the power of large agribusinesses and extractive industries that control materials supply chains.

International institutions have also advanced the interests of transnational capital in the process of globalization. The IMF and World Bank were established at the end of World War II to promote global trade and development, but disproportionately represent Western countries in their governance. They condition loans and debt relief for developing countries on the implementation of free market policies like privatization, deregulation, and cuts to public spending. These policies primarily benefit foreign investors, while limiting the ability of governments to protect domestic workers and industries. 

The WTO also establishes rules for global trade that advance the interests of its powerful members. Policies like intellectual property protections and unfettered market access have been imposed around the world through the WTO, benefiting multinational corporations. When countries do not comply, they face sanctions and expensive legal challenges. The dispute settlement process of the WTO is also disproportionately accessible to wealthy countries and companies that can afford years of litigation. This has made it difficult for developing countries to implement policies that protect public interests. 

In these ways, the transnational capitalist system regulates globalization in a manner that maintains global inequalities and a neo-colonial relationship between the Global North and South. While globalization has enabled greater connectivity across borders, it has also increased the reach of exploitative economic power dynamics around the world. Addressing these inequitable outcomes will require reforming multinational corporations and global institutions to make them more democratic, transparent and accountable to marginalized groups, not just transnational capital. Overall globalization must be transformed to serve global justice and shared prosperity between countries, not just maximizing profits and western economic dominance.
