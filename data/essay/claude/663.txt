Autonomy and freedom are core concepts in Western moral and political philosophy. Two of the most influential figures in this area of philosophy are Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Nietzsche. While Kant focuses on autonomy based on the exercise of will in accordance with moral law, Nietzsche has a more radical concept of freedom rooted in overcoming the illusions of morality and embracing Dionysian will to power. There are significant differences between how Kant and Nietzsche conceptualize autonomy, freedom, and the nature of the self. 

For Kant, autonomy is acting rationally, according to the moral law, known as the Categorical Imperative. Rational beings have a duty to act morally, respecting the equal worth and dignity of all persons. The morally autonomous agent is one who exercises their will in line with the universal law of reason. Freedom, for Kant, is the capacity to make rational choices that accord with the moral law. The self is the locus of reason and morality. To be truly free and autonomous is to obey the moral law and universal reason.

Nietzsche rejects Kant's conceptions of autonomy, freedom and the self. For Nietzsche, moral concepts like duty, the universal law, and the equal worth of persons are illusions that prevent human flourishing. Autonomy does not consist in following the moral law but in rejecting morality altogether. True freedom comes from liberating oneself from the restrictive grip of morality through acts of radical will. The fundamentally amoral self Nietzsche envisions is the creator of new values rooted in vital Dionysian instincts.          

Kant believes morality depends on reason alone, excluding inclinations and consequences. Nietzsche sees this as a distorted view of human nature that denies life. For Kant, the free and autonomous will is moved by reason, not desire or emotion. For Nietzsche, freedom and autonomy come from tapping into primal drives and passions, not reason. The Kantian self is a rational, duty-bound moral agent. The Nietzschean self rejects moral duty to pursue Dionysian self-creation.   

In conclusion, while Kant and Nietzsche both value autonomy and freedom, they have radically different conceptions of them. For Kant, autonomy and freedom are aligned with rational morality. For Nietzsche, they involve liberating the self from morality through radical acts of will to power. The fundamental differences in their views of morality, reason, desire, and the self yield opposing visions of the autonomous and free individual. Overall, the divide between Kant's Enlightenment faith in universal reason and Nietzsche's postmodern philosophy of radical self-creation represents a tectonic shift in thinking about autonomy, freedom and human flourishing.
