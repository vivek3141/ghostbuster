Parmenides' poem, On Nature, is one of the foundational texts of Ancient Greek philosophy. In the poem, Parmenides describes two "ways" of inquiry: the "Way of Truth," which leads to knowledge, and the "Way of Seeming," which leads only to opinion. The inclusion of the Way of Seeming has puzzled scholars, and there are several interpretations of why Parmenides included this Way in his poem.

One interpretation is that the Way of Seeming is included to show the reader the correct path by contrast. By laying out the erroneous Way of Seeming, Parmenides highlights the correct method of the Way of Truth. The contrast helps the reader see why the Way of Truth avoids the pitfalls of relying on perception and opinion. This view suggests Parmenides wanted to steer his readers away from a common but mistaken mode of thinking, represented in the Way of Seeming. However, if Parmenides wanted to simply reject the Way of Seeming, it is unclear why he would have devoted so much space in his poem to articulating it. The elaborate description of the Way of Seeming suggests it has more importance than merely serving as a foil.

A second view is that Parmenides intended the Way of Seeming as an explanatory device for those unable to grasp the rigorous logic of the Way of Truth. The Way of Seeming provides an alternative, more familiar account based on perception and cosmology. While not strictly true, this account is at least partly intelligible to ordinary people. On this interpretation, the Way of Seeming has pedagogical value, even if Parmenides believes only the Way of Truth represents the ultimate truth. The main shortcoming of this view is that the poem seems intended for thinkers who can engage in philosophical argumentation, not ordinary people requiring simplified explanations. 

A third interpretation is that the Way of Seeming represents a cosmological or scientific theory that Parmenides wanted to integrate with his logical and ontological conclusions from the Way of Truth. On this view, Parmenides explored the realm of phenomena and offered a coherent and systematic account of the world of appearances, even though he recognized this world is not ultimately real. The inclusion of the Way of Seeming thus has theoretical value, as an attempt to provide a comprehensive account of the cosmos consistent with Parmenides' philosophy. The strength of this interpretation is that it takes seriously the content of the Way of Seeming, rather than dismissing it as merely an explanatory prop. However, some argue the specifics of Parmenides' cosmology in fragment B12 are not coherent enough to constitute a serious scientific theory.

In my view, the third interpretation, that the Way of Seeming represents Parmenides' own cosmology, is the most compelling. The poem as a whole has a strong systematic intent, and to leave out the world of appearances would be an obvious oversight in Parmenides' grand metaphysical vision. While Parmenides recognizes the ultimate illusoriness of the world of the senses, this does not mean the phenomenal world is entirely incoherent or unintelligible. The Way of Seeming offers Parmenides' attempt to give a systematic account of appearances consistent with the insights from the Way of Truth. Recognizing the theory's shortcomings, Parmenides clings to the path of "Truth" as the only source of genuine knowledge but still seeks to incorporate appearances into his comprehensive vision. For these reasons, the Way of Seeming is best understood not as a foil or prop but as Parmenidesâ€™ honest attempt to offer a theory of the world as a whole.
