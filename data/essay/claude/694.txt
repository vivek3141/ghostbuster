The legal status of non-state actors involved in asymmetrical warfare is complex and controversial. On the one hand, non-state groups that engage in armed conflict are not officially parties to the Geneva Conventions or other International Humanitarian Law (IHL) treaties that regulate the means and methods of warfare and protect victims of armed conflict. However, some IHL rules, such as the prohibition of torture and inhumane treatment, are considered customary international law and thus binding on all parties to a conflict. 

The issue of terrorism further complicates the legal status of non-state actors. There is no universally accepted definition of terrorism, though most definitions consider terrorist acts to be violence against civilians for political aims. However, one person's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. The detention center at Guantanamo Bay highlights this controversy, as detainees have been denied POW status and habeas corpus rights, despite arguments that some were merely defending their territory against foreign occupation. Codifying terrorism risks further blurring the line between lawful and unlawful combatants in asymmetric warfare.

Giving non-state actors more legal protections could change the dynamics of asymmetric war. They may be less likely to disregard IHL rules if they had more to lose by doing so. However, expanding IHL to non-state groups risks legitimizing certain groups and granting them a legal status they do not deserve. It may also make it more difficult for states to take effective action against terrorist groups, who often deliberately operate from within civilian populations.

There are also risks in tightly integrating IHL and human rights law regarding non-state actors. IHL was designed to balance humanitarian concerns with the necessities of war, recognizing that some loss of life and liberty are unavoidable. Human rights law differs in granting wider protections to individuals even during emergencies. Prioritizing human rights may restrict states' lawful use of force and make asymmetric warfare more difficult to prosecute, while emphasizing IHL may leave non-state groups and civilians with too little protection.

The legal status of non-state groups in asymmetric warfare is multifaceted with many trade-offs to consider regarding the scope of legal rights and responsibilities for these actors. With no easy or universally accepted answers, this debate is sure to continue as warfare evolves in the 21st century. Overall, clarifying and expanding legal protections risks legitimizing terrorists, but also better upholds humanitarian values. A balance must be struck between these competing concerns to determine just legal limits in asymmetric war.
