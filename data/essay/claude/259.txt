The patriarchal system that had dominated European society for centuries came under increasingly challenge during  the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. However, while women pushed against patriarchal limitations in some spheres, their positions in other areas of society ultimately helped provide security to the system overall. 

In the religious sphere, some women gained more freedom and authority during this period. The Protestant Reformation opened up new religious vocations for women, such as becoming deaconesses in the Lutheran church or lay preachers in radical Protestant sects like the Quakers. Powerful female mystics like Teresa of Avila also challenged the male clerical hierarchy of the Catholic Church. However, mainstream religious institutions like the Catholic and Anglican churches still barred women from becoming priests or attaining high-level leadership roles. So despite some openings, patriarchal control over official religious power structures remained largely intact.

Socially and politically, a few women gained more visibility and influence, especially queens and noblewomen. Powerful queens like Elizabeth I of England and Catherine de’ Medici of France helped rule their kingdoms, though still in partnership with male advisers and lawmakers. However, for common women, opportunities for education, work, property ownership, and political participation remained extremely limited. Legal rights for women also changed little, as they were still considered the inferior wards of either their fathers or husbands under the law. 

Economically, women’s work roles evolved in some trades but remained restricted in most areas. Some women gained new employment in retail and manufacturing jobs in cities, while female healers and midwives also maintained a level of power and expertise. However, professional guilds excluded women from membership, and most highly skilled, high-status jobs remained closed to them. Women of all social ranks also faced substantial legal and financial discrimination, relying on male relatives for economic support and security.

In conclusion, while the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries saw some limited challenges to patriarchal control, especially in religious roles, most spheres of society remained dominated by men. Power structures, social attitudes, and institutional barriers still prevented women from gaining equal rights and opportunities. So despite some openings and contestation, the overarching patriarchal system proved largely secure, adaptable, and resistant to more radical or widespread change during this period. Overall, women’s agency and authority expanded in a few select areas but continued to operate within severe constraints placed upon them by a society that still viewed them as subordinate to male power.
