The 'Critical Issues in Management' module was highly valuable in providing an overview of some of the most significant challenges managers face today. Through the lectures and seminars, I gained insights into key issues such as digital disruption, corporate social responsibility, sustainability, globalization, and diversity.

One of the most impactful lectures focused on digital disruption and how emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, automation, and robotics stand to greatly impact many industries and jobs. I found it illuminating to learn about specific examples of companies that have been disrupted by new digital competitors and ways that executives can help their organizations better adapt to rapid technological changes. For instance, the concept of 'digital Darwinism' - adapting business models and processes to keep pace with technology - provides a useful framework for how managers can make their companies 'future-ready' and less vulnerable to obsolescence.

The seminar on corporate social responsibility highlighted for me how important it is for companies today to consider their impact on society and the environment. By examining cases of corporate irresponsibility that led to crises, I came to appreciate why companies must hold themselves accountable to stakeholders and practice sustainability and social initiatives. At the same time, I learned how implementing effective CSR programs can benefit companies through boosting brand value, employee satisfaction, and long-term profits. Overall, this seminar demonstrated why corporate responsibility should be an integral part of any company's strategy and decision making.

Other valuable aspects of the course included discussions on managing diversity in the workplace and the opportunities and challenges of global expansion. While diversity and globalization are not new topics, the course materials provided a fresh perspective on key issues managers must consider, such as unconscious bias in hiring and promotion, conflicts that can arise in cross-cultural teams, and risks of 'pseudo-globalization' without true localization.

In summary, the 'Critical Issues in Management' module covered a range of vital contemporary issues that managers must understand to lead their companies effectively. I found the course highly engaging and practical, with many insights I will be able to apply in my own career. The lectures and seminars have equipped me with a broader and deeper understanding of the responsibilities of modern management.
