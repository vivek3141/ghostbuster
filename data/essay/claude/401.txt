There are several theories that help explain why humans are attracted to others in the context of romantic relationships. Two of the major theories are evolutionary and social psychological theories. Evolutionary theories suggest that attraction is driven by the biological drives to reproduce and maximize reproductive success, while social psychological theories propose that attraction is influenced more by social and psychological factors. These theories interact and influence each other in complex ways.

Evolutionary theories emphasize the role of biological drives and reproductive fitness in attraction and mate selection. Key theories include sexual selection theory, which suggests that humans are attracted to certain traits that signal reproductive fitness and capacity, and parental investment theory, which argues that humans look for mates who will invest resources in potential offspring. For example, studies show that women tend to prefer mates who show signs of being able to provide resources and protection (e.g. ambition, height) while men are more attracted to youth and physical appearance in women which are signs of high fertility. These preferences are thought to have evolved as adaptations to maximize reproductive success. Evolutionary theories thus propose that much of human attraction is innate and linked to basic biological motivations. 

Social psychological theories, on the other hand, suggest that attraction is more strongly influenced by social and psychological factors such as similarity, proximity, familiarity, and reinforcement. For example, the similarity-attraction effect shows that humans tend to be attracted to those who share similar attitudes and interests. The mere-exposure effect demonstrates that repeated exposure to a stimulus (e.g. a person) increases attraction. Operant conditioning and reinforcement also play a role, as when we are attracted to those who provide us with rewards and positive reinforcement. Unlike evolutionary theories, social psychological theories point to attraction developing through experience and social interaction.   

The evolutionary and social psychological perspectives interact in various ways. At times they are complementary, for instance when certain traits that are initially preferred for evolutionary reasons (e.g. physical attractiveness) are reinforced through social interaction, strengthening attraction. In other cases they appear contradictory, such as when attraction develops towards a partner despite a lack of initial biological preferences. This can be explained through the significant influence of factors like similarity and familiarity on attraction according to social psychological theories.
