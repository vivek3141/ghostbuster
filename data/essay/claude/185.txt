There were several factors that likely contributed to the rise in reported cases of depression in the UK between 1994 and 1998. First, there were improvements in screening and diagnosis of depression during this period. Previously, many cases of depression went undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. With greater awareness of depression as a medical condition and the development of screening tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), more individuals were being properly diagnosed with depression. 

Second, there were changes in societal attitudes that made people more willing to seek help for depression. In the 1990s, there was decreasing stigma around mental health issues like depression. People felt more comfortable acknowledging depression as a real medical issue and were more willing to talk to their doctors about symptoms of depression. With reduced stigma, the higher diagnosis rates at least partially reflected people's greater willingness to report symptoms, not just an absolute rise in depression prevalence.

Third, economic factors likely played a role. Between 1994 and 1998, the UK economy went through a recession, and unemployment rose. Financial stress and job insecurity are linked to higher risks of depression. The economic downturn may have contributed to rising rates of depression during this time period. 

Finally, aspects of life in a capitalist democracy like the UK could contribute to depression. There is an emphasis on individualism, competition, and consumerism that prioritizes acquiring material goods and achieving certain lifestyle standards. For those unable to achieve these cultural ideals, it may lead to feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, and depression. Social media today amplifies these effects but even in the 1990s, television and print media promoted materialistic values.   

To reduce depression rates in capitalist democracies, some argue for cultural and policy changes. For example, promoting more progressive taxation, universal basic income, and community support programs could help address financial worries that feed into depression. Emphasizing intrinsic life goals focused on relationships and experiences over material gains and status symbols may also help. Greater access to mental healthcare, social support programs, green spaces, and work-life balance policies can provide a buffer against factors that negatively impact mental health in capitalist democracies.

In summary, increased awareness and diagnosis of depression, societal destigmatization of mental illness, economic recession, and aspects inherent to capitalist culture likely all contributed to rising depression rates in the UK in the mid-1990s. both medical and socio-cultural interventions may help build a society that supports rather than threatens mental health and well-being.  With a multi-pronged approach, capitalist democracies can work to establish a social system conducive to flourishing populations.
