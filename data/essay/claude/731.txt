The Victorian era in Britain, spanning roughly the second half of the 19th century, was marked by rapid industrialization, scientific progress, and social change that led to a "crisis of faith" for many. The traditional religious and moral values that had dominated earlier in the century were called into question, creating doubts and anxieties that were reflected in the literature of the time. Two major authors whose works were shaped by this Victorian crisis of faith were George Eliot and Thomas Hardy. 

George Eliot, the pen name of Mary Ann Evans, addressed religious doubt and moral uncertainty in her novels, including Middlemarch and Silas Marner. In Middlemarch, Eliot tackles religious hypocrisy and the challenges of living a moral life in the absence of religious faith. The character of Dorothea Brooke seeks purpose and meaning, but is disillusioned with religious institutions and struggles with doubts about Christian doctrine. Eliot suggests that one can lead a moral life based on compassion for others, rather than strict religious principles. Similarly, in Silas Marner, Eliot portrays religion in a negative light as Silas loses his faith in God after being falsely accused of theft by religious authorities. However, Silas regains a sense of purpose through his love for his adopted daughter. Eliot indicates that human relationships and community connections can provide meaning, even without religious faith.

Thomas Hardy addressed similar themes in his novels, including Tess of the d'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure. In Tess of the d'Urbervilles, Hardy criticizes the sexual double standards imposed by Victorian morality and portrays Tess's life as cruelly subjected to the indifferent forces of nature, rather than guided by divine providence. The tragic conclusion suggests a bleak, godless world lacking justice or moral order. In Jude the Obscure, Hardy depicts Jude's hopes for education and enlightenment as crushed by a harsh, unforgiving society. The novel implies that culture and religion mainly serve to perpetuate oppression and human misery, rather than uplift or enlighten humanity.   

In conclusion, both George Eliot and Thomas Hardy reflected the crisis of faith in Victorian England in their works. They portrayed religious belief as hollow or morally questionable, suggested doubt in the existence of a just and caring God, and implied that neither the Church nor religious principles adequately guided moral behavior or provided meaning. However, their novels also indicated that hope, purpose and morality could emerge through human compassion, love, and connection. While the Victorian crisis of faith undermined traditional religious values, Eliot and Hardy showed how morality and meaning could be reconstructed on a secular humanist foundation.
