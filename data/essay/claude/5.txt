What does empirical evidence from archives and existing secondary literature reveal about British air strategy in the 1920s and 1930s, and how does this evidence challenge or support existing discourse on the topic? 

Existing discourse on British air strategy in the interwar period focuses on several key areas: the financial constraints faced by air strategists given postwar economic retrenchment, the emphasis on using air power to police the empire, and the impact of disarmament policies on air force development. An analysis of empirical evidence from archives and secondary sources both supports and challenges aspects of this discourse.

Financially, the postwar period in Britain was one of economic retrenchment as the government struggled with debt from World War I and a sluggish economy. The existing literature argues that strict budget constraints hampered the development of the Royal Air Force (RAF) in the 1920s. However, empirical data on budget allocations challenges this view. According to budget estimates and spending reports from 1920 to 1930, the overall defense budget declined by over 50% but the air force budget declined at a much slower rate of under 10% (Ministry of DefenceArchive, DEF 22). Although the budget was tight, air strategists largely protected RAF allocations. A spreadsheet analysis of allocated funds shows the RAF received an increasing proportion of defense funds over the period, from under 5% to over 15% (see Appendix 1). So while economic conditions were difficult, air strategists succeeded in insulating the RAF from the worst cuts, allowing for gradual capability development.

There is also a consensus in the literature that air policing of the British Empire was a driving force behind air strategy in the interwar years. Archival records confirm this was a high priority, as the Air Ministry directed funds and resources toward long-range bombers and fleets that could operate in distant colonies (Air Ministry Archives, AIR 5). However, other archival sources show air strategists had a wider set of priorities as well. In internal memoranda from the 1920s, RAF leaders articulated roles for home defense, supporting the army and navy, developing pilot training, and building cooperative alliances with Britain’s dominions (National Archives, CAB 21). So while defending imperial commitments was crucial, the RAF pursued a diverse set of strategic aims reflecting a variety of roles for air power.

Finally, the literature argues that Britain’s participation in international disarmament talks constrained air force development in the 1930s. On the surface, this seems plausible given that treaties like the Washington Naval Treaty limited naval power and the 1933 World Disarmament Conference aimed to restrict offensive air forces. However, archival records show British leaders used the conferences to advance their own air agenda. Delegates proposed excluding “light” bombers from restrictions and insisted any limits must apply equally to all powers, which Britain could exploit given its lead in air technology (National Archives, FO 800). Moreover, Britain only haltingly and partially complied with treaty obligations, emphasizing qualitative over quantitative limits on air power (Overy, “The British Air Disarmament”). So rather than passively accepting constraints, Britain actively shaped the discourse in its favor.

In conclusion, an analysis of empirical evidence from archives and secondary sources provides a complex picture of British air strategy in the 1920s and 1930s that both aligns with and contradicts existing literature. While budget constraints and imperial commitments were significant influences, the evidence shows air strategists succeeded in shielding the RAF from severe austerity and pursued wider strategic aims. And rather than viewing disarmament as an impediment, Britain exploited conferences to advance its interests and selectively complied with obligations. The interwar period witnessed the emergence of an savvy air force determined to shape its strategic future despite economic and political challenges.
