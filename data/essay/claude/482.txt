The American Civil War had a decisive outcome that led to the defeat of the Confederacy and the preservation of the Union. There were several key factors that led to the Union victory and the zeal with which northerners fought for the cause.  

First, the North had significant advantages in population, industrial capacity, and infrastructure over the South. The North had a population of roughly 22 million compared to 9 million in the South, including 4 million enslaved African Americans. This population advantage meant the North could raise, supply, and field much larger armies. The North also had far more extensive railroad and telegraph networks that enabled quick movement and communication of armies. Its factories and farms were able to produce ample supplies to feed and equip Union armies. In contrast, the South was primarily agricultural and lacked these advantages in transportation and industry. These asymmetric capacities and resources were a major factor leading to Northern victory.

Second, the North had a stronger central government and political will to see the war through to its end. President Abraham Lincoln and his administration provided steady leadership throughout the long conflict, raising and supplying new armies each year. The Confederate government was weaker and struggled with political divisions that undermined the Southern war effort. The North also passed conscription acts to institute the draft, enabling massive armies. The Confederacy only instituted conscription late in the war, hampering its ability to match Northern numbers. The stronger leadership and administration in the North were key to the eventual Union victory.

Third, Union military strategy evolved during the course of the war and eventually found generals that understood how to wage war against the South effectively. Early Union commanders like George McClellan were overly cautious and unwilling to aggressively pursue Confederate armies. However, later commanders like Ulysses Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Philip Sheridan understood that the North needed to grind down the South through total war that targeted civilians and supply infrastructure as much as opposing armies. The evolution of military strategy in the North, especially the successes of Grant, Sherman, and Sheridan, was instrumental to defeating the Confederacy.  

Finally, northerners fought with zeal for the cause of preserving the Union because they believed deeply in the founding principles of the nation as expressed in the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. Most northerners saw secession as illegal and the Confederacy as rebellion against the lawful government. Slavery was increasingly seen as a moral evil that undermined the nation's founding ideals of liberty and equality. Preserving the Union was seen as necessary to vindicate and uphold these principles. The conviction that the North was fighting for the survival of the United States and the noblest of principles inspired northerners to make immense sacrifices for the Union cause.

In conclusion, the outcome of the Civil War was shaped by several major factors, including the Northâ€™s significant advantages in population, industry, and infrastructure; stronger central government and political will; evolution of military strategy; and zealous belief in the righteousness of the Union cause. These factors combined to enable the defeat of the Confederacy, preserve the Union, and vindicate the founding principles of the United States.
