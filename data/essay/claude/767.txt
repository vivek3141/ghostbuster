Descartes and Hume take very different approaches to philosophical scepticism and knowledge. Descartes employs systematic doubt to rebuild knowledge on an indubitable foundation, while Hume is more concerned with the human propensity to form false beliefs and argues that philosophical scepticism cannot be escaped. 

For Descartes, achieving knowledge requires a process of methodological doubt to strip away all beliefs that could possibly be false. He seeks to find foundational beliefs that are 'indubitable' - impossible to doubt. His method involves casting doubt on the senses, memory, and reason, culminating in the discovery of his own existence as an indubitable truth in the cogito argument. From there, Descartes attempts to prove God's existence and reconstruct knowledge of the external world. Descartes' method relies heavily on his assumption that there are in fact foundational indubitable beliefs that can ground knowledge.

In contrast, Hume is more concerned with how humans form beliefs and argues that philosophical scepticism - the possibility that all our beliefs are false or unjustified - cannot be overcome through reason alone. Hume distinguishes between 'impressions' - lively perceptions that compel belief - and 'ideas' - faint perceptions of impressions. He argues that ideas of external objects, the self, causation and morality all arise from human psychology, not reason. Hume argues we cannot know with certainty that causes and effects in the external world must be connected, or that the self remains consistent over time. 

A key difference is that while Descartes sought to overcome scepticism through methodological doubt and indubitable foundations, Hume argues we cannot escape the human tendency to form beliefs that outstrip our evidence and justification. Descartes assumes reason can provide a indubitable foundation for knowledge, whereas Hume believes human psychology constructs beliefs that cannot be grounded by reason alone.

In conclusion, Descartes and Hume provide very different analyses of knowledge, doubt and the human propensity to form beliefs. Descartes sees methodological doubt and indubitable foundations as the path to knowledge, while Hume argues that human psychology constructs beliefs in a way that cannot escape philosophical scepticism through reason alone. Their approaches rely on key assumptions about reason, human nature and the possibility of grounding knowledge on indubitable foundations that remain debated today. Overall, while Descartes aims to purge false beliefs, Hume accepts their inevitability.
