The current system of regulation of the legal profession in England and Wales operates primarily based on the principle of self-regulation. The Law Society and Bar Council, which are the representative bodies of solicitors and barristers respectively, are tasked with regulating their legal profession members. However, this system of self-regulation has been subject to significant criticisms in recent decades due to various limitations and conflicts of interest. There are arguments for implementing reforms to address these limitations by moving toward a co-regulatory or independent regulatory model.  

Self-regulation refers to a regulatory system where the regulated individuals themselves are primarily responsible for their regulation, monitoring and disciplining. Self-regulation of the English legal profession dates back to the 19th century. The rationale behind self-regulation is that legal practitioners themselves are the best placed to set standards, determine best practices, and regulate the conduct of members based on their professional expertise. However, concerns about self-regulation focus on the conflict between professional and public interests inherent in the model. Regulatory models based on self-interest and informational advantage can lead to a lack of external supervision and inadequate pursuit of public interest objectives like access to quality and affordable legal services.

Criticisms of the current self-regulatory system are that it is susceptible to "regulatory capture" where the regulator serves the commercial interests of the legal profession instead of the public. The Law Society and Bar Council are primarily funded by membership fees from solicitors and barristers and are dominated by legal practitioners. There are concerns they are not sufficiently independent to make objective judgments and prioritize public interests over their members' commercial interests. Legal practitioners may also be reluctant to sufficiently discipline their peers due to professional loyalty and a "there but for the grace of God go I" mentality. The self-regulatory system has also been criticized as lacking transparency and accountability. Decisions are made largely by legal practitioners behind closed doors without demonstrating how the public interest has been served.

Models of regulation aim to explain regulatory motivations and behaviors. The capture model argues that regulators act in the interests of the industry they are tasked with regulating due to factors like funding sources, shared backgrounds, and career ambitions of regulators. This model suggests self-regulation will inherently favor commercial over public interests. In contrast, the public interest theory argues that regulators aim to act in the wider public interest due to political and social pressures. However, self-regulatory bodies may lack sufficient incentives and independence to fulfill this aim. Integrated theories like responsive regulation argue that regulators balance public and industry interests, but their motivations and behaviors depend significantly on their institutional structures and incentives. Self-regulatory bodies are more prone to prioritize industry over public interests due to their institutional biases.

There are proposals to reform the regulation of the English legal profession to address limitations of self-regulation while still permitting a role for practitioner expertise. A co-regulatory model would establish an independent oversight regulator to monitor and supervise the Law Society and Bar Council. It could address transparency and accountability concerns while still allowing practitioner input. Independent regulation involves an entirely independent regulator like the Legal Services Board. It may be better able to objectively regulate in the public interest but risks marginalizing practitioner expertise.

In conclusion, while self-regulation has a long history in the English legal profession and the rationale of practitioner expertise, it has significant limitations like conflicts of interest, lack of transparency and independence. There are arguments for implementing a co-regulatory or independent model of regulation to balance public and professional interests and address the criticisms of the current self-regulatory system. Overall, reform is needed to ensure the regulation of legal services prioritizes access to affordable and quality justice.
