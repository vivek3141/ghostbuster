The US "war on terror" launched after the September 11 terrorist attacks has largely prevented the US from establishing strategic hegemony in East Asia. The war on terror, especially the long engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq, have sapped the US of diplomatic and military resources that could have otherwise been deployed to counter the influence of China in the region and reaffirm US alliances. 

After the Cold War, the US emerged as the world's sole superpower and sought to consolidate its leadership in key regions around the globe, including East Asia. In the 1990s, the US focused on strengthening alliances with Japan and South Korea, expanding trade partnerships, and promoting democratic values. The US intervention in Kosovo in 1999 also demonstrated American willingness to exert military force to defend human rights and democratic principles. With a strong economy and military, active diplomacy, and a prevailing message of democratic liberalism, the US was poised to dominate the post-Cold War order in East Asia.

However, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks abruptly curtailed the US's ambitions for strategic preeminence in East Asia. The Bush administration launched the "war on terror" with the invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003, diverting critical resources and attention away from East Asia. The wars lasted for years at immense cost, resulting in over 6,800 US military fatalities and $2 trillion in expenses. The US became bogged down in long counterinsurgency campaigns, nation-building efforts, and power vacuums that still destabilize Afghanistan and Iraq today.

In contrast, China took advantage of this window to expand its influence in East Asia relatively unencumbered. China deepened economic, diplomatic, and military ties with countries across the region through initiatives like the Belt and Road infrastructure program. It also asserted territorial claims in the South China Sea, built up its naval forces, and used economic leverage to pressure its neighbors. By the time the US began to pivot back to East Asia under the Obama administration, China had gained substantial ground and credibility as a regional leader.

The war on terror also damaged the US's reputation and soft power which had previously given it an edge in East Asia. The wars, torture scandals, and long detentions at Guantanamo Bay contradicted America's democratic values and ideals of human rights. In contrast, China largely avoided overseas interventions and occupied the moral high ground, positioning itself as a champion for sovereignty, non-interference, and globalization without the baggage of militarism.

In conclusion, the US "war on terror" and long engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq grievously handicapped its ambitions to dominate the strategic landscape of East Asia. Tied down in costly counterinsurgency missions, the US allowed China to expand its influence with little resistance. The war on terror also undermined the US's reputation and values, creating a void in leadership and credibility that China readily filled in East Asia. Despite the US pivot to Asia, it has struggled to regain the diplomatic, economic and military ground it lost to China due to the war on terror.
