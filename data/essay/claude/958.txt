One of the classic arguments for the existence of God is the design argument, also known as the teleological argument. This argument from natural theology proposes that the complexity and order in the world necessitates an intelligent divine designer. In its simplest form, the argument says that specific structures in the world are analogous to a watch or a machine: they are intricate, have multiple parts that fit together to serve a purpose, and require an intelligent designer.  

However, the design argument has faced many notable objections. In the 19th century, philosopher John Stuart Mill argued that arguments from analogy like the watchmaker analogy are flawed. A watch requires an intelligent designer because we know watches are designed by humans, but we do not have the same knowledge about the universe and natural world. Philosopher Immanuel Kant also objected that the design argument assumes that order and purpose can only arise from intelligence, rather than natural processes. Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection further challenged the design argument by providing an alternative, natural explanation for the development of complex life. 

Proponents of natural theology have attempted to address these objections and reconcile belief in God with evolution in several ways. Some argue that God created the universe and the laws of nature, including the mechanism of natural selection, to bring about the development of life and complexity. This view is consistent with a God who is an "intelligent designer" who set up the system that would unfold according to his plan. Others argue that God guided the evolutionary process, actively steering it to produce life in all its complexity and diversity. A third view is that God created the potentiality for life to emerge and evolve in the universe, with evolution being the natural outworking and unfolding of this potentiality.

In conclusion, while the traditional design argument faces significant challenges from philosophers like Mill and Kant as well as from Darwin's theory of evolution, natural theologians have proposed several ways to reconcile belief in God as a designer with the concept of natural selection and evolution. The debate between proponents and critics of the design argument remains a vibrant area of discussion in philosophy of religion today.
