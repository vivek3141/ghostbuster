The field of real analysis has seen ongoing efforts to develop a rigorous foundation for calculus and analysis, though some key concepts remain open to interpretation. Cauchy provided one of the first rigorous definitions of continuity, defining a function as continuous if "an infinitely small increase in the independent variable always produces an infinitely small increase in the function itself." However, this definition appears inconsistent with Cauchy's theorem that a continuous function on a closed interval attains a maximum and minimum value. His theorem seems to assume continuity can be determined by evaluating the function at discrete points, rather than considering infinitely small changes.  

Progress toward rigor has been made by providing precise definitions for concepts like continuity, differentiability, and integrability. Cauchy defined the derivative of a function at a point x as the limit of the difference quotient as Î´x approaches 0, differing from Lagrange's informal definition. Applying calculus to unusual functions like Weierstrass's nowhere-differentiable continuous function has revealed challenges. While the intermediate value theorem guarantees such a function will take on all values between extremes, its lack of a derivative at any point shows the derivative is not required for continuity.

Functions with fractal-like properties or that are non-measurable in some way continue to pose challenges. They reveal ambiguities in concepts like area, volume, and dimension central to real analysis. For example, non-measurable sets defy attempts to rigorously define notions of 'size' or 'measure.' The Banach-Tarski paradox, illustrating how a solid ball can be divided into a finite number of non-measurable pieces that can be rearranged to form two balls of the same size, highlights such ambiguities.   

In summary, while progress toward rigor has been made by formally defining concepts like continuity, differentiability, and integrability, certain fundamental ideas remain problematic. The precise nature of continuity and other concepts taken for granted in calculus continue to be debated. Unusual functions with fractal-like properties that defy intuition reveal ambiguities in foundational ideas like space, dimension, and measure that real analysis has not yet fully resolved.  Cauchy's own definition of continuity appears inconsistent with his theorem on continuous functions attaining maximum and minimum values, showing even the work of foundational thinkers remains open to interpretation. Overall, real analysis will continue to be an active area of research.
