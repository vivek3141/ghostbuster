Emotion and Memory: Theories and Phenomena 

Emotion and memory are intricately connected. Our emotional state at the time of an event can have a profound impact on how that event is encoded and later retrieved. Several theories and phenomena help explain the relationship between emotion and memory.

The flashbulb memory theory proposes that highly emotional or traumatic events can lead to vivid and long-lasting memories. The memory of learning about impactful events like 9/11 or the Challenger disaster are examples of flashbulb memories. These memories tend to be very detailed but not always completely accurate. While flashbulb memories demonstrate how emotion strengthens memory encoding, the memories can fade or become distorted over time. 

The theory of repression proposes that traumatic or highly emotional memories can be unconsciously blocked from access. The memory still exists but is pushed into the unconscious mind as a defense mechanism. Repressed memories can sometimes be retrieved later through hypnosis or therapy. However, the existence of repressed memories is controversial and there is little evidence they can be reliably retrieved. 

The mood-congruent memory theory suggests that the emotional state at the time of encoding and retrieval impacts what is remembered. When in a particular mood, memories of events that match that mood are more easily accessed. For example, being in a sad mood may cue memories of other sad times. Mood-congruent memory demonstrates how emotion impacts both memory encoding and retrieval.

Mood-state-dependent learning similarly proposes that information learned during a particular emotional state is more easily recalled when in a matching emotional state. For example, information studied when feeling anxious may be better remembered during subsequent feelings of anxiety. The context of the learning environment is tied to one's emotional state at the time of learning.

In summary, emotion and memory are closely linked in the brain and several theories demonstrate this connection. Flashbulb memories show how emotional events can lead to vivid and lasting memories. The theory of repressed memories suggests traumatic memories can be unconsciously blocked. Mood-congruent memory indicates emotional state impacts memory encoding and retrieval, cuing memories that match one's current mood. And mood-state-dependent learning shows how information learned in an emotional state is best recalled in a matching state. While debated, these theories provide insight into the complex relationship between emotion and memory.
