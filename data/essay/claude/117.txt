There are several notable variables that could affect a student's performance on their first year statistics exam, including hours studied, students' age, English as a second language status, and hours worked per week. Hours studied has the most straightforward relationship with exam scoresâ€”generally, the more a student studies, the higher their exam score will be. Age and status as an English language learner can negatively impact exam scores due to additional challenges in learning and language barriers respectively. Hours worked per week also has a negative relationship with exam scores as it reduces the amount of available study time for students. 

The sample data provides evidence that using regression analysis to analyze the impact of these variables on exam scores would be appropriate. Regression analysis is a statistical method for determining the relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable. In this case, the dependent variable is the exam score and the independent variables are hours studied, age, English as a second language status, and hours worked per week. Regression analysis produces an equation to predict the dependent variable based on the independent variables. It also provides insight into which independent variables have a statistically significant impact, as well as the magnitude and direction of any relationships.

For predicting first year statistics exam scores, a good regression model will have a high R-squared value, indicating it explains a large portion of the variance in exam scores. It will also have independent variables that are statistically significant, meaning there is only a small chance the observed relationship occurred due to random chance. Among regression models, the one with the highest R-squared value and variables that are statistically significant at a 95% confidence level would be statistically preferred. Using this criteria, a model including hours studied, English as a second language status, and hours worked per week as independent variables may be statistically preferred based on the given data.

In summary, while there are several variables that could impact exam performance, hours studied has the clearest positive relationship. Age, English language learner status, and hours worked may also negatively relate to exam scores. Regression analysis is suitable for analyzing the relationships between these variables and can provide a model for predicting first year statistics exam marks based on the variables that are statistically significant and produce the highest R-squared value.
