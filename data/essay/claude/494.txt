Descartes proposes an ontological argument for the existence of God in his Fifth Meditation. The core of his argument is that existence is a predicate that belongs to the idea of a supremely perfect being. Descartes claims that our mind has an idea of God as an infinite, perfect being. Since existence is a perfection and God possesses all possible perfections, God must exist. 

The key objection to Descartes' argument is that 'existence' is not actually a predicate in the same way that properties like 'benevolence' or 'omnipotence' are predicates. A predicate serves to characterize something and specify its attributes or qualities. But to say that something exists is not to attribute a quality to it or characterize it in some way. Existence is simply the bare fact of a thing's being. So existence cannot be a predicate in the same sense that other attributes are. When I think of a supremely perfect being, I am conceiving of a collection of qualities and attributes - but existence itself is not an attribute. Existence is not something that can be logically deduced from the attributes I can conceive of. The fact that I can conceive of a perfect being does not entail or necessitate that the being exists. Existence remains a further open question.

Descartes believes that his realization "I exist" gives evidence that existence can indeed function as a predicate. However, this is not persuasive. When Descartes concludes that he exists from his thinking, he is not characterizing or attributing something to himself. He is simply acknowledging the raw fact of his own being or consciousness. That consciousness exists is self-evident to him, but its existence is not an attribute of consciousness in the way 'benevolence' is an attribute of God. So "I exist" does not actually support the view that existence can be a logically attributed predicate.

There are additional arguments that existence cannot be a predicate. For Kant, existence is not a predicate at all but a mere position - it indicates that a subject has instances in the real world. For Frege, existence is a second-level predicate - it applies to concepts or properties, not individuals. Russell argues that existence is not part of the logical properties of a subject at all. Existence depends on there being an object in the domain of discourse that possesses certain properties - but the properties themselves do not entail existence as a predicate.

In conclusion, there are persuasive arguments against Descartes' view that existence can function as a logically attributable predicate. While Descartes seeks to use "I exist" as evidence for existence as a predicate, this is not convincing. Existence appears to be distinct from the properties or attributes we can apply to concepts and individuals. The ontological argument ultimately fails because there is no reason to believe existence necessarily logically follows from our concept of a supremely perfect being. Existence remains an open question that requires empirical evidence to determine - it cannot be logically deduced or defined into being.
