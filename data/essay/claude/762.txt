There are two main competing theories in paleoanthropology regarding the relationship between modern humans (Homo sapiens) and Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis). The first theory, known as the "Out of Africa" or replacement model, argues that Neanderthals were a separate species that went extinct and were replaced by the migration of modern humans out of Africa. The second theory, known as the assimilation or hybridization model, proposes that Neanderthals interbred with modern humans, leading to absorption of Neanderthal populations into the human lineage. 

The Out of Africa theory argues that Neanderthals were a separate species that evolved in Eurasia and went extinct around 40,000 years ago without interbreeding with modern humans. According to this view, anatomically modern humans evolved in Africa around 200,000 years ago. Around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago, modern humans began migrating out of Africa, eventually spreading to Eurasia. When modern humans arrived in Europe and western Asia, they outcompeted Neanderthals for resources and habitat, eventually leading to the extinction of Neanderthals. Proponents of this theory point to distinct anatomical differences between modern humans and Neanderthals as evidence that they were separate species that could not interbreed. They argue that cultural and technological differences between the groups also show that there were limited interactions between Neanderthals and modern humans.

In contrast, the assimilation theory proposes that when modern humans migrated out of Africa and spread into Eurasia, they interbred and hybridized with Neanderthals, absorbing them into the human gene pool. According to this theory, Neanderthals and modern humans were closely related enough to interbreed, and when contact occurred between the groups in Europe and western Asia, interbreeding led to the gradual disappearance of Neanderthals as a distinct population. Proponents argue that anatomical similarities between modern humans and Neanderthals show they were the same species, and point to evidence of interbreeding from studies of the human and Neanderthal genomes. They claim that some Neanderthal genes have endured in the human genome, especially in human populations outside of Africa. They also argue that similarities in sophisticated tools between modern humans and Neanderthals indicate cultural exchanges and interactions between the groups that could have enabled interbreeding.

These conflicting theories have significant implications for understanding human origins and evolution. If the Out of Africa theory is correct, modern humans were isolated from other hominin groups for most of their evolution, developing independently as a new species that outcompeted ancient humans like Neanderthals. In contrast, the assimilation theory suggests modern humans emerged through integration with other closely-related hominins they encountered as they dispersed from Africa to Eurasia. Resolving which theory is more plausible through further research on human and Neanderthal genomes, as well as archaeological evidence, will provide crucial insights into the evolutionary forces that shaped modern humanity.
