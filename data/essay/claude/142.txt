Martin Luther's theological ideas were evolving rapidly in the years leading up to 1520 and the publication of his three major treatises that year, The Babylonian Captivity of the Church, To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, and On the Freedom of a Christian. Several key turning points in Luther's thinking during this time period shaped his break from the Catholic Church and paved the way for the Protestant Reformation.

Luther's views started shifting around 1515 as he lectured on the Psalms and Romans. He began to see salvation as arising from faith alone, not good works. This "tower experience" marked a turning point where Luther realized that repentance and penance were insufficient for salvation, which depended on God's grace. His lectures and sermons started emphasizing faith and Scripture alone as the path to salvation.

Another turning point came in 1517 when Luther published his 95 Theses criticizing the Catholic church's sale of indulgences. While Luther was not yet challenging core Catholic doctrines, his boldness in questioning church practices showed how far his thinking had moved from unquestioning orthodoxy. The 95 Theses represented a pivotal moment that thrust Luther into the public spotlight and set him on an irreversible collision course with the Catholic church.

In 1519, Luther held a debate with Catholic theologian Johann Eck. Eck forced Luther to articulate views that diverged from Catholic doctrine, like rejecting the papacy's authority and the infallibility of church councils. This debate marked Luther’s total break from Rome and his embrace of sola scriptura, scripture alone as the sole authority for Christian belief and practice. 

The three treatises of 1520 were the culmination of Luther’s radical and hardening theological stances. In The Babylonian Captivity, Luther rejected Catholic sacraments and the papacy. In To the Christian Nobility, he argued that all believers had a right to read and interpret the Bible. In On the Freedom of a Christian, he expounded on salvation by faith alone and the priesthood of all believers. These treatises cemented Luther as the leader of a reform movement that would shatter the unity of the Western church.

In conclusion, between 1515 and 1520, Luther experienced a series of turning points in his theology that led him to repudiate Catholic doctrine and authority. His "tower experience" and lectures revealed a new understanding of faith and grace. The 95 Theses and debate with Eck marked his total break from the Catholic church. Finally, his 1520 treatises established him as the champion of new Protestant doctrines like sola fide and sola scriptura that stripped power from the Catholic hierarchy and put faith firmly in the hands of each individual Christian and their own interpretation of the Bible. Luther's radical and prolific writings during these pivotal years precipitated the Protestant Reformation and reshaped Christian belief for centuries.
