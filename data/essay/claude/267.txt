PCD Maltron, a UK-based company that produces ergonomic keyboards, faces several challenges in improving their market position. The main issues PCD Maltron faces are:

1) Limited awareness of the benefits of ergonomic keyboards. Many potential end-users and businesses are still unaware of the health and productivity benefits of using ergonomic input devices like specialized keyboards. This limits the overall size of the market and demand for PCD Maltron’s products. To address this, PCD Maltron needs to invest in marketing and education to raise awareness around ergonomics and the benefits that their keyboards can provide. They should focus on targeting ergonomists and health professionals in occupational therapy, as well as organizations focusing on workplace health and productivity. They also need to modify their existing marketing materials to better emphasize how their products can improve employee wellbeing, comfort, and work efficiency. 

2) High barriers to switching for businesses. Businesses often face significant switching costs when changing equipment like keyboards, including costs to retrain employees, IT support expenses, and lost productivity during the transition. To overcome this barrier, PCD Maltron needs to clearly demonstrate the long-term financial and efficiency benefits of switching to their ergonomic keyboards. They should provide resources to help businesses transition smoothly to new equipment with minimal disruption. PCD Maltron could also offer initial discounts and trials to encourage businesses to make the switch.

3) Different needs of businesses and end-users. End-users tend to focus on comfort, ease of use, and health benefits when purchasing an ergonomic keyboard. Businesses, on the other hand, focus more on productivity, cost savings, and return on investment. To meet these differentiated needs, PCD Maltron should tailor their products, marketing, sales approach, and pricing for each audience. For end-users, emphasis should remain on the personal benefits, while the business case should focus on quantifying productivity gains and cost effectiveness.   

The global computer peripherals market, including keyboards, is growing at over 5% annually. However, the ergonomic keyboard segment is growing at a faster rate of about 9% per year as awareness of ergonomic products increases. The main barriers to entry for new competitors are: 1) Lack of expertise and experience in ergonomic design; 2) The cost of research and development to produce specialist ergonomic products; 3) Difficulty gaining acceptance from businesses and end-users who prefer well-known, established brands.

Overall, PCD Maltron faces a number of significant challenges, but also has substantial opportunities for growth given the increasing demand for ergonomic computer peripherals. With a clear marketing and sales strategy focused on the key issues outlined above, PCD Maltron can solidify their leadership position in the ergonomic keyboard market and expand into new segments and regions. By raising mainstream awareness of their products and overcoming businesses’ switching costs, PCD Maltron can achieve sustainable growth and success.
