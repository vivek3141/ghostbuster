The most appropriate qualitative research design for a study on factors influencing compliance with hand treatment for rheumatoid arthritis would be a phenomenological study. Phenomenological research seeks to understand the lived experiences of individuals and how they perceive and make meaning of a particular phenomenon. In this case, the phenomenon of interest would be the experience of undergoing hand treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and what influences a patient's compliance with the prescribed treatment plan.

Two possible research questions that could be addressed in this phenomenological study are:

1. What are the experiences of rheumatoid arthritis patients in adhering to hand treatment as prescribed by their physicians and therapists? Through in-depth interviews with patients, this question can explore what they perceive influences their ability, willingness, or barriers to comply with recommended hand exercises, medications, orthotics, or other interventions. Gaining an understanding of the lived experiences of patients in this regard can help identify problems as well as what is working to inform improved treatment plans and education. 

2. How do rheumatoid arthritis patients describe the meaning and significance of their hands and how does the meaning and significance of their hands influence their motivations and willingness to comply with recommended hand treatments? Our hands are essential to most activities of daily living and independence, so understanding a patient's perspectives on their hands can reveal determinants of compliance behaviors. Patients may be motivated by a desire to maintain independence and functioning, or they may feel that compliance will not make a difference due to the level of impairment and pain they already experience. Exploring the meaning patients ascribe to their hands and how this influences their treatment compliance can uncover important psychosocial factors.

In summary, a phenomenological study using in-depth interviews and thematic analysis would be an ideal qualitative approach to gain insights into patients' experiences with hand treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and what shapes their compliance behaviors. The proposed research questions explore both the practical experiences of adhering to treatment plans as well as the personal significance of hand function and how this motivates patients' willingness to comply with recommended interventions. Findings from such a study could inform more patient-centered and effective hand treatment programs.
