Hyperlipidemia refers to abnormally high levels of lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, in the blood. Elevated lipid levels are a risk factor for coronary heart disease, including heart attacks and coronary artery disease. There are several classes of pharmaceutical treatments available for hyperlipidemia to help lower lipid levels and reduce coronary heart disease risk.

Statins are the most commonly prescribed class of drugs for lowering cholesterol. Statins work by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a key role in cholesterol production. By blocking this enzyme, statins reduce the amount of cholesterol made by the liver. Statins have been shown in numerous large clinical trials to effectively lower LDL or "bad" cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Some of the most widely used statins include atorvastatin (Lipitor), simvastatin (Zocor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and pravastatin (Pravachol). Lowering LDL cholesterol by just 1% can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by 1 to 2%. Studies show statins can lower LDL cholesterol by up to 60% when used at high doses.

Fibrates are another class of drugs used for lowering triglyceride levels and raising HDL or "good" cholesterol. Fibrates work by activating PPAR-alpha receptors which regulate fatty acid and lipoprotein metabolism. Commonly used fibrates include fenofibrate (TriCor, Lofibra) and gemfibrozil (Lopid). Fibrates can reduce triglyceride levels by up to 50% and raise HDL by 10 to 15%. Clinical trials show fibrates also modestly lower coronary heart disease risk, especially for those with high triglycerides and low HDL. However, fibrates are not as effective at reducing heart disease risk as statins.

Bile acid sequestrants are cholesterol-lowering drugs that work by binding to bile acids in the intestines to prevent their reabsorption into the bloodstream. This causes the liver to use more cholesterol to make bile acids, which in turn lowers cholesterol levels in the blood. The most common bile acid sequestrants are cholestyramine (Questran), colestipol (Colestid), and colesevelam (WelChol). These drugs can lower LDL cholesterol by 15 to 30% but often cause gastrointestinal side effects like constipation, bloating, and nausea. They are usually only used when statins or other drugs are not tolerated or are not effective enough.

Ezetimibe (Zetia) is a cholesterol absorption inhibitor that blocks the uptake of dietary and biliary cholesterol from the intestines into the bloodstream. It is often used in combination with statins to enhance their cholesterol-lowering effect. Clinical trials show ezetimibe can lower LDL cholesterol by 15 to 20% and provide an additional 15 to 20% reduction when combined with a statin. However, ezetimibe alone does not appear to directly reduce heart disease risk and is best used as an adjunct to statin therapy.  

In summary, there are several classes of drugs available for lowering cholesterol, triglycerides, and coronary heart disease risk. Statins are the most commonly used and effective drugs for reducing LDL cholesterol and heart disease risk. Fibrates and bile acid sequestrants can also help lower lipids but may not reduce risk to the same degree as statins. Newer agents like ezetimibe are best used in combination with statins to maximize their benefit. Pharmaceutical therapy, combined with lifestyle changes, can be very effective for managing hyperlipidemia and preventing coronary heart disease.
