The Hfr mapping experiment was a classic bacterial genetic experiment conducted in the 1950s by French scientists Francois Jacob, Elizabeth Lwoff, and Jacques Monod. The purpose of the experiment was to determine the order of genes on the Escherichia coli chromosome and produce a genetic map. This was achieved through conjugation between an Hfr (high frequency of recombination) strain of E. coli and an F- (needs to be capitalized) strain lacking certain markers.

The Hfr strain contained an F factor that had integrated into the E. coli chromosome.  When the Hfr cell mate  (needs to be conjugated)d with the F- cell, the integrated F factor allowed efficient transfer of chromosomal DNA from the Hfr to the F- cell. The researchers interrupted the mating at timed intervals and then selected for markers that had been transferred, thereby identifying the relative positions of genes on the chromosome based on the order in which the markers appeared.

In the experiment, the Hfr strain was a leucine auxotroph with markers for proline (pro) and histidine (his) requirements and resistance to bacteriophages T1 (T1r) and T6 (T6r). The F- strain was a prototroph lacking those markers. The researchers mingled (needs to be conjugated) the Hfr and F- strains on an agar plate and incubated them. Every few minutes, they disrupted the mating by vortexing and plating the mixture on media selecting for transfer of specific markers. For example, to select for inheritance of pro, they plated on a medium lacking leucine and proline. Colonies that grew had inherited pro. The earliest appearing colonies contained markers closest to the origin of transfer in the Hfr strain.

They found that pro was transferred earliest, followed by T6r, then his, and lastly T1r. This mapped the gene order as pro-T6r-his-T1r with pro nearest the origin of transfer. As the mating time increased, the percentage of recipients acquiring each marker also increased until reaching 100%, indicating all markers had transferred. The results were in agreement with the known positions of these genes on the E. coli genetic map, thus validating the technique.
