Implementing practices that empower employees has significant benefits for businesses in the hospitality and tourism industries.  However, there are also some risks and downsides to consider with employee empowerment. Overall, despite these risks, hospitality and tourism businesses should aim to empower their employees to a considerable extent in order to maximize satisfaction and productivity.

The main advantages of empowering employees in hospitality and tourism businesses are increased customer satisfaction, improved retention and loyalty, increased productivity and creativity, and higher job satisfaction. First, empowered employees who have the ability to resolve issues promptly and make decisions to benefit the customer are able to provide much higher levels of customer service. This leads to higher customer satisfaction, which is crucial for success in these industries. Second, empowered and satisfied employees are also much more likely to remain loyal to their company and in their roles. This reduces turnover costs and builds company success based on employee tenure and experience. 

Third, empowered employees tend to be more productive and engaged, often coming up with innovative solutions and new ideas to improve the business. They have a sense of ownership and care deeply about the success and growth of the company. Finally, empowered employees simply enjoy their jobs more. They feel trusted and valued, leading to higher motivation and job satisfaction. This creates a positive cycle where satisfied employees lead to satisfied customers.

However, there are some risks to consider with employee empowerment. There is a possibility of poor decision making if employees are not properly trained or do not have access to necessary information. Mistakes made by empowered employees can be costly. There is also a risk of employees abusing their power or trust, for example by providing unauthorized discounts or upgrades to customers.  Empowerment may lead to lack of consistency in service or brand standards as different employees make different judgments. 

There can also be additional costs associated with effectively empowering employees, such as investments in more comprehensive training. These costs may strain resources for some businesses. However, on balance, the significant advantages of employee empowerment, especially in driving better customer experiences, outweigh these potential disadvantages. The key is to empower employees in a structured way, with proper training, guidelines, and monitoring.

In conclusion, hospitality and tourism businesses should aim for a high level of employee empowerment to gain the important benefits to satisfaction, loyalty, productivity and the customer experience. With the right approach, these benefits can be achieved while mitigating risks. Empowered and engaged employees are essential for success in these competitive, customer-centric industries.
