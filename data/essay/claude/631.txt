Human rights law has had mixed success in advancing women's rights and eliminating harmful practices such as female genital mutilation (FGM). On the one hand, human rights laws and conventions have helped raise awareness of FGM and pressured governments to enact laws banning the practice. However, cultural beliefs and social norms have made it difficult to fully enforce these laws and end FGM.  

Several international human rights instruments prohibit FGM, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. These conventions obligate states to protect women and girls from harmful practices and violence. In recent decades, many countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East have passed laws banning FGM in line with these international conventions. For example, in Kenya FGM was banned in 2001, and in Egypt it became illegal in 2008.

However, the existence of laws alone has not been enough to end FGM. Deeply entrenched cultural beliefs and social pressures mean that families continue to subject their daughters to the practice despite the bans. Enforcing the laws has also been challenging, as FGM is often performed in secret by community members and those who support the practice. Prosecutions for violations of anti-FGM laws are rare. For example, Egypt's first conviction for FGM was in 2015, seven years after the ban, and Kenya has only achieved around 50 convictions so far.

Some progress is being made through education and advocacy efforts within communities where FGM is common. When community members themselves speak out against the harms of FGM, it can be more effective in changing views and behaviors than legal prohibitions alone. Success has also been seen when alternative rites of passage are developed to replace FGM ceremonies. But overall, while human rights law has raised the visibility of and formally prohibited practices like FGM, social change is still needed to fully uphold and advance women's rights. Without substantial investments in education and community mobilization, human rights conventions and national laws will continue to have limited impact.

In conclusion, human rights law should be seen as a starting point rather than an end point for eliminating harmful practices against women and girls. Especially on culturally-sensitive issues, laws must be accompanied by community education and mobilization to be fully effective. Progress will require patience, persistence, and long-term commitment to empowering women and transforming deeply rooted social norms. But with additional efforts, the promise of human rights can ultimately be realized for women and girls around the world.
