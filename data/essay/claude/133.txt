In the autobiographical book The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls, the narrator's portrayal of her father Rex Walls is highly influenced by social conditioning and class divisions. Jeannette grows up in poverty with an alcoholic father and a sporadically-employed mother. Her father Rex is portrayed as intelligent and charming but irresponsible, selfish and neglectful. This portrayal is a reflection of Jeannette's complex relationship with her father that is shaped by her challenging upbringing and desire for stability and normalcy.  

Jeannette's account of her father is understandably colored by her difficult experiences growing up in extreme poverty and neglect. As a child, she resents her father's inability to hold down a steady job and provide basic necessities for the family. They lose their home and end up homeless, scavenging for food and living in abandoned houses without electricity or plumbing. Her father's alcoholism and grandiose schemes make their lives more difficult and chaotic. Naturally, this shapes Jeannette's view of her father in a very negative light given the immense hardships she endured due to his behavior and poor life choices.

At the same time, Jeannette exhibits a strong desire for a normal life and relationship with her father that represents traditional social conventions. She wants Rex to behave like a responsible parent and provider, to give her a safe home, financial security and opportunity for education and social mobility. Her yearning for stability and normalcy in the face of an unconventional upbringing influences her portrayal of Rex as irresponsible and neglectful. She judges him harshly for not living up to traditional social expectations of fatherhood and for depriving her of a normal childhood.      

However, there are glimpses of Jeannette's deeper affection for her charming and whimsical father. Although she resents his behavior, she acknowledges his adventurous spirit and passion for learning. She has fond memories of Rex sharing stories, teaching her about the stars and wild plants, and encouraging her imagination. This hints at Jeannette's complex and conflicted view of her father that is tinged with admiration and love despite her resentment of him. Her nuanced portrayal thus reflects the push-pull of her yearning for normalcy and her inherent affection for Rex.

In conclusion, Jeannette Walls' portrayal of her father in The Glass Castle is highly influenced by her experiences of poverty, social conditioning around parental responsibility, and class divisions in society. While she resents her father's neglect and desire for a normal upbringing, she also exhibits a deeper affection and respect for his passion and personality. The overall portrayal is a poignant reflection of her conflicted relationship with her father that shaped her identity and view of the world.
