When determining whether to purchase additional carding machine capacity to extend a production contract, several factors should be considered:

Cost of purchasing additional carding machine capacity. Carding machines that increase production capacity are a significant capital investment. The cost to purchase additional machines to meet increased demand from a contract extension needs to be evaluated relative to the potential revenue from the extended contract. If the contract extension is not long enough or the per-unit revenue is not high enough, the cost may not be recouped from extending the contract. A thorough cost-benefit analysis in Excel would determine if the investment in new equipment is worthwhile based on key metrics like payback period, net present value, and internal rate of return. 

Cost of purchasing additional yarn. Extending the contract also means purchasing more raw materials, like yarn, to meet increased production needs. The cost of yarn and other materials needs to be considered, especially if there are potential price increases for materials over the extended contract period. Using Excel, the total cost of materials for the initial 6-month contract period can be calculated and extrapolated to the full extended contract period. If material costs increase significantly, the contract extension may not be profitable even if new carding machine capacity is purchased.

Potential changes in production capacity utilization. Another factor to consider is how much of the new carding machine and production capacity will be utilized once the initial 6-month contract is complete. If a significant portion of the new capacity is left unused and is not able to be re-purposed for other contracts, the initial capital investment in new equipment may not be worthwhile. The company needs to evaluate if there are opportunities to use the additional capacity after the contract extension ends through other production contracts or internal needs. If much of the new capacity will remain unused, it likely does not make financial sense to invest in equipment and extend the contract.

In summary, a data-driven analysis that considers the cost of new equipment, cost of materials, revenue potential, capacity utilization, and other key metrics is needed to determine if extending a production contract by investing in additional carding machine capacity is financially viable. Using Excel tools like Linear Programming Solver to optimize the key drivers of the decision can help determine the best course of action. With a holistic view of the costs and benefits, the best decision that maximizes profitability and optimizes production resources can be made.
