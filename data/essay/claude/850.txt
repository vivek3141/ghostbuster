To properly assess the status of 65-year-old Deirdre after undergoing electro-convulsive therapy for severe depression and risk of relapse, several evaluation steps should be taken by her health professionals.

First, a thorough medical and psychiatric history review should be conducted, including discussion of her mental and physical health before and after her husband's death, the severity and symptoms of her depression that warranted ECT treatment, how she responded to the ECT, any side effects, and her current state of mood, cognition, and daily functioning. Standardized depression screening tools, like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, that Deirdre fills out and clinician-administered scales such as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale provide quantitative measures of her current depression severity and risk of relapse.

Deirdre reported that ECT helped lift her depression but left her with memory gaps and concentration difficulties, common side effects, so cognitive testing is recommended. Simple screening tests include the Mini-Mental State Exam, clock drawing test, and verbal fluency to check for significant cognitive impairment. More in-depth neuropsychological testing may also be needed to identify specific memory, attention, and executive function deficits. These cognitive baselines will help determine if further ECT treatments are suitable and monitor her progress. 

Discussion about Deirdre's activities of daily living, social interactions, sleep, and eating habits provides insight into her overall wellbeing and recovery. Talking to her close ones, with her consent, can give another perspective on her day-to-day functioning. It is important that Deirdre maintains a routine, sticks to a healthy diet and exercise, and continues social engagement to avoid isolation and support her rehabilitation and remission.

Ongoing follow-ups and management are required to monitor for depression recurrence. Deirdre should schedule regular visits with her psychiatrist and therapist, and be aware of potential trigger events that may exacerbate her depression. Medication may be introduced to sustain her mood stability and adjunct therapies like psychotherapy sought if needed. Community support groups can also aid her long-term coping.

In summary, a comprehensive assessment and management plan considering Deirdre's medical history, current symptoms, cognitive and functional status, and relapse prevention strategies is key to evaluating her progress, maintaining stability, and optimizing her wellbeing after loss and depression. With the right care and her personal motivation, Deirdre has a good chance of sustained remission despite facing a difficult life event. But vigilance for recurrence and proactive support systems remain vital to minimize future episodes and safeguard her health.
