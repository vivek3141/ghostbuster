There are two main grounds for judicial review evident in the case of Georges v. Canada (Attorney General). The first ground is the violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, specifically the freedom of expression under Section 2(b). The second ground is the violation of Canada's international obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). 

When dealing with alleged violations of convention rights like the Charter or ICCPR, courts implement a proportionality analysis to determine if the limit on the right is justified. This requires examining whether the objective of the limit is sufficiently important, whether the measure limiting the right is rationally connected to that objective, whether the limit minimally impairs the right, and whether there is proportionality between the effects of the limiting measure and the objective. This test differs from a "reasonable options" analysis which considers whether the government chose from a range of reasonable policy options in good faith. The proportionality test involves deeper scrutiny to determine if the specific policy option chosen was justified in limiting a convention right.

In Georges' case, the central issue was whether the criminal prohibition on film piracy violated Section 2(b) freedom of expression and Article 19 of the ICCPR protecting free expression. The trial judge applied the proportionality test and found the objective of protecting intellectual property rights was important, but that criminalizing all unauthorized downloading or streaming was not rationally connected to that goal, did not minimally impair the right, and the effects were disproportionate. On appeal, the Court of Appeal conducted a more deferential "reasonable options" analysis and found that Parliament could reasonably choose strict criminalization to protect copyright holders.

The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the trial judge's decision and approach. It affirmed that courts must apply a proportionality analysis when reviewing limits on convention rights, not a more deferential reasonable options test. Rights must only be limited in a way that is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The Court also found that criminalizing all unauthorized downloading violated Section 2(b) and Article 19 and was not saved under Section 1 of the Charter or Article 19(3) of the ICCPR.

In its decision, the Supreme Court was clearly influenced by jurisprudence from the European Court of Human Rights on Article 10 (free expression) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Supreme Court cited numerous Article 10 cases requiring the "necessity" and proportionality of restrictions on free expression. The Court affirmed that in the post-Charter era, Canadian judges have a responsibility to defend individuals' fundamental human rights and freedoms, and must not show deference to Parliament when those rights have been violated.

The two grounds of review in Georges' case—Charter rights and international law—required the courts to implement a proportionality analysis standard of review, not a rationality or reasonableness standard. In finding that the law violated Section 2(b) and Article 19, the courts followed European jurisprudence upholding a high standard for defending free expression rights. The case demonstrates the significant impact of international law and judgments on the domestic role of Canadian judges as guardians of fundamental human rights.
