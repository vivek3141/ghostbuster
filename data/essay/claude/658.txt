Meetings play an important role in enabling effective communication within organizations and teams. However, the way meetings are conducted has significantly evolved with advances in technology.

In-person meetings foster real-time interaction and allow for discussions that can rapidly evolve based on participant feedback and questions. Body language and tone can provide additional context, helping to ensure the intended meaning and importance are conveyed. For example, in team meetings at my company, being able to physically gather around a whiteboard or mock-up has been invaluable in generating new ideas or finding solutions to complex problems. The spontaneous debates and tangents that happen when people can feed off one anotherâ€™s energy in a room often lead to unexpected breakthroughs.

However, in-person meetings also require significant time and resources to organize and conduct. People have to physically travel to and from the meeting location, and meetings that include participants from different offices or regions can be particularly challenging to coordinate. Meetings with large groups of people can also be inefficient, as they frequently get off track or become dominated by a vocal few.  

Technology has enabled new ways of conducting meetings that address some of these shortcomings while still facilitating useful discussion and collaboration. Web conferencing software like Zoom, WebEx, and GoToMeeting allows for virtual meetings where participants can share audio, video, and screens from wherever they have an Internet connection. These virtual meetings require little to no travel and can include people from almost anywhere. While they lack some of the benefits of face-to-face interactions, virtual meetings are highly efficient, especially for routine status updates or when visual components are less important.

Other tools like online whiteboards, document sharing platforms, and project management systems support asynchronous meetings, where participants contribute at their own pace over a defined time period, rather than at a single moment. These asynchronous tools allow people to thoughtfully consider ideas and post questions or comments in a collaborative space. They have become a staple for many remote teams and working groups.

In my experiences working as part of largely distributed teams, finding the right balance of in-person, live virtual, and asynchronous meetings has been key to communication and collaboration success. Each meeting type has a purpose, and thoughtfully combining them can mitigate weaknesses and play to different strengths. Overall, while technology has introduced more options for conducting meetings and made existing meetings more convenient, human interactions remain vital to building understanding and trust in work relationships. In-person meetings should not be discounted and will likely endure as an important way for people to connect, even as virtual tools continue to expand the possibilities.
