Lenin's political ideology was rooted in a few core principles that remained largely unchanged throughout his life and shaped the development of Bolshevism. These principles centered around a strict organizational approach, a focus on industrial production, the dominant role of the Communist Party, and a vision for an egalitarian socialist society. However, the Bolshevik party underwent a shift from being solely an opponent of the autocracy and bourgeoisie to becoming the sponsor of a functioning government. This shift required some adaptation of principles to realities on the ground. 

From an early age, Lenin developed a strict view of organization, discipline, and hierarchy that would come to define Bolshevism. According to historian Richard Pipes, Lenin's childhood was marked by the stern discipline of his father, a school inspector, who valued order and obedience. This likely contributed to Lenin's belief in "organization, discipline, and authority" as the means to achieve revolutionary goals. Lenin advocated for a rigid, hierarchical party organization with strict membership rules, believing superior central organization was necessary to overthrow the autocracy.

This organizational approach was a core part of Bolshevism from its beginnings. When the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party split into Bolshevik and Menshevik factions in 1903, it was largely over questions of organization and membership. The Bolsheviks, under Lenin's leadership, prioritized a disciplined, hierarchically organized party of professional revolutionaries. The Mensheviks preferred a more loosely organized mass party. The Bolsheviks' strict organization and discipline would become a hallmark of their success.

Lenin also maintained an unwavering belief in the necessity of developing industry and modernizing the economy. In his early work The Development of Capitalism in Russia, Lenin analyzed the emergence of capitalism and the revolutionary potential of the proletariat in Russia. He believed capitalism was a necessary stage of economic development that paved the way for a socialist system. The Bolsheviks promised rapid industrialization to strengthen the proletariat and improve living standards. 

After the revolution, Lenin's vision of a socialist society centered around further developing industry and production. He implemented the New Economic Policy in 1921 to encourage capitalist development where it would strengthen the economy and further the goals of socialism. Lenin saw no contradiction between using capitalist methods in the short term and striving for socialism in the long term. His core focus on developing the productive forces through whatever means necessary remained consistent.

The dominant role of the Communist Party in all areas of society was central to Lenin's vision. Lenin believed the Party should control not just the government but also trade unions, social organizations, and all means of disseminating information. The Party was meant to educate citizens and transform society in accordance with socialist principles. Lenin asserted the Party's monopoly on truth and wanted strict control over intellectual and artistic activity. 

Lenin envisioned an egalitarian socialist society as the ultimate goal of the revolution. He believed socialism would eliminate exploitation, free workers from the tyranny of capital, and establish social equality and communal welfare. However, Lenin's vision of socialism was always rather abstract. He cared more about securing the power of the Communist Party than immediately implementing a socialist system in a precise form. The realities of governing forced some compromises, such as the mixed economy of the NEP, but the socialist ideal remained.

The shift from opposing the government to governing required balancing idealism and practical necessity. The Bolshevik party had to translate its vision into policy, but compromises were inevitable to maintain power and prevent economic collapse. They gave up complete control of industry with the NEP, though insisting socialism was still the goal and the Party alone would determine the course. The Civil War and foreign invasions also necessitated temporary compromises, though terror and repression were deemed necessary to preserve Bolshevik authority. 

In conclusion, Lenin maintained a few core principles that defined Bolshevism: strict organization, the necessity of developing productive forces, the dominance of the Communist Party, and the vision for an egalitarian socialist society. However, the Bolshevik party adapted these principles to the realities of governing a country in crisis. While compromises were made for expediency, the Bolsheviks never lost sight of their ideological goals and upheld their belief in their right to total power and control as the Party of the proletariat. Lenin's unchanging principles coupled with pragmatic adaptation shaped Bolshevism in theory and practice.
