There were several factors that influenced the decision to run the design and implementation phases in parallel for the second part of the project. The most significant factor was the tight timeline and schedule for completing this stage of the work. By overlapping the design and build phases, the team would be able to gain back some of the time lost in the initial planning stages of the project. Running these phases concurrently, even if just partially, could help ensure the overall timeline was met.  

Another factor was the modular and iterative nature of the work. The team planned to break the second part of the project into smaller, more manageable components that could be designed and built individually yet still integrated together. This lent itself well to a parallel approach, as some modules could be in the design phase while others were already in development. The modular work also meant designs and requirements were likely to evolve as each module was built, so ongoing communication and collaboration between designers and developers was important.

To manage the effort and schedules effectively with this parallel approach, the team leads carefully evaluated the scope of work for each module and assigned cross-functional groups to oversee the design and development of each component. They also built extra time into the schedule to account for rework that might come out of the integrated modules not quite aligning with the initial designs. The team holds regular meetings—within the subgroups working on each module as well as with the overall team—to review status, address any conflicts, and keep the work on schedule.

The team found that running the design and implementation phases in parallel for this stage of the work allowed them to gain significant schedule efficiencies while also improving feedback loops. Tight collaboration and coordination across groups has been key to the success of this approach, but the savings in time and enhanced outcome have made the additional effort worthwhile. Overall, the parallel workstreams have kept the project on schedule and led to a higher quality end result.
