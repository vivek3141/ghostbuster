The Internet Age has revolutionized businesses and commerce in profound ways over the past few decades. As the Internet has developed from the early days of ARPANET in the 1960s and 1970s into the ubiquitous global network it is today, opportunities for electronic business and commerce (e-business and e-commerce) have exploded. 

The development of the Internet began in 1969 with the creation of ARPANET, the network that connected research centers and universities in the United States. In the 1980s, the network expanded globally, TCP/IP protocols were adopted as standards to allow multiple networks to interconnect, and the domain name system was introduced. The launch of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 was a turning point that made the Internet accessible to ordinary people. The 1990s saw massive growth of the Internet, with the popularization of web browsers, search engines, e-commerce websites, and Internet service providers. By the early 2000s, broadband access allowed for even faster growth. Today, about 4.5 billion people use the Internet, and a vast e-commerce industry brings in trillions of dollars per year.

The Internet has enabled new opportunities in the e-marketplace for both businesses and consumers. E-commerce platforms allow businesses of all sizes to sell to customers around the world. This includes large online retailers like Amazon as well as small businesses leveraging websites and social media. For customers, e-commerce means more choice, convenience, and often lower prices. The e-marketplace has also enabled new business models, like online marketplaces connecting buyers and sellers, subscription services, and the sharing economy.   

Looking ahead, several drivers are likely to shape the future of Internet business. First, the growth of mobile technology and applications will fuel new opportunities, as more people access the Internet via smartphones and other devices. Second, improved analytics, AI, and personalization technologies will allow businesses to gain greater insights into customers and more effectively target them. Finally, online platforms and marketplaces will continue to enable new types of businesses, cutting out middlemen and creating new ways to match buyers and sellers or tasks and workers.

The benefits of e-business for companies are substantial. For example, e-business significantly reduces the costs of customer service through the use of automated chatbots and self-service portals. It also improves time-based customer delivery performance, enabling just-in-time production and rapid delivery of goods and services to customers. Using the Internet, companies can efficiently evaluate business counterparties, competitors, customer segments, and their needs. The Internet also facilitates optimal resource allocation and aggregation by enabling price transparency and connecting companies to a global network of suppliers and partners.

In conclusion, the Internet Age has brought about massive changes in business and commerce. The Internet developed over decades into a global network that has enabled new forms of e-business and e-commerce. It has created opportunities for businesses large and small and provided benefits to both companies and customers. The future of Internet business is bright, with developments in mobile, analytics, AI, and platforms likely to drive further innovation. Over time, the industry value chain may evolve into a "Value Trust Network," supported by a global knowledge network and enhanced security for collaboration between well-branded organizations. The Internet has been transformational, and likely will continue enabling new types of businesses, marketplaces, and models in the coming decades.
