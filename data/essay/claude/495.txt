Descartes' Method of Doubt is a useful but imperfect starting point for philosophical inquiry. It allows one to radically challenge and re-examine all presupposed notions and beliefs to build a foundation of knowledge from scratch. However, Descartes' approach has some weaknessesâ€”it is overly skeptical, it relies on questionable metaphysical principles, and it does not fully escape the problem of uncertainty. 

Descartes proposes the Method of Doubt to systematically examine and reject any belief that is not certain. He aims to discover unshakeable foundational truths from which to reconstruct knowledge. This approach of radical skepticism and suspension of judgment about uncertain propositions is beneficial for philosophical thought. It forces one to reflect on why they believe what they believe and accept only logically justified propositions as true. The Method of Doubt compels philosophers to build knowledge in a meticulous, ground-up fashion based on indubitable first principles.

However, Descartes' approach is problematically hyperbolic in its skepticism. He intends to doubt everything that can be doubted, but this is an implausible and impractical epistemic goal. As observed by contemporary philosophers like Saul Kripke, one cannot reasonably doubt propositions like "The earth has existed for more than 5 minutes" or "Other people have minds." Descartes' method leads to absurd conclusions if applied consistently without restraint. A moderate, selective skepticism that calls into question only those beliefs which are demonstrably uncertain or contradictory is more reasonable.

Descartes also relies on dubious metaphysical assumptions, like the reliability of clear and distinct ideas and the ontological argument for God's existence. The criterion of clarity and distinctness is a poor standard of knowledge because Descartes provides little justification for why clear ideas must be true. The ontological argument is controversial and relies on intuitions that are not universal. Because Descartes builds much of his epistemology upon these questionable arguments, his overall system becomes less plausible. A superior approach would be to ground knowledge and justification in principles that do not require controversial metaphysical support.

Finally, Descartes does not fully escape the epistemic predicament that motivates his methodological skepticism. Even if one accepts his metaphysics, Descartes fails to rule out the possibility that an evil demon may be systematically deceiving him. The evil demon hypothesis remains coherent even after Descartes constructs his system of knowledge. As a result, Descartes cannot achieve the indubitable certainty of knowledge that he seeks. His method does not conclusively prove that we are not deceived about what we take to be most evident and rationally justified.

In conclusion, while the Method of Doubt has merits as a tool for philosophical re-examination of knowledge, Descartes' employment of the method is imperfect and limited. His radical doubt leads to implausibly skeptical conclusions, relies on questionable metaphysical principles, and ultimately does not achieve complete epistemological certainty. The Method of Doubt should be applied carefully and selectively, with consideration of objections raised against Cartesian skepticism. A tempered, restrained skepticism may better serve philosophical inquiry than the hyperbolic doubt that Descartes proposes.
