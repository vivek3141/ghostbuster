There are several major online databases that are useful for research in chemistry, including Beilstein, Web of Knowledge, and SciFinder. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages for different types of chemical searches and research applications. 

Beilstein is one of the most comprehensive databases for organic chemistry. It contains over 9 million organic compounds and over 70 million properties and reactions. The depth of coverage on organic chemistry makes Beilstein an excellent resource for an exhaustive search on a particular organic compound or reaction. However, the focus on organic chemistry means the database lacks good coverage of inorganic compounds, metals, or materials. The interface can also be challenging to navigate with many options and capabilities that have a steep learning curve. For most routine searches, the complexity of Beilstein may be overkill.  

Web of Knowledge, which includes the Science Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Index, has a broader coverage of chemistry and all sciences. It allows for searches of topic keywords, authors, journals, and cited references. A major advantage of Web of Knowledge is the ability to track citation relationships between articles to follow the intellectual progression of an idea or discover influential papers on a topic. However, the chemistry coverage is not as deep as a specialized database like Beilstein, so for intricate chemical queries or compounds, Web of Knowledge may lack sufficient details. The broader scope also means searches may yield an overwhelming number of results that require filtering.

SciFinder is a popular database produced by the American Chemical Society that incorporates chemical structures, reactions, and references with cited relationships. The interface in SciFinder is intuitive and easy to navigate for most common types of searches. It has good coverage of both organic and inorganic chemistry. For searches involving chemical structures, SciFinder can recognize and suggest related structures. However, the coverage of journals and references in SciFinder may not be as extensive as Web of Knowledge. The cost to institutions and limitations on user numbers can also be a disadvantage for wider access.

In summary, for an initial broad search on a chemistry topic, I prefer using SciFinder because of its balance of coverage and ease of use. For an in-depth search on a specific organic compound or reaction, Beilstein would likely yield the most comprehensive results. To identify influential papers or track the citation record on a chemistry subject, Web of Knowledge may have advantages. Using a combination of these databases can provide a good overall approach for productive chemistry research based on different needs. But for most routine searches, SciFinder and Web of Knowledge are more accessible and cover a sufficient scope for initial explorations.
