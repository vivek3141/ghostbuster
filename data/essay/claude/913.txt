There are several factors that contribute to the complex relationship between land prices and house prices. The supply and demand of land and housing are closely interconnected, with changes in one market impacting the other. The economic model of supply and demand applies to the housing market, where the equilibrium price of houses is determined by the interaction of supply and demand. Changes in factors like interest rates, land costs, and residential density can shift the supply and demand curves and impact house prices. Local planning authorities and house builders also play a role in influencing land and house prices. Finally, degradation and contamination of land can negatively impact house prices by reducing supply and demand.

The supply of land and housing is relatively inelastic in the short run due to the time required to develop new properties. When demand increases due to population growth or other factors, it takes time for supply to catch up. This results in upward pressure on land and house prices. Similarly, a decline in demand can lead to falling land and house prices until supply adjusts. The long run elasticity of land and housing supply depends on several factors, including availability of suitable development sites, planning regulations, building costs, and developer speculation. Limited land availability and restrictive planning policies constrain supply and keep land and house prices high. 

The demand for land and housing depends on several factors as well, including interest rates, cost of land, and residential density. Lower interest rates make mortgages more affordable and stimulate demand for housing, driving up both land and house prices. The high cost of land also gets passed onto homebuyers in the form of higher house prices. Increasing residential density, such as through redevelopment of single-family homes into multi-unit dwellings, can raise land values and prices due to the more intensive use of scarce land resources. However, higher density also often means smaller unit sizes, which can reduce demand and offset some of the upward pressure on prices.

Local governments and house builders exert control over land use, development, and house building. Their decisions can directly impact both the supply of new housing and demand for land. Housing starts and building activity are determined by house builders seeking to maximize profits. Governments implement planning policies that can constrain land supply through zoning restrictions, heritage protection, and development approvals. These policies are often aimed at managing issues like urban sprawl, but they also restrict supply and drive up land and house prices. Governments also invest in infrastructure like roads, transit, and amenities that improve accessibility and increase the desirability and demand for housing in certain locations.

Finally, contamination or degradation of land can reduce both the supply of usable land and the demand for housing in affected areas. Brownfield sites and lots requiring environmental remediation are more costly to develop, and some may be unsuitable or unsafe for residential use. This limits the supply of land available for housing. At the same time, homebuyers typically prefer uncontaminated land and will avoid purchasing houses on degraded or polluted sites. This negatively impacts demand and results in lower house prices for properties on or around contaminated land. In some cases, the costs of remediating the land may outweigh the potential benefits of residential development. 

In summary, there are many interconnected factors that determine the supply of and demand for land and housing, including interest rates, land costs, residential density, planning policies, builder activity, and site contamination. Through their impacts on supply and demand, these factors combine to shape the complex relationship between land prices and house prices. Changes in any factor can shift the balance and influence the equilibrium values of land and house prices.
