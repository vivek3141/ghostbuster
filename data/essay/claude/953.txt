Occupational imbalance and occupational deprivation can have significant negative impacts on an individual's health and wellbeing. Occupation refers to the activities that occupy a person's time, including self-care, leisure, and work activities. When a person lacks meaningful occupations, experiences an excess or lack of certain occupations, or is unable to participate in desired occupations, it can lead to poor health and wellbeing outcomes.

Occupational imbalance refers to having either an excess or lack of certain types of occupations. For example, a workaholic who spends the vast majority of their time engaged in work occupations and little to no time engaged in leisure or self-care occupations would be experiencing an occupational imbalance, as would someone who is mostly inactive and lacking work or leisure occupations. According to the literature, occupational imbalance has been linked to poor physical and mental health outcomes. For example, a study by Chandola et al. (2008) found that employees who work long hours have an increased risk of coronary heart disease as a result of stress and lack of leisure time. Similarly, Barnett et al. (2012) found that retired individuals who lack purposeful activity and social connections are at higher risk of accelerated aging and cognitive decline.   

Occupational deprivation refers to being unable to participate in meaningful occupations due to factors outside of one's control, such as illness, disability, or social factors like poverty or discrimination. For example, someone with a physical disability that prevents them from engaging in cherished leisure activities or someone in poverty unable to afford supplies for their hobbies would be experiencing occupational deprivation. Studies show occupational deprivation is associated with depression, anxiety, and limited success and satisfaction in life (Whiteford, 2000; Wilcock, 1991).

Personally, I have experienced the impacts of both occupational imbalance and occupational deprivation. A few years ago, I had a demanding job and was working between 60 to 80 hours a week. I lacked time for exercising, socializing, and engaging in hobbies. I developed unhealthy habits and gained weight, and I felt extremely stressed, unmotivated, and at times depressed. In short, the excess of work occupations and lack of other meaningful occupations negatively impacted my wellbeing. After cutting back my work hours, introducing regular exercise and leisure activities, and improving my sleep schedule, my health and mood significantly improved. 

On the other hand, a close family friend of ours suffered an injury that left him unable to walk and participate in many of the physical occupations and activities he previously enjoyed. As a result, he reported feelings of depression, uselessness, and lack of purpose, demonstrating the impact of occupational deprivation on wellbeing and sense of identity or "occupational being". With time and access to occupational therapy, he was able to adapt some of his interests to his physical abilities and learn new skills to add purpose and meaning. This exemplifies how participation in meaningful occupations is not only essential for health but also one's sense of identity and self.

In summary, occupational imbalance and occupational deprivation can pose significant threats to an individual's health, wellbeing, sense of purpose, and identity. While these experiences are often outside of one's control, one's "occupational being" and satisfaction in life depends greatly on having opportunities to participate in a variety of meaningful occupations. Access to healthcare, social support, and occupational therapy services can help address these issues and enable people to adapt and reengage in purposeful and balanced occupations.
