Was Leopold von Ranke Truly the 'Father of Scientific History'?

Leopold von Ranke is often cited as the "father of scientific history" due to his rigorous methodology and emphasis on working with primary source evidence. However, this title is debated by historians. While Ranke made significant contributions to historical practice and shaped modern historical methodology, strict and representative application of his methods did not dominate historical scholarship in his time. Furthermore, other contemporary and later historians also adopted and advocated for scientific approaches to history. Whether Ranke alone deserves the title of "father of scientific history" is thus open to analysis and interpretation. 

Ranke helped pioneer and propagate a scientific, evidence-based approach to history in the 19th century. He emphasized working with primary sources and eyewitness accounts to understand the past "as it actually happened" ("wie es eigentlich gewesen"). He aimed to strip away mythology and assumptions to comprehend history objectively. Ranke turned away from the imaginative histories of earlier writers in favor of a fact-based, scientific approach relying on archival research. His credo of objectivity and emphasis on evidence established a new standard for historical scholarship.

However, Ranke's methods were not universally or strictly adopted by historians of his time. Many contemporaries continued to write narrative, literary histories rather than strictly evidence-based ones. Ranke's conception of objectivity has also been criticized as misleading by later historians, who argue that objective, value-free history is impossible. All historians bring certain assumptions and interpretations to their work, despite best efforts at neutrality and impartiality. Ranke's scientific ideals were thus aspirational but not fully achievable or representative of 19th century historical practice.   

Other historians of Ranke's era and later also championed scientific history, questioning whether he alone deserves the title "father of scientific history." For example, Barthold Georg Niebuhr emphasized working with primary sources and establishing historical facts a generation before Ranke. Later, Sir John Seeley advocated for a scientific, source-based approach to history in his 1883 book The Expansion of England. Johan Huizinga and Eileen Power pushed for rigorously evidence-based history in the early 20th century. Although Ranke was instrumental, he was not the sole founder or proponent of scientific history.

In conclusion, while Leopold von Ranke deserves acclaim for helping establish evidence-based, scientific history as the dominant modern methodology, the title of "father of scientific history" is debatable. His approach was not uniformly adopted by contemporaries, and his ideals of objectivity have been criticized as unrealistic. Other historians before and after Ranke also advocated for scientific, fact-based history. Ranke may have pioneered and popularized - but did not singularly "found" - scientific history. Whether he alone merits the title "father of scientific history" is thus open to interpretation, though his contributions were undoubtedly highly significant and long-lasting. Overall, Ranke shaped the emergence of scientific history, though he was not its sole architect or founder.
