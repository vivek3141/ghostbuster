The Monarka Hotel in Kathmandu, Nepal faces a significantly different business environment than hotels in the UK and thus should adopt distinctive people management strategies. The hotel industry in Nepal has strong growth potential given the rise in tourism, but it also faces more challenges in navigating cultural and governmental factors. Nepal has a collectivist culture focused on family and social harmony, highly regulated employment laws, and weaker infrastructure. In contrast, the UK has an individualistic culture, more flexible workforce regulations, and a stronger business infrastructure. 

Given these divergences, a personnel management approach is more suitable for Monarka Nepal compared to a strategic human resource management approach often seen in the West. Personnel management focuses on more administrative functions related to payroll, compliance, and day-to-day workforce activities. In Nepal, compliance with complex employment regulations is critical and workforce activities require nuanced navigation of cultural factors. A strategic HRM approach aims to gain competitive advantage through workforce initiatives, but Nepal's business environment poses more obstacles in achieving that level of workforce optimization and innovation.

Culturally, Nepal's collectivist culture values harmony over competitiveness and prioritizes family and community over individual achievement. This requires a more paternalistic management style where employees expect close bonds and support from employers in exchange for loyalty. In contrast, the UK's individualist culture encourages competition and self-interest. Employees value independence and ambition over social connections at work. This allows for a more impersonal, incentive-based management style in the UK focused on productivity over harmony.

Governmentally, Nepal has instituted strong regulations on workforce pay, benefits, and termination that aim to protect employees. This limits Monarka's flexibility and discretion over employment decisions. In contrast, UK regulations are less restrictive, giving businesses more flexibility in tailoring rewards and performance practices to their needs. Infrastructure challenges like frequent power outages and transportation issues in Nepal also require more contingency planning to ensure smooth operations. Advanced infrastructure in the UK poses fewer disruptions to standard workforce processes.

In conclusion, the differences between Nepal and UK's business environments call for distinct people management strategies for Monarka Hotel. A strategic HRM approach suitable for a Western company like a UK hotel may falter in Nepal without significant localization for cultural and practical challenges. An administrative personnel management approach aimed at compliance, cultural sensitivity, and coping with operational disruptions is better suited to succeed in Kathmandu. With strong understanding and adaptation to the Nepali context, however, elements of strategic HRM such as performance management and skills development can be implemented gradually to help improve Monarka's competitive position despite the complexities of its environment.
