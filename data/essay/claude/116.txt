Cryptography is the process of encoding and decoding information to prevent unauthorized access. It has been used throughout history but has evolved rapidly with the growth of electronic communication and e-commerce to become more mathematical and secure. The two main categories of cryptography are public-key cryptography and private-key cryptography. Public-key cryptography is considered more secure and has enabled much of modern e-commerce.  

Private-key cryptography uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. Both the sender and receiver must have the same key. The Caesar cipher, where each letter is shifted a fixed number of positions, is the earliest known example of private-key cryptography. The Enigma machines used by the Nazis in World War II were more complex private-key cryptography systems. The main downside of private-key cryptography is that the key must be exchanged between the sender and receiver before secure communication can happen. This exchange of keys itself can introduce vulnerability.

Public-key cryptography was developed in the 1970s and overcomes this key exchange problem by using two mathematically related keys: a public key and a private key. The public key can be shared with anyone, while the private key is kept secret. The key property of public-key cryptography is that a message encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key, and vice versa. This is made possible due to some mathematical functions that are easy to do in one direction and practically impossible to reverse. 

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange method published in 1976 allowed public keys and private keys to be derived by the two parties trying to communicate. The RSA algorithm, named after its inventors Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, is the most well-known public-key encryption method. Published in 1977, RSA uses prime numbers to encrypt and decrypt messages. Encrypting with the public key is like raising a message to a power. Decrypting with the private key relies on calculating the multiplicative inverse, which is feasible with small prime numbers but practically impossible with the size of numbers used for encryption. 

Public-key cryptography has enabled the secure transmission of information over the Internet. Website connections encrypted with SSL utilize RSA or similar public-key cryptography methods. Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies rely on Elliptic Curve public-key cryptography to prove ownership and exchange keys. Digital signatures made possible by public-key cryptography are used to verify identities and sign documents electronically. And encrypted e-commerce transactions keep payment information private. In short, public-key cryptography has shaped the modern, interconnected digital world we live in. Overall, cryptography has a long and important history and has evolved to become essential to the functioning of e-commerce and communication technologies today.
