Melodrama, with its sensational storylines, exaggerated emotions, heightened sense of morality, and easily identifiable characters, dominated theater stages in the 18th and 19th centuries. Despite the ever-evolving tastes of audiences and the multitude of entertainment options becoming available, melodrama's immense popularity endured throughout this period. This popularity stemmed from melodrama's ability to reflect the social and political anxieties of the time while eliciting a range of intense emotions from audiences and employing familiar stock characters and plot devices that theatergoers loved. 

One of the earliest successful melodramas was Thomas Holcroft's A Tale of Mystery, first performed in 1802. The play tells the story of jealous lover Monsieur Belville's plot for revenge against his rival for the affections of the innocent orphan girl Amelia. The play is filled with suspense, mystery, passion, and drama, and ends happily with the villains punished, innocents rewarded, and love triumphant. For early 19th-century audiences, A Tale of Mystery evoked anxieties over political turmoil in France while championing wholesome, virtuous characters who represent hope and morality. The exaggerated characters and rollercoaster of emotions left audiences feeling relieved and uplifted at the conclusion.

Boucicault's The Octoroon, first performed in 1859, was one of the most popular plays of the century. Set in Louisiana, the play deals with the evil overseer Jacob M'Closky's attempt to thwart the virtuous hero George's love for Zoe, a beautiful octoroon woman who is one-eighth black. The play tackles the pressing issue of slavery and racism, but in a way palatable for white audiences by portraying slavery as an evil institution that also corrupts white characters. Zoe, the octoroon character, is a model of femininity and morality in need of white male protection. Once again good triumphs over evil, and audiences experience a mix of suspense, anger, and satisfaction.   

Dion Boucicault's later work The Colleen Bawn (1860) was also enormously successful, running for over 350 performances. Set in Ireland, the play tells of the young and beautiful Eily O'Connor, who marries a man for his money but then falls in love with his younger brother. The play depicts the Irish characters through a lens of stereotypical attributes – irrational, impassioned, scheming – which audiences likely saw as both familiar and exotic. Like his previous melodramas, Boucicault creates a world of heightened emotion and sensation but ultimate moral justice.

Melodrama was able to achieve such immense and enduring popularity through reflecting the social anxieties and political issues of the time in an accessible, crowd-pleasing way. At the same time, melodrama elicited a range of extreme emotions in audiences through suspense, sensation, and moral justice. By employing familiar stock characters and predictable but dramatic plots, melodrama gave audiences exactly what they wanted – an escape from their everyday lives into a world of heightened passions and ensured happy endings. Thus, it is no wonder that melodrama came to dominate popular theater in the 18th and 19th centuries.
