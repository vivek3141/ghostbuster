Explain and analyze the problems associated with God's spatial and temporal transcendence and explore possible resolutions to these conflicts. 

The traditional attributes of God present several philosophical and theological challenges when combined with His spatial and temporal transcendence.  If God is omnipresent, omniscient, and eternal, how can He interact with and relate to spatially and temporally finite human beings? How can a transcendent God be immanent and providentially involved in human affairs? These questions have perplexed philosophers and theologians for centuries and raise several key problems that deserve analysis and possible resolution.

First, God's spatial transcendence as an omnipresent being seems to conflict with His personhood and ability to relate to individuals.  If God is wholly present everywhere in creation equally, how can He focus His attention on any one person or group?  How can God respond to individual prayers or develop intimate, personal relationships if He is diffused uniformly across all of space?  This seems to make God into an impersonal force or energy rather than an agent capable of interaction.  Possible solutions to this problem include the suggestions that God can multi-task across all of space due to His infinite power and unlimited consciousness.  God may also choose to manifest Himself and His presence in special ways in certain locations, similar to a hologram that can project a focused three-dimensional image from a two-dimensional surface.  Another approach is that God's omnipresence refers to His power being diffused everywhere to uphold creation, but not necessarily His consciousness or attention.  These solutions allow for God to be immanently present and active everywhere in a general sense, while also personally present and relational with individuals.  

Second, God's temporal transcendence as an eternal being poses problems for His knowledge of and interaction with temporal events.  If God exists outside of time and views all moments equally in a single "eternal now," how can He know what time it is now or the sequence of events for finite creatures?  How can God respond to temporal events or answer time-sensitive prayers if He has no temporal perspective or location?  It seems God would have no basis for choosing one moment over another to act if all moments are equally real to Him.  Possible resolutions to these dilemmas include that God can choose to adopt a temporal perspective when interacting with creation, similar to an author envisioning the sequence of events within their story.   God may also exist in a supra-temporal state that encompasses all moments, but still perceive the flow and passage of time for creatures.  Another approach is that God knows and wills the temporal effects of His atemporal knowledge and decisions.  So God can know our prayers and respond in His eternal now in a way that interacts with us in our own temporal sequence.  These solutions provide ways for a transcendent God to remain immanently involved in and responsive to events in time.

In conclusion, while God's spatial and temporal transcendence poses difficult philosophical and theological problems regarding His interaction with and knowledge of creation, several possible resolutions have been proposed that can reconcile these attributes with His immanence and providence.  Through further philosophical and scriptural reflection, we can work towards coherent and compelling accounts of how a transcendent God can also be personally present and active within our space and time.
