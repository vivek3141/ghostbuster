According to Douglas in her book 'Implicit Meanings,' pollution is a relative concept that is socially constructed and defined. What is considered 'polluting' in one culture can be seen as acceptable in another. Douglas links the concept of pollution to Durkheim's functionalist theory by arguing that beliefs about pollution serve to reinforce cultural categories and maintain social order. Pollution beliefs are a way of keeping social control as they define what belongs to certain cultural groups and what does not. They protect society by setting symbolic boundaries. 

Perceptions of dirt and pollution vary significantly across cultures. For example, the handling of corpses after death is viewed very differently across cultures and religions. In some, corpses are seen as polluting while in others, close contact with corpses during funerary rites is an important part of the grieving process. As Douglas notes, "dirt is essentially disorder. There is no such thing as absolute dirt: it exists in the eye of the beholder." For anthropologists, it is crucial to understand cultural relativism in perceptions of pollution. What one culture deems as dirty may not be viewed as such in another. Pollution beliefs are culturally constructed and help maintain the structure of societies.

The functions of pollution beliefs are to reinforce cultural categories by defining what belongs and does not belong. They help protect society's vulnerable domains including the human body, the classification of animals, and the natural environment. By setting up rules about what crosses the boundary into pollution, they guard the integrity of these domains. Pollution beliefs also create symbolic boundaries between groups by defining purity and impurity - what is acceptable for 'us' and 'them.' In this way, pollution beliefs are a mechanism of social control that reinforces the cultural structure.  

According to Douglas, "Society's concern with pollution arises from its concern with social purity." Pollution beliefs protect society by guarding cultural conceptions of purity. They reinforce fundamental classifications and conceptions in culture, strengthening the symbolic boundaries between groups. While the domains that are seen as vulnerable and in need of protection differ across cultures, the function of pollution beliefs as a mechanism of social control remains the same. They maintain cultural categories and the social order by defining what belongs and what threatens. For anthropologists, recognizing the culturally relative and socially constructed nature of pollution beliefs is key to understanding their role in sustaining the fabric of societies.
