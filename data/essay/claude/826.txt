Human-wildlife conflict refers to the interaction between wild animals and people and the negative impacts on human activities or property. As the human population grows and expands into previously uninhabited areas, interactions between humans and wildlife increase in frequency and intensity. These interactions often lead to conflicts that cause harm to people, wildlife, and the environment. 

There are many examples of human-wildlife conflict around the world. One of the most common is damage to crops or livestock by wild animals. For example, elephants raid crops in many parts of Africa and Asia, resulting in loss of income and food for farmers. Predators like lions or wolves may attack livestock, reducing herder's incomes. In some cases, people may retaliate by hunting and killing the wildlife in question, exacerbating the conflict.

Another frequent example is wildlife vehicle collisions. Animals crossing roads may be struck by vehicles, resulting in harm to the animals, damage to vehicles, and in some cases injury or death for vehicle occupants. Regions with high densities of large mammals like deer or moose frequently see high numbers of wildlife-vehicle collisions. These collisions pose risks to both human and animal life, and also incur costs from vehicle damage and medical bills.

Disease transmission is also a source of human-wildlife conflict. Wild animals may carry diseases that can spread to people, pets, or livestock. For example, bats are reservoirs for diseases like ebola, Nipah virus, and even coronaviruses that can spread to people. Rodents may carry hantaviruses or plague, while birds can spread influenza and other pathogens. As people encroach on wildlife habitats, the risks of disease spillover increase.

In some cases, wild animals may prey on pets or even attack humans. Large predators like bears, mountain lions, or crocodiles may view people as prey under certain circumstances. Sharks are also known to attack humans in coastal areas from time to time. While rare, these predatory attacks often lead to a desire for lethal control or elimination of the offending animals due to safety concerns.

As the human population grows, conflicts with wildlife over space, food, and safety will likely escalate. Integrated management approaches that emphasize coexistence and balance the needs of both humans and wildlife will be required to achieve sustainable solutions. Reduction of habitat loss and protection of wildlife corridors can help decrease interaction frequencies. Non-lethal deterrents, compensation for losses, and public education may also reduce conflicts. With proactive management and coexistence strategies, humans and wildlife can share landscapes sustainably.
