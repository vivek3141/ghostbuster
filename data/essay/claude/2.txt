The emergence of feminism in Japan was influenced by a unique set of social and political factors that differed in important ways from those in Western nations. Confucian ideologies, nationalism, education, political awareness, and workforce changes all shaped the development of feminism in Japan, but in ways distinct from the West.   

Confucianism promoted strict gender roles in Japan that subordinated women to men, framing women as inferior and limiting their opportunities outside the home. These ideologies initially constrained the growth of feminism in Japan relative to Western nations where Enlightenment ideals of individualism and equality took stronger hold. However, as Western influences grew in Japan starting in the 19th century, exposes to alternative value systems led some Japanese women to question and reject traditional gender roles, fueling an early feminist awakening.

The rise of nationalism in Japan also had a complex influence on feminism. On the one hand, nationalist sentiments glorified traditional gender roles and the ie (family system), discouraging women from seeking greater rights and opportunities. On the other hand, as Japan sought to be viewed as a modern nation, Western notions of women's rights and suffrage gained appeal as symbols of modernity. This contributed to the passage of limited suffrage rights for women in Japan in 1920, though still far behind most Western nations.

Education played a key role in raising feminist consciousness in Japan as in the West. Access to education emboldened women to question traditional roles, and student activism was central to early feminist organizations in Japan, such as Seitosha and the New Woman's Association. However, education rates for women remained low relative to Western nations, limiting the spread of feminist ideas. Many Japanese women did not have opportunities for higher education until the mid-20th century.   

Political awareness and activism were also crucial for the rise of feminism, but unfolded differently in Japan.  Early feminist leaders in Japan, such as Kishida Toshiko and Fukuda Hideko, were politically engaged and outspoken in demanding rights for women. However, women in Japan gained the right to vote in 1945—decades after women in most Western nations—and to stand for political election in Japan in the 1950s. Grassroots political activism was more constrained in Japan relative to Western feminism. 

Finally, workforce changes in Japan contributed to the feminist movement, as growing numbers of women gained awareness of and experience with discrimination and limitations on their opportunities relative to men. However, cultural expectations continued to relegate most Japanese women to the home, and workforce participation rates for women in Japan remained very low compared to Western nations for most of the 20th century.

In conclusion, while the rise of feminism in Japan shared some common causes with Western nations, such as education and political activism, it was shaped by a distinct set of social and political factors in Japan—notably Confucian ideologies, nationalism, and constraints on women's opportunities relative to the West. These factors gave rise to a feminist movement in Japan that developed later and differently from its Western counterparts.
