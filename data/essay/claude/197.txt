Classical Greek theatre served as an important platform for conveying and critiquing cultural values in Athenian society. The tragedians Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides frequently used their plays to spread messages about what it meant to be Greek, but they also pushed cultural boundaries and challenged societal norms. 

A key way in which the tragedians promoted Greek cultural values was by dramatizing stories from Greek mythology that emphasized aretê, or excellence and virtue. For example, in Aeschylus’ Oresteia, the house of Atreus is purified through the establishment of the Athenian legal system and the transference of power from blood vendettas to trial by jury. This trilogy served to highlight the cultural value Athens placed on civic institutions and the rule of law. The tragedians also emphasized other Greek virtues like courage, loyalty, and sacrifice for one's polis or city-state.

However, the tragedians did not simply endorse all traditional Greek values. They also used their plays to question and challenge certain cultural norms, especially those surrounding religion, gender, and politics. For instance, in Euripides’ Bacchae, the god Dionysus is portrayed as a cruel and vindictive deity who punishes those who refuse to worship him. This subversive portrayal of a Greek god would have been seen as quite shocking. Euripides was also progressive in his treatment of women, giving them more complex and sympathetic roles than the stereotypical female characters in other tragedies.

The tragedians also provided social commentary on political issues, though often indirectly. In Aeschylus’ Persians and Suppliants, he criticized imperialism and argued for mercy towards foreigners. Sophocles engaged with the debates surrounding new ideas that threatened tradition, as in Antigone where the title character questions the authority of the state over family. Euripides was the most overtly political, openly criticizing war, tyranny and even democracy in his plays.

Through their plays, the Greek tragedians promoted civic values that were core to Athenian cultural identity, but they also tested the boundaries of what was socially and politically acceptable. Their tragedies served as a lens through which the Athenians could examine their society and its moral, religious and political complexities. The lasting power of plays like Antigone, Medea and Oedipus Rex testify to the tragedians' success in using drama as a platform to spread cultural messages and challenge norms in ancient Greece.
