Realism, liberalism, and Marxism are three major paradigms in the field of International Relations. Realism focuses on the role of power and national interests in global politics, whereas liberalism emphasizes cooperation, institutions, and human rights. Marxism, on the other hand, highlights the role of socioeconomic class struggle and capitalist imperialism in shaping world order. Overall, while all three schools of thought offer insightful perspectives on global affairs, liberalism is arguably the most effective paradigm to understand and justify the contemporary world order.

Realism dominated during much of the Cold War, emphasizing the role of raw power in global politics. Realists view the international system as anarchical, where states seek power and security to advance their national interests. Realism offers a pessimistic outlook of global politics, suggesting that conflict and competition rather than cooperation define world affairs. While realism provides useful insights into geopolitical rivalries, its pessimistic orientation limits its ability to justify today's increasingly globalized world with proliferation of global institutions and governance. 

Unlike realism, liberalism focuses on cooperation and shared interests among states, emphasizing the role of international institutions, organizations, and non-state actors. Liberals argue that globalization and interdependence foster cooperation, as states work together to solve transnational challenges like climate change or economic crises. Key liberal institutions like the UN and WTO provide evidence for global cooperation today. By highlighting shared interests and cooperation, liberalism offers an optimistic perspective well-suited to understand today's globalized world order. However, liberalism's emphasis on harmony risks underestimating enduring rivalries and conflicts that also shape global politics.

Marxism highlights the role of economic and social forces in global affairs, especially the exploitative nature of global capitalism. Like realism, Marxism adopts a pessimistic view of world order, but attributes global dynamics to the contradictions of capitalism rather than human nature. While Marxism provides a compelling critique of global inequalities, its focus on class struggle and revolution appears increasingly irrelevant in today's post-Cold War context where capitalism reigns globally. Overall, Marxism's limited applicability to contemporary global politics suggests its lesser ability to understand today's world compared to liberalism.

In conclusion, while realism, liberalism, and Marxism offer useful lenses into global politics, liberalism provides the most compelling paradigm to understand and justify today's globalized world order. Liberalism's optimistic faith in cooperation and shared interests aligns well with globalization's proliferation of multilateral ties and institutions. Yet liberalism should also recognize realism's insights into enduring global conflicts and power dynamics, as well as Marxism's highlighting of systemic inequities, to develop a balanced perspective on world affairs. Adopting a liberal lens tempered by realist and Marxist critiques offers the most promising way to analyse contemporary global politics.
