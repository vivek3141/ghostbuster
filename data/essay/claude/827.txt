The concepts of dirt and pollution have long been used to shape societal norms and create divisions among groups. By defining certain acts, behaviors, and even entire groups  of people as "dirty" or polluted, societies are able to classify some behaviors and social statuses as acceptable and others as discordant. Those deemed polluted or dirty are othered  and marginalized. 

One clear example of this is the historic treatment of waste and those who handle it. Throughout much of history, waste products and those who collected or disposed of them were seen as dirty and polluted. For example, in many ancient cities, people of lower classes and castes were assigned the role of collecting and disposing of human waste, animal carcasses, and other refuse. They were marginalized and ostracized due to their unclean professions. This classification allowed those in higher classes and castes to maintain their status as pure or clean in contrast.  

The notion of dirt and pollution has also been used to enforce gender roles and patriarchal systems. Women have long been seen as more bodily and earthy, and thus more contaminated, while men were viewed as the purer and rational sex. This was used to justify restricting women's lives and enforcing norms like menstrual seclusion. Even today, the fact that menstruation is viewed as unclean contributes to stigma around menstruation that limits women's full participation in society.  

Racial groups have also been classified as polluted or dirty to justify oppression and discrimination. For example, both European Jews and Roma populations were viewed as contaminated and unclean by the Nazis to rationalize isolation, hatred, and even genocide. Racial minorities have frequently been described as dirty or polluted as a way to other them from the dominant racial group in a society. This language is often used specifically to frame minorities as threats that will contaminate or pollute the purity of the dominant group.

In these ways, the concepts of dirt and pollution have been used as powerful tools to shape societies' views of normal and abnormal, acceptable and unacceptable. By othering groups as contaminated or unclean, the dominant groups are able to maintain their own purity and status. This continues today in many forms, showing how notions of pollution remain a stubborn justification for oppression, discrimination, and marginalization. Overall, these societal divisions have had grave consequences on human relations and equality.
