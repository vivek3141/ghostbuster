Multilateralism and bilateralism are two contrasting approaches to international trade that countries employ to advance their economic interests. Multilateralism refers to the coordinated liberalization of trade through broader agreements between many countries, such as through the World Trade Organization (WTO). Bilateralism refers to selective trade deals and partnerships between two countries tailored to their unique economic relationship. 

For much of the post-World War II era, multilateralism dominated international trade. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its successor the WTO promoted increasingly free trade and reciprocity between countries. However, in recent decades bilateralism has become more prominent, with countries pursuing customized Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) and partnerships outside of the WTO framework. PTAs have evolved into a hybrid approach bridging multilateralism and bilateralism.

Advocates argue PTAs expand trade by tailoring deals to bilateral relationships, address modern trade issues the WTO fails to incorporate, and stimulate multilateral deals by demonstrating their benefits. Critics counter that PTAs undermine nondiscrimination and reciprocity in the WTO, distort global trade patterns, and weaken the WTO's authority. There are also debates over whether PTAs mainly reflect economic motivations to access foreign markets or geopolitical motivations to advance strategic alliances.

The rise of bilateralism and PTAs poses challenges to the multilateral trading system. While PTAs have not made the WTO obsolete, they have reduced its importance and threaten its principles. The WTO remains relevant for negotiating new multilateral deals, enforcing trade rules, and settling disputes. There have been limited successes reviving multilateral talks, but the consensus-based WTO faces difficulties incorporating new issues and diverse country interests. 

Looking ahead, multilateralism and bilateralism will likely co-exist, with PTAs bridging them in a "spaghetti bowl" of crisscrossing trade rules. Multilateralism may regain momentum if there are breakthroughs in long-stalled WTO talks or appetite for new global rules on 21st-century issues like e-commerce or environmental protection. However, bilateralism and PTAs also appear firmly entrenched given their flexibility to address unique country interests and adapt to political priorities - suggesting a hybrid trade governance landscape is here to stay.

In conclusion, while multilateralism dominated post-World War II trade, bilateralism and PTAs have gained prominence more recently. PTAs straddle the line between multilateralism and bilateralism, expanding trade but also fragmenting the global system. There are good arguments on both sides of the debate over PTAs and their relationship with the WTO. The trading system of the future is likely to incorporate both multilateral and bilateral elements, with the balance of power between them continually evolving alongside geopolitical realities and economic priorities.
