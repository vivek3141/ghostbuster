Governments have several policy tools available to help combat the problems associated with excessive car use, including congestion and pollution. Implementing policies and incentives that make alternative transportation modes more attractive and discourage car use can be effective ways to change people's behavior and reduce the negative externalities of automobile dependence. 

One approach is to make mass transit options like buses, trains, bikeshares, and rideshares more affordable, accessible, and convenient. Governments can subsidize public transit to reduce fares, increase routes and frequency of service, and make the overall experience more pleasant. When public transit is a viable and attractive alternative, more people will opt to take transit rather than drive. Cities can also invest in infrastructure for active transportation like bike lanes, sidewalks, and bike parking to make cycling and walking easier and safer. These policies essentially make the alternatives to driving more competitive.

Governments can also introduce disincentives for driving to motivate a shift to other modes of transport. Policies like congestion pricing, parking fees, and higher vehicle registration taxes are examples. Congestion pricing charges drivers for using crowded roads during busy times, which can reduce traffic and also generate revenue to fund transit and active transportation initiatives. Parking fees and increased vehicle taxes raise the overall cost of car ownership and usage, encouraging some to drive less or use alternative transport. 

Emission standards and pollution taxes are additional ways for governments to curb environmental damage from vehicle use. Stricter emissions standards for new vehicles can accelerate the adoption of greener technologies over time. Fuel taxes and taxes on emissions like carbon can be levied to account for the pollution costs of driving, making driving a less attractive option relative to transit or active transportation.

In summary, governments have many tools available to shift behavior and reduce the problems associated with excessive car use. Investing in alternative modes of transport along with economic disincentives for driving can work together to combat both traffic congestion and pollution. Policymakers should utilize a mix of "carrots" and "sticks" to motivate a transition to more sustainable transportation habits overall.
