Descartes' argument for mind-body dualism in his Meditations rests on his foundational belief that the essence of the mind is thinking, while the essence of the body is extension in space. From this starting point, Descartes argues that the mind and body have distinct essences and are independent substances. However, there are several issues with Descartes' reasoning that call into question the validity of his argument for dualism. 

First, Descartes claims that the mind and body can be clearly and distinctly understood as separate substances because they have distinct essences - thinking and extension, respectively.  However, it is debatable whether these attributes truly capture the essence of mind and body. The mind seems to encompass more than just thinking, including emotions, sensations, and intuitions. And the body enables more than just extension and space-occupation; it allows for movement, growth, and tactile sensation. Having different primary attributes does not prove that two things have completely distinct essences. Descartes' notion of essences is too simplistic.

Second, Descartes argues that the mind and body can exist independently, which proves they are distinct substances. But this claim is not definitively supported. While Descartes imagines his mind existing without his body, this is not conclusive evidence that disembodied minds can exist in reality. His imaginative exercise only shows the conceptual independence of mind and body, not their actual ontological independence. Without proving mind and body can function separately, Descartes cannot prove they are independent, let alone distinct, substances. 

In contrast, Hobbes argues that thinking may simply be a faculty of the body, rather than proving the mind and body are distinct substances. Hobbes proposes that all mental experiences, including thinking, arise from material processes in the body. On this view, the appearance of mind-body dualism comes from our first-person experience of thought as seemingly non-physical. But there is no proof that thought cannot be reduced to a "corporeal faculty" - a function of the body.

Descartes believes one can have a clear conception of the mind without the body, but it is far from obvious that we have a complete conception of thinking divorced from any bodily function. Our experience of thought seems inextricable from the brain and body. While we do not currently understand how matter gives rise to mind, that does not rule out the possibility of a scientific explanation and a monist view, as Hobbes suggests.

In conclusion, while Descartes presents an interesting case for mind-body dualism, there are significant issues with his reasoning and assumptions. Descartes relies on an outdated notion of essences and imaginative exercises rather than providing a sound argument for why the attributes of thought and extension prove that mind and body are distinct and separable substances. In contrast, Hobbes presents a more plausible view that acknowledges the intractable link between mind and body evidenced in experience, and recognizes that a monist, materialist theory of mind may be consistent with both scientific and philosophical explanations of the world. On balance, Hobbes' view that thinking may be a corporeal faculty poses a stronger challenge to Descartes' claim for mind-body dualism.
