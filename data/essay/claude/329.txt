Porter's Diamond of National Advantage model outlines several resources and conditions that shape the competitive advantage of firms located in a particular nation. According to the model, firms in China experience both advantages and disadvantages from the essential elements in the diamondâ€”factor conditions, demand conditions, related and supporting industries, and firm strategy, structure, and rivalry. 

On the advantage side, China has abundant available labor, especially low-cost labor, which serves as a key factor input for many manufacturing industries. The large population also means increasing domestic consumer demand for goods and services, especially from the expanding middle class. The increasing demand for products in China attracts many foreign companies to not only export to China but also establish local manufacturing bases to better reach Chinese customers. In addition, the rivalry between local Chinese firms promotes efficiency and innovation. The active presence of supporting and related industries in China also makes collaboration and partnership with suppliers easy and accessible for firms.

However, Chinese firms also face many disadvantages from the factors in Porter's Diamond model. Limited availability of higher-level skills and technology poses challenges for industries that rely on advanced factors to operate. Government control and intervention are common in the Chinese economy, creating uncertainty and barriers for firms. Local demand conditions also favor low-cost over high-quality, limiting the incentive for firms to upgrade. Fierce price-based competition due to rivalry leads to a lack of brand recognition and quality issues.

For western multinational companies, the advantages of Chinese firms from Porter's model enable cheaper manufacturing and wider market access in China through partnerships or joint ventures with locals. However, such advantages also make Chinese firms major competitors, especially as they improve their capabilities and expand globally. Many western firms have lost market shares to low-cost Chinese competitors both domestically and internationally.

Porter's Diamond model is closely related to SWOT analysis, which assesses the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats facing a firm. The strengths and weaknesses are internal to a firm, just like factor conditions and firm strategy in Porter's model. Opportunities and threats are external to a firm, similar to demand conditions and related/supporting industries in the Diamond model. Both models highlight how internal and external elements interact to impact a firm's competitive performance.

However, Porter's model has some shortcomings. It downplays the role of government and likelihood of events in shaping competition. It has a static view of competition and comparative advantage. The model also overemphasizes the home base, ignoring the increasing globalization of competitive advantages. Overall, while Porter's Diamond model provides useful insights into national advantages, a more dynamic model that incorporates global factors would better reflect the complexity of competitive landscapes today.
