Liberal institutionalist political economy (IPE) and free trade theories have shaped much of the debate around contemporary globalization. Core tenets of these perspectives, including the notion that increasing cross-border flows of goods, capital and investments lead to economic gains, help explain some characteristics of globalization, such as the rising mobility of capital and the spread of transnational production networks. However, these theories also face significant challenges in fully accounting for the realities of globalization today. 

Classic liberalism sees the free flow of trade and open markets as leading to greater prosperity and cooperation between nations. This theory suggests that globalization should raise global welfare, as countries can benefit from specialization and gains from trade. The emergence of complex transnational production networks, with supply chains spanning multiple countries, reflects this liberal vision. Firms are able to optimize production by locating different stages across countries, benefiting from cheap labor and resources. For developing nations, participation in these networks allows them to gain new technologies and skills, boosting their economic growth.

However, the benefits of globalization have not been evenly distributed, challenging the liberal claim that free trade leads to collective welfare gains. Where firms have concentrated high-value activities in developed countries while shifting more labor-intensive processes to developing economies with cheap labor, this has exacerbated inequality both within and between countries. Developing countries have also faced risks of over-reliance on foreign direct investment that can quickly exit, destabilizing their economies.

Interdependence theory also provides insights into globalization by emphasizing how cross-border flows have increased connections between countries, creating mutual vulnerabilities and benefits. The global spread of transnational production networks demonstrates growing interdependence, as firms rely on trade and investments across borders. Within production networks, events affecting one country can have economic ripple effects elsewhere along the supply chain. This interdependence means that global events like financial crises, trade disputes or public health crises can now transmit rapidly between countries.

However, the complex interdependencies facilitated by globalization cannot be adequately explained by an oversimplistic notion of harmony of interests between states. There remain conflicts of interest, power imbalances and geopolitical rivalries within an interconnected global system. While transnational firms have built interdependent production networks, states continue to primarily serve national interests. Managing global challenges like climate change also requires overcoming these competing interests between nations, which interdependence theory does not fully account for. 

In conclusion, while liberal and interdependence theories provide useful foundations for understanding globalization, they face significant limitations in explaining the complex realities of an increasingly globalized world. The trends of rising capital mobility, spread of transnational production chains and growing interconnections between countries cannot mask the uneven impacts of globalization, conflicts of interest between states, and the primacy of national priorities over universal gains. To develop appropriate policy responses, we must move beyond theories predicated on general equilibrium and mutual benefits towards more realist perspectives that recognize and address the tensions within globalization.
