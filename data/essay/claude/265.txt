There are several legal considerations that must be taken into account when determining liability for damages arising from a multi-vehicle car accident involving claims of nervous shock. The key considerations include:

1. Establishing negligence and fault. The first step is to determine which party or parties were negligent and at fault for causing the accident. This could be one or multiple drivers. Their level of fault must be assessed, as many jurisdictions have rules apportioning liability based on the degree of fault of each party. If one driver is predominantly at fault, they may bear most of the liability.

2. Causation of physical injuries. The negligent actions of the at-fault driver(s) must be shown to have caused the physical injuries to the victims in the other vehicles. This requires establishing a clear causal link between the breach of duty (negligent driving) and the resulting harm (physical injuries). Difficulties can arise in complex collisions with multiple impacts. 

3. Claims for nervous shock. Some claims may arise from victims who suffer psychological trauma from witnessing the accident and its aftermath, even if they did not suffer physical injury. These "nervous shock" claims must show that the victim witnessed events that would be considered shocking or horrifying to a reasonable person and that they developed a recognized psychiatric illness as a result. Establishing these elements can be challenging. 

4. Shared liability considerations. If multiple drivers are found to be at fault, liability may be shared or "apportioned" between them. How much each driver is liable depends on their relative degree of fault. Some jurisdictions prohibit recovery if the victim is found to be partially at fault. Determinations of shared liability can be complex when there are competing accounts of how the accident occurred.

5. Statutory benefits complications. The availability of statutory accident benefits or insurance coverage can further complicate determinations of liability. There may be caps on damages or prohibitions against suing parties except in cases of gross negligence. Statutory schemes differ significantly between jurisdictions and must be examined closely in any given case.

In conclusion, establishing liability in a multi-vehicle accident with nervous shock claims requires a careful analysis of negligence, causation, apportionment of fault, availability of statutory benefits, and other legal considerations that can vary in different jurisdictions. Determining who is liable for damages in such a complex situation is not straightforward but must adhere to basic legal principles of tort law.
