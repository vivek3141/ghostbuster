Firms face an important decision when it comes to how they distribute excess cash to their shareholders. They can pay out earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends, they can repurchase their own shares on the open market, or they can do a combination of both. There are several potential motives behind a firm's choice between dividends and share repurchases, including desire to influence shareholder base, provide flexibility, optimize tax impacts, or signal information.  

Some firms may prefer dividends because they are seen as attracting long-term, passive investors who want a stable income stream. Regular dividends are often valued by stable, income-oriented investors. In contrast, share repurchases will benefit investors who seek to reinvest dividends into the stock. Repurchases tend to attract more active investors who are interested in capital gains and the potential for future share price appreciation. By choosing dividends instead of stock buybacks, a firm may wish to shape its shareholder base and cater to more long-term focused investors.

Another motive is flexibility. Dividends represent a long-term financial commitment since investors expect recurring payments. Share repurchases are more flexible as they can be started or stopped relatively easily as the firm's cash position changes. If a firm anticipates uncertain future cash flows, it may prefer share repurchases to avoid committing to levels of dividend payments that cannot be sustained. Repurchases allow management to scale back shareholder distributions whenever needed.

Tax efficiency is also a likely motivation. Share repurchases generate capital gains for investors which are often taxed at lower rates than ordinary income like dividends. By choosing repurchases, the firm can provide higher after-tax returns to investors. Management may also consider the tax impact on the company, as earnings used for share repurchases are not tax deductible, while dividends are tax deductible. For firms with high taxable income, using earnings for dividends may generate tax savings. 

Finally, firms can signal information to the market with their choice of mechanism. When earnings are stable and strong, dividends tend to be viewed as a positive signal about future prospects. However, rapidly increasing dividends are hard to sustain and may signal overly optimistic expectations. Share repurchases are often viewed as a signal that management believes the shares are undervalued, as they are buying back shares with the expectation that the share price will rise in the future. The timing and magnitude of repurchases can also signal the confidence level of managers.

In summary, the issue of dividend payments versus share repurchases is important because they represent two of the primary ways firms can distribute excess cash to shareholders, and the choice impacts shareholders, taxes, financial flexibility, investor base, and information signaling. Firms must weigh these various factors and determine which option, or combination of options, maximizes benefits for both the company and its investors.
