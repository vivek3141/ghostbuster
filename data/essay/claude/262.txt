The French historian Fernand Braudel made a significant contribution to the Annales school of history and challenged traditional historical methods with his emphasis on the longue durée. Braudel advocated studying history at multiple timescales, including the short-term events studied in traditional political and social history, but also longer-term geographical, social, and economic factors that shape historical change. 

Braudel articulated his vision for a new historical method in his 1949 book La Méditerranée et le Monde Méditerranéen à l'époque de Philippe II. In this work, Braudel examined the Mediterranean world in the 16th century, but rather than focusing on the political and military events surrounding the reign of Philip II of Spain, Braudel spent much of the book discussing the geography of the Mediterranean and long-term social and economic factors like trade, agriculture, and transportation. For Braudel, these were the deep historical forces that shaped human events and experiences in the Mediterranean over the long run.

Braudel's emphasis on the longue durée placed him firmly within the Annales school, which aimed to move beyond the traditional focus on political and military history toward a deeper understanding of historical change. The Annales historians, including Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre, believed that history should encompass geography, economics, and social forces, not just the study of events. They advocated for conjecture and fluidity, rather than a rigid prescribed method. 

Braudel built upon these ideas but also expanded the temporal scope of the Annales school. He argued that historians should examine history at multiple levels of analysis, including: (1) the short-term time of events; (2) the medium-term social time of conjunctures that link events together; and (3) the long-term structural time of the longue durée that represents enduring geographical and social factors. For Braudel, the longue durée was the deepest level of historical understanding, but all levels were needed for a full picture.

Braudel's method represented a wider trend toward greater temporal depth, conjecture, and development in French historiography. His embrace of the longue durée and multi-level analysis exemplified a move toward "total history" that aimed to synthesize diverse historical perspectives. Braudel's vision has been massively influential and shaped the direction of French history and historiography in the postwar period. Overall, Braudel's contribution was instrumental in promoting a broader, deeper, and more fluid understanding of historical change that continues to inspire historians today.
