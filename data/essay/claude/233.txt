Tularemia is a rare infectious disease caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis. It is often referred to as "rabbit fever" because it can be contracted from infected rabbits and rodents. Tularemia was first described as a distinct disease in 1912 by two Japanese physicians who identified it as a plague-like illness in ground squirrels in Japan. However,  the causative bacterium, F. tularensis, was not identified until the 1920s. 

Tularemia is considered a potential biological weapon because the infectious dose is very small and the disease can be debilitating. As few as 10-50 bacterial cells can cause infection if inhaled or injected, leading to severe pneumonia and systemic infection. Because of this high infectivity and its potential to cause harm, F. tularensis  was studied as a potential biological weapon by several nations in the mid-20th century, including Japan, the Soviet Union, and the United States. However, most nations discontinued such programs in the 1970s due to public controversy. Some experts worry that stored samples could still be used as weapons.

People can get tularemia through several routes of exposure: insect bites (especially ticks and deerflies), handling infected animal tissues, inhaling contaminated aerosols or agricultural dusts, and drinking contaminated water. The most common symptoms depend on the route of exposure and include skin ulcers, swollen and painful lymph glands, and pneumonia. The mortality rate in untreated cases of pneumonic tularemia can be as high as 60%, but with antibiotic treatment, the overall mortality rate is about 2%. A vaccine for tularemia exists but is not currently licensed for public use.

According to the CDC, there are an average of 126 cases of tularemia reported each year in the United States. Most cases occur in the south-central and western states during the summer months. Due to underreporting, the actual incidence rate is estimated to be as much as 10-50 times higher. People who spend time outdoors in areas where tularemia is common, like campers, hunters, and landscapers, have a higher risk of becoming infected. Farmers and veterinarians are also at increased risk due to handling infected animal tissues.

In summary, tularemia is a bacterial disease that can cause debilitating illness in humans. While treatable with antibiotics if diagnosed early, its highly infectious nature and ability to cause severe disease via multiple routes of exposure has led to its study as a potential biological weapon. Although rare, it continues to affect people in certain occupational groups and geographic regions. With climate change expanding the ranges of ticks and rodents, tularemia may become more common in the future. Continued research on improved vaccines and rapid diagnostic methods is warranted.
