Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray incorporates themes of degeneration and physicality as described by Cesare Lombroso's theories of criminal anthropology. Lombroso posited that criminals could be identified by certain physical characteristics and that immoral behavior results in physical degeneration. Wilde employs these ideas to develop the character of Dorian Gray and chronicle his moral downfall.

When Basil Hallward first encounters Dorian Gray, he is struck by Dorian's youthful beauty and innocence. Dorian's physical perfection and purity inspire Basil to paint a portrait that captures Dorian's essence. However, Basil's friend Lord Henry Wotton corrupts Dorian by convincing him that youth and beauty are life's greatest treasures. Dorian becomes vain and libertine, indulging in immoral acts without consequence while the painted portrait ages and degenerates, reflecting the effects of Dorian's sins.

According to Lombroso, criminals often have distinctive facial features like broad jaws, fleshy lips, and asymmetrical faces. When Dorian first sits for Basil, his "finely-curved scarlet lips" and "frank blue eyes" exude purity and charm. However, as Dorian descends into debauchery, subtle changes in his appearance reflect his debased character. Years later, Basil observes that Dorian's "soft, rose-red lips" have become "curved and cruel" and his eyes "gleam with a fiery unholy light." The once angelic face now bears the marks of corruption in accordance with Lombroso's theories.

Whereas Dorian remains superficially unchanged, the portrait reveals the depths of his moral decay. On the night when Dorian cruelly rejects the actress Sibyl Vane, Basil notices a "touch of cruelty in the mouth" of Dorian's portrait. The painted figure appears disfigured with a "hideous expression" as Dorian indulges vain and immoral desires without restraint or regret. The worse Dorian's sins become, the more ghastly and corrupt the portrait grows, resembling a grotesque criminal type described in Lombroso's work.   

In the end, Dorian is unable to escape the degeneration of his character as reflected in the portrait. Confronted with the ugliness of his soul, Dorian hates the portrait for revealing his true self. He tries in vain to destroy the painting, but succeeds only in killing Basil Hallward. Dorian descends into despair as the sins of his immoral life ultimately catch up to him through the grim testimony of the portrait.

Wilde employs themes of degeneration and physicality, inspired by the works of Cesare Lombroso, to develop Dorian Gray's character and chronicle his downfall. Dorian's beauty and youth epitomize purity when Basil first paints his portrait. However, Dorian is soon corrupted by Lord Henry's cynicism and embraces a life of sin and pleasure. While Dorian remains unchanged, his portrait reflects his debased character through a progressive decay and deformity of features. In the end, the portrait stands as a symbol of Dorian's moral degeneration and inherent baseness beneath his superficial charms. Wilde suggests through this device that one cannot escape the effects of a life lived without virtue or restraint.
