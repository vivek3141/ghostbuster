Occupational therapy can be instrumental in helping Sue, a patient with schizophrenia, achieve her goals of attending regular voluntary work, maintaining daily routines, and participating in social activities. Occupational therapists work closely with clients to identify meaningful activities and find strategies to overcome barriers to participation in those activities.

For Sue's long-term goal of voluntary work placement, an occupational therapist would help evaluate her interests and skills to find suitable work activities. The therapist may visit the potential workplaces with Sue to determine any accommodations needed and ensure she feels comfortable in that environment. They can work with Sue and her employer to set up a gradual transition to work, perhaps starting with just a few hours a week and building up from there. They can also provide ongoing monitoring and advice to help address any challenges that arise. Occupational therapy interventions like cognitive training, social skills training, and coping strategies can help improve Sue's focus, interpersonal effectiveness, and ability to handle work stresses. All these steps will maximize the likelihood Sue can achieve and sustain her goal of attending regular voluntary work.

For Sue's short-term goals of maintaining daily routines and participating in social activities, occupational therapy is also valuable. Occupational therapists can evaluate how schizophrenia impacts Sue's ability to complete daily tasks like personal hygiene, meal preparation, household chores, and financial management. They can then recommend adaptations to routines, use of memory aids, task organizers, and coping strategies to make these daily activities more achievable. They may also suggest starting with easier versions of the tasks that can be built upon gradually.

To facilitate social participation, an occupational therapist can help Sue explore options for local community activities, and work on skills like conversation, organization, and problem-solving that will enable her to feel more comfortable in new social surroundings. The therapist may attend initial social activities together with Sue to provide encouragement and advice. They can also try simulated scenarios to enable Sue to practice her social skills in a controlled setting before attempting them in the real world.

In summary, by focusing on crucial life roles and meaningful activities, occupational therapy is well equipped to support Sue in multiple ways to achieve both her long-term goal of attending work and her short-term goals of managing daily life and connecting socially with others. Through evaluation, adaptation, skills training, and gradual exposure, occupational therapists can help reduce barriers and give Sue strategies to successfully participate in work, daily and social activities despite the challenges of her schizophrenia. With this support, Sue will have the opportunity to live as independently and purposefully as possible.
