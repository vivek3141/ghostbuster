London experienced a period of rapid growth during the Tudor and Stuart dynasties in England, from the late 1400s through the 1600s. There were several contributing factors to London's expansion during this time period. 

First, London became an increasingly important center of trade and commerce. London's port grew significantly, becoming a hub for trade with continental Europe as well as long-distance trade. Wool, cloth, wine, spices, and other goods flowed through London. Numerous trade companies were headquartered in London, including the East India Company, the Muscovy Company, and the Levant Company. The Royal Exchange was built in 1570 to facilitate trade. As trade expanded, merchants and craftsmen flocked to London. 

Second, London grew due to its prominence as the political and administrative center of England. The royal court was located in London, at places like the Palace of Westminster, the Palace of Whitehall, and the Tower of London. Parliament also met in London. As the Tudor and Stuart monarchs consolidated power, the civil service and bureaucracy grew in London. Lawyers, clerks, and government officials took up residence in London.

Third, London's population grew due to migration from other parts of England as well as immigration from abroad. Migrants were attracted to the many economic opportunities in London, especially for skilled craftsmen and merchants. Some 150,000 people are estimated to have migrated to London between 1500 to 1650, compared to a native population increase of only about 50,000. Immigrants also came from continental Europe, including French Protestants (Huguenots) escaping religious persecution.

Finally, London expanded geographically through the development of suburbs outside the walls of the City of London. As the population grew, the limited area within the city walls could not contain it. Neighboring towns like Westminster, Southwark, and Stepney became de facto suburbs of London. Developers bought land and built new residential districts. This expansion of the built-up area of London enhanced its status and attracted even more people.

In conclusion, London grew rapidly during the 16th and 17th centuries due to its increasing prominence as a center of trade and commerce, its position as the political and administrative capital of England, migration from the countryside and immigration from abroad, and physical expansion beyond the walled city. These factors combined to make London one of the largest and most important cities in Europe during the period.
