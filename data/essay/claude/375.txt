The opening shot of Martin Scorsese’s Raging Bull is a close-up of Robert De Niro as Jake LaMotta shadowboxing in a smoky boxing ring. Shot in black and white, the camera zooms slowly into his face, focusing the viewer's attention entirely on LaMotta as he violently punches the air and grunts with exertion. This opening shot is a visual representation of LaMotta’s intense, brooding inner rage and establishes his volatile and destructive character.  

The tight framing of the close-up shot isolates LaMotta, removing any sense of context or surroundings. All we see is his face and upper body as he violently lashes out, suggesting his all-consuming anger and implying a lack of restraint or control. The black and white cinematography further adds to the oppressive and claustrophobic feel of the shot. The lack of color drains any warmth or vitality from the image, leaving only shades of gray that mirror LaMotta’s own troubled psychology.  

LaMotta’s grunts and yells as he pounds his invisible opponent reveal his animalistic nature and desire for violence. Even though there is no actual physical opponent, LaMotta is intensely psyching himself up for a fight through his shadowboxing. His aggression seems to come from within, not in response to any outside provocation, indicating deep inner turmoil and demons that drive his rage. The slow zoom into LaMotta’s face as he continues shouting creates a feeling of being drawn unwillingly into his fury and inner darkness.   

This opening shot lasts an unusually long time, fixating the viewer on LaMotta’s emotional outburst and setting up his unhinged temperament. When the shot finally fades into a wider view of LaMotta training in the ring, his rage has already been firmly established and lingers over the scene. Everything we see of LaMotta from this point on is colored by our initial impression of his volatility.   

In conclusion, the opening close-up shot of LaMotta shadowboxing is a visual representation of his inner rage and instability. The tight framing, black and white cinematography, and long duration focus the viewer’s attention on LaMotta’s emotional turbulence. His grunts and yells reveal a dangerous aggression that seems to come from within. This highly memorable opening shot sets up the portrayal of Jake LaMotta as a man consumed and ultimately destroyed by his own anger and violence.
