The humanist movement in Renaissance Europe played a significant role in paving the way for the Protestant Reformation. Humanism centered on the study of classical Greek and Roman texts, focusing on human potential, individualism, and skepticism towards established dogma. The humanists helped foster an intellectual environment where new ideas could spread, and also directly influenced key reformers like Erasmus and Luther.

The humanist focus on studying original texts directly, rather than relying on interpretations of church scholars, promoted an independent and skeptical attitude that aligned with the Protestant Reformation. The humanists studied ancient Greek and Roman works directly, embracing rhetoric, history, poetry and more. They aimed to purify knowledge by going back to original sources, believing the Middle Ages had lost touch with the roots of Western civilization. This same impulse to renew Christianity by going back to original biblical texts would inspire the Protestant reformers. 

The humanists also championed a rebirth of ancient wisdom and belief in human potential that contradicted the medieval Catholic view of humanity as hopelessly bound to sin. Humanists like Pico della Mirandola promoted human free will and the ability of people to choose their own destiny by exercising reason. This optimistic view of human potential and free will aligned with the later Protestant belief that humans could have a direct relationship with God, without the mediation of the Catholic Church.

In addition, the humanists fostered a spirit of skepticism towards established beliefs that would later characterize the Protestant Reformation. The humanists subjected many long-held assumptions of medieval Christianity to rational scrutiny and criticism. While not directly attacking the Catholic Church, the humanists created an environment where questioning authority and received wisdom became more accepted and common. The reformers would take this skeptical spirit and directly apply it to the Catholic Church.

Finally, key reformers were directly influenced by and involved in the humanist movement. Erasmus, one of the most important humanist scholars, also advocated for reform within the Catholic Church and greater access to the Bible for common people. While Erasmus remained Catholic, he laid the groundwork for vernacular translations of the Bible and a focus on early Christianity that Luther and others would build upon. Luther himself was trained in humanist scholarship and adopted humanist principles of skeptical inquiry, belief in human potential, and return to early sources. So the humanist movement directly shaped those who would become the leaders of the Protestant Reformation.

In conclusion, the humanist movement in Renaissance Europe contributed in many ways to the coming of the Protestant Reformation. The humanists promoted principles of free inquiry, skepticism towards authority, belief in human potential, and return to original ancient sources that align with the attitudes and philosophies of the reformers. And key reformers were directly influenced by and involved in humanism. So while the Reformation would ultimately represent a break from Rome, it was built on foundations laid, in part, by the humanist scholars who came before. Overall, humanism played a significant role in preparing the ground for this revolutionary moment in Christian history.
