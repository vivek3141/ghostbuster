Oxford and Bath are two popular tourist destinations in England, attracting millions of visitors each year. However, while there are some similarities in their tourism concepts and attraction points, there are also key differences in their target markets, facilities offered, and destination management. 

Both Oxford and Bath are historic cities that leverage their cultural heritage and architecture to attract tourists. Oxford is renowned for its prestigious university and college buildings, some dating back to the 13th century, as well as its association with famous intellectuals like C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. Bath is a UNESCO World Heritage site known for its Georgian-era buildings and Roman baths. The cities showcase a rich and well-preserved cultural history that appeals to tourists seeking an authentic British experience.

However, the cities differ significantly in their target markets and facilities. Oxford primarily attracts educational tourists, families with children, and older visitors. It focuses on college tours, museums, and cultural attractions. Accommodation options are more limited. In contrast, Bath caters to a wider range of visitors, from families to honeymooners. It offers amenities like spas, shopping, and nightlife entertainment in addition to its cultural sights. A wider choice of hotels, restaurants and leisure activities appeal to tourists with diverse interests.  

The management of the cities as destinations also differs. Oxford has a decentralized model with each college managing its own tourism program. Coordination between colleges and citywide initiatives are limited. Bath, on the other hand, has a dedicated visitor and tourism association funded by local businesses to oversee tourism promotion and development for the city in a cohesive manner. 

In summary, while Oxford and Bath share some similarities as popular historic destinations, there are distinctions in their target markets, facilities, and management models. Oxford takes a more hands-off, decentralized approach that relies on its prestigious colleges and intellectual heritage. Bath adopts a proactive destination management model that provides infrastructure and activities to serve a diverse base of leisure tourists beyond its cultural attractions alone. The cities showcase two different successful tourism concepts in Britain today.
