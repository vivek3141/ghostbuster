Logical positivism was an intellectual movement in the early 20th century that sought to apply the scientific method to philosophy. The logical positivists believed that the only knowledge that was meaningful was that which could be verified through direct observation or logical reasoning. They aimed to make philosophy an empirically grounded discipline rather than one focused on speculation or assumptions that could not be directly tested. 

Logical positivism had a major influence on the field of psychology in the early-mid 20th century. Psychology was struggling to establish itself as an empirical science, and the logical positivist emphasis on empiricism, verification, and logical reasoning resonated with psychologists aiming to make psychology a "hard science." The logical positivists viewed psychology as a science that could provide empirical evidence about the human mind and experience. In turn, psychology adopted some of the principles of logical positivism, like operationalization of concepts, verification of theories through observation, and minimizing speculation.

The influence of logical positivism shaped how philosophy and psychology interacted during this time period. Philosophy had long dominated psychology, but under the sway of logical positivism, many philosophers came to see psychology as a natural philosophical ally that could provide empirical data to support philosophical theories of mind and knowledge. Psychology embraced this partnership with philosophy and adopted many philosophical principles that aligned with logical positivism. The distinction between philosophy and psychology was blurred, as they shared some similar aims and principles.

However, by the mid-20th century, logical positivism was declining in influence. Psychologists began to realize that strict empiricism and verificationism were too limiting and did not reflect the full scope of scientific psychology. New philosophical movements like postpositivism recognized that observation is theory-laden and knowledge cannot be purely empirically grounded. Modern psychology has moved beyond the principles of logical positivism, adopting a more postpositivist philosophy of science. Speculation and hypothetical reasoning are now recognized as valuable, and psychology aims to combine empirical evidence with theoretical inference. 

In conclusion, logical positivism had a major influence on the development of scientific psychology in the early 20th century. It shaped how philosophy and psychology interacted and adopted some key principles from each other. However, logical positivism was too narrow of a philosophy of science to capture the scope of knowledge in psychology. Its influence has waned in modern psychology, which now adopts a more postpositivist approach that values both empirical evidence and theoretical inference. Overall, while logical positivism was highly influential for a time, psychology has evolved beyond its strict tenets.
