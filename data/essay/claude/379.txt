Mergers and acquisitions are growth strategies where companies combine with other firms to build scale, complement their existing products and services, or expand into new markets. However, M&A transactions are frequently unsuccessful in delivering value to shareholders, with many academic studies finding that between 50-80% of deals fail to generate any meaningful value to shareholders of the acquiring companies.

There are several factors that contribute to the failure of M&A deals to create shareholder value. First, there are often mismatches in corporate cultures between the acquiring and acquired firms. Integrating two distinct company cultures is challenging and can result in power struggles, key employee departures, and loss of productivity. Second, executives often overpay for acquisitions due to overoptimism about potential synergies or rivalry from other bidders. Overpayment reduces the financial returns of a deal and makes it harder to generate shareholder value. 

Third, integration of the two companies is often poorly managed. Effective post-merger integration requires aligning incentives, streamlining overlapping functions, and leveraging synergies across the combined firm. This is difficult to achieve in practice due to complexity and politics. Finally, regulator intervention can reduce the potential synergies and benefits of a merger. Regulators may require divestitures or place restrictions on the merged firm to maintain competition, limiting upside for shareholders.

The outcomes of M&A deals are also heavily influenced by differences in ownership structures, corporate governance, and legal frameworks across countries. In countries with weaker investor protections, founding families and large blockholders typically have more control over firms and M&A decisions may primarily benefit controlling shareholders rather than minority investors. In contrast, dispersed ownership and stronger legal protections for minority shareholders in the U.S. and U.K. aim to generate value for all investors from M&A.

Board oversight and independence also varies significantly across countries. Boards are more independent and activist in the U.S., closely scrutinizing M&A deals to ensure shareholder interests are prioritized. In comparison, board members in some Asian and European countries may be less independent, and more easily influenced by dominant family shareholders or CEOs to approve value-destroying deals.

In conclusion, while M&A is a popular strategy for company growth, there are several reasons why mergers frequently fail to generate meaningful value for shareholders. Differences in ownership structures, governance mechanisms, and legal regimes across the world further contribute to varying outcomes of M&A transactions in different countries. With more effective deal evaluation, negotiation, and post-merger integration, combined with appropriate board oversight, M&A can better achieve its goal of enhancing long-term shareholder value.
