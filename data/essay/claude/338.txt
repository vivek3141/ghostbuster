The recommended strategy for minimising production costs in the yarn manufacturing division involves determining the optimal production level of each yarn to maximise profit. This can be achieved using the linear programming technique.
 Linear programming uses mathematical models to determine the optimal solution to a problem within certain constraints. In yarn manufacturing, the constraints include limits on the raw materials available, production capacity, and worker hours. The goal  is to maximise profit per unit of each yarn produced. By maximising profit across all production, total profit for the division can be optimised. 

To determine the optimal production level for each yarn, the division must first identify the profit per unit, production costs per unit, demand forecast, and relevant constraints for each yarn type. The linear programming model can then calculate the optimal combination of yarn amounts that will generate the maximum profit under the specified constraints. Often an iterative approach is used, testing different combinations and revising the amounts for each yarn until an optimal solution is found.

Using this approach, the yarn division can determine how much of each yarn type to produce to maximise profit for the division as a whole. The optimal combination of yarn amounts essentially provides a production recipe to follow. As long as raw materials, production capacity, worker hours, and other constraints are not exceeded, following the recommended amounts for each yarn type will result in the lowest production costs and highest profit margin for the division. 

In summary, by framing the yarn production scenario as a linear programming problem with the goal of maximising profit under certain constraints, the optimal production strategy for minimising costs can be determined through an iterative calculation process. The result is an ideal combination of production amounts for each yarn to optimise overall profitability. Using this strategy, the yarn manufacturing division can confidently achieve and sustain the lowest possible production costs relative to revenue and profit targets.
