The Model of Human Occupation (MOHO) was developed by Gary Kielhofner and colleagues to provide a conceptual framework for understanding human occupation and how it is motivated, patterned, and performed. MOHO examines the interaction between a person and their environment and how that interaction influences occupational participation. 

For Greg, the MOHO was used to develop an occupational therapy intervention plan that considered his volition, habituation, performance capacity and environmental context. Greg's volition, or motivation for participating in occupations, was assessed by discussing meaningful activities with him and determining what he wanted to achieve in therapy. His habituation, or the habits, routines and roles he has developed over time, was also evaluated through interview and observation. Evaluating Greg's performance capacity, including his physical, cognitive and mental abilities, involved assessing range of motion, strength, attention span and other factors that could impact what occupations he could do and his success with interventions. Finally, Greg's environmental context, including cultural, social and physical aspects, was assessed to determine potential barriers or supports for occupational participation.

Greg was actively involved in the goal setting process. His long term goals included improving mobility, endurance and independence so he could travel again, cook for himself and maintain his home. Short term goals were developed collaboratively based on MOHO assessments to work towards these long term goals through specific interventions focused around occupation-based activities meaningful to Greg's roles and routines. Interventions included seated range of motion and strength exercises, balance activities, cognitive exercises to improve attention span and strategies for break down complex tasks.

Greg's Muslim faith and Saudi Arabian background were considered for their potential impact on intervention. Accommodations were made for prayer times and periods of fasting during Ramadan. Greg's cultural views on gender roles and ideas of independence and self-sufficiency were also respected in developing goals and choosing intervention activities. Relevant legal and policy documents, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines, Americans with Disabilities Act and Practice Framework for Occupational Therapy, were followed to ensure Greg's safety, access and appropriate care.

In summary, the MOHO model provided a framework for understanding Greg's motivation and capacity for occupation so collaborative intervention goals could be set and tailored to his needs, beliefs and priorities. Greg's active participation in the process helped ensure goals and interventions were meaningful, relevant and sensitive to his cultural and religious context. Legal and policy documents impacted implementation of Greg's care by promoting accessibility, safety, and best practices. Using this combination of concepts and guidelines, an occupational therapy intervention was developed to optimize Greg's occupational participation and well-being.
