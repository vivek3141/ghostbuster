Evaluate the case for reform of Britain's law on industrial actions, especially in terms of the right of strike and the right of secondary action, using the Gate Gourmet dispute as a case study. 

Britain's laws on industrial action, specifically the right to strike and take secondary action, are in need of reform. The current laws unduly restrict workers' ability to take action in disputes with their employers and promote inequality in the balance of power between employers and trade unions. The 2005 Gate Gourmet dispute at Heathrow Airport illustrates how the existing laws frustrate reasonable and justifiable collective action by workers. Reforms that expand the legal scope for strikes and secondary action would help address the current imbalance while still protecting the wider public and national interest.

Under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, workers in Britain have a right to strike, but it is subject to a number of restrictions. Strikes are only lawful if they are "in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute" and if a proper ballot of members has been held. Secondary action, such as sympathy strikes in support of other workers, is almost entirely prohibited. The laws aim to limit disruption to economic activity from industrial action, but critics argue they go too far and undermine workers' basic rights. The Gate Gourmet dispute demonstrates how these restrictions can prevent legally questionable but morally justified industrial action.

In August 2005, Gate Gourmet, which provides in-flight catering services, sacked over 600 employees at Heathrow Airport after workers took unofficial action over the company’s plans to cut wages and change shift patterns. The workers claimed Gate Gourmet had reneged on a previous agreement and was treating them unfairly. However, because the action was not officially balloted, it was unlawful. The Transport and General Workers Union (T&G) argued that balloting was impossible given the speed with which Gate Gourmet acted and the fact many of the workers were immigrants with limited English. But under the current law, the lack of ballot made the strike illegal regardless of the moral factors.

The dispute escalated as British Airways (BA) baggage handlers, who were T&G members, refused to cross the Gate Gourmet picket line in a show of solidarity. Again, this secondary action was unlawful, even though the baggage handlers were directly affected by Gate Gourmet’s actions. The refusal of BA staff to work led to flight cancellations and chaos at Heathrow. The media condemned the ‘wildcat’ strike and its disruption, pressuring the T&G to resolve the dispute. 

Faced with unlawful industrial action and media hostility, the T&G was unable to support its members adequately. Gate Gourmet ultimately reinstated only a fraction of the sacked workers, on worse terms and conditions. The outcome showed the union was powerless in the face of unjustified but lawful managerial action and unable to take reasonable responsive action of its own within the law. The dispute encapsulates how Britain’s industrial relations laws are unbalanced in favor of employers over trade unions and workers. Reasonable, morally justifiable action can be prevented and even criminalized.

In conclusion, Britain’s laws on industrial action require reform to rebalance power between employers and trade unions and uphold basic worker rights. Relaxing balloting rules and permitting more secondary action would allow for reasonable responsive industrial action in disputes like Gate Gourmet, while still protecting against unjustified widespread disruption. The role of trade unions as workers’ representatives depends on their legal ability to take collective action, while responsibly and for just cause. The current law fails to sufficiently enable and respect that role. Reforms to expand lawful strike action and end the outright ban on secondary action would therefore be both fair and prudent. Overall, Britain’s longer-term economic health and industrial relations depend on a equitable and progressive legal framework for collective action by workers.
