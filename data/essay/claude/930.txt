The views of two hypothetical young, white, and middle class informants, Mark and Jessica, on gender and its socially constructed nature can be explored as follows: 

Mark, a 25-year-old male, holds largely traditional views on gender roles and expectations. He believes that men and women have certain natural tendencies and abilities that make them suited for specific and different social roles. For example, he thinks that women are naturally more nurturing and caring, making them better suited as primary caregivers for children. Meanwhile, he believes that men are naturally more assertive and ambitious, making them better suited as leaders in the workplace and community. 

Mark acknowledges that some aspects of gender are socially constructed, but he believes that biology is primarily responsible for determining gender roles and that society should uphold traditional expectations. For example, while he recognizes that certain behaviors like interests or fashion choices are shaped by the environment, he thinks that fundamental qualities like women’s empathy or men’s leadership abilities are inherent. He believes it is important for society to encourage men and women to fulfill these natural and traditional roles, rather than try to challenge them. Overall, Mark’s views largely conform to and support traditional gender stereotypes and norms.

In contrast, Jessica, a 23-year-old female, holds views that significantly challenge traditional gender roles and expectations. She believes that the majority of differences between men and women are socially constructed, not biologically determined. For example, she recognizes that society shapes and encourages young boys and girls to exhibit certain behaviors from an early age based on their gender. Over time, these gendered social interactions and expectations become so entrenched that people mistake them as natural or inherent.  

Jessica argues that gender roles are limiting and that people should be free to pursue whatever interests, behaviors, and social roles they choose, regardless of their gender. She believes that gender equality and more fluid understandings of gender will benefit both individuals and society as a whole. While Jessica does not deny that some biological sex differences may exist, she thinks that culture and environment are most responsible for shaping individuals and that people should not feel confined by traditional gender stereotypes. Overall, Jessica’s views challenge traditional notions of gender and conform more to contemporary concepts of gender as a social construct.

In summary, while Mark holds largely traditional views of gender that conform to stereotypical roles and expectations, Jessica holds more progressive views that challenge these traditional roles and see gender as primarily socially constructed and as something that should not limit people or society. The differing views of these two hypothetical informants illustrate some of the ongoing debates around gender and the tension between traditional and more contemporary concepts of gender.
