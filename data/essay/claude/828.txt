Stylistic devices, like sound effects and intertextuality, are powerful tools that poets employ to develop characters and convey themes in their works. By creating rhythm and musicality with sound effects, poets invite the reader into the cadence and flow of the poem. References to other texts through intertextuality situate the poem in a broader tradition, allowing poets to build on common cultural themes and symbolism.  

In the poem "Would Not Take a Statute" by the South African poet Mongane Wally Serote, sound effects highlight and strengthen the defiant and determined voice of the speaker. The repetition of "would not" in each line reinforces the speaker's conviction and refusal to be constrained by the law. The assonance - the repetition of vowel sounds within words - of "statute" and "shut" connects the themes of being closed in and limited. These effects give rhythm to the poem and emphasize important words, crafting a melodic quality that stays with the reader. The speaker's rebellious spirit is made memorable through these poetic devices. 

Intertextuality is used in Serote's poem through implicit references to apartheid laws that curtailed the freedoms of black South Africans. Although not directly named, these unjust laws are evoked through the idea of statutes that "fetter" and "shackle." This gives broader context about the time period and its challenges, which shaped the speaker's determined mindset. By drawing on the larger cultural experiences of oppression and racial segregation, the poem takes on greater significance and poignancy. The intertextuality of referencing apartheid enhances the portrayal of the speaker's character and reinforces the poem's themes of resistance and breaking free from bondage.

In conclusion, the poetic devices of sound effects and intertextuality are powerful ways to develop a character and explore themes in a poem. Serote's "Would Not Take a Statute" demonstrates how these tools can be used to give a voice to a persona, highlight their attributes, and link their experiences to broader historical and social contexts. The compelling voice of the speaker is crafted through the repetition and rhythm of sound effects, and given poignancy by implicit references to the injustices of apartheid. These elements work together to create a persona readers will not soon forget.
