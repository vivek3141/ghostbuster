To fully evaluate the effects of Drug A and Drug B on blood pressure in patients, additional information is needed beyond a basic comparison of average blood pressure changes. Some key factors that would need to be accounted for include:

Patient demographics and characteristics. The patient population can significantly impact results and needs to be well-defined. Important characteristics include age, gender, ethnicity, weight, pre-existing conditions, and baseline blood pressure levels. Drugs can have differential effects based on these attributes. For example, a drug may lower blood pressure more in older or obese patients.  

Dosage amount and administration. The specific dosage of each drug and how it is administered can also affect blood pressure outcomes. Higher doses may produce greater changes, and the method of administration like oral vs. intravenous can impact absorption and metabolism. These details need to be standardized or clearly reported.

Length of treatment. Blood pressure effects can change over time with continuous use of a drug. Pressure may decrease more over longer treatment periods as the body adjusts or side effects emerge. The duration of each trial, and measurements at multiple time points, should be specified.

Adherence and dropout rates. Patient compliance with the drug regimen and completion of the trial are important. Non-adherence can underestimate the effects, while dropouts can skew results if certain types of patients are more prone to dropping out. Attrition rates and measures to promote compliance should be reported.   

Placebo and blinding effects. Use of placebo control groups and blinding are important to account for psychological and other effects. Failure to properly employ these techniques may lead to overestimation of drug impacts or biased results. Details on the placebo composition and blinding procedures should be noted.   

Confounding variables. Other factors like diet changes, exercise, stress levels, or additional medications may also affect blood pressure and confuse the results if not properly controlled for. These potential confounding variables should be measured, reported, and ideally minimized or standardized.  

In summary, evaluating the effects of medications or other interventions on complex outcomes like blood pressure requires a holistic view of the trial that accounts for the many influences on the results. By measuring key demographic, procedural, and confounding factors, the impact of the actual drugs or treatments under study can be better isolated and understood. The same is true when analyzing relationships that involve complex, interdependent variables, as with ship crew to tonnage ratios or city rainfall and sunlight patterns. Simply comparing averages will not yield a meaningful understanding of the effects. Additional data and a broad consideration of the overall system and trial design are required.
