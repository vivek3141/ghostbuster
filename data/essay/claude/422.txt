Shell Oil Company has adopted a version of the stakeholder theory framework to guide its corporate governance strategy. Stakeholder theory posits that corporations should serve the interests of all parties who have a stake in the company, not just shareholders. This includes employees, customers, suppliers, local communities, and society as a whole. By considering all stakeholders, companies can make more balanced and ethical business decisions that create long-term shared value.

Shell has adopted a stakeholder approach in several ways. It has established sustainability as one of its five core business principles, signaling that environmental and social impacts are just as important as financial performance. It has established environmental and social performance standards,  and tracks its performance across key metrics related to safety, environment, communities, and human rights. Shell explicitly considers the interests of multiple stakeholders in strategic planning and investment decision making. It also engages with stakeholder groups through dialogue and partnership. For example, Shell works with local community groups, NGOs, and governments on topics such as economic development, education, and biodiversity protection in the areas where it operates. 

While Shellâ€™s stakeholder theory approach is admirable, critics argue it has shortcomings in implementation. There is a lack of transparency around exactly how Shell balances stakeholder interests with its drive to maximize shareholder returns. Its environmental and social policies have been criticized as weak, and the company still faces accusations of environmental damage, human rights abuses, and greenwashing. There is also little evidence that Shell provides local communities with more than superficial influence over company decisions that profoundly affect them.

In conclusion, Shell has made progress by explicitly adopting a stakeholder theory framework, but still has significant work to do to address shortcomings in how that translates into practice. To be an effective corporate governance strategy, stakeholder theory must be more than just rhetoric - it requires creating meaningful partnerships, ceding some real control to communities, and backing up policies with transparent action and accountability. Overall, Shell is moving in the right direction but has not yet arrived at a model of true shared value creation.
