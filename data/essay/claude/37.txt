The theory of memes proposes that cultural information, ideas, and behaviors spread and evolve in a way analogous to the evolution of genes. The biologist Richard Dawkins coined the term ‘meme’ in 1976 to describe how cultural information is transmitted between individuals, groups, and across generations. The psychologist Susan Blackmore extended Dawkins' idea and proposed that memes explained aspects of human evolution like the development of language, altruism, and increased brain size in humans. According to Blackmore's memetic theory, our minds are selves are collections of interacting memes that have evolved over many generations through a process of variation, selection, and retention. In other words, memes that are more successful at getting copied and spread will get selected and passed on, while unsuccessful memes will die out.

Memes include ideas, songs, stories, theories, fashions, inventions, and all forms of cultural information that spread from person to person by imitation. Blackmore argues that memes shaped the evolution of unique human traits like language. As memes competed to get copied, this drove the development of more sophisticated communication abilities in humans to spread memes more effectively. In turn, the spread of language memes further accelerated the spread and evolution of additional memes. This co-evolution of language and memes eventually gave rise to features like grammar, complex syntax, and large vocabularies that enabled efficient transmission of memes.

Altruism also evolved through memetic selection, according to Blackmore. Memes that encouraged cooperation, generosity, and altruism towards others would spread more effectively because groups with more of these memes would outcompete other groups. As a result, ‘memeplexes’ of compatible memes, like religions, often promote altruism and cooperation. Over generations, humans have developed cognitive mechanisms for empathy, theory of mind, and moral reasoning to spread altruism memes.

The human brain also increased in size and complexity due to the competition between memes, Blackmore argues. As memes became more sophisticated, larger brains with greater cognitive capacities were selected because they were better able to acquire, store, and spread memes. Selection pressure from memes favored traits for cultural learning, language, long-term memory, and abstract reasoning. In this way, an 'arms race' between memes led to the evolution of the large, powerful human brain. 

However, Blackmore's memetic theory of evolution has been criticized on several grounds. First, memetic evolution may not actually mirror genetic evolution closely enough for the analogy to hold. Memes spread horizontally between contemporaries and across generations, not just vertically from parent to offspring like genes. Memes also spread through high-fidelity copying as well as mutation, unlike blind variation in genetics. Some argue that memes change too quickly and spread too broadly to drive stable, long-term changes in human evolution.

Second, Blackmore's theory relies too heavily on adaptationism—the idea that every feature must have an evolutionary purpose. Critics argue that many aspects of human cognition, language, altruism, and brain size can emerge from interactions between simpler mechanisms without memetic selection pressure. Memes themselves may be byproducts of other evolved features rather than adaptations. Blackmore also fails to specify the mechanisms by which memes influence genetics and vice versa. Without a clear account of how memes can drive genetic changes over generations, the co-evolution of memes and genes seems implausible.

In conclusion, while Blackmore's memetic theory of human evolution is creative and thought-provoking, it does not seem entirely convincing without addressing these substantial criticisms. Memes likely spread and evolve differently from genes in ways that prevent close analogy. And many complex human traits that Blackmore attributes to memetic selection may have simpler explanations or emerge from the interaction of other cognitive mechanisms. Overall, memes probably supplement rather than broadly define human evolution, contrary to Blackmore's ambitious memetic model of the selfish self.
