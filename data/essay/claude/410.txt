The rapid industrialization of Russia in the decades leading up to World War I contributed significantly to the rise of radicalism in the Russian labor movement. Several factors intertwined to radicalize Russian workers during this period. First, the harsh conditions of industrial work and urban life led to widespread grievances among workers. Second, Marxism gained influence among labor activists and intellectuals, promoting a radical critique of capitalism and envisioning a socialist system to replace it. Third, the repressive policies of the Tsarist government further angered workers and pushed many to embrace radical ideologies that opposed the monarchy. 

Russia industrialized rapidly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, following the emancipation of the serfs in 1861. Millions of peasants migrated to cities and took jobs in factories, mines, and mills. However, urban living conditions were terrible, with crowded, unsanitary housing and lack of social services. Factory work was difficult and dangerous, with long hours, low pay, and abusive management. These dire circumstances led to widespread grievances that fueled radical sentiments.

At the same time, Marxism spread among labor activists and revolutionary intellectuals. Marxism provided a radical critique of capitalism as an exploitative system and envisioned a socialist system with common ownership of property and an egalitarian distribution of resources. Marxism inspired hopes for a total transformation of society among segments of the Russian working class. Revolutionary organizations like the Bolsheviks promoted Marxist doctrines and recruited from the ranks of radicalized workers.

The repressive Tsarist autocracy also contributed to the radicalization of labor. The Tsars brutally suppressed dissent and denied citizens basic civil liberties and political representation. Peaceful protests were often met with violence from the authorities. This repression angered workers and led many to support radical groups that sought to overthrow the Tsarist system altogether. The failure of the 1905 Revolution, and the violent crackdown that followed, further disillusioned moderates and swelled the ranks of radical revolutionaries.

In conclusion, the harsh realities of industrial life, the spread of Marxism, and political repression by the Tsarist government were the primary factors that contributed to the radicalization of the Russian labor movement before 1914. While rapid industrialization spurred economic growth, it also led to deteriorating conditions for workers that bred deep resentment of the social order. Radical ideologies provided an outlet for those grievances and a vision for revolutionary change. This volatile combination of circumstances made the Russian working class a prime audience for radical calls to overturn capitalism and the Tsarist system through mass mobilization and violent revolution.
