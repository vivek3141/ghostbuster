Qualitative research is an important methodology for exploring complex social phenomena. However, there is an ongoing debate about whether qualitative research can achieve reliability and validity—two key measures of research quality that traditionally arose from quantitative research methodology. If we apply quantitative notions of reliability and validity to qualitative research, it may seem that qualitative studies can never achieve high standards of quality. However, qualitative research should be evaluated on its own terms using alternative criteria that are suited to its interpretive paradigm. 

Reliability refers to the consistency and repeatability of research findings. In quantitative research, reliability means that the same results would be obtained if the study were repeated multiple times. Qualitative research, on the other hand, aims to explore complex social experiences that are context-dependent. The same study repeated in a different place and time would likely yield different results due to changes in the research context. Therefore, qualitative researchers aim instead for “dependability”—ensuring that the research process is logical, traceable, and documented. Techniques like data triangulation, researcher reflexivity, and maintaining an audit trail can establish dependability.

Validity refers to the accuracy of research findings and whether they represent the social realities being studied. For qualitative research, “credibility” is a more suitable criterion than validity. Credibility means ensuring that the research findings reflect the actual experiences of participants. Techniques like member checking, thick description, and peer debriefing can enhance credibility. These techniques tap into the perspectives and interpretations of participants themselves to determine if the research findings resonate with their experiences. 

While qualitative research cannot achieve reliability and validity in the traditional sense, it can meet high standards of quality through alternative evaluative criteria that are well suited to its epistemological paradigm. Dependability and credibility are two key criteria that can be used to judge the quality and trustworthiness of qualitative research. By employing techniques such as data triangulation, researcher reflexivity, member checking, and thick description, qualitative research can generate convincing and authentic findings to make important contributions in the social sciences. The debate should move beyond questions of whether qualitative research can achieve reliability and validity, and instead focus on how high qualitative research standards should be established and evaluated on their own terms.
