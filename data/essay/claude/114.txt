Quaternions: Exploring Rotations in Four Dimensions and Division Algebras

Quaternions are a mathematical construct that extends the familiar real and complex number systems into four dimensions. Unlike the real and complex numbers, quaternions form a noncommutative division algebra, meaning that multiplication is not commutative and nonzero quaternions have multiplicative inverses. Quaternions were first described by William Rowan Hamilton in 1843 and have many interesting properties relating to rotations in four-dimensional space. They are foundational for understanding geometry and hyperdimensional objects beyond the three spatial dimensions we observe in the physical world.

Quaternions consist of four components: a real scalar part and three imaginary vector parts. They take the form q = w + xi + yj + zk, where w, x, y and z are real numbers and i, j and k are imaginary units satisfying i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = −1. Due to their inclusion of these imaginary units, quaternions extend into a four-dimensional space. However, unlike the coordinates of four-dimensional space-time in special relativity for example, the four quaternion components belong to a non-Euclidean four-dimensional space. Quaternions are a mathematical construct in their own right, not tied to any particular physical reality.

Despite including imaginary units, quaternions are a division algebra, meaning nonzero quaternions have multiplicative inverses. This property arises from the particular multiplication rules that were defined for quaternions, which cause their imaginary units i, j and k to anti-commute, meaning ijk = −1. The multiplication of quaternions is not commutative, meaning the order of terms matters, unlike multiplication of real or complex numbers. For example, ij ≠ ji for quaternions. The noncommutative and division algebra properties are closely linked, as shown in proofs by Frobenius and Hurwitz. These proofs showed that among normed division algebras over the real numbers, the only possibilities are the real numbers themselves, complex numbers, quaternions, and perhaps one other algebra of dimension 16—though a 16-dimensional division algebra has never been constructed. The impossibility of constructing any other normed division algebras over the reals was a startling mathematical discovery.  

The noncommutative multiplication of quaternions leads to their powerful application for representing rotations in four-dimensional space. In three dimensions, any rotation can be achieved by an angle θ around a unit vector n̂. In a similar fashion, quaternions can represent rotations in four dimensions with two parameters: an angle θ and a unit quaternion q̂. By multiplying a quaternion vector v by a unit quaternion q̂, the rotated vector v′ is obtained: v′ = q̂vq̂−1. Geometrically, the product q̂vq̂−1 represents a rotation of v about the 4-axis defined by q̂. This is a generalization of the familiar 3D rotation formula using an axis-angle representation. Quaternions are said to give an "algebraic geometry" to four-dimensional space.

The properties of quaternions and their representations of 4D rotations lead to many intriguing results. For example, while a rotation in 3D space requires an angle between 0 and π radians to return an object to its original orientation, in 4D space a rotation of 4π radians is required. Also, the sphere in 4D space that corresponds to all unit quaternions has three separate "hemispheres" corresponding to rotations, instead of the two hemispheres of the 3-sphere. Visualizing these hyper-spheres and hyper-rotations requires mathematical abstraction that can twist the mind.

Quaternions find many applications in geometry, physics, engineering, and computer graphics. To represent 3D rotations, quaternions have advantages over other representations like Euler angles or rotation matrices. They are more numerically stable, compact, and suited for interpolation and composition. For these reasons, quaternions are commonly used in computer animation and virtual reality software for modeling motion and orientation. They also appear in control systems, spacecraft dynamics, and orbital mechanics due to their utility in tracking moving coordinate systems. 

In conclusion, quaternions are a fascinating mathematical system that extends the real and complex numbers into four-dimensional space. They possess a noncommutative multiplication and form a division algebra, properties which were proven impossible for any other number system to have. Quaternions elegantly represent rotations in four dimensions and enable a geometric interpretation of 4D space. With their many interesting properties and applications, quaternions continue to intrigue mathematicians and physicists even over 150 years after their discovery. They remain a productive area of research and a doorway into understanding hyperspaces beyond our three-dimensional intuition.
