Obtaining a graduate degree in the UK can be an immensely challenging experience for international students, particularly those from China. There are several reasons for this, including differences in cultural and academic norms, gaps in language competence, and difficulties adjusting to an unfamiliar education system. This essay explores these challenges through the case study of a Chinese student currently undertaking an English for Academic Purposes (EAP) course in preparation for a Master's degree in the UK.  

The student in this case study, whom I will call Ling, faces difficulties stemming primarily from differences in cultural and academic expectations between China and the UK. In China, learning is largely by rote and reproduction of knowledge, with less emphasis on critical thinking or argumentation. In contrast, UK universities place a premium on critical analysis, logical reasoning, and forming a persuasive argument supported by evidence. For Ling, this represents an entirely new approach to learning that she is struggling to adopt. There are also differences in terms of academic integrity, with plagiarism treated much more harshly in the UK. Ling has had to modify her approach to incorporate more critical analysis and develop stronger paraphrasing and citation skills to avoid plagiarizing.

Ling's English language proficiency also poses a significant barrier. While she meets the minimum English language requirements to undertake postgraduate study, her speaking and writing skills need further improvement to handle the linguistic demands of a Master's degree. Ling struggles with some aspects of academic writing, such as formulating a thesis statement, organizing her ideas logically, using cohesive devices, and revising and editing her work. The intensive nature of EAP courses means limited time for practice and internalizing new skills. The interim period between the end of this semester and the start of her Master's would benefit from additional opportunities for Ling to strengthen her writing.

There are several implications from Ling's experience. First, EAP courses should incorporate more flexibility to address students' individual needs...  

In conclusion, while Ling has made good progress in her EAP course, there are still challenges to overcome in bridging cultural and academic norms between China and the UK and further improving her English proficiency. A longitudinal study tracking Ling's experience through her Master's degree and beyond would provide valuable insight into how effectively EAP courses prepare international students for postgraduate study in the UK and what additional support they may need during their degree programmes. With continued hard work and perseverance, Ling can overcome these challenges and succeed in her goal of obtaining a UK Master's degree.
