In her chapter 'Mask and Shadow in Japanese Culture: Implicit Ontology in Japanese Thought,' Sakabe Megumi argues that traditional Japanese culture has aimed to recreate a sense of harmony between internal and external reality through the use of masks, shadows, and ritualized movements. 

Sakabe begins by explaining the Japanese concepts of tatemae, one's public stance or fa√ßade, and honne, one's private intentions or true feelings. She argues that in Japanese culture, there is an acceptance that one's inner self is not always accurately reflected in outward behavior and speech. Masks and ritualized polite behavior act as a kind of 'veil' between the inner honne and outer tatemae. For Sakabe, this indicates an 'implicit ontology' in Japanese thought that sees a distinction between inner and outer reality.

Sakabe then analyzes the use of masks in traditional Japanese Noh theater and religious rituals. She argues that the mask acts as a 'medium' between the human actor and the supernatural character or spirit they are trying to embody. The mask transforms the actor by allowing them to leave behind their individuality and 'become' the otherworldly character. The mask transports both the actor and audience into an 'alternative ontological space.' The mask acts as a veil, but also a conduit connecting the natural and supernatural.

Finally, Sakabe examines the use of stylized movement, gestures, and dance in Noh theater and religious ritual. These strictly choreographed movements are meant to evoke feelings or spirits in a precise, evocative manner. Sakabe argues that the dances recreate an 'alternative bodily syntax' that allows participants to achieve a harmony between inner spirit or emotion and outer physical form. The choreographed movements act as a mask for the body, allowing it to represent feelings beyond everyday human expression.

In conclusion, Sakabe presents an analysis of traditional Japanese masks, shadows, and movements as a means for recreating an experience of harmony between surface and depth, interiority and exteriority in Japanese ontology and metaphysics. The masks, dances, and gestures of cultural rituals and theater allow a transcendence of the everyday self, connecting actors and participants to a spiritual or mythical dimension of reality through stylized representation. Overall, this chapter provides insight into implicit philosophical attitudes in pre-modern Japan.
