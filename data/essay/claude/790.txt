Observations of ADHD Family Using Attachment and Developmental Theory 

Attachment theory provides a useful framework for understanding the relationship between a child and their caregivers and the implications of that attachment on psychological and emotional development. According to attachment theory, the relationships we form early in life with our primary caregivers shape our expectations for relationships throughout life and influence our sense of self and our ability to regulate emotions (Bowlby, 1969/1982). In the context of a family attending an ADHD clinic, observing the interactions and relationships between family members through the lens of attachment theory can provide insight into the child’s psychological and social development. 

The first observation involves a single mother and her 12-year-old son, Tom, who was diagnosed with ADHD-Combined Type two years ago. Tom's mother appears very involved in his care and ensuring he receives treatment. However, during interactions with clinicians, Tom often avoids eye contact with his mother and appears hesitant to share information about his challenges and experiences. His mother does most of the talking for him and occasionally speaks over him or answers questions directed at Tom before allowing him to respond. The lack of emotional attunement and space for Tom to share his own experiences suggest an anxious or ambivalent attachment style between Tom and his mother. Anxious or ambivalent attachment early in life may lead to struggles with emotion regulation, low self-esteem, excessive reassurance-seeking, and difficulties establishing autonomy later on (Hazan & Shaver, 1994). For an adolescent with ADHD, these attachment-related impairments may exacerbate symptoms and undermine the development of self-efficacy required to manage the condition.  With treatment, Tom's mother may be supported in allowing him more autonomy and reciprocating his bids for emotional connection to facilitate a healthier attachment relationship through middle and late adolescence.

The second observation involves a married couple, both in their late 30s, and their 8-year-old daughter, Emily, who was recently diagnosed with ADHD-Hyperactive/Impulsive Type. Emily appears restless but also very engaged with her parents, frequently interrupting the discussion to show them objects or tell stories and anecdotes. However, her parents become quickly frustrated with her interruptions, often scolding or ignoring her when she seeks their attention during the session. Although Emily's behavior suggests she feels secure in the attachment relationship with her parents, their frequent dismissal and apparent lack of patience for her emotional needs may lead to insecure attachment styles later on, especially in the hyperactivation pathway (Cassidy & Shaver, 2008). For Emily, this may influence the development of poor self-esteem, emotional instability, and unhealthy relationships as she navigates challenges associated with her ADHD symptoms and transitions through Erikson’s stage of Industry vs. Inferiority (approximately 6-12 years old). With family therapy, Emily’s parents may develop a better understanding of her needs for connection and learn strategies to reciprocate in a healthy way, supporting her socioemotional development despite challenges presented by her ADHD symptoms.

In summary, attachment theory provides a means of conceptualizing the relationships within families seeking treatment for ADHD and implications of attachment security or insecurity on the psychological and emotional development of the child. The observations discussed highlight the importance of the caregiver-child relationship in the management of ADHD symptoms and the possibility of tailoring treatment to meet attachment and developmental needs. By providing psychoeducation and strategies for caregivers to strengthen the attachment relationship, clinicians may better support the long-term wellbeing of children and adolescents with ADHD.
