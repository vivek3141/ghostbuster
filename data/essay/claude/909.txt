A PESTE analysis is a tool used to analyze the macro-environmental factors that can impact a business. PESTE stands for Political, Economic, Social, Technological, and Environmental. Conducting a PESTE analysis helps a business understand the external forces of change that may affect its strategy and operations. 

Kirtlington Golf Club Restaurant can use a PESTE analysis to anticipate and plan for changes in the broader environment. On the political front, changes in legislation such as food safety, employment, or liquor licensing laws can impact operations. Economically, factors like inflation, exchange rates, disposable income levels, and broader economic growth or decline can influence customer demand and costs. 

Socially, changing customer tastes, health trends, and demographic changes shape what and how people eat and drink. An aging population or increasing interest in healthy, organic, and sustainably-sourced food are examples of social trends that could impact Kirtlington Golf Club Restaurant. Technologically, innovations such as online booking platforms, electronic payment systems, social media, and new kitchen technologies provide both opportunities and threats that must be monitored.

Environmentally, factors such as waste management legislation and the availability of ingredients can impact a restaurant's costs and menu options. Conducting a PESTE analysis helps Kirtlington Golf Club Restaurant identify and plan for these macro-environmental changes and trends to gain a competitive advantage.

A customer audit trail tracks a customer's experience with a company to identify areas of good service and potential improvement.
