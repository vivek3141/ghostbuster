The poems "Her First Week" by Sylvia Plath and "The Spirit is too Blunt an Instrument" by Emily Dickinson explore themes of death, loss, and the human condition through their distinctive use of pronouns, lexis, and grammatical structure. By analyzing these facets of the two poems, we can gain insight into how they construct different perspectives and themes. 

In "Her First Week," Plath adopts an extruded, detached perspective through her choice of pronouns and grammatical structure. The poem is written in tight terse verse with little embellishment or complexity in its grammatical structure, reflecting the emotionally stunted nature of the speaker. The consistent use of the third-person pronoun "she" and possessive pronoun "her" creates distance between the speaker's perspective and the mother, who is the subject of the poem. The mother is objectified through this choice of pronouns, highlighting the speaker's inability to connect with the mother on an emotional level.

In contrast, Dickinson's pronoun choice in "The Spirit is too Blunt an Instrument" establishes a deeply personal perspective. Her use of the first-person singular pronoun "I" brings the reader into the speaker's intimate mental experience. This choice of pronoun, combined with the poem's loose hymn-like grammatical structure, creates the sense that we have been given access into the unfiltered workings of the speaker's mind. The effect is a raw portrayal of the speaker's personal grappling with profound questions about human consciousness and spirituality.

Both poets employ specific lexis to further their poems' themes and perspectives. Plath's use of clinical and banal language in "Her First Week" reinforces the detached tone and themes of loss of identity. References to "germs," "sterilized sealed bags," "thermometers," and "clocks" construct the cold and impersonal setting of a hospital, reflecting the mother's loss of self to her infant. The repetitive lexis referring to crying, feeding and sleeping in a "two hour rotation" also highlights this loss of identity and autonomy.

In contrast, Dickinson's use of abstract and esoteric lexis in "The Spirit is too Blunt an Instrument" highlights the metaphysical nature of the concepts she is exploring. Words like "soul," "chaos," "heaven," "infinity," "mortal," and "immortal" give the poem a metaphysical flavor and craft the philosophical perspective of human existence and spirituality. The weird collocations of "colorless" and "owls" also create a dreamy quality that invites speculation.

In conclusion, while Plath and Dickinson's poems share themes of death, loss and the human condition, they adopt very different perspectives through their strategic and distinct use of pronouns, lexis, and grammatical structure. "Her First Week" employs an extruded perspective to explore loss of identity and self through motherhood, whereas "The Spirit is too Blunt an Instrument" crafts an intimate perspective to speculate on profound metaphysical questions about human consciousness and spirituality. By analyzing these aspects of the two poems, we gain insight into the nuanced ways they construct meaning and explore common themes.
