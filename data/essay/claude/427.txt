The traditional ABC system has several significant weaknesses in its application to modern business environments. The ABC system, or Activity-Based Costing, allocates costs to products and services based on the activities and resources used. However, it relies on subjective estimates and arbitrary allocations of overhead costs. It also tends to focus too narrowly on short-term, direct costs rather than the full costs to serve different customers over their lifetimes.  

Alternative approaches like customer lifetime value (CLV) analysis provide a more comprehensive and strategic view of customer profitability. The CLV approach considers the net present value of the total costs to acquire and maintain a customer relationship over time. It provides a forward-looking view of the future revenue potential of serving customers through different channels. However, implementing CLV analysis requires significant investment in data infrastructure and may face organizational resistance. The long-term, theoretical nature of CLV projections may clash with a short-term, transactional culture and mindset. Executives and managers may be unwilling to change existing ABC systems without strong evidence of the benefits.

A/B testing of different customer experience strategies is another approach that can provide concrete evidence to build internal support for new methods. By testing the results of different strategies on live customers, companies can determine optimal approaches to maximize CLV and overall market share. However, effective A/B testing requires scale and access to customer data that may not suit smaller organizations. There are also risks of poor test design, incorrectly interpreting results, and allocating too many resources to testing rather than implementation.

In summary, while the traditional ABC system has weaknesses for today's competitive environments, alternative approaches each have their own costs and risks. Organizations should evaluate options based on their unique culture, capabilities, and competitive positions. A combination of methods, such as using CLV to set strategic direction and A/B testing to optimize implementation, may provide the best results. With the right approach, companies can gain a much clearer and actionable view of what drives customer profitability and market share.
