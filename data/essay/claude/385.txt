Modernism arose in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a cultural movement that broke with traditional societal norms and aesthetic conventions. It developed in response to rapid industrialization and technological change in Western society that resulted in widespread feelings of uncertainty, alienation, and fragmentation. Modernist philosophy rejected Enlightenment notions of subjective certainty and a meaningful, orderly universe, instead embracing relativism, ambiguity, and subjectivity. 

Art forms such as literature, visual art, architecture, and music began emphasizing experimental forms and styles. Modernist works reflected the dislocation felt by many in the modern world by fragmenting familiar forms and utilizing unfamiliar aesthetics and nonlinear narratives. For example, the 1927 film Metropolis, directed by Fritz Lang, depicted the dehumanization of workers in a futuristic urban dystopia. The sophisticated set design and visuals embodied the machine age with itsencased workers marching in synchronized movements. The film conveyed fears of how technology could strengthen the control of institutions over individuals, a common modernist theme regarding industrialization.

The 1920 film Lola Lola similarly used Freudian symbolism and Expressionist set design to explore themes of sexual repression,seduction, and power dynamics between genders in Weimar society. The provocative portrayal ofthe femme fatale Lola and the emotional conflicts felt by her surrounding men reflected concerns over female sexuality threatening traditional male authority that were prevalent in early 20thcentury modern thought.

Philosophically, modernism was influenced by thinkers like Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, and Einstein, who argued that reality is shaped by social and psychological forces, rather than being objectively "true." Marxism in particular, with its critique of capitalism and call for radical social change, shaped modernist desires to radically change Western cultural forms and institutions. At its core, modernism reflected a rejection of bourgeois liberalism and a desire to reimagine society in the wake of World War 1's immense destruction. 

However, modernism's experimental and radical nature also made it elitist and inaccessible to many. Its open rejection of traditional values and aesthetics alienated some who saw modernism as a threat to social cohesion and morality. Viewed critically, modernism reflected the anxieties and rootlessness of the postwar period more than a viable or cohesive vision for cultural progress. 

In conclusion, modernism was a diverse cultural movement that rejected Enlightenment and Victorian ideals, embracing relativism and surrealism to reflect the anxieties of the postwar, industrial era. Through radical experiments in art, architecture, literature, and philosophy, modernism sought to reimagine cultural forms to match the disorienting experiences of modernity. However, its radical vision proved inaccessible and threatening to many, limiting its potential as a force for lasting social change. Modernism reflected the turbulent uncertainties of its time, for better and for worse.
