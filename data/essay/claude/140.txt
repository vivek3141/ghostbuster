The Christian crusades of the Middle Ages were wars that sought to capture Jerusalem and other holy sites from Muslim control. On the surface, the violence and bloodshed of the crusades seemed  contradictory to the teachings of Christianity, which emphasized peace, love, forgiveness. However, the Christian Church was able to justify the crusades to believers using several arguments.

First, the Church framed the crusades as defensive wars to protect Christians and Christianity. Church leaders argued that Muslim conquests of formerly Christian territories like Jerusalem and parts of the Byzantine Empire posed an existential threat. By conquering more territory, the Muslims were oppressing and persecuting Christians. Therefore, the crusades were positioned as necessary to defend Christians and protect the Christian faith. This argument resonated with many Christians who felt surrounded and threatened by expanding Muslim rule.

Second, the Church claimed that the crusades would grant spiritual rewards to participants. Pope Urban II promised crusaders they would have all their sins forgiven if they went on crusade. Crusading was equated with pilgrimage, and participants believed they were following in the footsteps of Christ by journeying to Jerusalem. The crusades were imbued with religious meaning that made the wars an act of penance and devotion for Christians. This logic helped reconcile crusading with Christian teachings around forgiveness of sins and eternal life.

Third, the crusades were framed as "just wars" waged for a just cause with the right intentions. The Church argued that fighting to capture Jerusalem and defend Christians was morally justified according to Christian theology around just war. Leaders like St. Augustine had argued that war could be justified if the cause was just and the intention pure. The crusaders saw themselves as having a just cause (protecting Christendom and Christianity) and right intentions (expressing devotion to God). This argument was more theological but still resonated with some Christian thinkers.  

In conclusion, the medieval Church was able to justify the crusades by characterizing them as defensive wars, a path to spiritual salvation, and morally just according to theological principles around just war. Although the violence of the crusades seemed to contradict the Christian message of peace and forgiveness, the Church successfully made arguments that persuaded Christians the crusades could be reconciled with their faith. The crusades highlight the ways in which religious institutions can justify violence through rhetoric and theology.
