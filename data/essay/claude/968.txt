Rapid urbanization in less economically developed countries has led to major social, economic and environmental issues. As populations shift from rural to urban areas, cities struggle to provide basic resources and infrastructure to meet the needs of the increasing population. Globalization has exacerbated income inequalities in cities, contributing to the growth of slums and poor living conditions for much of the urban population in the developing world.  

A major social issue arising from rapid urbanization in the developing world is the growth of slums and extreme poverty. As people migrate to cities at a pace that outstrips the growth of jobs and affordable housing, many end up in slum settlements that lack access to clean water, sanitation, and other basic services. Inequalities are rife in globalized cities, where economic growth concentrates opportunity and wealth in certain industries and areas of cities. This disproportionately impacts young, unskilled migrants from rural areas, who make up much of the population in informal settlements.   

Rapid urban population growth also strains resources and services in cities. Essential infrastructure like water supply, sewage and waste disposal, healthcare and education cannot expand quickly enough to meet demand. This results in shortages of clean water, lack of access to healthcare and education, and poor sanitation - conditions which pose health and safety risks to all city residents. Although governments aim to provide universal access to these key resources and services, population growth outpaces these efforts, especially in informal settlements.   

Urbanization also has significant environmental consequences, including issues such as water scarcity, air pollution, waste management issues and loss of agricultural land. As cities expand outwards and the population grows, the surrounding agricultural land and ecosystems come under threat. Waste generation increases dramatically with city populations but waste collection cannot keep up, leading to clogging of waterways and spread of disease. Vehicular traffic and industrialization also increase air and water pollution in urban areas, posing serious health risks to residents.  

In conclusion, the rapid growth of cities in the developing world has led to a host of social, economic and environmental issues that present major challenges for urban governance and sustainability. Globalization has contributed to rising inequalities that amplify the negative impacts of urbanization. With over half the world's population now living in cities, addressing issues like lack of basic services, housing shortages, inequality, environmental degradation and health risks should be a priority in global development agendas. Policies and investments that improve conditions for the urban poor and build sustainable, equitable cities will be crucial in the coming decades.
