The use of parliamentary debates and materials as an extrinsic aid in statutory interpretation has been controversial, with reasonable arguments on both sides. On the one hand, parliamentary materials can provide valuable context for understanding the purpose and intent behind legislation. Words spoken during debates can illuminate what issues the legislation aimed to address and the mischief it sought to remedy. For judges charged with interpreting the meaning and application of statutes, this context can be highly useful. 

However, there are also significant drawbacks to relying on parliamentary materials. First, it can undermine the separation of powers between the judiciary and legislature. When judges rely too heavily on statements made by legislators during debates, it can appear that legislators are directly influencing or even controlling judicial interpretations of statutes, rather than leaving it to judges to determine meaning based on the text and structure of the statute itself. This can call into question the independence of the judiciary.

Second, parliamentary materials may not actually reflect the intent of the legislature as a whole. Statements made by a few vocal legislators during debates do not necessarily represent the understanding or purpose of all legislators who voted for the bill. Legislation is the result of compromise, and a statute's final text may reflect concessions made to secure sufficient votes. Relying on the commentary of a few legislators risks misconstruing the motive and intent behind the statute.

Finally, parliamentary materials can increase uncertainty in the law and undermine the importance of statutory text. The meaning should be derived from the actual words used in the statute, not the commentary around it. When judges rely more on the latter, it makes the law less predictable and accessible to citizens.  

In conclusion, while parliamentary debates and other materials can provide useful context for statutory interpretation, judges should exercise caution in relying on them. They must consider how much weight to afford such materials relative to the statutory text, and be mindful of the impact on separation of powers and certainty in the law. In general, the further parliamentary materials are from directly illuminating the meaning and purpose of the text, the more hesitant judges should be to rely on them. statutory text should remain the primary guide, with parliamentary materials serving only a supporting role.
