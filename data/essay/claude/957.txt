Modernist writers such as James Joyce and Ford Madox Ford actively sought to break away from traditional forms of literature and aesthetic ideals of the past. They employed new techniques and narrative structures to depict a more realistic account of the human experience in the modern era as well as reflect the political and social uncertainties of the times. 

Joyce's Ulysses revolutionized the modern novel through its stream-of-consciousness technique, fragmented and nonlinear narrative, and exploration of the interior workings of the human mind. The nonlinear plot and shifting perspectives resemble the disorderly flow of human thoughts. This allows for a more authentic representation of human consciousness and experience. The characters reflect the anxieties and disillusionment of the postwar generation in their endless wandering through Dublin. Joyce's implicit critique of religious, political and social institutions also mirrors the instability and disintegration of prewar values. 

Similarly, Ford's The Good Soldier employs an unreliable narrator, fractured chronology and impressionistic style to capture the chaos and moral ambiguity of the modern world. The narrator John Dowell's imperfect and subjective account highlights the inability to achieve any objective or higher truth. The non-chronological order and Dowell's continual revision of events also reflect the shapelessness and entropy of lived experience. Ford suggests there are no simplistic explanations in human affairs and that disorder and uncertainty reign supreme. The text can also be read as a subtle indictment of the hollowness and decadence of the English upper classes in the prewar era.

In terms of narrative form, both Ulysses and The Good Soldier abandon linear sequences and neat resolutions in favor of open-endedness, incoherence, and irresolution. Their disjointed structures require readers to impose their own order and actively interpret meanings, reflecting modernists belief that absolute meaning and truth were no longer accessible. Their unreliable and impressionistic narration also aimed to make readers more aware of the subjectivity of all knowledge and the fallibility of human perception.

In conclusion, modernist writers employed revolutionary techniques such as stream-of-consciousness, nonlinear plots, and unreliable narration to capture the uncertainty, moral ambiguity and recklessness of the early 20th century. Their formal experimentation was a means to represent the chaos and disorder of modern reality as well as raise implicit critiques of contemporary society. Their open-ended and indeterminate works aimed to reflect the unstable nature of knowledge and human affairs in the aftermath of the first World War. Overall, modernist literature provided a more authentic exploration of human consciousness and experience, giving insight into life in a rapidly changing world that seemed to have abandoned absolutes.
