EHL (École hôtelière de Lausanne) is one of the top hospitality management schools in the world, renowned for training graduates for leadership roles in the hospitality industry. However, in recent years EHL has experienced issues with maintaining quality in certain areas, including declining student satisfaction scores, attrition of star faculty members, and inconsistency in the quality of the curriculum across programs. These underlying problems point to a lack of focus on a holistic Total Quality Management (TQM) approach.

One underlying issue is lack of student centricity. Although EHL has a strong focus on industry connections and internship placements, it seems to have lost sight of the student experience. Dropping student satisfaction scores suggest students feel less supported and engaged. TQM focuses on understanding student needs and expectations, providing a learning experience aimed at exceeding those expectations. Applying TQM, EHL could survey students to better understand pain points, set quality objectives around student experience, and make necessary improvements. Simple actions like increasing personal interactions and student feedback sessions with faculty and administration can go a long way.

Another concern is faculty turnover, especially of "star" professors known for their teaching excellence and industry expertise. Their exits hurt EHL's quality reputation and deprive students of enriched learning opportunities. While some degree of faculty turnover is inevitable, TQM aims to create an environment where faculty feel motivated, challenged, and rewarded, reducing unnecessary turnover. EHL may need to evaluate faculty compensation and career progression, set objectives for professional development and work-life balance, and support faculty through improved resources and other incentives. Retaining high-quality faculty is key to delivering a premium educational experience. 
 
In addition, there are signs that EHL is struggling to maintain consistency in curriculum quality, course content, and rigor across its programs. Some courses are outdated, while others fail to prepare students with needed job skills. TQM focuses on continuously monitoring course curriculum to ensure alignment with industry needs and student outcomes. EHL could establish ongoing program review processes to evaluate curriculum for relevance, soliciting input from hospitality employers and recent graduates. Setting clear learning objectives, investing in faculty training, and standardizing course guidelines can help improve consistency.

In summary, EHL's quality issues stem from lack of student centricity, high faculty turnover, and inconsistent curriculum. By embracing a TQM approach with a focus on stakeholder needs, EHL can remedy these problems and regain its position as a leader in hospitality education. TQM is a proven management philosophy centered on stakeholder satisfaction and continuous improvement. If EHL makes a sincere effort to understand student and faculty needs, set clear quality objectives, invest in stakeholder relationships, and monitor performance, it will thrive for years to come. But TQM must become an institutional way of thinking to make a real impact, with buy-in at all levels of the organization.  With a strong commitment to total quality, EHL can overcome its challenges and further cement its status as one of the top hospitality schools worldwide.
