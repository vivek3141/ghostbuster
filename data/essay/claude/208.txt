Judicial review is the process by which the courts review the lawfulness of decisions or actions made by public bodies such as central government departments, local authorities, tribunals, and other decision-making bodies. A claim for judicial review is a legal challenge to the way in which such a decision was made, rather than the merits or content of the actual decision. To bring a claim for judicial review in England and Wales, there are a number of procedural requirements that X would need to fulfil.

Firstly, X would need to have sufficient interest in the matter, known as 'standing'. Standing is established if X can show that the decision being challenged directly affects them or would affect them differently from the public at large. Given that X was excluded from school by the decision, X would likely be directly affected by the decision and have standing to bring a judicial review claim.

Secondly, X would need to act promptly in bringing the claim. Under the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR), claims for judicial review must be filed within 3 months of the grounds for the claim arising. The court has discretion to extend this time limit, but promptness is expected given the public nature of decisions under review. X would thus need to file his claim within 3 months of being notified of the exclusion decision.

Thirdly, X would need to apply for permission to proceed with the claim. This requires filing court forms setting out the grounds for review along with evidence to support those grounds. Permission will be granted if the court considers that X has an arguable case warranting a review. At the permission stage, the court will assess the grounds put forward by X for their potential to succeed. Common grounds for review include procedural unfairness, irrationality/ unreasonableness, illegality, and lack of proportionality. 

X could potentially argue that the decision to exclude him was disproportionate on the basis that the exclusion was too severe a punishment and not rationally connected to the aims of discipline and good order in the school. The principle of proportionality requires that decisions impacting individual rights are proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. The court would consider whether the exclusion was rationally connected to its aims, whether less restrictive measures were available, and whether the impact on X's right to education was excessive. Given the severity of exclusion, X may have grounds to argue disproportionality.

In considering Y's involvement in the decision to exclude X, the rule against bias may apply if Y had a close relationship with X or a vested interest in seeing X excluded. The rule against bias requires that decisions are made impartially, by individuals with no pecuniary or personal interest in the outcome. If Y was biased or appeared to act unfairly in recommending X's exclusion, the decision and process may be flawed and unlawful on the grounds of apparent bias.

In conclusion, there are clear procedural and substantive grounds on which X could challenge the school's decision to exclude him through judicial review. By acting promptly to file a claim, securing permission to proceed, and arguing that the decision was disproportionate or apparently biased, X could have reasonable prospects of success in his application for judicial review of the school's decision.
