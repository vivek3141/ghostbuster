The isoelectric point of a protein refers to the pH at which the net charge of the protein is zero. For casein, a phosphoprotein found in milk, determining its isoelectric point required the use of electrophoresis and pH titration experiments. 

Electrophoresis involves the migration of charged molecules in an electric field. By placing a protein solution on a gel and subjecting it to an electric field, the mobility of the proteins can be assessed based on how far they migrate. The isoelectric point is indicated when there is no net movement of the protein within the gel. For casein, multiple electrophoresis experiments were conducted using a range of pH values for the gel and solution. It was found that at a pH of 4.6, casein did not migrate in the electric field, indicating this is its isoelectric point.

pH titration involves gradually adding acid or base to a protein solution and measuring how the pH changes. As protons are added to a protein molecule, its net charge will decrease until reaching zero at the isoelectric point. The titration curve of casein showed an increase in pH with added base up to 4.6, at which point the curve flattened out. The lack of change in pH indicates the isoelectric point has been reached. Through multiple titration experiments, it was conclusively shown that casein has an isoelectric point of pH 4.6.

Electrophoretograms, the visual results of electrophoresis experiments, were also obtained for the proteins haemoglobin and cytochrome c. For haemoglobin, the electrophoretogram showed two distinct bands migrating at different rates, indicating the presence of two subunits. The cytochrome c electrophoretogram revealed a single band, showing it is made up of a single polypeptide. 

In summary, through the use of electrophoresis and pH titration, scientists were able to determine experimentally that the isoelectric point of casein is 4.6. Electrophoretograms also provided information on the subunit composition of haemoglobin and cytochrome c. These methodologies have been crucial for studying proteins and expanding our understanding of their structure and function.
