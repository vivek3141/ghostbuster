OPUS Ltd. uses a rigorous quality control and assurance process for their software development. They follow industry-standard methodologies like the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) to ensure high quality at every stage of development.

First, OPUS requires extensive requirements analysis and specifications documentation for any new software project. Business analysts meet with clients and end users to determine exact requirements and use cases. These are documented in a requirements specification document that is reviewed and approved by all stakeholders before development begins. This helps ensure the team has a clear and shared understanding of what they are building.

Second, OPUS employs a test-driven development methodology where test cases are written even before the code itself is developed. As each new module or function is coded, automated tests are created to validate that it works as intended. The code is then refined until all tests pass. This "build a little, test a little" approach ensures high quality code with a high degree of test coverage. 

Third, OPUS conducts code reviews for all new code prior to release. Senior developers review the code to check for any errors, bugs, or other issues. The code is revised if any problems are found. Code reviews are also a way for team members to learn from each other and promote knowledge sharing.

Fourth, OPUS does multiple levels of testing including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing. Unit and integration tests verify that individual modules and interfaces work properly. System testing evaluates the software as a whole to ensure all requirements are met. User acceptance testing is done with client involvement to validate that the software works for its intended users and purposes.

Finally, OPUS has a issue tracking system where any bugs, errors or other issues detected during the development and testing process are logged, prioritized, and addressed. All issues must be resolved before final release of the software. Release to clients only proceeds after sign-off from QA and client stakeholders.  

In summary, OPUS Ltd. follows a rigorous multi-step quality assurance process for their software including requirements analysis, test-driven development, code reviews, various test levels, and an issue tracking system. This comprehensive methodology has proven effective for delivering high-quality, well-tested, and client-validated software.
