The Frankfurt School theorists Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer developed the concept of the 'culture industry' as a critique of the mass production and circulation of cultural forms in capitalist societies of the 20th century. Their theory argues that cultural goods, art and entertainment have been commodified by the economy in order to optimize profit. The culture industry produces pre-packaged cultural goods that are homogenous, formulaic, and engineered to please the masses. It generates a supply of easily consumable cultural goods to match the interests of a standardized mass market.

Adorno and Horkheimer argued that the culture industry is shaped by the forces of totality and technological domination in capitalist society. Totality refers to the way that advanced capitalist systems have developed an all-encompassing logic that shapes and organizes all spheres of life according to the interests of capital accumulation, including culture, art and leisure activities. Technological domination reflects the use of new technologies, such as film, radio and television, to produce mass culture and exert control over the population. Mass culture is tailored to the interests of the market and fuels the endless accumulation of capital, rather than enriching human creativity or imagination. 

The culture industry relies on societal mechanisms of social control to manipulate audiences into becoming passive consumers of pre-packaged culture. It deprives audiences of the ability to judge aesthetic or intellectual value. Audiences come to desire the standardized cultural goods produced for mass consumption, even though they do not enrich their lives in any meaningful way. This reflects the 'fetishism of commodities’ where the exchange value of goods in the market become more important than their use value. Audiences develop false needs that can only be satisfied through consumption. The culture industry thereby cultivates a ‘sameness’ that destroys critical thinking and opposition.

While Adorno and Horkheimer were pessimistic about art's existence outside the culture industry, they believed that art could still be a site of resistance. Authentic art retains a utopian impulse to reject the logic of domination in society and enrich human imagination and creativity. However, art is also affected by the commodification of culture and the influx of market forces that treat cultural goods as merely a means to generate profit. Contemporary art must often rely on private sponsorship, corporate funding, and the art market to sustain itself. The fetishism of the art market and the branding of artworks as status objects poses a threat to art's autonomy. However, some art still retains an oppositional character by rejecting commercial co-option and critiquing the culture industry itself.

The culture industry continues to be relevant today with the rise of media monopolies, reality television, social media and other mass cultural platforms designed primarily to generate advertising revenue and fuel consumption. However, digital technologies have also enabled greater diversity of cultural expression and more avenues for creativity outside of the mainstream. There is an ongoing struggle between the homogenizing effects of the culture industry and the human desire for more meaningful and enriching cultural experiences. The concept of the culture industry remains useful for critically analyzing this tension and how market forces shape culture, despite the potential for greater diversity and access in the digital age.
