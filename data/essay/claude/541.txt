Several factors contributed to the decline of "brutal" working-class sports in Britain during  the 18th and 19th centuries, including the rise of evangelicalism, urbanization, and changes in cultural attitudes. At the same time, other sports grew increasingly popular as replacements.

Evangelical religious movements emphasized morality, compassion, and restraint. Blood sports and violent recreations were seen as immoral and sinful. Preachers railed against the "barbarism" of sports like bull-baiting, cockfighting, and bare-knuckle boxing. Their campaigns helped turn public opinion against these activities and led to legal bans, starting with bull-baiting in 1835.

Rapid urbanization also made brutal sports increasingly problematic. As cities grew more crowded, violent and unruly recreations disrupted public order. Blood sports required space and made noise that disturbed urban residents. City leaders banned these events to maintain control, on the grounds that they were nuisances and threats to civic stability.

Attitudes began to shift toward a vision of a civilized, refined culture. Cruel sports were seen as remnants of a barbaric past, unsuitable for a modern industrial age. The middle and upper classes looked down upon violent working-class recreations as vulgar and savage. More "civilized" sports like cricket, football, and rugby became fashionable among these social groups and were promoted as superior alternatives. 

While some brutal sports declined, other recreations rose to take their place. Cricket became a major spectator sport, as did horse racing. Football transitioned from a raucous mob activity into the organized sports of rugby and association football. Boxing was reformed under the Marquess of Queensberry rules to create the modern sport. These new sports, though some still violent, were more controlled, refined, and spetacle-oriented, appealing to all classes.

In summary, evangelical religious revival, rapid urbanization, and shifting cultural attitudes all contributed to the decline of violent working-class sports in Britain between the 18th and 19th centuries.  While these brutal recreations were on the wane, civilized and organized sports gained popularity to become national pastimes that crossed social boundaries. Overall, it represented a gradual process of refinement of popular taste from barbarism to civility.
