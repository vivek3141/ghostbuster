There are several major factors contributing to the global crisis facing nonhuman primate populations. The first and most significant factor is the destruction and fragmentation of primate habitats due to deforestation for agriculture, logging, infrastructure development, and other human activities. As forests are cleared and degraded, primate populations become isolated in fragmented patches of suitable habitat and face increased risks of local extinction due to inbreeding depression and stochastic events. The second major threat is the bushmeat tradeâ€”the hunting of wild animals for consumption as meat. The bushmeat trade directly targets many primate species for food and also depletes prey populations on which primates depend. The third factor is the illegal wildlife trade, where primates are captured and sold as pets, for circuses and zoos, or for biomedical research. 

Hunting has had a devastating impact on primate populations, especially in areas where firearms have become more widely available. Many primate species have life history characteristics that make them vulnerable to overhunting, such as low reproductive rates, long interbirth intervals, and complex social systems. Species with these traits cannot quickly recover from increased mortality. For example, the population of Grauer's gorillas in the Democratic Republic of Congo has declined by 77% over the past 20 years due to hunting. Even traditionally "protected" species like chimpanzees have lost up to 90% of their populations in heavily hunted areas. Species with smaller body sizes, diurnal activity patterns, and those that travel and forage in large conspicuous groups tend to be more vulnerable to hunters and experience steeper population declines.

Strategies to mitigate this crisis must address multiple factors simultaneously to be effective. Protecting and restoring habitat is critical, as it reduces access for hunters and also provides resources to support primate populations. Banning the hunting and trade of endangered primates can be effective if enforceable. Providing alternative sources of protein and livelihoods for local communities can reduce dependence on bushmeat. Education and outreach are also important for fostering understanding and support for conservation goals. The success of any strategy depends on involvement of local communities, political will to design and enforce appropriate policies, funding for conservation and alternative livelihood programs, and cooperation across country borders. There is no single solution, but coordinated efforts across sectors and borders offer the greatest hope for ensuring the long term survival of our closest living relatives.
