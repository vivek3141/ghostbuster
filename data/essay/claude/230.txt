Brian Friel's play Translations, set in 1833 Ireland, explores the role of language in shaping Irish culture and identity. The play is set in the fictional town of Ballybeg in County Donegal, where  an ordnance survey and the opening of English-speaking hedge schools are displacing the Irish language. Friel shows how this linguistic shift profoundly impacts the town's culture and power dynamics. 

Friel portrays the Irish language as central to Irish cultural identity. The characters in the play frequently speak in Irish, with whole scenes entirely in Irish. Their fluency and comfort in Irish demonstrates how intertwined it is with their cultural heritage. For example, Owen's lessons to his students on Irish place names and their poetic origins highlights how much local history and folklore is encoded in the language. The characters take pride in their language as a marker of their Irishness. This is evident in Hugh's stubborn refusal to speak English even as he struggles to find the Irish words to express modern concepts. For Friel, the erosion of Irish thus represents a loss of connection to traditional culture and ways of thinking.

Friel also shows how language is tied to political and social power. The British ordinance survey is a tool for exerting control over the Irish, enabling taxation and military control. The opening of English-only hedge schools is similarly a way to spread English and British values. As Manus says, "it is to forge a whole new reality for them. It is to redefine and reinvent them". The resulting language shift empowers those who speak English, like Owen and Yolland, while diminishing the authority of Irish speakers. The town's toponyms are Anglicized, symbolizing the British overwriting of Irish identity and history. Those who don't speak English, like Manus and Hugh, are left behind.

However, Friel also challenges the notion that the Irish language alone defines Irish culture. He shows how Ballybeg's culture, traditions and way of life are adapting to outside influences, rather than remaining stagnant. The everyday lives of the characters incorporate English elements, like the music and books that Sarah teaches at the hedge school. Although the characters value their heritage, they are not opposed to cultural change or engagement with the outside world. Manus and Hugh may cling to Irish, but the younger generation are bilingual and comfortable navigating both linguistic and cultural spheres. 

Friel thus portrays language as inextricably linked with culture, identity and power in 1833 Ballybeg. The erosion of Irish through British policies and institutions leads to a loss of tradition and authority for the native Irish. However, he also shows that Ballybeg's culture is not defined by language alone, and its inhabitants are embracing a bilingual identity and cultural change. Friel suggests that while language shift has profound consequences, it does not necessarily equate to full cultural loss or stagnation. The people of Ballybeg are shaped by their past but also dynamic and adaptive, navigating a space between old and new.
