Henrik Ibsen's 1879 play 'A Doll's House' exemplifies many of the characteristics of the naturalist drama movement of the late 19th century. Naturalism in drama aimed to represent 'real life' on stage as truthfully and objectively as possible. Ibsen adopted this approach in 'A Doll's House' through focusing on the lives of middle-class people and their daily struggles and relationships. The play has a strong focus on the psychology and inner experiences of the characters in place of melodramatic plotlines and action. The characters are ordinary people grappling with family dynamics, relationships, gender roles and self-identity. This focus on internal, psychological elements was a hallmark of naturalism in drama. 

Ibsen also employed highly detailed, elaborate stage directions in the text of 'A Doll's House' in order to prescribe the most realistic and lifelike staging of the play. The stage directions span several pages at the beginning of the play, describing in extensive detail the set, furnishings, lighting and daily activities of the characters. For example, Ibsen specifies exactly which room of the house each act is set in, the time of year, and what the characters are engaged in as the curtain rises in each act. The stage directions cover specifics of the set design, including the color of wallpaper and the pattern of rugs and upholstery. This level of detail and control was aimed at creating a wholly naturalistic mise-en-scene that would transport the audience into a faithful representation of a middle-class Scandinavian home.

Through the inclusion of these highly prescriptive stage directions, Ibsen sought to minimize the interpretive role of directors and set designers, essentially demanding the most realistic recreation of domestic life on the stage. The play is intended to be an imitation of real life -- the lives of ordinary people with complex psychology -- not a spectacle or melodrama. The detailed set, props and activities all combine to create a fully realized environment and daily life for the characters in the Helmer household. The audience witnesses daily rituals like dinner, reading and children being put to bed. All of these elements work to create the illusion of real life unfolding naturally in front of the audience's eyes.

In conclusion, 'A Doll's House' exemplifies naturalism in drama through its focus on ordinary people and the drama of daily life, as well as Ibsen's use of highly detailed stage directions to prescribe a realistic setting and environment. Through these techniques, Ibsen aimed to move drama away from the spectacle, exaggeration and melodrama of earlier forms and instead represent real life with objectivity and truthfulness. The play is ultimately a study of human nature, identity and psychology -- themes at the very core of the naturalist project in drama.
