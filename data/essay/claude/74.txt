The attempted English settlement of Roanoke Island off the coast of present-day North Carolina in the 1580s ultimately failed for several reasons. Poor relations with the local Native Americans, the choice of Roanoke Island as the settlement site, the characteristics of the colonists, and a lack of support from England all contributed to the demise of the Roanoke colony. 

First, the English colonists failed to establish good relations with the local Native Americans, the Croatoan and Secotan tribes. Initial contact in 1584 was friendly, but later expeditions encountered hostilities, in part due to the English kidnapping of Native Americans like Manteo and Wanchese. By the time the main group of 117 colonists arrived in 1587, relations had soured. The colonists arrived too late in the year to plant crops, and they were dependent on the Native Americans for food. Tensions over resources and English livestock trampling Native crops likely provoked the Croatoan and Secotan tribes to withdraw their support for the colonists, contributing to the ultimately mysterious disappearance of the group.

Second, Roanoke Island was a poor choice for the site of a fledgling colony. Although selected for its strategic location within the proposed Raleigh Empire, the thin barrier island lacked many of the attributes necessary for a successful settlement. The sandy soil was ill-suited for agriculture, the island offered little protection from storms, and the surrounding waters made it difficult to find fish and navigate. The island was also isolated, separated from the mainland by a treacherous inlet, making trade and communication difficult. In short, Roanoke Island lacked many of the key natural resources and geographic features that would support life for European colonists.  

Third, the characteristics and aims of the colonists themselves contributed to the failure. Many were ill-suited for life as pioneers, drawn more by the promise of gold and riches than the difficult work of establishing a self-sustaining settlement. They lacked key survival skills and included few farmers or builders. More concerned with privateering against the Spanish than building homes or planting crops, the colonists were primed for failure. Their aims of finding riches, gold, and glory were unrealistic, as was the scheme to plant grapes for wine to sell to England. The harsh realities of life as colonists soon devolved into internal dissent and conflict.

Finally, the lack of firm support from England and Sir Walter Raleigh significantly hampered the chances of success. Promised supplies and reinforcements either never came or came too late. Communication was poor, and the fate of the final group of colonists, including John White's granddaughter Virginia Dare, remains a mystery due to the challenges of transatlantic communication at the time. The decline of Raleigh's favor in the English court undermined support for his ambitious colonial schemes, and the threat of war with Spain diverted the attention and resources of the English government. The colonists were effectively abandoned on Roanoke Island.

In conclusion, poor relations with Native groups, the choice of a difficult island location, the problematic characteristics and aims of the colonists themselves, and a lack of real support from England doomed the Roanoke colony to failure. The mysterious fate of the colonists, including Virginia Dare, remains an unsolved problem in American history. The failure highlighted the many challenges of establishing successful colonies and influenced future English settlement efforts in North America.
