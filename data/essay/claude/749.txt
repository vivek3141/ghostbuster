Culinary taste refers to people's preferences and dispositions towards specific foods and the practice of eating. However, these tastes do not arise in isolation or purely as a result of personal preferences or physiological drives. Rather, culinary taste is socially constructed through various processes of socialization and shaped by the social world we inhabit. 

Many sociologists have studied how social factors influence the development and expression of taste. Pierre Bourdieu proposed the concept of habitus to describe the socialized norms and tendencies that shape how we think and act, resulting in certain tastes being acquired during early socialization and then reproduced unconsciously. For Bourdieu, a person's habitus is closely tied to their social class, as class structures expose individuals to different social learning environments. Members of the upper and middle classes develop a "cultural capital" and refined taste through exposure to cultural goods and education. In contrast, members of the working class develop tastes more oriented around necessity and familiarity.

Alan Warde built on Bourdieu's theory, arguing that habitus also incorporates cultural customs and values shared among generations. However, Warde saw individuals as having more agency in consciously adopting and abandoning tastes. While early tastes are strongly influenced by family and social environments, individuals gradually develop autonomous tastes as they are exposed to a wider range of foods and social interactions. Warde focused more on the role of cultural diffusion and less on social class in the development of taste.  

Zygmunt Bauman proposed the notion of "aesthetic choice" to describe how globalization and consumer culture have given individuals more freedom to adopt varied tastes based on identity and lifestyle. However, Bauman also noted how this freedom is constrained by social emulation and the desire to signal status. Taste becomes a means of distinction, and individuals adopt the tastes of those they aspire to be like in order to elevate their social standing. In this view, taste is shaped more by status anxiety and fashion than by culture or social class.

Mike Featherstone similarly argued that lifestyle and identity have become more prominent influencers of taste in consumer culture. Drawing on the work of Bauman and Bourdieu, Featherstone theorized that globalization has weakened the rigid link between habitus and social class, giving rise to more individualized "lifestyle habitus" oriented around aesthetic choice. However, lifestyle habitus is still subject to dynamics of distinction and emulation, as people adopt tastes and lifestyles to build their cultural capital and identity. 

In summary, sociologists view culinary taste as a socially constructed and fluid concept. While early tastes are often shaped by habits and norms assimilated through family and social class, individuals increasingly develop autonomous tastes as self-expression and lifestyle gain more prominence as influencers. However, the freedom of choice is limited by the desire to signal status and identity. Taste remains bound by sociological factors and dynamics of distinction, even as it becomes more personalized and culturally diverse. Overall, there are many  social and cultural influences that construct and reproduce the varied tastes found in society.
