The interview conducted to develop my "Responding to Others" project was a semi-structured interview focused on exploring the experiences of one participant within the theme of responses to others. The interview was completed and analyzed as part of a human-computer interaction course to improve interviewing skills in order to construct the conversational capabilities of an AI system. 

The initial step in developing the interview was to determine the goal, theme, and scope of the subject matter. The broad theme of exploring responses to others was selected to allow for a wide range of possible experiences and perspectives to be discussed. The scope was limited to a single participant to keep the project concise within the course timeframe. With the theme and scope defined, a standard set of open-ended questions was drafted to serve as a starting point to guide the conversation. The questions focused on the participant's experiences in different situations, how responses were determined or selected, what factors influenced their responses, and what they thought were the most effective ways of responding to others.

The interview was conducted remotely via video conferencing software due to health and safety regulations during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This format presented some challenges in developing rapport and reading body language but allowed for a convenient way to connect and have a meaningful conversation. The video format did also allow for some observations of nonverbal forms of communication during the discussion. Beginning the interview, I introduced myself, explained the purpose and theme of the study, and assured the participant that their responses and identity would remain confidential. Rapport was built through initial casual conversation before transitioning into the interview questions.

The open-ended questions were used as a guide, with the interview taking the form of a semi-structured conversational exchange. Follow up questions and probing was done to clarify responses and explore some areas in more depth. The participant's responses and stories were Capture through notes and a transcript of the full interview audio. The semi-structured and conversational nature of the interview allowed for the discovery of new themes and ideas that had not previously been considered. The participant was able to speak freely about what they found most significant and meaningful within the topic.

Some key strengths in the interview approach were the open-ended, conversational style which provided rich data and new insights. The video format and development of rapport also helped create a level of comfort in which the participant was happy to share personal experiences and perspectives. Weaknesses in my interview skills were also apparent, including the overreliance on a rigid set of questions, failure to probe more deeply at times, and issues with summarizing or paraphrasing responses effectively. Improvements for the future include more flexibility in following new lines of inquiry, greater use of summarizing and paraphrasing to confirm understanding, less focus on a set list of questions, more follow up, and greater observation of nonverbal cues which could not always be achieved due to the video format's limitations. 

In conclusion, the methods, skills, and tools utilized in this exploratory interview on responses to others provided a strong foundation for a beginner in developing interviewing techniques. The experience yielded a wealth of data and insights while also highlighting many opportunities for improvement and further skill development in constructing a fluent and productive qualitative interview. With practice, the abilities to think on one's feet, reframe questions spontaneously, probe insightfully, build strong rapport, and interpret nonverbal communication can all be enhanced. The lessons learned from this first experience interviewing will be invaluable for continuous growth and progress in applied research.
