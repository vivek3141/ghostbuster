Thrombelastography (TEG) is a viscoelastic test that provides a real-time assessment of clot formation and dissolution in whole blood. It is typically used to directly measure all phases in the haemostatic process in perioperative patients to aid in diagnosis and treatment of coagulopathies and guide blood product transfusions. 

The process of haemostasis involves platelets, blood coagulation factors, fibrinolysis, and the proteins and cells of the vascular bed. In a healthy individual, this system works to maintain blood in a fluid state within vessels, but is poised to rapidly form clots to minimize blood loss in the event of an injury. The traditional methods of assessing this system involve measuring individual components using tests such as the prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen level, platelet count, and thrombin time (TT). However, these tests are often limited as they are performed on citrated platelet-poor plasma, do not provide a complete functional assessment of the haemostatic system, and have a limited ability to predict perioperative blood loss.

In contrast, TEG provides a comprehensive functional assessment of the entire clotting cascade in real time using native whole blood. It works by detecting the changing viscoelastic properties of blood as a clot forms and lyses. As clot formation is initiated, the blood first becomes more gel-like, increasing resistance to motion. The clot then becomes more elastic, storing and releasing energy with motion. Finally, as the clot stabilizes or lyses, the properties change once again. By applying a constant force to blood in a heated cup and monitoring its motion, TEG can detect all phases of clot formation including the initial clot formation (R value), kinetics of clot formation (α-angle and K value), clot strength (MA), fibrinolysis (LY30), and clot lysis (CLT). 

The main advantages of TEG over standard tests include providing a more comprehensive real-time assessment of haemostasis, incorporating the patient’s own anticoagulants and inhibitors, using whole blood rather than plasma, having the ability to detect hypercoagulability and hyperfibrinolysis, and having predictive abilities for perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements. Several studies have found TEG parameters to have a moderate to strong correlation with blood loss and transfusion in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, liver transplantation, trauma, and obstetrics. A meta-analysis of 13 studies found TEG had a sensitivity of 0.82 and specificity of 0.85 for predicting transfusions.

However, TEG also has some limitations and disadvantages. It requires specialized equipment and training, has higher costs, lower reproducibility, and established reference ranges have not been developed for all patient populations. TEG may also be affected by preanalytic variables such as time from collection, agitation, and diet. Although TEG provides additional information compared to standard tests, the two methods are not completely interchangeable. Current recommendations state that for optimal management of perioperative coagulopathies, TEG should be used as an adjunct to standard coagulation tests, with diagnosis and treatment algorithms that incorporate results from both methods.

In summary, TEG is a point-of-care test that provides an overall assessment of clot formation and breakdown in whole blood. It has been shown to aid in the diagnosis and management of coagulation derangements in surgical settings by predicting transfusion requirements and guiding blood product administration. Although TEG should not replace standard coagulation tests, when used together they provide a more complete picture of a patient's coagulation status and readiness for surgery. Overall, TEG adds valuable information for optimal perioperative coagulation monitoring and management.
