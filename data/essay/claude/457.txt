Economic globalisation has expanded rapidly in the past few decades with the liberalisation of trade barriers, advancements in transportation and technology, and the emergence of global supply chains. Flows of goods, services, investment, and people across borders have intensified. This increasing integration of the global economy has significantly shaped the power of nation states. 

On the one hand, nation states have lost some economic powers as globalisation has made it more difficult for them to control flows across borders or set independent economic policies. Their policy options are now constrained by global economic forces and the actions of other nations. For example, if a country raises interest rates to curb inflation, it may attract volatile foreign capital flows that can destabilise its economy. Nation states have also lost control over some levers of their economies, as global supply chains now locate segments of production in the most efficient locations worldwide.

However, nation states remain influential economic actors in some ways. They shape the institutional frameworks that govern global trade and finance. They also significantly impact the business environments and competitiveness within their borders through investments in infrastructure, education, regulations, and tax policies. While transnational companies may have more global reach and flexibility, the bulk of economic activity is still domestic, and nation states largely control domestic conditions. Nation states also negotiate trade agreements and alliances to advance their economic interests on a global scale. Despite globalisation, most political leaders still take nationalist stances to boost their domestic economic standing.

In conclusion, while economic globalisation has reduced some traditional powers of nation states, they remain influential actors in the global economy. They help determine the rules of globalisation and directly shape conditions within their borders. While their policy options may be more constrained, nation states actively negotiate globalisation on their own terms. Kenichi Ohmae's statement that nation states have become "little more than bit actors" is an overstatement that underestimates their enduring influence over global and domestic economic affairs. Nation states will likely remain principal players in the global economy for the foreseeable future.
