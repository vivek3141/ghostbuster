The idea of a distinction between the mind and the body has been contemplated by philosophers and theologians for centuries. While the Aristotelian view and medieval Christianity posited an intimate connection between the mind (or soul) and the physical body, the 17th-century philosopher René Descartes articulated an argument for the real distinction of mind and body. Descartes laid out his argument systematically in his Meditations on First Philosophy. 

The notion of a distinction between mind and body originated in ancient Greek philosophy, with the concept of the soul as something non-physical that animates the body. Aristotle argued for the unity of body and soul, with the soul being the form of the living body. The soul could not exist without the body. Medieval Christian philosophers and theologians adopted Aristotle's view, arguing that body and soul are united and interdependent.

Descartes broke from this tradition by arguing for a real ontological distinction between mind and body. His argument proceeds through several premises, derived from his method of radical doubt. First, Descartes concludes that he can doubt the existence of his body, but he cannot doubt the existence of his mind, since the act of doubt itself requires a mind to do the doubting. From this, Descartes infers that the mind must be distinct from the body.

Second, Descartes argues that the nature of the mind and body are utterly different. The mind is non-extended, lacking shape and dimension, while the body is extended in space. Their attributes are incommensurable. From this difference in nature, Descartes concludes that the mind and body have a real distinction—they can each exist independent of the other.  

Third, Descartes argues that God could create a mind without a body and a body without a mind. Since God is omnipotent, his power is not limited by requiring a mind to be embodied or a body to be animated. The separability of mind and body is possible. From this potential separability, Descartes concludes that the mind and body have a real distinction.

Finally, Descartes argues that sensations, emotions, and imaginings come from the mind alone, not the union of mind and body. The mind can experience these mental phenomena even without input from the body. Hence, the mind does not depend on the body. The mind is self-sufficient and can operate independently of the body. This reinforces the conclusion that the mind and body have a real distinction.

Descartes's argument for a real distinction between mind and body marked a pivotal turning point in Western philosophy. However, his view also faces some difficulties. Interaction between mind and body remains problematic if they are really distinct. And Descartes's attribution  of sensations, emotions, and imagination solely to the mind seems dubious, given their bodily components. The relationship between the mental and physical remains an open question in philosophy today, with Descartes's provocative argument framing one side of the discussion.
