Hegemonic masculinity, the dominant and idealized form of masculinity in a given culture, is prevalent in the British sports media. Male athletes and sportsmen receive disproportionately more coverage in print media, television, and online sports outlets compared to female athletes and sportswomen. This coverage differential manifests itself in several ways: more frequent photographic coverage of male athletes, more prominent photograph placement for male athletes, and more frequent action shots of male athletes engaged in athletic feats.

Content analysis of British sports media confirms this gender imbalance in coverage. For example, a study analyzing six major British newspapers over the 2012 Olympics found that male athletes received 62.7% of all photographic coverage, while female athletes received only 37.3% (Vincent et al., 2013). The photographs of male athletes were also more likely to be large action shots on the front page or double-page spreads, while photographs of female athletes tended to be smaller and placed in less prominent locations in the newspapers. Similar imbalances have been found in studies of British sports television, with 63-77% of airtime and 64-75% of commentary focused on male athletes and men's sports (Bruce, 2013). 

The British sports media conveys traditional masculine attributes like strength, speed, and aggression through its disproportionate focus on male athletes, especially in dynamic action shots. By contrast, female athletes are often portrayed in more passive posed photos that emphasize their femininity and heterosexuality. These patterns reflect and reproduce hegemonic masculinity in sports media. They send the message that athleticism and sport are primarily masculine domains, while femininity is best expressed through passivity and sexuality.

While content analysis provides a systematic way to study patterns of gender representation in the media, it has some potential limitations. First, it can only analyze what is present in the media, not what is absent. The lack of coverage of women's sports and female athletes is a glaring absence, but one that content analysis cannot directly measure. Second, content analysis cannot determine the effects of hegemonic masculinity in the sports media on audiences. Surveys and experiments are needed to explore how these patterns of coverage may influence beliefs and attitudes.

In conclusion, content analysis studies show clear evidence of hegemonic masculinity in the British sports media, including disproportionate coverage of male athletes, more prominent and active portrayals of men, and the association of masculinity with athleticism. This gender imbalance likely has significant consequences for attitudes about sports, gender roles, and sexuality. While content analysis is a useful tool for systematically documenting these patterns, a fuller understanding requires other methodological approaches that can explore both media absences and audience effects.
