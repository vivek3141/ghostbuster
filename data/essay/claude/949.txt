Qualitative research methods can be used to gain rich insights into healthcare professionals' experiences with and perspectives on hand hygiene in hospitals. Qualitative research aims to understand meaningful and symbolic experiences of participants through in-depth data collection and analysis. Unlike quantitative studies that focus on measuring or quantifying phenomena, qualitative research seeks to explore how and why certain human experiences occur.

An ideal qualitative approach for studying hand hygiene practices would be interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA). IPA focuses on how individuals make sense of their experiences and the meanings they derive from those experiences. It would allow researchers to understand how healthcare professionals perceive and experience hand hygiene in their daily work. Researchers adopting IPA should use purposive sampling to select participants based on certain criteria, such as years of experience, professional roles, and willingness to share experiences. Around 6 to 10 participants from different professions (e.g. nurses, physicians, technicians) should be recruited to capture a range of perspectives.

Semi-structured interviews would be an effective method for data collection. The interviews should be designed to probe participantsâ€™ views on topics such as the importance of hand hygiene, facilitators and barriers to compliance, perceptions of risks and benefits, experiences educating patients and peers, and beliefs about policy and leadership support. Open-ended questions should be used to allow participants to speak freely about their experiences and raise issues that are most meaningful to them. The interviews should be audio recorded and transcribed for in-depth analysis.

Validity and reliability in qualitative research depend on the rigor of methodology and depth of analysis. Several strategies can strengthen validity, including researcher reflexivity, member checking, thick descriptions, peer debriefing, and consensus coding. Reflexivity requires the researcher to examine their own values, biases, and preconceptions and how these may influence the research process. Member checking involves providing preliminary results and interpretations back to participants to check for accuracy. Thick descriptions refer to providing rich, detailed accounts of participants' experiences. Peer debriefing means consulting external researchers to review methods and help identify weaknesses. And consensus coding is when multiple researchers analyze the data and compare and reconcile interpretations.

In summary, qualitative research using IPA and in-depth interviews is well suited to developing an understanding of healthcare professionals' experiences with hand hygiene. With a rigorous approach to methodology and analysis, such research can provide compelling insights to inform policy, practice improvements, and educational interventions in hospitals.
