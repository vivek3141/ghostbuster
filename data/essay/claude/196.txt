The hoplite phalanx was one of the most significant military revolutions in ancient Greek warfare. Hoplites, heavily armored infantry soldiers, equipped with a large round shield, spear, bronze cuirass, helmet, and greaves, employed dense formations and precise tactics to dominate the battlefields of Greece from around 650 BCE. The development of the hoplite phalanx provided many advantages over previous styles of warfighting, allowed for the mass production of hoplite equipment due to economic prosperity, and eventually led to the rise of democratic institutions in many Greek city-states.

There is some debate about when exactly hoplite warfare first emerged in ancient Greece. Traditionally, most scholars pointed to the introduction of hoplite armor and phalanx tactics around 650 BCE based on vase paintings and ancient writings. However, more recent archaeological evidence suggests hoplite equipment and tactics may have developed gradually over the 7th century BCE. The burial site at Argos suggests some hoplite equipment like the bronze cuirass was being used as early as 750 BCE. The Lefkandi tomb in Euboea, dating to around 900 BCE, contained a burial with iron weapons and some possible hoplite equipment. 

While the archaeological evidence is subject to interpretation, most scholars still think hoplite warfare was not fully developed until around 650 BCE. The artistic record provides clear evidence of a phalanx in tight formation, using hoplite shields and equipment, around this time. Additionally, ancient writers like Herodotus wrote that hoplite warfare was introduced from Argos to Sparta around 650 BCE. The Greek adoption of iron metallurgy and a prosperous economy that could equip large numbers of citizens with armor supports the view that classic hoplite warfare developed in the mid-7th century BCE.

The hoplite phalanx provided significant advantages over earlier forms of warfare in Greece. The large round aspis shield, about 3 feet in diameter, allowed hoplites to form a protective wall with their shields that negated the effects of enemy archers and slingers. The hoplites fought packed in a dense formation, with shields overlapping, presenting a uniform front to the enemy. Their bronze armor and helmets also provided protection for the torso and head. The long thrusting spear, the doru, had a range advantage over swords and could be held underhand or overhand.

The shield and spear were ideal for fighting in a unified formation. The tight formation, discipline, and standardized equipment gave the hoplites a huge advantage over loosely organized and lightly armored opponents. An organized phalanx could easily defeat a disorganized mass of individual fighters. The phalanx was a revolutionary new fighting tactic for the Greek city-states that dominated warfare for centuries.

The rise of hoplite warfare was enabled by the prosperity of the Greek city-states in the 7th century BCE. Advances in agriculture, trade, and iron metallurgy allowed for surplus wealth and a large class of citizen farmers who could afford the equipment necessary to fight as hoplites. A full panoply of hoplite equipment was expensive, costing about 30 drachmae, equivalent to a monthâ€™s pay for a farmer. While only the wealthy could afford hoplite equipment initially, costs declined over time as iron and bronze became more widely available, and many city-states began providing arms for those who couldn't afford it. 

The widespread adoption of hoplite warfare had significant political and social consequences. The hoplite phalanx required teamwork, discipline, and a strong group identity to function. This group identity and values of collective action then translated to political demands for a greater say in government by the hoplites. In many city-states, the rise of hoplite armies led to the broadening of citizen rights and more democratic constitutions. The hoplite ethos also introduced new social attitudes that glorified ordered discipline, civic responsibility, and group solidarity.

In summary, the development of hoplite warfare in Greece produced a revolution in military equipment, tactics, and political consequences. The hoplite phalanx dominated battlefields for centuries and shaped civic values across the Greek world. While there is some uncertainty regarding the precise dating of the first hoplite equipment and tactics, most evidence suggests hoplite warfare was fully developed around 650 BCE. The hoplite phalanx provided military advantages through close-quarters fighting with spears and hoplite shields, which were enabled by economic changes allowing large-scale production of armor. The rise of hoplite armies also fueled the rise of democracy and shaped Greek social attitudes for generations. Hoplite warfare left a lasting legacy on ancient Greece that shaped its military, social, and political institutions.
