There are several factors that influence the supply and demand for land and housing. On the supply side, the availability of land suitable for residential development and the costs associated with preparing the land and building housing are key factors. Geographically constrained areas with little land available for new development will have a more limited supply. Areas with high costs for materials, labor, and regulatory compliance will also see supply suppressed to some degree. 

On the demand side, population growth and demographic changes are major drivers. Areas with strong population growth, especially among younger households looking to buy homes, will see higher demand for housing and land. In contrast, areas with stable or declining populations will likely see lower demand pressures. Affordability and access to financing also significantly impact demand. When mortgage rates are low and lending standards loosen, more households are able to afford homes, so demand rises. During credit crunches, demand falls sharply.

The local economy and job opportunities in an area also strongly influence demand for housing and land. Robust job growth means more people are moving into an area, looking to rent or buy homes. Struggling economies with few job prospects see outward migration and weaker demand. Changes in tastes and preferences can also affect demand, especially the popularity of lower- versus higher-density housing. The desire for larger homes and lots boosts demand for land, while preference for smaller spaces in walkable, transit-friendly neighborhoods reduces demand.

Land prices are ultimately determined by the interplay of supply and demand in the market for completed dwellings in an area. When demand is strong relative to supply, competition for homes leads builders and developers to pay more for land, since they can pass those costs onto buyers. The amount they can pay depends on several factors, including the selling price of completed homes, construction costs, profit margins, and market conditions.  Over time, as supply catches up to demand, price pressures ease and land prices stabilize or even fall.

In summary, a variety of demographic, economic, geographical, and social factors influence the supply of and demand for residential land and housing. Interactions between these supply and demand factors in local housing markets then determine the prices that builders and developers can pay for land to build homes. Changes in any factors can lead to changes in land and housing prices over time. Overall, well-functioning land and housing markets help match locations and prices of homes to the needs and means of those demanding them.
