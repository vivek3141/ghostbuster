The poems "How we have walked, How we have journeyed" by Nicholas Christopher, "Pan Recipe" by Leslea Newman, and "New World A-Comin'" by Al Young demonstrate the authors' poetic craft through their strategic use of metaphor, tense, parallelism, and subtle graphological deviation. These rhetorical devices not only provide rhythmic and musicality within each poem but also serve to underscore deeper thematic connections between these works.  

Christopher's poem "How we have walked, How we have journeyed" relies extensively on metaphor and parallelism to depict humanity's age-old quest for knowledge and meaning. The poem itself becomes a metaphor for this journey and quest as the "we" (representing humanity) has "walked" and "journeyed" through time. The metaphor compares seeking truth to a physical quest or odyssey. The repetition of "How we have" in each line reinforces this metaphor through parallel structure. The parallelism also gives the poem a steady, marching rhythm, physically representing the metaphorical journey.

Christopher continues to use metaphor to represent abstract ideas. The "black bottomless pool" suggests the unknown and humanity's desire to find meaning in life's deepest mysteries. The "trail of sweet smoke and perfume" metaphorically depicts an enticing but elusive path that leads to greater understanding, as humanity "followed and followed" it. The parallelism of "the monks ... scribbling, the monks ... illuminated" compares two means of gaining knowledge: through recording histories and through artistic embellishment. Both are attempts to understand life's meaning.

In a similar vein, Leslea Newman's "Pan Recipe" relies on food and cooking metaphors to represent finding purpose and meaning. The unconventional ingredients for "Pan" like "a cup of new moon" and "a tablespoon of bird song" suggest creating meaning and joy from simple, natural elements in life. The instruction to "blend in a warm place, in a quiet place" metaphorically conveys finding inner peace and harmony to make sense of the world. The metaphorical recipe format and sometimes nonsensical elements ("a dash of sunrise") give the poem a whimsical, dreamy quality, reinforcing its theme of imaginatively creating purpose.  

Like the other poems, "New World A-Comin'" also addresses humanity's search for meaning, but it does so by employing metaphor, tense, and parallelism in very different ways.  The poem begins in the present tense as the speaker addresses the metaphorical "new world a-cumin'" and considers how to navigate life's mysteries. However, the poem sharply shifts to future tense with "There will come soft rains," emphasizing the unknown future ang giving the poem a prophetic quality. This tension between the present and future enhances the poem's consideration of time's passage and humanity's eternal search for purpose.

The strategic use of metaphor, tense, parallelism, and other rhetorical devices give these three poems deeper thematic cohesion and power. Though they approach the topic in different ways, at their core they each poignantly represent humanity's timeless attempt to find meaning and understand our world. The musicality and metaphors of the poetry underscore these profound ideas, giving the reader a sense of connection across the ages to those who have asked the same questions about life. Though the future remains uncertain, the poetry suggests finding meaning in simple moments and charting our own purposeful journey.
