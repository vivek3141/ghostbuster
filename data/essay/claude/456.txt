There is substantial research showing a linkage between job satisfaction and job performance. When employees are satisfied with their jobs, they tend to perform better. Job satisfaction refers to an employee's attitudes and feelings towards their job. Key determinants of satisfaction are intrinsic job factors like skill variety, task identity, autonomy, and feedback, as well as extrinsic factors like pay, supervision, and working conditions. Job performance refers to the outcomes of a job, including productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness. Key determinants of performance are knowledge, skills, abilities, effort, and job demands.

Several studies have found positive correlations between job satisfaction and performance, suggesting they are related. For example, a meta-analysis of 312 studies found an average correlation of 0.30 between satisfaction and performance (Judge et al., 2001). The relationship is not perfect, however, as other factors like motivation, abilities, support, and luck also influence performance. While satisfaction may contribute to performance, high performance can also increase satisfaction through rewards and recognition. The relationship is likely reciprocal.

Managers should consider both individual and cultural differences in enhancing satisfaction and performance. At the individual level, managers should design jobs that provide intrinsic motivation by giving employees autonomy, feedback, task variety, and clear roles. They should also offer extrinsic motivators like competitive pay, good supervision, and safe working conditions. Providing the right mix of motivators can increase both satisfaction and performance for each employee based on their unique needs and priorities. 

At the cultural level, managers must recognize that the importance placed on job satisfaction and specific motivators varies across cultures. For example, employees from collectivist cultures may value relationships and group work satisfaction more than those from individualist cultures. Diverse, equitable, and inclusive organizational cultures that value all employees can also boost both satisfaction and performance by making people feel respected and motivated.

In summary, job satisfaction and performance are reciprocally related, with satisfaction contributing to performance and vice versa. Managers should employ intrinsic and extrinsic motivators to enhance satisfaction and performance, tailored to individual and cultural differences. An inclusive organizational culture is also key. By focusing on these factors, managers can create a motivated, productive, and satisfied workforce.
