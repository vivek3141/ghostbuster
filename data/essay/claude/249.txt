Hua Guofeng succeeded Mao Zedong as the paramount leader of China following Mao's death in 1976. However, Hua's hold on power was short-lived. Within just two years, Deng Xiaoping had emerged as the de facto leader of China, and Hua was marginalized and eventually removed from power. There were several factors that led to Hua's rapid downfall. 

First, Hua lacked a strong independent power base. He was a relatively obscure figure who Mao had elevated shortly before his death. Hua did not have deep connections within the Communist Party or the military, unlike Deng who had been a high-ranking official for decades. When Mao passed away, Hua's authority came solely from being Mao's handpicked successor, but that was a weak foundation of power with Mao gone.

Second, Hua mishandled the legacy of Mao. On the one hand, Hua tried to portray himself as the true heir to Mao as a way to legitimize his power. He continued and even intensified some of Mao's radical policies like the Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius Campaign. However, Hua did not have Mao's charisma or authority, and his policies were seen as excessive by many in the party. On the other hand, Hua began moving away from some of Mao's most damaging policies, in particular ending the Cultural Revolution. This angered Mao's radical supporters but did not win over moderates in the party who saw Hua as an opportunist using Mao's name. Hua was caught between these opposing forces, unable to fully embrace or reject Mao's legacy.

Third, Deng Xiaoping outmaneuvered Hua politically. Deng had widespread support within the party, and he cleverly undermined Hua's authority while formally accepting Hua's leadership. Deng overturned many of Hua's policies, especially ending the radical leftist campaigns. Deng also brought many of his allies into key positions of power. By 1978, Deng and his supporters dominated the government, and Hua was marginalized as a nominal figurehead. Deng forced Hua into early retirement in 1980, completing his consolidation of control.

In conclusion, Hua Guofeng lacked political skills and a strong enough power base to maintain control of China following Mao's death. His uncertain handling of Mao's complex legacy weakened his authority, as he failed to satisfy either radical Maoists or moderates looking for reforms. Meanwhile, the shrewd Deng Xiaoping outflanked Hua by gaining control of the key levers of power within the party and government. Within a few years, Deng had eclipsed Hua without a violent power struggle, bringing the short-lived Hua era to an end. The legacy of Mao ultimately proved too great a burden for Hua to overcome.
