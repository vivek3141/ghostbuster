Husserl's method of phenomenological reduction involves suspending all assumptions about the nature of reality and focusing instead on the intuitive constitution of consciousness and experience. This method leads to metaphysical idealism, despite Husserl's denial of any such commitment. 

To understand Husserl's phenomenological reduction, we must first understand his critique of psychologism and naturalism. Husserl argued that naturalistic sciences like psychology commit the "naturalistic fallacy" by uncritically assuming that consciousness can be understood in naturalistic terms. For Husserl, consciousness cannot be naturalized and reduced to material causesâ€”it has its own proper domain of meanings, essences, and intuitions. Likewise, psychologism commits the fallacy of reducing logical and mathematical truths to psychological processes. Against these views, Husserl argued for a phenomenological science that brackets these assumptions and focuses on the essential structures of consciousness.

The phenomenological reduction, then, involves "bracketing" or suspending all assumptions about the natural world and the psychophysical nature of human beings. We refrain from positing the real existence of the world and our own psychophysical nature. Instead, we turn our attention wholly to the essential structures of consciousness and intuition. What is left is the sphere of "pure consciousness" and its objectivated correlates, the phenomena of consciousness. As Husserl puts it, "we put out of action the general positing which belongs to the essence of the natural attitude, we parenthesize everything which that positing encompasses with respect to existence." 

This reduction to pure consciousness, Husserl argues, does not entail metaphysical idealism or solipsism. He claims phenomenology is "strictly neutral" regarding metaphysics and naturalism. However, many of Husserl's critics argue that the phenomenological reduction inevitably leads to metaphysical idealism. Once we bracket the existence of the natural world, it becomes difficult to re-instate the world as anything other than a correlate of consciousness. The lifeworld itself seems to be constituted by consciousness, even if Husserl denies this is his view.

Paul Ricoeur argues that Husserl's method implicitly relies on a "foundation of idealism" that Husserl failed to recognize. The reduction to pure consciousness cuts us off from the world such that "consciousness finds itself alone, in a region where nothing exists except through it and for it." While Husserl insisted that phenomenology could remain metaphysically neutral, "the road he traveled led, in spite of his precautions and protestations, to idealism."
