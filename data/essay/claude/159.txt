The study of international relations is diverse and complex, with many theories attempting to make sense of the interactions between states and non-state actors on the global stage. Some of the major theoretical frameworks include liberalism, neo-liberalism, realism, neo-realism, and Marxism. Each theory makes certain assumptions about human nature, state behavior, and the driving forces behind international politics. However, no single theory encompasses the complexity and diversity of the international system.   

Liberalism assumes that states can cooperate to achieve absolute or relative gains, and that international institutions and regimes can facilitate this cooperation. Liberals believe that democratic institutions within states can spread to the international level, fostering peace and cooperation. Neo-liberalism builds upon these ideas but with more emphasis on complex interdependence between states and non-state actors in a globalized world. However, both liberalism and neo-liberalism underestimate conflicts of interest between states and the role that power and security concerns play in global politics.

In contrast, realism assumes that the international system is anarchic and states are the key actors primarily concerned with power and security. States seek to maximize their power relative to other states, leading to conflicts of interest and a lack of cooperation. However, traditional realism cannot account for the rise of non-state actors and globalization. neo-realism incorporates these factors but still sees power and security competition between states as the defining feature of international relations. While realism highlights important factors, its narrow focus on states and material power is limiting.

Marxism also plays an important role in international relations theory. Different Marxist approaches share some assumptions, such as viewing the global capitalist system as the primary driver of international politics. However, Marxists disagree on whether the key actors are classes, the bourgeoisie and proletariat within states, or the core states versus peripheral states in the world system. Marxism provides some compelling insights but often adopts an overly deterministic view of the impact of economic forces on global politics.

In conclusion, there is no single theory that can account for the diversity and complexity of international relations. Each theory has certain strengths as well as weaknesses and gaps. To understand international relations, these theories should be combined and their assumptions reassessed based on contemporary global events. A eclectic theoretical approach, rather than strict adherence to any particular theory, will provide the most comprehensive understanding of international politics in an increasingly globalized world.
