John Locke was an influential British philosopher who developed an empiricist theory of knowledge that differed significantly from the rationalist views of philosophers like Ren√© Descartes. Where Descartes believed knowledge is attained primarily through reason and intellectual intuition, Locke argued that all knowledge arises from sense experience. In his Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Locke lays out an empirical account of perception and knowledge acquisition that contrasts with Descartes' rationalism.

For Locke, perception refers to the passive reception of ideas through the senses. He defines an idea as "whatsoever is the object of the understanding when a man thinks" or "whatever the mind perceives in itself, or is the immediate objects of perception, thought, or understanding."  Ideas enter the mind from either sensation (external perception) or reflection (internal perception of the mind's own operations). So all perception and knowledge begins with ideas derived from sense experience. This stands in contrast to Descartes' view that we have innate ideas and knowledge that are not derived from the senses.

Locke articulates a representative theory of perception, meaning that the immediate objects of perception are not material things in the external world themselves but rather the ideas or mental representations of those things. We do not perceive external objects directly but only through the mediation of ideas. Ideas resemble but do not duplicate the qualities that produce them. This representational nature of perception, Locke argues, shows why we cannot have a perfectly transparent grasp of the external world. While our ideas resemble external qualities, "they are not [those qualities], nor can possibly represent them perfectly."  

Perception itself, for Locke, is a passive rather than an active process. The mind does not determine what ideas are received through sensation; it simply registers the information that is transmitted to it. The mind is a "blank canvas" that is filled through the passive reception of simple ideas in sensation and reflection. This is contrary to Descartes' view of the mind as an active intellect that contributes to its own ideas through reason and intellectual intuition. 

While Locke's empirical theory of perception provides the foundation for knowledge, he recognizes inherent limitations and uncertainties in human perception and understanding. Because knowledge is built on ideas received through the senses, it can never be more perfect or exact than the ideas themselves. Simple ideas may be adequate for some purposes, but they do not always transparently represent the microscopic structures of bodies that produce them. Locke also notes that the secondary qualities of bodies (colors, sounds, smells) are produced in us by the primary qualities of bodies (size, shape, motion) but do not actually resemble those primary qualities.

In summary, Locke articulated an empirical theory of perception and knowledge that is founded on sense experience rather than reason alone. Perception refers to the passive reception of ideas, which represent the qualities of external objects. The representative nature of perception, and its basis in imperfect sensory information, places natural limits on human understanding. While Locke shared Descartes' goal of philosophical certainty, he located the source of all knowledge in the senses rather than in innate reason. Locke's epistemology thus provides a critical contrast to the rationalism of philosophers like Descartes.
