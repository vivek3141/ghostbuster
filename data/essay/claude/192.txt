The Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Act (DVCVA) 2004 is a UK law aimed at protecting victims and punishing perpetrators of domestic violence and abuse. A key provision of the DVCVA is that it created new criminal offenses related to domestic abuse, including willful assault, battery, wounding, and child abuse that lead to the death of a child. 

In the tragic case of R vs. Leanne Williams, the DVCVA and related laws were applied. Leanne Williams was convicted of the manslaughter of her 2-year-old daughter, Amy, in 2009. Amy suffered a fatal brain injury after being thrown into a wall by her mother. Leanne Williams had a history of violence against Amy, with hospital records showing Amy had unexplained bruises and injuries on several occasions leading up to her death.

Leanne Williams was initially charged with murder, but the prosecution accepted her guilty plea to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. The judge ruled that Williams suffered from recurrent depressive disorder and a borderline personality disorder, which impaired her ability to form rational judgments and exercise self-control. However, the judge also stated Williams' behavior involved "gratuitous violence" against a "small, vulnerable child."

Under the DVCVA, the judge considered aggravating factors like the death of a child, the trauma to other family members who witnessed the violence, and the abuse of trust inherent in a parent-child relationship. The judge sentenced Williams to 9 years in prison, a relatively severe punishment for manslaughter, stating "no sentence I pass can bring Amy back or reflect the loss suffered."

Leanne Williams could also have been charged under the Child Abduction Act 1984 for failing to protect Amy from violence, or the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 for willfully assaulting, ill-treating, neglecting, abandoning or exposing Amy in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury. The inquest into Amy's death also found the local authority children's services department was aware of concerns for Amy's safety, but errors were made in how the case was handled. The council accepted responsibility and committed to improving procedures.

In summary, the DVCVA and related laws aim to punish abusers like Leanne Williams to the fullest extent of the law, especially when a child dies due to violence in the home. The DVCVA also seeks to hold agencies and individuals accountable if they fail to protect victims. Tragic cases like Amy's show why laws are still needed to prevent and criminalize all forms of domestic violence. Overall, the DVCVA has been effective in achieving its stated goals, but continued enforcement and public support are needed to truly combat domestic abuse.
