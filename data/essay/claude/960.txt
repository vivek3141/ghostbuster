Bram Stoker's renowned Gothic horror novel Dracula, published in 1897, reflects the anxieties and tensions surrounding female sexuality and the emerging New Woman movement in Victorian society. The New Woman movement of the late 19th century challenged traditional gender roles and conceptions of sexuality. New Women were educated, independent career women who were politically engaged and determined to shape their own destinies. They rejected the notion that a woman's purpose was to be a dutiful wife and mother. 

Stoker's novel explores these societal fears about female sexuality and independence through the contrasting female characters of Mina Harker and Lucy Westenra. Mina is portrayed as the ideal Victorian woman - intelligent but submissive, chaste and dedicated to her husband. In contrast, Lucy is depicted as a passionate and free-spirited young woman who eagerly explores her suitors' affection. After Lucy succumbs to Dracula's vampiric influence, she becomes sexually aggressive, predatory and dangerous - embodying the threat of unconstrained female sexuality.

Stoker suggests that for a woman to give in to her own passions and desires leads only to corruption and destruction. The male characters must protect Mina's virtue and restrain Lucy's primal urges. Only by destroying the vampirized Lucy can order be restored. The staking of Lucy is a symbolic punishment of her uncontrolled female desire and a reassertion of patriarchal authority over women's sexuality.

Mina's character is complex and ambiguous. Although she is portrayed as the ideal dutiful wife, she is also determined, courageous and intelligent in assisting the men with their quest to defeat Dracula. However, her brief connection to Dracula via a blood transfusion leaves her tainted and open to temptation. She admits that she felt a strange connection to Dracula that both frightened and excited her. The male characters' anxious desire to protect Mina suggests a fear that even ideal women harbor a primal and uncontrollable sexuality that threatens the foundations of a patriarchal social order.

In conclusion, Stoker's Dracula reflects the deep anxieties surrounding female sexuality, desire, and empowerment that were provoked by the New Woman movement. The novels' treatment of its female characters reveals a conceptual struggle between Victorian ideals of women as chaste, dutiful wives and the emerging vision of women as independent and sexually liberated beings. The defeat of the vampirized Lucy and the salvation of Mina's virtue can be read as a symbolic restoration of the status quo in which female passion and desire are constrained within the institution of marriage and women's traditional gender role.
