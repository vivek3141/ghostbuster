Religious practices among Catholic laity witnessed significant changes during the early modern period in Europe from 1500 to 1750. However, the extent and nature of these changes, as well as their uniformity across regions, remain subjects of historical debate. 

Some historians, like Jean Delumeau, have emphasized the vitality and continuity of Catholic religious practices during this period. Delumeau argues that Catholics remained deeply devoted to traditional religious rituals like processions, pilgrimages and the veneration of relics. He points out that new confraternities and devotional groups actually spread Catholic practices to more people. However, other historians like John Bossy contend that the Reformation and Catholic Reformation spurred more substantial changes, like a new focus on interior devotion and less emphasis on outward ritual.

The work of Ellen Hsia and Robert Birely represents a middle ground. They argue that while some new practices emerged, especially among the educated elite, most Catholics continued with long-held traditions. However, popular religious rituals were infused with more personal sentiment than in the Middle Ages. Hsia sees this in the spread of private devotions like the rosary as well as greater emotional expressiveness. Birely similarly points to the rise of baroque mysticism and a "devotional revival." 

Regional variations in religious practices across Europe also challenge notions of uniform change. For instance, while Hsia finds a flourishing "devotionalism" in 17th-century Rome that expressed emotional piety through rituals, art and architecture, Paula Findlen sees more restrained and intellectualized piety in 18th-century Venice. Historians like Alison Forrestal have also shown how local politics and culture in Lyon, France produced religious rituals and organizations with little connection to broader continental trends.

In conclusion, while new personal and interiorized forms of Catholic devotion emerged during the early modern period, traditional rituals and practices remained widespread. The extent and nature of changes in religious practice ultimately depended on both era and locality. The interpretations of Delumeau, Bossy, Hsia and Birely all capture elements of the diverse realities of Catholic life in Europe between 1500 and 1750. Overall, there was no single or uniform process of change in how ordinary Catholics lived, thought about and worshipped during these transformative centuries in Europe.
