The theory of endosymbiosis proposes that certain organelles within eukaryotic cells, specifically mitochondria and chloroplasts, evolved from free-living prokaryotic organisms. According to the theory, these prokaryotes were engulfed by ancestral eukaryotic cells as endosymbionts and, over millions of years of coevolution, developed into permanent and essential organelles of the eukaryotic cell. The endosymbiosis theory is supported by several lines of evidence from genetics, biochemistry, and cell biology.

At the genetic level, mitochondria and chloroplasts contain their own small circular DNA genomes that resemble bacterial genomes. These organelle genomes are separate from the larger genome found in the cell nucleus. The DNA sequences of organelle genomes also closely match certain types of bacteria, with those of mitochondria resembling alpha-proteobacteria and those of chloroplasts resembling cyanobacteria. In addition, mitochondrial and chloroplast ribosomes and transfer RNAs closely resemble those of bacteria. These genetic clues indicate that organelles share an evolutionary history with bacteria. 

Biochemically, mitochondria and chloroplasts also show similarities to bacteria. They have their own ribosomes and synthesize some of their own proteins. Their membranes contain lipids and proteins characteristic of bacterial membranes but distinct from other eukaryotic cell membranes. Mitochondria and chloroplasts also possess their own enzymes and pathways for producing energy, fatty acids, amino acids, and nucleotides that closely resemble bacterial systems. For example, chloroplasts carry out oxygen-producing photosynthesis using machinery nearly identical to that found in cyanobacteria.

At the cellular level, mitochondria and chloroplasts replicate independently like bacteria, dividing and increasing in number. They also share similarities in size, shape, and internal structure with some types of bacteria. Mitochondria in particular resemble alpha-proteobacteria, while chloroplasts resemble photosynthetic cyanobacteria. These morphological resemblances provide further support for their bacterial origins.

Some scientists have proposed alternative theories to endosymbiosis to explain the origins of organelles. However, genetic, biochemical, and cellular evidence overwhelmingly supports endosymbiosis as the explanation for how mitochondria and chloroplasts came to reside in eukaryotic cells. The implications of this are profound, as it highlights the important role that cooperation between organisms played in the early evolution of complex life. By acquiring bacterial endosymbionts, eukaryotes gained access to new metabolic functions that enabled them to become vastly more complex and ecologically successful. Endosymbiosis was a crucial evolutionary innovation that shaped all subsequent eukaryotic life.
