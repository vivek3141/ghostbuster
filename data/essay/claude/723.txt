Gothic literature of the nineteenth century reflected many of the societal issues and anxieties of the time period, especially related to conceptions of the individual and subjectivity. The Gothic trope of blurring the boundaries between dream and reality also worked to problematize and unsettle the reader's understanding of the self, reflecting the unstable and liminal nature of identity in an era marked by increasing individualism and the breakdown of traditional social categories.

George Byron's poem Manfred (1817) explores a person questioning his own identity and place in the world, reflecting a contemporary focus on the individual. The eponymous character Manfred is a brooding and isolated figure who wanders the Alps, pondering his mysterious and tormented past. The exact nature of his sins remains veiled, reflecting a sense of uncertainty and liminality regarding his actual identity and deeds. Manfred embodies the Byronic hero: a figure marked by brooding romanticism, rebellion, and a defiant assertion of the self, reflecting a new form of heroism centered on the cult of individualism. However, Manfred is ultimately punished for this assertion of the self, reflecting anxieties about unrestrained individualism.

Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818) also deals with the theme of questionable individualism and the angst of the era. Victor Frankenstein's act of creation is a gross violation and distortion of the natural order, reflecting fears of scientific progress and the Industrial Revolution. The monster serves as a doppelgänger for his creator, and his rejection by society reflects a deep-seated anxiety about those who deviate from social norms. The blurring of creator and created, natural and unnatural, reflects a liminal space in conceptions of human identity and the self during the era. This liminality is heightened by the nested frame narrative structure, where multiple levels of voices blur into one another, and reality and fiction merge, leaving both the reader as well as characters grasping for certainty. 

John Keats's poetry makes use of dreamlike, fantastical imagery and explores ideals of beauty, reflecting the Romantic era's focus on imagination, emotion, and escape from mundanity. His poetry is marked by richness of imagery, sensuality of language, and a play between illusion and reality. In poems like "The Eve of St. Agnes" (1819), Keats blends hyperrealistic detail with fantastical, dreamy atmospheres to problematize the boundary between the real and imagined while reflecting the era's concern with extreme emotions and experience. The Gothic trope of the liminal space between dream and reality thus allows for an escape from normal temporal and physical laws.

Overall, Gothic literature of the nineteenth century reflected a period marked by anxieties about identity, individualism, and social change. By depicting brooding, defiant yet tortured characters, exploring unsettling distortions of the natural order, and blurring the lines between reality and imagination, Gothic literature reflected a liminal space in conceptions of identity, reflected the problematic nature of unrestrained self-assertion, and allowed for escape from societal issues into a space of disturbing fantasy and subconscious drives and desires—all of which reflected the major intellectual, social and economic issues of the era.
