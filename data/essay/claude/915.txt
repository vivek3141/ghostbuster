Multi-level governance refers to the sharing of decision-making power across different tiers of government at the local, regional, national and supranational levels. This has significantly impacted local governments in several ways. First, local authorities have had to adapt to work with agencies and partners across levels of government to provide public services. Multi-agency networks and partnerships have become more common, where different organizations at multiple levels pool resources and responsibilities to offer services. While this can improve service coordination and address complex policy issues that span jurisdictions, it also introduces challenges around aligning goals, sharing resources, and accountability. 

Second, local governments have had to navigate the dynamics of governance that now operate at multiple levels, not just the local level. Local authorities have to implement policies and legislation that originate from regional, national and European Union levels of government. There is a tension between top-down control from higher levels of government and bottom-up local autonomy. The European Union has brought an additional layer of governance that influences local governments, including regulations, funding programs and policy requirements. Local governments have had to build relationships and partnerships with EU institutions and follow EU directives and policies in areas like the environment, transportation and trade.

In England, the Local Government Act 2000 introduced directly-elected mayors to some local authorities, giving citizens more direct control and accountability over decision making at the local level. Directly-elected mayors have the potential to provide strong local leadership and bring more prominence to the role of mayor. However, there is also a risk of tension between mayors and local councils, and confusion over who is ultimately responsible and accountable for local authority actions. The role and powers of directly-elected mayors continue to evolve in practice.

Planning is a policy area that uniquely operates at all levels of government, from the local planning authority up to the national government. In England, the National Planning Policy Framework sets out the national planning policies for local planning authorities to follow in their local plans. While local authorities have flexibility to address local priorities, they must do so within the broader framework established nationally. National policies aim to balance top-down consistency with bottom-up local needs and authority. However, tension can emerge between local desires for development and national policies protecting the environment and countryside.

In conclusion, multi-level governance creates opportunities for improved policymaking and service delivery but also tensions that local governments must navigate. Partnerships across levels of government are increasingly necessary but also introduce challenges. Local authorities have less autonomy but also new tools for local control, as with directly-elected mayors. And planning requires balancing national direction with local priorities. Overall, local governments in England have had to adapt to a more complex system of multi-level governance with both benefits and drawbacks.
