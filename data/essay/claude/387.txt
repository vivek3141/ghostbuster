E.T.A. Hoffmann was a key figure of German Romanticism in the early 19th century known for his fantastical and uncanny tales that explore the relationship between the real and the supernatural. In his story "Das Marchen" ("The Fairytale"), Hoffmann masterfully uses the character of Anselmus to examine how the real and supernatural interact and to explore deeper ideas about fate and human existence. 

Anselmus starts out as a cheerful and dreamy student, disconnected from the harsh realities of the world. He lives in "a little garden of Eden" surrounded by "overwhelmingly beautiful" flowers in a state of childlike wonder and joy. However, his innocence leaves him unable to cope with the disorder and "madness" of the outside world. When he meets the mysterious Serpentina, who seems to embody both the real woman Veronica and a supernatural serpent-spirit, Anselmus descends into madness in his attempts to reconcile these two halves of the same person.

Hoffmann suggests that the human mind cannot comprehend the co-existence of the real and supernatural, which results in madness. Anselmus' mind unravels as he tries to apply "earthly logic" to the fantastical Serpentina. His friend Heinrich warns him that "our philosophers have excluded from the realm of possibility anything that does not conform to the usual natural laws." Anselmus ultimately requires a "purifying thunderstorm‚Äù to shock him out of his deranged state by choosing to embrace the fantastical and reject this limited logic. The story suggests human existence can only be fulfilled through an acceptance of the magical and mystical, not by reason alone.

A recurring metaphor used to represent the real and fantastical is the interplay between light and shadow. Anselmus first sees Serpentina "in the shadowy light of the last evening glow." She seems to disappear and re-emerge from the shadows, embodying this duality of light and dark. Similarly, Anselmus enters a "shadowy realm of mystery" when he descends into madness. Hoffmann frequently uses shadow, moonlight, dusk and nighttime as symbolic realms where the real and fantastical intersect. 

Ultimately, Hoffmann suggests that fate predetermines human existence, but we have free will in how we choose to perceive our fate. Though Anselmus' fate leads him into madness and despair, he is able to find redemption through choosing to view his fate through the lens of the fantastical instead of trying to impose reason. Hoffmann appears to believe that while we cannot escape our destiny, we can choose the meaning we ascribe to life's events. Through the journey of Anselmus, the reader learns that the fantastical should not be feared but embraced as a fundamental part of human existence.

In conclusion, through the complex character of Anselmus, Hoffmann masterfully explores how the real and supernatural interact and their impact on human existence. He suggests that reason alone is limiting, and true understanding requires an acceptance of the fantastical. Though fate shapes human destiny, we have the free will to perceive our fate through the magical or logical. Ultimately, Hoffmann appears to advocate for embracing the fantastical as a means to achieve a more meaningful existence.
