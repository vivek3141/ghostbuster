People are motivated to work hard for a variety of reasons that can be interpreted both positively and negatively. Positively, people may be intrinsically motivated by a sense of passion or purpose, believing in the mission and values of an organization or leader. However, these motivations can be interpreted negatively as a form of misguided loyalty that leads to the exploitation of workers. People may also be extrinsically motivated by rewards and incentives like compensation, benefits, promotions or recognition. While these motivations can drive productivity, an overreliance on extrinsic rewards can backfire and reduce intrinsic motivation.  

Historically, employees were viewed more as replaceable cogs in a machine during the era of scientific management. Today, businesses recognize that employees are human assets to be developed and empowered. Approaches like job enrichment, autonomy, and shared purpose aim to tap into intrinsic motivation by giving employees more meaningful work and a sense of ownership over their jobs. Businesses also use incentive pay like bonuses, profit sharing, and stock options to motivate employees extrinsically according to performance and company growth.

While financial incentives and shareholding schemes can be effective at motivating some employees and aligning interests with company success, they also have potential downsides. Those only motivated by money may take unethical actions to gain rewards or cut corners to improve short-term performance at the expense of long-term sustainability. Incentives can also promote unhealthy internal competition and a "star culture" where a few top performers gain a disproportionate share of rewards. Income inequality can negatively impact cooperation, trust, and team cohesion.

To ensure incentive schemes are fair and effective, businesses should connect rewards to meaningful metrics that reflect long-term strategy. They should balance individual and team-based incentives to promote both internal cooperation and competition. Businesses should also consider non-monetary forms of recognition and reward that tap into intrinsic motivation. Fairness is key - incentive schemes should be transparent and equitable, with rewards proportional to contribution. Excessively disproportionate pay can damage employee morale and trust in leadership.   

In summary, while there are many reasons why people work hard that can drive productivity, businesses must be careful not to rely entirely on approaches that activate extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is a more sustainable driver of effort and excellence. Businesses should empower employees through meaningful work and shared purpose to tap into this intrinsic motivation. They should also structure incentive and reward schemes judiciously and fairly to motivate and align employees' interests with long-term company success. Achieving this balance will enable businesses to prosper through the efforts of motivated and committed employees.
