The hydrogen hypothesis proposes that the acquisition of organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, by early eukaryotic cells provided a competitive advantage by increasing their capacity for energy production. Specifically, mitochondria enabled more efficient aerobic respiration, generating up to 18 times more ATP than anaerobic processes. Chloroplasts enabled photosynthesis, providing cells with a source of high-energy carbohydrates and oxygen. 

The hydrogen hypothesis argues that the energy benefits of organelles drove their evolution and spread. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, organelles provide eukaryotic cells with dramatically increased energy production capacity. Mitochondria enable aerobic respiration, which generates up to 18 times more ATP than anaerobic processes. Photosynthesis by chloroplasts produces high-energy carbohydrates and oxygen. This boost in energy and resources likely provided a strong selective advantage to early eukaryotic cells that acquired these organelles.

Second, comparative genomics studies show that mitochondria and chloroplasts descended from free-living bacteria that developed a symbiotic relationship with early eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria descended from alpha-proteobacteria, while chloroplasts descended from cyanobacteria. These bacterial progenitors already had the capacity for aerobic respiration and photosynthesis, respectively, so their acquisition endowed eukaryotic cells with these abilities. The genes for these abilities were transferred to the eukaryotic genome over evolutionary time. This transfer of bacterial genomes provides evidence that mitochondria and chloroplasts did descend from once free-living bacteria.

Third, mitochondria and chloroplasts maintain their own genomes and machinery for transcription and translation. They also reproduce independently by dividing in two. These are characteristics of their bacterial ancestors and support the idea that these organelles were once free-living bacteria. Over time, most of their genes were transferred to the nuclear genome, but they retained some of their original genetic independence and ability to self-reproduce.

In conclusion, several lines of evidence support the hydrogen hypothesis that the acquisition of mitochondria and chloroplasts provided early eukaryotic cells with an evolutionary advantage due to increased energy production capacity. Their bacterial ancestry, retention of some bacterial-like characteristics, and dramatic boost to eukaryotic energy production all point to the selective benefits that drove the spread of these organelles and shaped the evolution of complex eukaryotic cells.
