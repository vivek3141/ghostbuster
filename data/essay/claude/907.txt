Working as a Front Office Receptionist at Cowley Manor hotel over the summer of 2019 has been an incredibly valuable experience for me. Although the role had its challenges, I learned many important lessons that have helped me grow as a person. 

One of the most significant strengths I identified through my reflective journals and appraisals was my ability to provide excellent customer service. I have always enjoyed interacting with people and making them feel welcome and appreciated. In my role at Cowley Manor, I was able to do that every day in greeting guests, handling their requests and complaints, and ensuring their stay was as pleasant as possible. My managers frequently praised me for going the extra mile for guests and for receiving positive reviews and feedback as a result. This reinforced for me how important this skill is for any role involving customer interaction and motivated me to continue developing it.

However, the role also highlighted some key areas of weakness for me, especially around leadership and delegating responsibility. As the most experienced receptionist, I was expected to guide and direct the others at times. However, I struggled with clearly communicating tasks and felt uncomfortable strictly monitoring them. I wanted to maintain a friendly rapport with my coworkers, but this made it difficult to also act as their leader. Through feedback in my appraisals, I recognized I needed to improve in providing clear direction and follow-up to achieve team goals. I also tended to take on more work myself instead of delegating, due to my perfectionism and desire to please others.

The experiences at Cowley Manor taught me many valuable lessons around conflict resolution and teamwork as well. Working in a fast-paced, service-centered role meant tensions and disagreements were inevitable at times. I improved in mediating issues with guests and coworkers in a manner that de-escalated conflict and left both parties feeling respected. However, there were also instances of unprofessional behavior from colleagues that left me unsure how to respond. In reflecting on these situations, I realized I needed to speak up more assertively when necessary and address concerns directly instead of avoiding them. 

Overall, my time at Cowley Manor has been pivotal in helping me identify both strengths and weaknesses central to my development as a professional in any industry. I hope to build on the skills and experience I gained by taking on new responsibilities and leadership opportunities in future roles. With continuous self-reflection and learning, I aim to advance my conflict resolution approaches, enhance my delegating and directing abilities, and boost my confidence in managing difficult situations proactively and professionally. The insights I have gained will be invaluable for the rest of my career.
