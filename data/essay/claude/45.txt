The authoritarian personality refers to a personality type that is characterized by an excessive need to submit to authority and wield power over others. People with authoritarian personalities tend to obey authority figures without question and believe in strict discipline and rigid social hierarchies. The theory of the authoritarian personality was developed in the aftermath of World War II to explain the rise of fascism in Germany and other fascist regimes. Researchers proposed that certain personality traits predisposed individuals to become ardent fascists and racists who would blindly follow authoritarian leaders like Hitler.  

Key characteristics of people with authoritarian personalities include conventionalism, authoritarian aggression, authoritarian submission, stereotypy, power and toughness, cynicism, and projectivity. They defer greatly to authority figures, are eager to attack dissenters in the name of authority, readily obey rules and social conventions, stereotype groups, value power and toughness in leaders, distrust others, and projecting their flaws onto marginalized groups. These traits are believed to develop in children who face extreme discipline, little affection, and strict norms about acceptable and unacceptable behavior. Such conditions teach children that authority should never be questioned and that dissent should be punished.

The theory of the authoritarian personality argues that widespread prejudices like racism and movements like fascism gain popularity because these beliefs and ideologies appeal to and are spread by people with authoritarian personalities. Those with authoritarian traits readily adopt racist beliefs because they stereotype others and project negative qualities onto marginalized groups. They also flock to fascist leaders and movements because they crave power, obedience, and conformity. The mass appeal of fascist propaganda capitalizes on people's prejudices and desire for law, order and discipline.  

While the theory provides valuable insights, it has been criticized on several grounds. The theory relies too heavily on Freudian concepts that lack empirical evidence. The theory also focuses too narrowly on personality to explain complex social phenomena like fascism. In addition, critics argue the theory wrongly implies that authoritarianism exists only on the political right. The Right-Wing Authoritarianism scale was developed to address some of these limitations. It measures authoritarianism along three dimensions—authoritarian submission, aggression and conventionalism—across the ideological spectrum. 

In conclusion, the theory of the authoritarian personality highlights how a particular personality type that develops in childhood can make individuals prone to unquestioningly obey authority and spread prejudiced attitudes. Although limited, the theory provides a valuable framework for understanding the rise of oppressive political movements and regimes. The insights from this theory remain highly relevant today in explaining current events across the world.
