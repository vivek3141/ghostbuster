What factors and evidence were used to inform a nursing decision and what theories of reasoning were applied? How did the nurse weigh potential risks against patient desires and needs in their decision-making process? Reflect on the decision-making process using the Gibbs reflective cycle and discuss the implications of this experience on future nursing practice.  

Making important medical decisions as a nurse requires careful consideration of multiple factors to determine the best course of action for a patient. In any decision-making scenario, the evidence and factors that inform the choice along with the reasoning and logic applied are key to understanding the thought process. For this reflective essay, I will examine a decision I made as a nurse regarding pain management for a cancer patient. The central issue was navigating the balance between the patient’s desire for increased pain medication and the risks of oversedation and respiratory depression.

The patient had advanced metastatic breast cancer which had spread to her bones and other organs. She was experiencing fluctuating severe pain that required increasingly higher doses of opioid medications to control. The standard procedures we had been using were increasing her OxyContin long-acting opioid and supplementing with Oxycodone as needed for breakthrough pain. However, on one particularly difficult shift, the patient described her pain as “excruciating” and “unbearable” despite receiving the maximum approved dosages of both OxyContin and Oxycodone. She was in obvious distress and begged the team for something more to relieve her pain.

The factors and evidence that informed my decision were the patient’s self-reported pain rating and observations of her distress, consulting with the physician on alternatives, researching additional pain management options, and weighing the risks of potential side effects. The primary reasoning applied was an ethical framework focused on beneficence for the patient and ensuring her pain was properly controlled and managed. On the other hand, the principles of nonmaleficence and “first, do no harm” were also considered regarding the risks of oversedation, respiratory depression, and reduced alertness if higher opioid doses were administered.

After re-assessing the patient’s vital signs and pain rating, I consulted with the physician about other options we could try to increase her pain relief while avoiding serious side effects. We decided a trial of methadone could be helpful as it is unlikely to cause respiratory depression at low doses and provides additive pain relief when combined with OxyContin and Oxycodone. I thoroughly researched methadone to understand appropriate dosing, administration protocols, and potential risks before adding it to the patient’s treatment plan. We started methadone at a low dose and monitored her closely for side effects.  The additional methadone, combined with her other medications, reduced the patient’s pain rating to tolerable levels without causing oversedation.

Using the Gibbs reflective cycle, I have described the situation, my initial thoughts, and the actions taken. The feelings I had were focused on reducing the patient's suffering while avoiding harm. The evaluation of this experience showed that with careful consideration of the factors, evidence, and reasoning involved, multiple medications at moderate doses could be combined safely for synergistic pain relief. For future practice, this experience reinforced the importance of thoroughly researching combination drug therapies and maintaining vigilance in monitoring for side effects. With close observation and gradual dose titration, the patient’s pain was brought under control without causing respiratory depression or oversedation, achieving the balance between patient desires and managing risks.

In conclusion, this reflective essay examined a clinical decision regarding pain management for an end-of-life cancer patient. The factors, evidence, and reasoning applied were described using an ethical framework centered on beneficence and avoiding harm. How the nurse weighed risks versus patient needs in the decision-making process was discussed. Finally, reflection on the implications for future nursing practice focused on safe and vigilant pain management practices especially when using combination drug therapies.
