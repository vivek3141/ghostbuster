The experiment conducted by Morris, Jones, and Hampson in 1978 aimed to investigate the relationship between context and forgetting. Specifically, they wanted to examine whether context could act as a cue to retrieve previously learned information that had not been accessed for some time. This study built upon the interference theory of forgetting, which proposes that memories can become inaccessible over time due to interference from other memories. However, memories may be retrievable if provided with the right cues, even after a prolonged period of forgetting. 

Morris et al. hypothesized that context may serve as an effective cue for retrieving information that was learned in that context, even after a long interval without access to that information. They tested this by having participants learn a set of words while in a particular room. After leaving that room for either 3 days or 31 days, participants returned to either the same room or a different room. Their memory for the words was then tested.

Results showed that participants who learned and were tested in the same room recalled more words than those tested in a different room. This was true even after 31 days, demonstrating that context could be an effective cue for retrieving memories that had not been accessed for a prolonged period of time. These findings supported both the role of context as a retrieval cue as well as the idea that memories may be temporarily inaccessible rather than permanently forgotten.

The current experiment aimed to replicate and extend these findings using a similar methodology. Participants learned a list of words in one of two distinctive virtual reality contexts. Their memory was tested either immediately, after 7 days, or after 28 days in either the same context or the different context. If context serves as an effective retrieval cue, memory should be best when tested in the same context, especially after longer retention intervals.

The results showed the expected pattern. Memory was superior when tested in the same context versus a different context. This difference increased over retention interval, with the greatest difference observed in the 28-day condition. This provides further evidence that context can be an important cue for accessing information that has not been retrieved for an extended time. These findings support both interference theory as well as the notion that so-called “forgotten” memories may still be intact if the right cues are provided.

In summary, the experiment by Morris et al. and the current study explored the relationship between context and forgetting. Their results suggest that context plays an important role as a retrieval cue, allowing access to memories that have not been retrieved for some time. While memories may become temporarily inaccessible due to interference, they are not necessarily permanently forgotten. With the right cues, such as the learning context, these memories can be retrieved even after prolonged periods of nonuse.
