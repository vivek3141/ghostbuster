To establish the tort of negligence, three crucial elements must be proven: duty of care, breach of duty, and damage caused by the breach. 

Duty of care refers to the responsibility that is placed on an individual requiring that they exercise a reasonable standard of care while performing any acts that could foreseeably harm others. It arises when a relationship of proximity or neighborhood exists between two parties. This could be due to a contractual relationship, a hazardous activity being carried out, or ordinary social interactions. For example, doctors have a duty of care to their patients, engineers owe a duty to anyone who could be harmed by faults in their designs, and all individuals must take reasonable care to avoid harming strangers they encounter in public. In these scenarios, harm is reasonably foreseeable if care is not taken.

The second element requires proving that the duty of care was breached through reckless, careless or intentional acts. This is assessed on an objective standard of reasonableness, measured against what a rational person in the defendant's position would do. For professionals, the standard is set higher and they must exercise the skill and competence expected of someone in their role. For example, if a doctor fails to diagnose a medical condition that should have been obvious given the symptoms and their knowledge, this would constitute a breach of duty. Similarly, if an engineer does not conduct necessary safety tests that would have revealed life-threatening design flaws, it would qualify as a breach. For ordinary individuals interacting with strangers, failing to exercise basic caution and respect for others' wellbeing can amount to a breach.

Finally, the breach must directly cause damage or injury to the plaintiff. The damage must not be too remote and the breach of duty must be shown to have materially contributed to its occurrence. For example, if a patient dies due to an undiagnosed illness, or someone is injured using a device with a faulty design, or a careless passerby knocks over and injures a stranger - in all these cases the link between breach and damage is direct. However, if faulty wiring in a building merely caused a power outage during which a resident stumbled and was injured, the damage may be too remote to attribute to the breach.

Proving breach of duty can often be challenging as it requires determining what constitutes reasonable care and skill in the circumstances. This is a complex, subjective assessment that considers the foreseeability of harm, the gravity of potential injury, custom and practice in a profession, availability of precautions, and the cost of implementation. For ordinary individuals, the standard of care owed to strangers is ambiguous and open to interpretation. However, ultimately what matters is whether the defendant exhibited the degree of care that would be expected of a reasonable, prudent person to avoid causing harm to others.

In conclusion, to establish negligence, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant owed them a duty of care, breached that duty through unreasonable actions, and directly caused damage as a result. While duty of care is relatively straightforward to establish based on relationships or foreseeability of harm, proving breach of duty can be complicated. But at its core, it comes down to whether the defendant failed to meet the standard of care that would be expected of a prudent, reasonable person.
