Liverpool's tourism industry relies on a network of stakeholders and their interactions to attract visitors and facilitate a positive experience. The key stakeholders are Liverpool City Council, Marketing Liverpool, transport operators, accommodation and restaurant providers, attractions managers, and tour operators. For Liverpool to continue increasing its visitor numbers and meet demand, especially following its success as European Capital of Culture 2008, it is important these stakeholders work together cohesively.   

Liverpool City Council and Marketing Liverpool are the leading stakeholders that set the strategic direction to promote Liverpool as a tourist destination. Liverpool City Council funds Marketing Liverpool to specifically drive tourism to the city. Marketing Liverpool develops and executes marketing campaigns, especially digital marketing and social media, to raise awareness of Liverpool's offerings and appeal to potential visitors. Its 'Visit Liverpool' branding and campaign have been largely successful, with Liverpool seeing a 50% increase in visitors from 2008 to 2018. However, more can be done to promote niche areas like Liverpool's musical heritage and maritime history. Collaborating with transport operators and attractions managers to cross-promote through discounts and package deals can also make Liverpool a more compelling tourist proposition.  

Transport operators, including airlines, rail and bus companies, are essential enablers of tourism as they transport visitors to and within Liverpool. Liverpool John Lennon Airport services direct flights from European hubs like Amsterdam and Barcelona, but more routes, especially long-haul, are needed as visitors from China and North America grow. Rail links with London and other UK cities require improvement. Within Liverpool, transport options to move tourists between attractions are adequate but can be expanded. Marketing Liverpool can work with transport operators to promote new routes and services to tap into new tourism markets. 

Accommodation and restaurant providers directly host visitors and significantly impact their experience. Liverpool has a shortage of high-quality hotels, especially 4- and 5-star, with occupancy rates of 82%, higher than the UK average. Mid-range hotels and budget options are also in demand. Property developers must be attracted to build new hotels. Restaurants, bars and nightlife in Liverpool are plentiful but tend to be concentrated in certain areas. Visitors need to be dispersed more widely across the city. Free or low-cost parking, and partnerships with transport operators for access deals can also encourage more visitors to restaurants. Overall, more coordination is required between Marketing Liverpool, Liverpool City Council and private property owners, restauranteurs and hoteliers to identify gaps, bid for new opportunities and facilitate development of new options at different price points.  

Key attractions like the Royal Albert Dock, Beatles Story, Merseyside Maritime Museum, Tate Liverpool and Sefton Palm House attract high volumes of visitors each year. Managers of these attractions must continually reinvest in and revamp their offerings to give repeat visitors unique reasons to return. Joint ticketing across attractions and cross-promotion on social media and online booking platforms can also make Liverpool a more compelling multi-day destination. Smaller attractions need more promotion to benefit from the visitor economy. Tour operators that bundle attractions, dining and accommodation should be supported to grow the tourism market.  

In conclusion, while Liverpool's tourism model has driven substantial growth over the last decade through strong collaboration between stakeholders, more work is needed to manage increasing demand, diversify products, attract investment and reach new visitor markets. Approaches used in other comparable port cities can provide benchmarks for Liverpool to build on its strengths, plug existing gaps, and create new opportunities for tourism and economic development. Overall, leveraging synergies between Liverpool City Council, Marketing Liverpool and private sector players will be key to cementing Liverpool's status as a world-class tourist destination.
