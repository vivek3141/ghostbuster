Relations between Britain and its American colonies steadily deteriorated over the course of the 18th century due to a series of taxes, trade regulations, and other policies imposed by the British government that stifled economic growth in America and infringed on colonists' rights as British subjects. The Sugar Act of 1764, Stamp Act of 1765, and Townshend Acts of 1767 imposed taxes on goods imported to the colonies and required payment in British currency, limiting trade and draining specie from the colonial economy. These acts provoked outrage among American colonists and led to growing anti-British sentiment.  

By the mid-18th century, Britain's policy was to limit westward expansion of American colonies while extracting revenue to help fund imperial administration. The Proclamation of 1763 prohibited settlement west of the Appalachians, restricting growth. The Navigation Acts required goods to be shipped on British ships with British crews, limiting trade. The Molasses Act of 1733 placed a tax on molasses imported from non-British colonies, damaging the rum industry. These policies favored British interests over those of Americans.

The Sugar Act of 1764 halved duties on molasses but imposed stricter enforcement, damaging the economy of New England. The Stamp Act of 1765 was a direct tax on legal documents, newspapers, and playing cards. It provoked outrage since it was a tax imposed without consent of elected representatives. The Stamp Act Congress convened to petition Parliament for repeal, articulating the argument that there should be "no taxation without representation." Parliament repealed the Stamp Act but passed the Declaratory Act, asserting its right to legislate for the colonies.

The Townshend Acts of 1767 taxed paint, paper, glass, and tea imported to America. In response, Americans boycotted British goods and resentment grew. British troops were sent to Boston in 1768 to enforce trade regulations, further angering locals. In 1770, British soldiers fired into a crowd in the Boston Massacre, killing several Americans. The tax on tea was retained when other Townshend duties were repealed in 1770.

In 1773, a tax on tea provoked the Boston Tea Party protest. In response, Parliament passed the Coercive Acts of 1774, known in America as the "Intolerable Acts." These acts punished Massachusetts, restricted local government, and quartered soldiers in colonists' homes. Americans formed the Continental Congress to coordinate opposition. 

When fighting broke out in 1775, the colonies were united against British rule. George III's refusal to consider American grievances and compromise intensified resentment of British rule. Economic policies benefiting Britain at the colonists' expense and violation of long-held rights and liberties fueled the desire for independence. The Declaration of Independence in 1776 articulated the colonists' grievances and cut ties with Britain, but the roots of this separation lay in decades of deteriorating relations.

In summary, a series of trade regulations, taxes, and punitive policies over decades stifled the American economy, infringed on colonists' rights, and bred resentment of British rule. Economic self-interest, abuse of power, and unwillingness to compromise or consider the legitimate grievances of American colonists ultimately led to the rupture of relations with Britain's most valuable colonies.
