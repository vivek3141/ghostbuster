Six conditions must be fulfilled to create a valid contract: agreement, consideration, intention to create legal relations, certainty, capacity, and legality. Firstly, there must be an agreement between parties to undertake a transaction or service. Next, each party must provide consideration - some benefit, interest or value created by the contract. Parties must also intend to be legally bound by the agreement, rather than just morally bound. The terms of the agreement must also be sufficiently certain, and both parties must have the legal capacity to enter into the agreement. Finally, the contract must be legal, meaning it does not violate any laws.   

An invitation to tender differs from an offer. An invitation to tender is an invitation to make an offer, which identifies the terms and conditions required to fulfill the contract. The offers submitted by bidders in response to the tender are evaluated, and the most advantageous offer is selected. An offer, on the other hand, is a promise to enter into a contract on specific terms by the party making the offer. The recipient of an offer is free to accept or reject the offer.   

There are rules regarding acceptance, revocation and communication of offers through post. Acceptance of an offer must be unconditional and communicated to the offeror. Until acceptance has been communicated to the offeror, either party may revoke their offer. If acceptance is communicated by post, it is deemed communicated at the time it is posted as per the postal acceptance rule. This rule applies even if the letter arrives late or does not arrive at all. 

In the given case study, Workwell Ltd issued an invitation to tender for a sub-contracting job, to which Drainklear submitted an offer. Workwell Ltd then awarded the contract to Highroad plc. Workwell cannot take legal action against Drainklear because there was no binding contract between them. Drainklear simply made an offer in response to Workwell's invitation to tender. Workwell was under no obligation to accept Drainklear's offer and was within their rights to award the contract to another party. 

When contracting with Highroad plc and searching for a new sub-contractor, Workwell Ltd should ensure their invitation to tender and any subsequent contract clearly outline expectations, responsibilities and terms to avoid uncertainty. They should also evaluate the capacity and legality of any offers received to avoid issues. Workwell should aim to minimize losses from this situation by maintaining open communication with Highroad plc and any new sub-contractors to facilitate cooperation and conflict resolution. Overall, to create a valid and enforceable contract, Workwell must fulfill all six conditions and follow appropriate offer and acceptance rules.
