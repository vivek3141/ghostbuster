Process Research and Development (PR&D) plays a crucial role in the pharmaceutical industry. It is responsible for developing efficient and cost-effective manufacturing processes to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and drug products. PR&D influences the drug development timeline by optimizing the manufacturing process in parallel with the clinical development of a new chemical entity (NCE). This parallel processing accelerates the overall timeline from drug discovery to market.   

The main sections within PR&D include process research, process development, and pilot plant operations. Process research focuses on developing innovative manufacturing processes for APIs and drug products. They aim to design synthetic routes, identify critical process parameters, and optimize reaction conditions. Process development further scales up and optimizes the processes developed by process research. They determine the critical process parameters and specifications to control variability. Pilot plant operations verify the robustness of the optimized process at a larger scale. They produce batches of APIs and drug products for clinical trials and stability testing.

PR&D can decrease development time and increase pipeline output in several ways. Firstly, beginning process research and development early in the drug discovery phase allows for parallel processing which saves time. Secondly, using tools like computational modeling and continuous processing can accelerate process research. Thirdly, quality by design (QbD) and design of experiments (DoE) help optimize processes faster while building quality into the process. Fourthly, utilizing platform technologies can expedite the development of similar molecules. Finally, seamless technology transfer from PR&D to manufacturing ensures efficient scale-up and reduced timelines.

An example of how PR&D solved a manufacturing problem is with the development of a modified-release dosage form of an API that showed poor flow properties and content uniformity issues. The PR&D team used QbD to study the impact of raw materials and processing parameters on the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the API. They identified the source of variability and adjusted the process parameters accordingly to achieve the target product profile. Additional experiments at pilot scale validated the robustness of the optimized process. The implementation of the new process and specifications enabled the successful development of the modified-release product.

In summary, PR&D plays an integral role in bringing a new drug to market by developing and optimizing manufacturing processes in parallel with clinical development.  Using modern tools and platforms, PR&D can significantly accelerate pharmaceutical development timelines and boost pipeline productivity. With the increasing complexity of drug molecules and delivery technologies, the role of PR&D will become even more crucial to translate innovative therapies to patients.
