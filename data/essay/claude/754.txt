Starbucks was founded in 1971 as a specialty coffee roaster and retailer. When Howard Schultz joined Starbucks in 1982, he helped transform it into a coffeehouse chain, modeling it after the coffee culture he had experienced in Italy. This shift in business orientation, from a retailer of coffee beans and equipment to a coffeehouse experience, marked Starbucks’ initial evolution.

In its early years as a coffeehouse, Starbucks focused on providing high-quality fresh-roasted whole bean coffees and rich Italian-style espresso beverages. It aimed to create an atmosphere where customers could relax, enjoy their coffee, and socialize or work. The Starbucks experience centered around quality coffee, an inviting ambience, and attentive customer service. This emphasis on customer experience helped differentiate Starbucks from other coffee retailers. 

In the 1990s, Starbucks expanded rapidly by opening numerous coffeehouses across North America. To support its growth, Starbucks focused on standardizing operations to ensure a consistent experience across all locations. It invested heavily in employee training and enabled customers to customize their drinks. While expanding its geographic reach, Starbucks was attentive to local tastes and preferences. This allowed Starbucks to scale up its operations successfully without compromising the customer experience that was core to its brand.

In the 2000s, Starbucks continued expanding globally, entering new markets in Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. To adapt to various cultures, Starbucks introduced new store formats, customized its menu, and collaborated with local business partners. It remained focused on high-quality arabica coffee but also added more non-coffee products like tea, food, and merchandise. Starbucks aimed to become a “third place” for customers to enjoy, in between home and work. Its comfortable, community-focused environment and amenities like free Wi-Fi made it a popular hangout spot.

More recently, Starbucks has focused on sustainability, social responsibility, and adapting to changing consumer preferences. It aims to ethically source its coffee and help farmers. It has also introduced healthier menu options, cold beverages, and plant-based milks to keep up with trends. Starbucks continues tweaking its store formats, introducing smaller pickup locations and larger roasteries with unique menus. However, at its core, Starbucks still focuses on its founding vision to bring people together over a well-crafted cup of coffee. 

In summary, Starbucks’ business orientation has evolved from a coffee bean retailer to a coffeehouse experience to a community gathering place. At each stage, Starbucks has focused on high-quality coffee, customer experience, and adapting to changes while staying true to its brand values. This ability to balance innovation and consistency has fueled Starbucks’ longevity and success.
