Feminist theory provides a more comprehensive understanding of international relations than Realism and Neo-realism in several key ways. Realism and Neo-realism are dominant theories of international relations that focus on the power politics of states and view global politics as an anarchic realm driven by the competition between rational, self-interested states seeking power and security. In contrast, feminist theory takes a broader, more diverse, and more radically critical approach by examining the role of gender, marginalized groups, and non-state actors in global politics. 

First, feminist theory broadens the focus of international relations beyond states to include non-state actors and marginalized groups. Realism and Neo-realism primarily focus on the actions and interactions of states in the international system. Feminist theory argues this state-centric approach is too narrow and ignores the role of non-state actors, local and transnational organizations, and marginalized populations in global politics. Feminist scholars study groups such as women, racial and ethnic minorities, indigenous peoples, and LGBTQ populations across borders and their relationships with global structures of power. This broader scope provides a more in-depth and multifaceted understanding of global politics.

Second, feminist theory examines issues of gender and sexuality that are overlooked by mainstream theories like Realism and Neo-realism. Realism and Neo-realism typically adopt an implicitly masculine perspective that focuses on traditional hard power politics and security issues. Feminist theory argues that global politics is also profoundly shaped by gendered structures and ideologies. It analyzes how political issues like conflict, peacekeeping, development, and human rights are gendered processes and shaped by patriarchal systems. Examining gender deepens our understanding of power relationships in global politics.  

Finally, feminist theory takes more critical and normative approaches than the purportedly value-neutral theories of Realism and Neo-realism. Realism and Neo-realism claim to take non-normative, scientific approaches to global politics focused on describing how power operates in the international system. In contrast, feminist theory adopts an openly critical and normative perspective that challenges existing power structures and ideologies. It seeks to reveal and address gendered and other inequalities built into the global political system. The critical, normative orientation provides a fuller understanding of ethics and justice in global affairs.

In conclusion, feminist theory provides a more comprehensive approach to international relations than Realism and Neo-realism by broadening the scope of analysis beyond states to non-state actors and marginalized groups, examining the role of gender and sexuality, and taking an openly critical and normative perspective. While Realism and Neo-realism remain dominant in international relations, feminist theory offers a fuller, deeper, and more ethical understanding of global politics in the 21st century. Overall, feminist theory deserves as much attention as more traditional approaches in international relations.
