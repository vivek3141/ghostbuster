Dualism refers to the view that there exist two fundamentally distinct kinds of substances or aspects of reality: the mental and the physical. In philosophy of mind, dualism denotes the position that the mind and the body are two separate substances. The mind is the non-physical substance of consciousness, feeling, thinking, and willing, while the body is the physical substance that has mass and occupies space. 

Dualism has been an intuitively appealing view for much of human history but came under scrutiny starting in the 20th century. There have been several reasons why philosophers and scientists have sought to resolve dualism into a monism, a view that reality consists of only one kind of substance. First, dualism faces the problem of interaction: how can the non-physical mind causally interact with the physical body? This seems to violate well-established laws of physics. Second, dualism does not sit well with the scientific worldview that the natural world should be explained in natural, physical terms. Mysterious non-physical substances seem out of place. Finally, dualism leads to a kind of explanatory obscurity: by attributing some phenomena to the workings of an immaterial mind, we fail to provide a clear explanation.

The French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre rejected dualism in favor of monism. For Sartre, there is only one kind of substance: the physical. However, Sartre adopts an idiosyncratic theory of consciousness that aims to do justice to our first-person experience of freedom and transcendence of the physical world. According to Sartre, the body, including the brain, belongs to the realm of "being-in-itself" - brute existence devoid of meaning or purpose. Consciousness, however, is "being-for-itself" - a spontaneous and groundless projecting beyond the physical into possibilities. 

For Sartre, the body manifests our radical unfreedom. Our consciousness is always embodied, and the body represents inertia, facticity, and limitation. However, consciousness can gain a kind of freedom by adopting attitudes toward its embodiment and toward the inevitable physical urges and limitations. In this way, Sartre establishes an asymmetrical and tension-filled relation between the for-itself of consciousness and the in-itself of the body. The body-for-itself is the body as experienced by consciousness, the body as interpreted and given meaning. While we cannot escape the brute facticity of our physical nature, we are free to determine its meaning and significance. 

In sum, dualism has faced significant objections but continues to persist as an intuitively compelling view. Sartre proposes an innovative monistic yet anti-physicalist theory of consciousness in an attempt to overcome the mind-body problem. His concept of the body-for-itself is central to his view that we can achieve a kind of freedom and transcendence even in the face of our unfreedom in relation to our embodiment. While Sartre's theory is perplexing in many ways, it provides an ambitious framework for thinking about the relationship between our subjective experience of freedom and our objective physical nature.
