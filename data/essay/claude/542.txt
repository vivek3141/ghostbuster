It seems possible that there could be a physically identical world in which consciousness does not exist, even if we accept that 'pain = C-fibre stimulation' is true and that 'pain' and 'C-fibre stimulation' are rigid designators. The argument for this possibility relies on the idea that consciousness could be an emergent property that arises from particular configurations of physical substances and processes in our world, but may not arise in another physically identical world with the same configurations and processes.

If we assume that 'pain = C-fibre stimulation' is an identity statement that is true in our world, it implies that the experience of pain just is the firing of C-fibre nerves in the body and brain. The terms 'pain' and 'C-fibre stimulation'  refer to the same thing. However, this does not necessarily mean that pain must be felt or experienced consciously. It could be the case that C-fibre firings result in pain experiences in our world because of the way consciousness emerges from the physical system that includes C-fibres firing in the body and brain. But in another physically identical world, the same C-fibre firings may not give rise to any conscious experience at all.

Consciousness is often thought to be an emergent phenomenon, arising from the complex interaction of physical processes in the body and brain, including the firing of neurons. But emergence is highly dependent on the context, relationships, and configurations in which those physical processes are embedded. Slight differences in context or configuration could result in consciousness failing to emerge, even with the same underlying physical parts and processes. This is akin to how the complex pattern in a flock of birds emerges from the simple rules followed by individual birds, but tiny differences could result in the pattern never forming at all. 

So while 'pain' and 'C-fibre stimulation' mean the same thing in our world, referring to a particular physical process, it is possible that the experience of pain fails to emerge in another physically identical world. The consciousness that is needed to experience pain may fail to arise, even with the same physical parts and processes as our world. Pain and consciousness could come apart in such a world, suggesting that despite any identity between pain and C-fibre stimulation here, consciousness is not guaranteed to arise given the same physical features. There seem to be few philosophical reasons to rule out the possibility of such a physically identical yet experientially different world.

In conclusion, while we may accept that 'pain = C-fibre stimulation' is true in our world and a rigid designator, referring to the same physical phenomenon, it appears possible that a physically identical world could exist in which consciousness fails to emerge and no pain is felt or experienced. Consciousness seems to depend heavily on context and relationships in the world, so even if grounded in particular physical processes, those same processes in a slightly different world may not give rise to consciousness. Thus we cannot rule out a physically identical yet experientially different world on the basis of identities like 'pain = C-fibre stimulation' being true in our world alone.
