Conversation Analysis (CA) is an approach to the study of social interaction that focuses on the structures and practices of naturally occurring talk-in-interaction. CA aims to provide an emic perspective on how participants produce and understand conversation by closely analyzing audio or video recordings of naturally occurring talk. For the analysis of the provided phone call sample between two friends, CA is an apt choice as it can help reveal how the interlocutors collaboratively construct the interaction using mechanisms like turn-taking, repair, word selection, and silence.  

However, there are ambiguities that arise in the analysis that can be addressed by incorporating other approaches. For instance, as CA primarily relies on the talk and focuses on the orderliness and organized nature of interaction, the contextual factors like the relationship between the speakers or their social identities are not explicitly considered. Approaches like Interactional Sociolinguistics can provide insights into how social factors might shape the interaction. Furthermore, since CA treats talk as the primary resource for organizing interaction, it does not account for how other semiotic resources like gaze, gestures, or body movements may influence the interaction. Multimodal CA approaches that analyze audio, visual and other embodied cues can address this limitation and provide a more comprehensive analysis.

In the sample call, Kara describes an issue with her neighbor but does not directly ask for advice until turn 10. However, the repeated mention of the issue and the silences (in turns 5 and 7) after Tom’s continuer “okay” (turns 4 and 6) and acknowledgment tokens “yeah” (turn 8) seem to invite advice or opinion from Tom without an explicit request. Tom understands these implicit requests and provides encouraging responses and advice. However, without seeing the participants, it is difficult to determine if these silences coincide with gazes towards Tom that might make the requests more salient. Since gaze can be used to solicit responses or overlap with talk, analyzing visual information may reveal that Kara’s looking behavior contributes to the implicit requests for advice that Tom understands.   

In conclusion, while CA provides a useful framework to analyze the organization of the phone call interaction, combining it with other approaches like Interactional Sociolinguistics and Multimodal CA can address ambiguities regarding contextual factors and the role of embodied cues. They can provide a more comprehensive understanding of how the conversation is collaboratively achieved through both talk and visual/ physical actions. The additional focus on gaze and gesture may uncover a more complex interplay between what is said and done that shapes how participants interpret each other’s meanings and coordinate this conversation.
