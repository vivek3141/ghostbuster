When parties enter into an oral agreement, there are several legal issues that can arise due to the lack of a written contract. The terms of the agreement can be ambiguous or disputed by the parties, especially if their memories of the exact terms differ over time or if there was a power imbalance when the agreement was made. Without a formal written contract, it can sometimes be difficult to prove the existence or terms of an oral agreement. However, courts may still find that an oral agreement gives rise to a constructive trust in some cases.

A constructive trust is a legal doctrine where the court declares that property be set aside for certain beneficiaries because the person holding legal title has acquired it under unjust circumstances. If a constructive trust is found, the court can order the legal owner of the property to transfer it to the beneficiaries who have equitable title. To determine whether a constructive trust has been created based on an oral agreement, the court examines several factors. The main considerations are whether there is clear and convincing evidence that an agreement existed between the parties to transfer beneficial ownership of the property; whether it would be unjust or unfair for the legal owner of the property to keep it; and whether the beneficiary seeking to enforce the trust acted to their detriment in reliance on the existence of the agreement.  

If there is persuasive evidence of an oral agreement and the other factors are met, the court may impose a constructive trust to prevent unjust enrichment and enforce the equitable rights and expectations of the beneficiary. However, the Statute of Frauds also requires that contracts involving real estate or those that cannot be completed within one year be written to be legally enforceable. So, oral agreements relating to the sale or transfer of land or long-term service contracts generally will not give rise to a constructive trust due to lack of enforceability under the Statute of Frauds.   

In conclusion, oral agreements can raise several legal issues due to lack of clarity or opposing recollections of their terms as well as challenges in providing sufficient evidence of their existence. While constructive trusts may sometimes be found based on oral agreements to prevent unjust enrichment, the Statute of Frauds requires certain contracts to be written to be enforceable in court. So, although equity aims to protect beneficiaries who deserve property under an agreement, the law sets some limits on using oral contracts as the basis for determining property interests. Overall, the existence of an oral agreement and the exact details of its terms must be very clearly proven for a court to find that it establishes a right to beneficial ownership in the form of a constructive trust.
