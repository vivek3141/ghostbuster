Infection control policies and guidelines for hand washing in hospitals are crucially important for providing safe patient care and preventing healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). However, compliance with hand hygiene guidelines remains suboptimal among many healthcare providers, including nurses. A study on nurses' opinions about and compliance with hand washing guidelines at Kingston Hospital would provide valuable insights into how to improve compliance and reduce HAIs. 

Methodologically, a phenomenological approach using semi-structured interviews with a sample of nurses at Kingston Hospital would be an ideal way to explore their lived experiences with and perspectives on hand hygiene policies and compliance in a deep, nuanced manner. Semi-structured interviews provide flexibility to follow up on themes that arise spontaneously while also covering certain broad topics and questions. Asking open-ended questions about nurses’ day-to-day experiences with hand washing, their perceived barriers to and facilitators of compliance, the culture and environment of the hospital unit, and their recommendations for improvement would yield rich data revealing the essence of how nurses view and relate to hand hygiene guidelines.

A representative sample of ten nurses should be selected from various units, shifts, ages, genders, ethnicities, levels of experience, and other variables to capture diverse perspectives. Purposive or criterion sampling would be an appropriate method, selecting nurses to participate based on specific attributes relevant to the study aims and interview questions. This sampling approach, combined with the in-depth phenomenological interviews, would provide a window into the range of views and compliance behaviors that exist among nurses at the hospital.

Observations are also a useful methodology to gather objective data on hand hygiene compliance that can supplement self-reported information from the interviews. However, observations also have some disadvantages, including the potential for the Hawthorn effect, where people may modify their behavior because they know they are being observed. Interviews can gather more nuanced, complex perspectives and opinions that may not be directly observed or quantifiable. Together, observations and interviews would provide both breadth and depth to explore compliance levels at Kingston Hospital fully.

In summary, a phenomenological study using semi-structured interviews with purposively selected nurse participants and supplemented by observations would be an ideal approach to explore nurses’ perspectives on hand hygiene guidelines and how to improve compliance at Kingston Hospital. The data gathered from such a study would provide a platform to develop targeted interventions to increase nurses’ motivation to wash hands appropriately and make system-level changes to facilitate compliance. This can significantly improve infection control and patient safety at the hospital.
