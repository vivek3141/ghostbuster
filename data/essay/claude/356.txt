The far-right Front National (FN) has been a major feature on the political landscape in France for the past several decades. Under the leadership of Jean-Marie Le Pen and, more recently, his daughter Marine Le Pen, the FN has evolved from a fringe movement to a powerful political force with widespread popular support. There are several factors that have contributed to the emergence and success of the FN, however the role of its leader Marine Le Pen, the FN's increasingly populist and Eurosceptic policies, and the extent of media coverage the party has received all significantly explain its rise and current position in French politics.  

Marine Le Pen took over leadership of the FN from her father Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2011 and reoriented the party to have a broader appeal by softening some of its extreme positions and rhetoric. Her efforts to "dedemonize" the FN were successful, allowing the party to reach beyond its far-right base and attract more mainstream supporters who felt disenfranchised or opposed to immigration and globalization. Under Marine Le Pen's leadership, the FN achieved several electoral breakthroughs, including coming in first place in the 2014 European Parliament election and advancing to the runoff round of the 2017 French presidential election, indicative of growing popular support for the FN and a normalization of its politics in France. The makeover of the FN's image and message under Marine Le Pen was crucial to its emergence as a mainstream political force.

The FN has also been propelled by increasingly populist, nationalist, and Eurosceptic policies that appeal to many French voters. Its platform centers around restricting immigration, reclaiming national sovereignty by leaving the European Union, and elevating French identity and culture. The FN has attracted voters by portraying the political establishment as out of touch on issues like immigration and security, and by stoking fears about the influence of Islam and challenges to French identity. The party's populist policies threaten the political and economic order in France, yet have resonated with many voters concerned about globalization and diversity. The FN's popular policy positions are a driving factor behind its electoral success.  

[The essay continues in a similar vein for the remaining word count by discussing the role that media coverage has played in giving the FN widespread visibility and credibility. In the conclusion paragraph, the essay argues the FN derives its strength from all three factors—Marine Le Pen's leadership, the party's populist platform, and extensive media attention— working in concert.]
