What Makes Good Cinema Propaganda? 

Propaganda aims to spread a particular message or ideology to shape public opinion. Cinema can be an extremely effective medium for propaganda due to its visual and emotional power. Several factors determine whether a film serves as successful propaganda. First, the message must be simple, clear, and emotionally resonant. Second, likable and admirable characters can make the message and ideals portrayed more appealing to audiences. Third, subtlety is key - the most effective propaganda is not overt or heavy-handed. Finally, appeals to patriotism and national pride can be a powerful way to generate a sense of common purpose.

The 1935 Soviet film Triumph of the Will, directed by Leni Riefenstahl, is a prime example of effective propaganda. It chronicles the Nazi rally at Nuremberg in 1934 and aims to showcase the power, order, and grandeur of the Nazi party. The messaging is unambiguous in glorifying the Nazi movement, but it is conveyed through emotional, visually stunning imagery rather than logical argument. Grand orchestral music accompanies enormous marches, flags, and swastikas to create a sense of spectacle and inspire national pride in viewers. By focusing on the drama and pageantry, the film disguises the sinister ideology behind it. The likable, charismatic figure of Adolf Hitler lecturing and connecting with youth and soldiers makes Nazism appealing and helps cultivate a cult of personality around him. Triumph of the Will demonstrates how a seemingly documentary-like style can mask the manipulative techniques of propaganda.

Another example of subtle yet powerful propaganda is the Hollywood film Mrs. Miniver, released in 1942. The film aims to drum up American support for Britain during World War II and help shift public opinion in favor of entering the war. It follows a British middle-class family and their struggles with wartime hardships like evacuation, rationing, and loss. The Miniver family is courageous, dignified, and patriotic, encouraging audiences to sympathize and identify with British civilians. Propaganda is most effective when audiences do not recognize they are being propagandized. By focusing on an relatable family drama, Mrs. Miniver subtly argues the case for war by showing its impact on ordinary people and promoting a sense of kinship between America and Britain. 

In conclusion, while propaganda aims to manipulate, cinema can be a particularly useful medium for spreading persuasive messages. Simple but emotionally resonant stories, likable and admirable characters, subtlety, and appeals to patriotism are all hallmarks of effective propaganda films. Both Triumph of the Will and Mrs. Miniver showcase these qualities and serve as prime examples of propaganda that shaped public opinion through the power of cinema. Overall, the most compelling propaganda is that which audiences do not recognize as such.
