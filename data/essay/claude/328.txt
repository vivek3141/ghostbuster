There are several types of non-verbal communication cues that researchers have studied as potential indicators of deception. These include changes in speech patterns, body language, facial expressions, and physiological responses. However, the reliability and accuracy of these cues in actually detecting lies is mixed. While certain cues may indicate deception for some individuals, there is no single cue that is a guaranteed sign of lying for all people.  

One commonly cited indicator of deception is changes in speech patterns, such as increased hesitancy or repetition, lack of detail, and avoidance of directly answering the question. However, these cues are not always reliable. A person may be hesitant or avoid detail when answering difficult or embarrassing questions even when being truthful. Repeating details or deflecting from answering directly could also simply be a verbal tactic, not necessarily a sign of deceit. For these reasons, speech pattern changes alone should not be used to definitively prove deception.

Another indicator studied is changes in body language, such as lack of eye contact, frequent position changes, or nervous behaviors like scratching, sweating or stuttering. However, like speech patterns, these behaviors are not consistently reliable signs of deception for all individuals or in all situations. Lack of eye contact could be a sign of anxiety, cultural expectations, or personality, rather than deception. Fidgeting may indicate discomfort for truthful or untruthful reasons. While potentially suggestive, body language should be considered cautiously and as part of a broader analysis of behavioral changes.

Similarly, microexpressions, or brief facial expressions, have been studied as indicators of concealed emotions that could suggest deception. However, research on the reliability of microexpressions in detecting deception has found low accuracy rates. There are few universal microexpressions, so interpretations require extensive training and practice. Many supposed 'microexpressions' may simply reflect normal variations in facial expressions as people speak. As with other cues, microexpressions alone should not be used to determine if someone is lying.
