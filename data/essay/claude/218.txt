The retention of biometric data such as fingerprints, DNA samples, and profiles raises serious questions about privacy and data protection according to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Article 8 of the ECHR protects the right to respect for private and family life, home and correspondence. The collection and storage of sensitive biometric information could be seen as an interference with the right to privacy under Article 8. However, the ECHR also allows for restrictions on the right to privacy that are "in accordance with the law" and "necessary in a democratic society."  

There are arguments that the retention of biometric data for law enforcement purposes, such as identifying suspects or victims of crimes, can be considered necessary and proportionate. DNA databases have been shown to aid criminal investigations and prosecutions, helping identify perpetrators as well as exonerate innocent individuals. The U.K. in particular has made extensive use of biometric data to solve crimes, citing estimates that DNA matches can provide leads in 40% of burglary cases and over 90% of murders.  The European Court of Human Rights has found that retention of DNA profiles can strike a fair balance between privacy rights and public security interests. 

However, the indiscriminate retention of biometric data, especially for individuals not suspected or convicted of any crime, raises more concerns. Storing sensitive information for indefinite periods creates risks of abuse, hacking, and privacy violations that outweigh the potential law enforcement benefits. Several studies have found little evidence that DNA databases deter criminal behavior or reduce overall crime rates. There are also concerns about bias and discrimination in the application of biometric technologies like facial recognition.  

The ECHR requires that any interference with Article 8 rights must be narrowly tailored and subject to oversight and controls. Biometric data retention policies that lack strict limits on collection, timeframes for review and deletion, or independent oversight are more likely to violate privacy rights under the Convention. The Court has ruled that retaining DNA profiles of individuals not convicted of serious offenses was unnecessary and disproportionate. It has also found issues with deficiencies in oversight and control mechanisms for biometric databases.

In conclusion, while the use of biometric data for law enforcement purposes may be legitimate and proportionate under the ECHR in some circumstances, broadly retaining fingerprints, DNA and biometric profiles of individuals not involved in criminal activity is difficult to reconcile with the right to privacy. Policies and safeguards are needed to limit interference with Article 8 rights to only what is strictly necessary and proportionate in democratic societies. Oversight, time limits, and avenues to review and challenge retention decisions can help balance privacy and security concerns as biometric technologies become more widespread.
