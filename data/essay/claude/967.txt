Maps represent the landscape and its features in either a raster or vector format. Raster maps are composed of a rectangonal grid of pixels, with each pixel representing an area on the ground and having an assigned value. Raster maps can provide a visually photorealistic representation of the landscape but offer limited functionality for analysis due to the pixel structure. Conversely, vector maps use a combination of points, lines and polygons to represent features. The vector structure affords cartographers greater flexibility and analytical capabilities but may lack the visual realism of raster maps. 

The accuracy with which analogue maps are digitised into digital raster or vector maps significantly impacts the reliability and usefulness of the resulting product. Map digitising encompasses the manual processes of tracing features from an analogue map and entering their attributes into a digital format. Heads-up digitising involves directly tracing features on-screen using a mouse or graphics tablet and is prone to human error that accumulates with increasing map complexity. Tablet digitising utilizes a graphics tablet with an electromagnetic stylus and offers greater precision, but still relies on the individual digitiser’s skill.  In either approach, the resolution and quality of the analogue map and the digitiser’s experience can considerably impact the accuracy of the digital map. With lower resolution analogue maps, there is greater uncertainty in the placement of features, and with inexperienced digitisers there are more likely to be topological and attribution errors in the digital map. Reputable mapping agencies employ cartographic standards to minimize errors, but some degree of uncertainty will always remain. 

Additional challenges stem from the varyied linework and feature representation on analogue maps. For example, lines of differing thicknesses are ambigous to digitise and adjoining features are not always clearly distinguishable. Vague area boundaries and nonspecific point locations compound difficulties in producing an accurate digital map. A high level of generalization or minimal detail on the analogue map will produce an overly simplistic digital map lacking in precise geospatial information. In contrast, a highly detailed analogue map may be impossible to fully and correctly digitise given constraints on time and resources. In these cases, digitisers must determine an acceptable level of flexibility between staying faithful to the source map and ensuring the digital map meets certain quality standards. 

In summary, while technical options exist to represent the landscape and incorporate cartographic elements in digital form, the digitising process itself remains largely manual and imperfect. Raster and vector digital maps each have strengths and weaknesses, and the approach selected depends on the intended use and desired functionality. Digitising challenges stem from limitations in human visual acuity, the subjective nature of interpreting spatial information, and varying degrees of analogue map quality or resolution. By developing robust cartographic standards, mapping agencies work to minimize errors and maximise the accuracy and usability of digital maps. However, some uncertainty will always remain, and digital maps should never be considered an error-free representation of fact.
