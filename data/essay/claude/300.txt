Georg Simmel developed a unique style of sociology focused on interpreting the subjective experiences of individuals within larger social contexts. Simmel was interested in understanding how modern society, with its emphasis on individuality, rationality, and intellectualism, shapes our psychology and interactions. At the core of Simmel's view of modernity is the eternal conflict between the soul/subjective self and the demands of society. Simmel believed that modernity led to increasing pressures for individual freedom and subjectivity to clash with social conformity and rationality. 

One of Simmel's key contributions was distinguishing between objective and subjective culture. Objective culture refers to the intellectual and rational aspects of society like science, technology, industry, and bureaucracy. Subjective culture refers to the psychological, emotional, artistic, and creative elements of society. Simmel believed that modernity's emphasis on rationality and intellect had led to an overabundance of objective culture that threatened to overwhelm subjective culture. The metropolis epitomized this loss of subjective culture by fostering short, fleeting, and superficial interactions that lacked emotional depth.

Simmel also made an important distinction between form and content. Form refers to the structures, rules, and norms that govern social interactions while content refers to the substance and meanings of those interactions. Simmel argued that modern society's focus on efficiency, productivity, and rational processes prioritized form over content. Interactions became cold, impersonal, and lacking in meaning or purpose beyond the form and rules that structured them. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the metropolis where most interactions were brief, task-oriented, and instrumental. 

However, Simmel believed individuals could resist the dominance of objective culture and form over subjective culture and content through acts of reserve by maintaining a psychological distance. Reserve allowed individuals to protect their inner subjective selves from being overwhelmed by the demands of society for conformity and rationality. By fostering an inner detachment from social interactions, individuals could gain more freedom and independence to develop their unique personalities and subjectivity. Thus, reserve was a means of reconciling the eternal conflict between the soul and society.

In conclusion, Simmel offered a unique sociological perspective focused on interpreting the impacts of modernity on individuals. By distinguishing between objective and subjective culture as well as form and content, Simmel highlighted how modern society can privilege rationality and conformity over emotion, meaning, and individuality. However, Simmel believed individuals could foster their own subjectivity and find inner freedom through detachment from the expectations of society by adopting an attitude of reserve. Simmel's focus on reconciling the soul and society provides a compelling framework for understanding both the emancipatory possibilities and threats of modernity.
