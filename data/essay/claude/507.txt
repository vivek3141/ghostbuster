Understanding customer and organizational buying behavior is crucial for companies to demonstrate a marketing orientation. A marketing orientation means putting the customer at the center of a company's thinking and decision making. By understanding how customers and organizations make buying decisions, companies can align their marketing strategies and business offerings to meet customer needs. 

The consumer buying decision process consists of five stages: need recognition, information search, evaluation of alternatives, purchase decision, and post-purchase behavior. First, the consumer recognizes a need or problem to solve. They then search for information from various sources about products and services that can meet the need. Next, the consumer evaluates the options based on a set of criteria important to them. A purchase decision is then made to buy the product or service that best satisfies their need. Finally, post-purchase behavior consists of actions taken after purchasing a product, such as feelings of satisfaction or cognitive dissonance.

The organizational buying decision process also consists of six stages: problem recognition, general need description, product specification, supplier search, proposal solicitation, supplier selection, and post-purchase evaluation. First, someone in the organization recognizes a problem or need that can be solved by purchasing a good or service. The need is then described in broad terms. Next, the specific features and requirements of the needed product are determined. A search for potential suppliers is conducted. Proposals are obtained from different suppliers. The organization evaluates the proposals and selects a supplier. Finally, the organization evaluates the selected supplier's performance for future reference.

Several factors influence the consumer and organizational buying decision process. Some key factors include: perceived needs and problems, personality, psychological factors, social factors, and situational determinants. The Dibb/Simkin buying pro forma provides a framework for analyzing the impact of each factor on the buying decision process. By examining each factor, companies can gain key insights into what motivates customers to buy their products and services.

An example of a company demonstrating a marketing orientation by understanding customer buying behavior is Fujitsu. As a technology company, Fujitsu traditionally had a product-focused approach. However, Fujitsu shifted to a customer-led approach by gaining a deeper understanding of customer needs through extensive market research. By analyzing the factors influencing their customers' buying decisions, Fujitsu has been able to develop IT infrastructure solutions that truly help their business clients solve problems and meet key objectives. Overall, understanding customer and organizational buying behavior is key for companies to achieve a marketing orientation and long-term success.
