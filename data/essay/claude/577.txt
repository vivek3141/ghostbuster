Environmental law and policy in the European Union (EU) has evolved significantly since the early 1970s. Initially, environmental protection was not a priority for the European Economic Community, the predecessor to the EU. The focus was primarily on economic integration and growth. However, as environmental problems intensified and public concern grew, the EU began passing environmental legislation and policies to curb pollution, conserve natural resources, and transition to more sustainable practices. 

One of the first major steps was the adoption of the 1973 Declaration on Environmental Action Programme, which recognized the need to incorporate environmental protection into EU policymaking. This led to the establishment of the Directorate-General for the Environment in 1981 to develop and implement environmental policy. A series of environmental action programmes were then adopted in the following decades to set strategic priorities and targets. The current programme, the 8th Environmental Action Programme, aims for a clean, circular, and competitive economy by 2020.

To achieve the goals in its environmental action programmes, the EU has passed several influential laws. The 1979 Directive on Conservation of Wild Birds established the EU's first nature conservation legislation. The 1985 Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment mandated that development projects assess their environmental impacts before approval. The 1990 Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control adopted a holistic approach to reducing pollution from industrial sources. These directives have since been updated to include more stringent requirements as well as additional environmental media like water, air, waste, and chemicals.

While EU environmental policy has led to substantial improvements in environmental quality throughout Europe, balancing it with economic interests has been challenging. Regulations can be seen as barriers to trade and growth by some member states and industries. There is also variation in environmental priorities and economic capacity between EU countries. Implementation and enforcement of EU environmental law has at times been inconsistent. Ongoing policy debates include how ambitious new climate and energy targets should be, how to ensure a just transition to a greener economy, and how to improve environmental compliance across member states.

In conclusion, environmental policy in the EU has evolved from an afterthought to a priority backed by a comprehensive legal framework. Significant progress has been made, but continued challenges include balancing environmental and economic interests, navigating differences between member states, and improving implementation of existing regulations. Overall, environmental protection is now viewed as complementary to economic growth rather than counter to it, demonstrating that environmental sustainability and a thriving economy can go hand in hand.
