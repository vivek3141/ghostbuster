The case of Eagle Star Insurance Co. v. Lucky Cutter centered around a disagreement over the interpretation of an exemption clause in an insurance policy. The key point of disagreement was whether the exemption clause applied to prevent the insured, Lucky Cutter, from claiming under the policy for the loss of their fishing vessel. The House of Lords ultimately resolved this disagreement through a purposive approach to statutory interpretation.

The facts of the case were as follows. Lucky Cutter owned a fishing vessel which sank, and they sought to claim Â£33,000 under an insurance policy they held with Eagle Star Insurance to cover the loss. However, Eagle Star denied the claim based on an exemption clause in the policy that stated the insurers would not be liable for "loss or damage caused by...want of reasonable care or skill, or latent defect." Eagle Star argued that the loss was due to a latent defect in the vessel, namely inadequate bilge pumping systems, and thus fell within the exemption. Lucky Cutter argued that the clause did not apply because the proximate cause of the loss was heavy weather at sea, not any latent defect.  

The central point of disagreement between the parties was thus whether the exemption clause applied to preclude Lucky Cutter's claim under the policy. The House of Lords found in favor of Lucky Cutter, ruling that their claim was covered. In arriving at this decision, the Law Lords applied a purposive approach to interpreting the insurance policy. They sought to interpret the policy in line with the purpose of providing coverage, and adopt the meaning that was most appropriate in the circumstances. As Lord Reid stated, "In interpreting a clause in an insurance policy one must have regard to its purpose and to the substance rather than the form."

Looking at the purpose and substance, the Lords found that the parties did not intend for normal weather conditions to trigger the exemption clause. The clause was meant to protect the insurers from liability due to the insured's negligence or poor maintenance, not from common and expected occurrences. Heavy weather at sea was an ordinary risk covered under the policy, and it would undermine the purpose of the policy to apply the exemption clause. As Lord Reid summarized, "The underwriters cannot have intended to exclude liability for the very perils against which they were insuring."

In conclusion, the central point of disagreement in Eagle Star Insurance v. Lucky Cutter was whether an exemption clause in an insurance policy applied to preclude a claim. The House of Lords resolved this through a purposive and contextual approach to interpretation, finding that applying the clause to deny coverage for expected sea conditions would undermine the purpose of the insurance policy and the intentions of the parties. Their ruling upheld the insured's ability to claim under the policy.
