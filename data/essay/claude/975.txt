Graham Swift's Waterland explores different interpretations and understandings of history through its nonlinear narrative structure and metafictional qualities. The novel rejects a linear narrative of history in favor of a revisionist approach that acknowledges the subjective and selective nature of historical accounts. Different characters offer alternative versions and interpretations of events, highlighting how history is constructed and shaped by individual perspectives and agendas. 

The novel's framing device of the history teacher Tom Crick imparting historical knowledge to his students reflects the act of constructing and shaping historical narratives. Crick acknowledges that "history...is just one bloody thing after another," but in teaching history, "you order it into patterns. You make it go somewhere." The nonlinear chronology of the novel, moving between different time periods, mimics the way in which we piece together and organize historical events into coherent narratives. However, the gaps and ambiguities in the novel's chronology also highlight the impossibility of capturing the full, objective "truth" of history.

The characters' different interpretations of events further demonstrate the subjectivity of history. For example, Tom's father Ernest offers an idealized view of the Fens' history by imagining it as an edenic, unchanging place, willfully ignoring the effects of political and social changes. In contrast, Tom as a historian aims for a more objective account that incorporates both continuity and change. However, his narrative is also shaped by his own agenda to make sense of his family's history and search for meaning in past events. 

The novel's metafictional qualities, with its self-reflexive focus on storytelling and the process of constructing historical narratives, further problematize the notion of objective, absolute truth in history. The motif of the ouroboros, the snake eating its own tail, is a metaphor for the self-reflexive nature of history and storytelling. Tom acknowledges storytelling as a way of "making sense, making meaning" and imposing order on the chaos of events â€”yet this act of creation is also one of destruction, as the ouroboros symbolizes. The novel's cyclical narrative structure also highlights how we keep reinterpreting and revisiting history, even as the past continues to shape our present and future.

In conclusion, Swift employs the tropes of unreliable narrators, nonlinear chronology, and metafiction in Waterland to demonstrate that history is mutable and open to interpretation. The multiplicity of perspectives and the self-reflexive focus on the process of constructing historical narratives point to the ultimate impossibility of fixing and containing the "truth" of history. The novel suggests we can never achieve an objective or definitive understanding of the past. Rather, we must accept the plasticity and plurality of history.
