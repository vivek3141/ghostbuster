There is an ongoing debate about the impact of background distractions, such as radios, televisions, and noises from household chores, on children's attention skills during schoolwork. Several studies have found evidence that background noise and distractions negatively impact children's attention, concentration, and learning outcomes. However, the magnitude of this impact may differ based on a child's age, gender, and other factors.   

For primary school-aged children in particular, background distractions pose challenges for maintaining focus and attention during activities that require concentration like doing homework or reading. Their attentional skills are still developing, so external noises and stimuli can easily disrupt their focus. A study that observed 223 first and second grade students found that the presence of background television was associated with poorer attention spans and more off-task behaviors during a 15-minute homework session. The children took longer to start their work, spent more time looking away from their work, and had higher rates of fidgeting and leaving their seat in the distraction condition compared to a no-distraction control.   

Another study looked at the impact of background noise (including sounds from hair dryers, washers, and radios) on reading comprehension in 90 second and fourth graders. They found that the background noise compromised reading comprehension for both age groups, but the effect was significantly greater for second graders. This suggests that younger primary school children may be particularly susceptible to attentional disruptions from background sounds. The differences in auditory processing abilities and working memory capacity between younger and older kids, even within the primary grades, are a likely explanation for these age effects.   

Some research has also pointed to possible gender differences in the impact of background distractions. A few studies have found that girls may be better able to ignore auditory distractions during schoolwork compared to boys. For instance, one study found that boys in grade 3 and 6 had significantly lower reading comprehension scores in the presence of background speech and music compared to girls of the same ages. The explanation may be that girls develop stronger verbal working memory earlier, which is associated with better attentional control and focus. However, not all studies have found gender differences, and more research is needed to draw definitive conclusions.

In summary, there is evidence that background noises, sounds, and other distractions have a negative influence on attention and learning in primary school children. The effects seem most prominent in younger kids, but gender may also play a role, with some studies finding larger impacts on boys. Minimizing background distractions at home and in the classroom is likely to help support children's attentional development and learning during their early schooling. Schools and families should work together to identify strategies for providing distraction-free environments for doing homework, reading, and other focused activities.
