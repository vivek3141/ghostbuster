The Bretton Woods system of international institutions established in the aftermath of World War II shaped the global economic order for nearly three decades. However, by the early 1970s, the system had broken down due to a combination of domestic economic troubles in the U.S., macroeconomic pressures, and geopolitical shifts. The collapse of the Bretton Woods system marked a pivotal moment that significantly reshaped global finance and trade.

The Bretton Woods system was built around the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency, fixed exchange rates between currencies, and institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to facilitate cooperation. Under the system, the U.S. guaranteed that foreign central banks could convert dollars into gold at $35 per ounce. However, in the late 1960s, the system came under pressure due to rising inflation and budget deficits in the U.S., as well as trade imbalances with Europe and Japan. The U.S. was printing more dollars to pay for government spending on the Vietnam War and social programs at home, but the amount of gold in its reserves stayed flat. As a result, confidence in the dollar declined and pressure grew to convert dollars into gold. 

In August 1971, President Nixon suspended the convertibility of dollars into gold, marking the end of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. Currencies were allowed to float freely, exchange rates fluctuated based on market forces, and the price of gold rose sharply. The breakdown of Bretton Woods was a pivotal moment that reshaped global finance. Floating exchange rates introduced volatility into international trade and investments, forcing countries and companies to hedge foreign exchange risks. It also weakened the position of the U.S. and the dollar in the global economy.

In the following years, further events reshaped global trade and finance. The oil crisis of 1973 quadrupled the price of oil, benefiting oil producers in the Middle East and harming consumers in the West. It also led to greater economic clout for oil exporters like Saudi Arabia. The Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s resulted in IMF bailouts and austerity measures that reshaped economies across the region. The stock market crash of 1987 highlighted the new era of floating exchange rates and electronic trading. The creation of the World Trade Organization in 1995 established a rules-based trading system between countries.
