Methods for Enumerating Bacteria in Foodstuffs

There are several methods used for enumerating bacteria in foodstuffs. The two most common methods are the spread plate method and the pour plate method. These methods involve diluting a sample, spreading it on agar media, incubating, and then counting the colonies that form. They provide a measure of the total numbers of viable bacteria in a sample. Other methods detect specific groups of bacteria, such as Enterobacteriaceae and coliforms. These methods vary in their precision and accuracy as well as in their advantages and disadvantages.

The spread plate method involves placing 0.1 ml of a diluted sample onto the surface of an agar plate and then spreading it evenly over the plate using a sterile glass spreader. The pour plate method entails pouring a sample into molten agar, mixing, and then allowing to solidify. Plates are then incubated and the colonies counted. The spread plate method typically yields higher precision because the sample is diluted and spread in a more controlled manner. However, the pour plate method may have better accuracy since there is less chance of bacteria adhering to the spreader. The spread plate method also has a higher risk of cross-contamination between plates. The pour plate method requires more time to prepare the plates but less time to spread the sample. 

Enterobacteriaceae are a large family of Gram-negative bacteria that are commonly found in the environment, plants, and the intestines of animals. They include many pathogens as well as non-pathogenic bacteria. Coliforms are Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria that ferment lactose and grow in the presence of bile salts. They are often used as an indicator of fecal contamination and the possible presence of pathogens. Methods for detecting Enterobacteriaceae and coliforms include the violet red bile (VRB) agar method, methyl umbelliferyl β-D-glucuronide (MUG) method, and Petrifilm method.

The VRB method involves inoculating a sample on VRB agar and incubating. Samples containing coliforms and Enterobacteriaceae will produce colored colonies due to the fermentation of lactose and other compounds in the medium. The MUG method also uses VRB agar but contains a fluorogenic compound that glows blue under UV light when cleaved by the enzyme ß-glucuronidase, which is produced by most Enterobacteriaceae but not most coliforms. Thus, this method can distinguish Enterobacteriaceae from other coliforms. The Petrifilm method uses film coated with growth media and indicators that produce colonies of varying colors based on the specific types of bacteria growing.   

In summary, the spread plate and pour plate methods are commonly used to determine total numbers of bacteria in food samples. While the spread plate method may provide greater precision, the pour plate method could yield improved accuracy. The VRB, MUG, and Petrifilm methods target specific groups of bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae and coliforms that can indicate contamination or the presence of pathogens. The appropriate method depends on the types of bacteria being detected and the level of precision required. With an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each method, the microbiologist can choose the optimal approach for enumerating bacteria in foodstuffs.
