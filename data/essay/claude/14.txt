Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of pneumonia caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila, has been on the rise in recent years. There are several factors contributing to the increased frequency and severity of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks. These include increased development of amoebae and biofilms that facilitate the growth and transmission of Legionella, an aging population that is more susceptible to the disease, and changes in plumbing and water systems that provide new routes of exposure to Legionella. While the host immune response plays an important role in combating the spread and proliferation of Legionella within the body, in some cases it may lead to damaging inflammation and contribute to the severity of the disease.

Amoebae and biofilms serve as environmental reservoirs and amplifiers for Legionella in the environment. The bacteria can survive and replicate within free-living amoebae and within biofilms, which are aggregates of bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances. Once established within these protective niches, Legionella can accumulate to high densities before being dispersed into water systems and the air, increasing the likelihood of human exposure and infection. The growth of Legionella within protozoa and biofilms also makes the bacteria less susceptible to disinfectants and other control measures. Although Legionella has been found to inhabit a wide range of protozoa and amoebae, certain host species appear especially suitable for supporting Legionella growth, including the amoebae Acanthamoeba castellanii and Vermamoeba vermiformis. The symbiotic relationship between Legionella and these host protozoa contributes substantially to increased disease transmission.
