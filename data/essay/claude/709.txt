The mail order bride industry has significant gendered social and economic effects that are particularly evident in the Filipina women â€“ Japanese/American/Canadian men commodity chain. International Marriage Agencies (IMAs) facilitate the transaction between these groups, advertising Filipina women as traditional, submissive wives to attract foreign men seeking such stereotypical partners. 

For Filipina women, the industry presents a mixed opportunity. On the one hand, it provides an avenue out of poverty through immigration and access to greater economic resources in their new country. However, their role is highly gendered, and they face major disadvantages given the power dynamics with their husbands. Their subservient position is reinforced through the process of being advertised, selected, and 'purchased' by foreign men.  

The receiving countries also benefit economically by gaining a source of female labor in the home and a population base that contributes to economic activity and growth. However, Filipina brides often face social isolation and difficulty navigating a new culture and language, and domestic violence is a significant risk. The foreign husbands gain a 'docile' wife who fulfills conventional gender roles, but they too face social pressures to find a spouse, and are often older or socially disadvantaged in their own country.

The IMAs are largely economically exploiting all parties, profiting from the demand for submissive brides and the supply of women seeking migration for a better life. While the mail order bride industry faciliates opportunity and choice for some, the gendered power dynamics that underpin it lead to the greater disenfranchisement and vulnerability of the women involved. Overall, the significant social and economic effects of this global sex trade are borne primarily by the Filipina women, demonstrating how deeply entrenched gender inequalities shape global flows of migration, labor, and commerce.
