The Gothic genre has held particular significance for women, both as writers and readers, since its emergence in the 18th century. The rise of Gothic fiction coincided with the rise of the novel as a genre, and both allowed women's experiences and voices to be expressed in literature as never before. Female Gothic writers like Ann Radcliffe used Gothic conventions to explore women's passions and powerlessness in a patriarchal society. The Gothic heroine, trapped in a mysterious and terrifying setting, became a lens through which women's fears and desires could be refracted.  

The Gothic genre privileges women's experiences through its use of "uncanny" terrors that are often located within the domestic sphere. The home, a space typically associated with women, becomes a site of fear and danger. The Gothic plot frequently centers on a heroine trapped in a threatening home, as in Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho, where Emily St. Aubert is imprisoned in a sinister castle by her wicked uncle. The Gothic signifies women's entrapment within the domestic and patriarchal order.

The Gothic genre is also characterized by extremes of passion and emotion. The Gothic heroine's inner life of intense feelings is valued, in contrast with the restraint of women's emotions required by social conventions of the time. The wild and transgressive passions in Gothic fiction functioned as an outlet for women who were confined by prescriptive gender roles. 

The Gothic has been subject to feminist criticism, especially the question of whether Gothic heroines are submissive or empowered. While some see these heroines as perpetuating patriarchal ideals of women as helpless victims, others argue that the Gothic allows a space for women to resist and subvert those same forces that aim to oppress them. The "Female Gothic," a term used to describe Gothic fiction written by and for women, may represent a genre separate from its male-authored counterpart, with its own conventions and meaning.

In modern Gothic works like Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca or Angela Carter's The Bloody Chamber, the "Female Gothic" is redefined through subversive rewritings of classic Gothic tales. These works adopt Gothic elements like the haunted house or imprisoned heroine, but recast them in a feminist light, crafting heroes and villains that represent patriarchal society and women's efforts to resist it. In cinematic examples like The Handmaiden or Stoker, Gothic horror is used to depict lesbian relationships and queer sexuality, broadening the scope of the Female Gothic.

The Gothic genre, born out of the anxieties of the Enlightenment, gave rise to a literature that highlighted women's experiences and allowed the expression of dangerous passions and unspoken desires. The Gothic heroine's encounters with terror in the homely and uncanny continue to represent women grappling with their place in the world, and the Female Gothic stands as a genre of transgressive works that resist patriarchal authority. The Gothic signifies a liberation of women's voices and desires, however problematically, that reverberates into the modern era.
