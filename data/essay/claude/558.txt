Legal parentage and parental responsibility are core concepts in family law that establish the legal rights and responsibilities of parents towards their children. Legal parentage, or the establishment of parenthood, is typically based on biology - giving birth to a child or being the genetic parent. However, parentage can also be established through adoption or by being named as a parent on a child's birth certificate. Once parentage is established, parental responsibility refers to the rights of parents to make decisions about their child's upbringing and the responsibility to care for the child.

There are a few main ways individuals can acquire parental responsibility. For married parents, both spouses automatically have parental responsibility. For unmarried parents, parental responsibility is gained either by jointly registering the birth of the child or by obtaining a court order. Stepparents and partners can also obtain parental responsibility through a court order or formal adoption of the child.  

These legal concepts aim to give parents the autonomy to raise their children as they see fit while also ensuring children's best interests are met. However, some argue these concepts do not always align well with modern family life. For example, in some jurisdictions parental responsibility is difficult to obtain as an unmarried or same-sex couple. The law also typically favors biological parents, even if a child has primarily lived with and been raised by a non-biological parent figure. Overall, while legal parentage and parental responsibility remain fundamentally important, the law could better recognize the diversity of modern families and ensure outcomes that prioritize the wellbeing of children.

In summary, legal parentage and parental responsibility establish the rights and duties of parents for their children's care. There are several paths to acquiring parental responsibility, though the law does not always adequately reflect today's variety of family structures. With some reforms, these legal concepts could better serve modern families and prioritize children's best interests.
