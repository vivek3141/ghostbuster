Euro-dollar deposits are dollar-denominated deposits held in banks outside the United States. They are not subject to Federal Reserve regulations and offer higher interest rates than domestic US deposits. The interest rates on Euro-dollar deposits are an important indicator for the overall health and direction of the US economy.  

The Federal Reserve tracks the interest rates on 6-month Euro-dollar deposits from major European banks. These rates indicate the willingness of global investors to keep their funds in dollar deposits and reflect expectations about US economic growth and potential changes in Federal Reserve interest rate policy. Higher Euro-dollar rates signal stronger demand for dollar deposits and expectations of increasing US interest rates, often due to a strengthening economy with potential inflationary pressures. Lower Euro-dollar rates indicate weaker demand for dollar deposits and potentially slowing US economic growth, with expectations of stable or decreasing US interest rates.

Analyzing the historical time series of 6-month Euro-dollar deposit rates provides insight into trends in the US economy over time. For example, from late 2008 through much of 2009, Euro-dollar rates were very low, reflecting a weak global economy, low inflation, and expectations that the Federal Reserve would maintain low interest rates during the financial crisis. As the US economic recovery has gradually strengthened over the 2010s, Euro-dollar rates have trended higher. More recently, increases in Euro-dollar rates have signaled expectations of higher US interest rates due to tax cuts and government spending potentially causing higher economic growth and inflation.

In summary, Euro-dollar deposit interest rates provide a window into the overall health of the US economy and expectations about Federal Reserve policy. Monitoring trends in these market-based interest rates contributes to a well-informed view of economic conditions and helps guide investment and policy decisions. The time series of 6-month Euro-dollar rates collected by the Federal Reserve is a valuable resource for understanding the historical evolution of the US economy.
