Employers owe a duty of care to their employees to ensure a safe working environment, both physically and mentally. However, the extent of this duty is debated, especially regarding obligations to support employee mental health and wellbeing. The case of Somerset County Council v Barber highlighted the complexities in determining how far an employer's duty extends regarding foreseeable psychiatric harm. 

In Barber, the House of Lords found that Somerset County Council was liable for the nervous breakdown of an employee, Barber, due to the unreasonable workload and pressures placed on him. Their judgment affirmed that employers have a duty to take reasonable care for the mental health and safety of employees in the workplace. However, the court also noted that employers could not be expected to predict and prevent all psychiatric harm, especially that arising from an employee’s own peculiar vulnerability or susceptibility.

The ruling in Barber has been criticized as posing too high a burden on employers and for judging the case with the benefit of hindsight. However, others argue it achieved an appropriate balance between employer and employee interests. Workplaces have changed dramatically in the 30 years since Barber was decided, with longer working hours, greater job insecurity, and more isolated working. This amplification of workplace stressors suggests employers should shoulder more responsibility for employee wellbeing.

That said, there are arguments against saddling employers with open-ended liability for employee mental health issues. Employees have a degree of personal responsibility for their own wellbeing and for raising issues with their employer. Employment contracts also outline expected working conditions, workloads and hours, limiting employers’ duty to account for all possible sources of employee stress. Moreover, psychiatric harm can be challenging to predict and prevent due to the individual nature of mental health.

In conclusion, while employers should promote workplace wellbeing and take reasonable steps to identify foreseeable sources of stress and mental harm, they cannot be insurer against all possible psychiatric injury. Balance is needed between employee interests in a safe working environment, and employers’ constraints in fully determining and controlling the roots of mental ill health for a diverse range of employees. Overall, the House of Lords in Barber achieved a reasonable compromise, but further clarity is still needed on the extent of responsibility employers can fairly bear for the psychological wellbeing of their workforce.
