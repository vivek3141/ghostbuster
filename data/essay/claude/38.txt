Philip Zimbardo and Stanley Milgram conducted seminal experiments in the 20th century exploring obedience to authority figures. While their hypotheses and methodologies differed, their results pointed to the same troubling conclusion: that ordinary people are capable of inflicting harm on others in response to orders from an authority figure.  

Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment examined the psychological impacts of being assigned to the roles of "prisoner" and "guard" in a simulated prison environment. Zimbardo hypothesized that these assigned roles would have a significant influence on behavior, independent of personality traits. To test this, he selected 24 male college students who were deemed psychologically stable and normal. They were then randomly assigned to be either "guards" or "prisoners" in a mock prison located in the basement of the Stanford psychology building.  

The experiment was scheduled to run for two weeks but had to be stopped after just six days due to the extreme and disturbing behaviors that emerged. The "guards" adopted authoritarian attitudes and subjected some prisoners to physical and psychological abuse. The prisoners also internalized their roles, with some becoming apathetic and depressed. The dark and oppressive atmosphere that developed shocked the researchers. The experiment demonstrated that the dynamics of prison authority and environments, rather than individual personalities alone, were capable of creating abusive behaviors.

In contrast, Milgram was interested in exploring factors of obedience to authority in the context of the Holocaust. He hypothesized that most ordinary people would follow orders given by an authority figure, even if it meant harming others. He tested this through an experiment in which volunteers were instructed by an authority figure to administer electric shocks of increasing intensity to another participant. Unbeknownst to the volunteers, the shocks and the victim's reactions were simulated and no one was actually harmed.  

In the experiment, two-thirds of participants followed orders and administered the maximum shock. The results suggested that ordinary people can easily override their own moral compass in response to orders from an authority figure. Like Zimbardo's findings, this pointed to the power of situations and environments to elicit behaviors one might not expect or desire from ordinary individuals. 

In summary, while Zimbardo and Milgram's hypotheses and methodologies differed in their specifics, their experiments pointed to the same troubling conclusion: that situational factors, like environments, roles, and deference to authority, can powerfully influence human behavior in ways that override individual personality and morality. Their work remains profoundly influential and has shaped modern understandings of authority, environments, and human psychology. Overall, the experiments highlight the importance of being aware of and resisting immoral or unjust orders, whatever their source.
