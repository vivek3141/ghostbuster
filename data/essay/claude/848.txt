Both 'The Kaleidoscope' and 'On Re-Recording Mozart' use the traditional sonnet form to explore themes of death and loss. However, each poem employs the sonnet structure and rhyme scheme  in different ways to highlight various facets of these themes. 

In 'The Kaleidoscope,' the rigid sonnet structure reflects the speaker's attempts to find order and beauty in the midst of grief. The octave follows a regular rhyme scheme of ABBA ABBA to suggest the speaker's desire for pattern and stability after her husband's death: "Each day a different beauty I arrange/To make bearable the unchanging fact." The sestet features an openly expressive turn, both in its rhyme scheme of DDCCD and its emotional shift as the speaker becomes overcome by the finality of her loss and the fleeting, illusory nature of the 'new flowers' she constructs each day. Thus, the sonnet form mirrors her fruitless search for permanence.

Conversely, in 'On Re-Recording Mozart,' the sonnet's irregularities accentuate the speaker's troubled relationship with harmony and closure. The inconsistent rhyme scheme of ABCB DEEF GHII reflects the speaker's inability to derive comfort from Mozart's 'perfect' music after her friend's death: "The second time, your absence ate like pain/Into the logic of the violin." The sestet breaks from the sonnet norm with a jarring volta between lines 7 and 8, as the speaker moves abruptly from praising the consolatory power of Mozart's compositions to lamenting their present hollowness. The lack of resolution in the closing couplet also leaves the grief inconclusive.

In terms of meter, both poems utilize iambic pentameter to evoke a sense of rhythmic flow. However, the lines of 'The Kaleidoscope' remain mostly intact, emphasizing the speaker's desire for coherence and stability. By contrast, the meter in 'On Re-Recording Mozart' is frequently interrupted by uneven lines, caesuras, and variations in rhythm to reflect the speaker's inner turmoil. For instance, line 8 reads: "Intolerable, that it can exclude." The omission of the first unstressed syllable jars the flow and rhythm to highlight the speaker's anguish in that moment.

In conclusion, while both 'The Kaleidoscope' and 'On Re-Recording Mozart' employ the sonnet form and iambic pentameter to confront themes of death and loss, their variant uses of structure, rhyme, and rhythm allow each poem to bring different facets of bereavement to the fore. The coherent sonnet in 'The Kaleidoscope' underscores the speaker's fruitless search for permanence, whereas the irregularities in 'On Re-Recording Mozart' articulate the speaker's fraught relationship with closure and harmony.
