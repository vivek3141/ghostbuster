Strategy making requires a delicate balance between long-term discipline and short-term flexibility. On the one hand, a consistent long-term strategy provides stability and helps companies build competitive advantage over time through accumulated resources, expertise, and customer loyalty. However, rigid adherence to a fixed strategy can also make companies slow to adapt to changes in the competitive environment, new technologies, or customer needs. Short-term flexibility allows companies to pivot in response to changes and seize new opportunities. But an overreliance on tactical maneuvers can lead to erratic changes in direction and difficulty building momentum or expertise.

The key is for companies to have a clear long-term strategic direction while also maintaining the flexibility to adapt their strategy and tactics as needed in the short-term. A good example of this balanced approach was Nokia in the 1990s and early 2000s. Nokia's long-term strategy was to focus on being the world leader in mobile phones. This discipline allowed Nokia to build up valuable resources, including strong engineering and design expertise, close relationships with telecom carriers, and a premium brand. However, Nokia was also willing to adapt its tactics to changes in the market, such as by introducing innovative new phone models, developing partnerships to access new technologies, and even acquiring companies to gain new capabilities. 

This combination of long-term strategic discipline and short-term flexibility helped make Nokia the clear leader in the mobile phone market for over a decade. However, Nokia ultimately struggled in the late 2000s with the rapid rise of smartphones. Nokia was slow to shift from its emphasis on basic phones to developing a strong smartphone strategy. When it did fully commit to smartphones, Nokia struggled to catch up to competitors like Apple and Samsung who had already established leadership. This illustrates the risks of maintaining too rigid of an adherence to the status quo strategy in the face of major market changes.

In contrast, a counterexample is the Canadian telecom company BlackBerry (formerly Research in Motion). BlackBerry was highly disciplined in its long-term strategy of focusing on making phones with physical keyboards for business users. This strategy initially led to success but ultimately proved limiting and inflexible. BlackBerry failed to adapt to the consumerization of smartphones and the rise of all-touchscreen devices. By the time BlackBerry tried to pivot its strategy, it had lost too much ground to competitors to recover.

In conclusion, the ideal strategic approach is one that combines long-term discipline to guide a companyâ€™s overall direction with short-term flexibility to adapt to changes. Discipline provides stability while flexibility allows for growth. Companies need to avoid sticking too rigidly to a fixed long-term strategy when the competitive landscape demands a new approach. With the right balance, companies can achieve sustained competitive advantage over the long-run while still thriving in a dynamic short-term environment. The cases of Nokia and BlackBerry illustrate the importance of this balance in strategy making.
