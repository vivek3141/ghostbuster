The migrations to the New England and Chesapeake colonies in North America through the mid-17th century represented two distinct waves of migration from England that resulted in the creation of two remarkably different societies. While the demographic makeup, motives, and social status of the migrants varied greatly between the regions, the societies that were created were shaped by these differences in migration as well as contrasting relations with Native Americans and experiences with disease.  

The New England colonies were settled largely by families, attracting a relatively even mix of men, women and children. In contrast, the Chesapeake colonies were predominantly settled by single young men, drawn by the promise of agricultural land and economic opportunity. The gender imbalance in the Chesapeake led to a far lower birth rate and a population that grew mostly through continued male migration. By 1640, the population of New England was estimated to be around 25,000 people, while the Chesapeake population was only around 5,000.

The migrants to New England were largely Puritans seeking religious freedom, while the Chesapeake attracted those seeking financial gain and economic opportunity. The Puritan values of community, hard work and morality shaped life in New England. In contrast, the profit motive dominated in the Chesapeake, creating a more individualistic and entrepreneurial spirit. The New England colonies were built around tight-knit religious communities, while the spread-out plantations of the Chesapeake led to isolation and loose social bonds.

There were also differences in the social status of migrants. New England attracted migrants largely from market towns and agricultural communities, reflecting a modest but mostly stable class of farmers and tradesmen. In the Chesapeake, migrants came from all social strata in the search for social and financial mobility. The unstable boom and bust economy of the Chesapeake plantations resulted in a far more transient and impermanent population.

 Relations with Native Americans were also markedly different, in part due to contrasting population densities. In New England, Puritans sought to convert Native Americans to Christianity, though conflicts did arise over land and resources. The smaller Algonquian tribes were decimated by war and disease through the 1630s. In the Chesapeake, early cooperation with Powhatan Indians turned to sustained conflict as the colonists acquired more land. However, the resilient and populous Powhatan tribes were able to hold their own for decades. 

The experience of disease also shaped the diverging societies. New England did not experience epidemics as devastating as in the Chesapeake, and was able to achieve natural population growth earlier. However, the epidemics that did strike New England were seen as divine punishment, reinforcing Puritan orthodoxy. In contrast, the Chesapeake suffered enormous death rates from malaria, dysentery and typhoid, especially in the mosquito-infested and unsanitary conditions of plantations and frontier areas. The successive epidemics and high mortality created instability and hampered population growth.

In summary, the migrations to the New England and Chesapeake colonies established two very different societies. The demographic makeup, motives, and social status of migrants created distinctive settlements that were further shaped by relations with Native groups and experiences with disease. The tightly-knit religious communities of New England stood in stark contrast with the unstable, profit-driven plantations of the Chesapeake. These formative differences firmly established the distinct characters of New England and the Chesapeake, which would endure for generations.
