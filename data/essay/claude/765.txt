Human Resource Management (HRM) practices that encourage employee commitment and facilitate organizational culture change include establishing a strong company vision and mission, promoting effective internal communication, providing learning and development opportunities, and empowering employees. When employees feel connected to the company's goals, have open channels of communication with leadership, are supported in developing their skills, and are given more autonomy and responsibilities, they tend to be more engaged and committed to the organization.

A clear vision and mission that employees can connect with and believe in is foundational to building commitment. Employees need to understand the company's core purpose, goals, and direction to see how their role contributes to the bigger picture. Promoting the vision and mission through messaging, stories, and leadership's actions helps ensure they become embedded in the organizational culture. 

Effective internal communication, both top-down and bottom-up, is also key to gaining employee buy-in and enabling cultural transformation. Opportunities for open dialogue, transparent information sharing, and input into decision making make employees feel heard and valued. They also minimize uncertainty and rumors which could negatively impact engagement and culture. Modern communication tools like company intranets, email newsletters, and online discussion platforms have enabled broader and more frequent internal communications compared with traditional approaches.

Providing learning and development opportunities through training, coaching, and mentoring shows employees that the company is willing to invest in them. This not only expands their skills and experiences but also makes them feel valued and motivated. Development programs should align with the company's vision and mission to effectively support any cultural changes. Career progression opportunities also encourage commitment by giving employees pathways to advance within the organization.

Finally, empowering employees through delegating responsibility and autonomy makes them feel trusted and engaged. When employees are involved in decision making and given ownership over their work, they feel more motivated to achieve goals and commit to the company. An empowered workforce also accelerates innovation and problem solving, enabling an organization to adapt quickly to meet changing demands. 

In the hospitality industry, the adoption of these new HRM approaches has changed traditional recruitment and selection methods. There is now greater focus on personality, values, and cultural fit, in addition to technical skills and experience. Candidates who connect strongly with the company vision and mission are more likely to fit into and help strengthen the organizational culture.  Modern recruitment also increasingly relies on technology, using online platforms for job postings, applications, and pre-screening assessments.

While some hospitality companies have implemented more innovative HRM practices, there are still opportunities for improvement across the industry. Many organizations still depend heavily on outdated policies, inconsistent messaging, a lack of empowerment, and limited career growth and learning â€“ approaches that no longer strongly engage today's workforce or support transformative cultural change. The companies gaining a competitive advantage are those adopting best practice, strategic HRM that puts employee experience at the center of business operations and success.
