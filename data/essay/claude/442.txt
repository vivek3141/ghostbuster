The ear is comprised of three main parts - the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The outer ear includes the pinna and external auditory canal. The pinna is the external cartilage structure that collects and directs sound waves into the ear canal. The ear canal transmits sound waves to the eardrum.

The middle ear contains the eardrum and three ossicles - malleus, incus and stapes. The eardrum vibrates when sound waves strike it. These vibrations are transmitted to the ossicles which amplify and transfer them to the inner ear. The middle ear is filled with air and equalizes pressure on either sides of the eardrum.

The inner ear contains the cochlea which converts sound waves into neural signals, and the vestibular system which controls balance. The cochlea contains hair cells and fluid which detect vibrations and generate nerve signals that travel to the brain. Higher frequency sounds stimulate hair cells at the base of the cochlea, while lower frequencies stimulate cells at the apex. The brain perceives the frequency of sound based on which hair cells are stimulated.

There are three main types of deafness - conductive, sensorineural and mixed. Conductive deafness occurs when sounds cannot pass from the outer and middle ear to the inner ear. It can be caused by earwax blockage, ear infection or perforated eardrum. Sensorineural deafness occurs when there are problems with the cochlea or auditory nerve. It can be caused by noise exposure, head trauma, aging or genetic factors. Mixed deafness has elements of both conductive and sensorineural deafness. 

Hearing tests like audiometry and otoscopy can determine the type and severity of deafness. Audiometry tests a person's ability to hear different frequencies and volumes of sound. Otoscopy involves examining the eardrum and ear canal visually using an otoscope. Other tests include tympanometry to test middle ear function, and auditory brainstem response to test neural pathways.

Early detection of hearing loss is critical, especially in children. Management options include hearing aids, cochlear implants, surgery for conductive deafness, and sign language for profound deafness. Hearing loss can significantly impact language, social and cognitive development if left undetected and unmanaged in infants and children. In conclusion, the ear is a complex organ and different types of deafness can arise from problems in the outer, middle or inner ear. A variety of hearing tests are available to determine the cause and severity of hearing loss. Early detection and treatment of hearing problems, especially in children, is crucial to prevent long term deficits.
