The First World War represented a massive disruption to the international economy that had been steadily globalizing in the decades before 1914. The outbreak of total war in Europe disrupted trade networks, redirected government spending towards armaments rather than investment, and significantly increased sovereign debts. In the aftermath of the war, European economies were devastated, global trade declined, and economic power began shifting from Europe to the United States. 

The pre-war Gold Standard, based on the convertibility of major currencies like the pound sterling into gold, had facilitated increasing global trade and investment between 1870 to 1914. However, the economic dislocations of the war made returning to the pre-war status quo impossible. The Gold Standard was re-established in the mid-1920s, but it proved fragile and crisis-prone. The new economic order was characterized by a more dominant U.S. economy, greater economic nationalism, unstable currency valuations, debt crises, and a slowed pace of globalization. 

The pre-war Gold Standard worked well because there was relative price stability, currencies were convertible into gold, and central banks coordinated to maintain currency values. The core economies of Britain, France and Germany had growing, balanced economies with little inflation. But after the war, price levels rose rapidly in most countries, economic growth stalled, and the debts accumulated during the war distorted government policies. Britain, the center of the pre-war system, emerged from the war with massive debts and a weak economy dependent on U.S. loans. France and Germany accumulated large reparations and debts, poisoning international relations.

The U.S. was the only major economy strengthened by the war, but the U.S. retreated into isolationism and refused to take on a leadership role. Most countries accumulated reserves of gold and dollars during the 1920s, but this made the system fragile and prone to crises. When the Great Depression hit, countries abandoned the Gold Standard and devalued their currencies to gain competitiveness. The international economy became increasingly fragmented and unstable during the interwar period.

In conclusion, World War I disrupted the dynamics of global trade and growth that had sustained the pre-war Gold Standard. With economies in disarray, price instability, balance of payments crises, reparations issues, and international tensions, returning to the pre-war status quo was impossible. The interwar Gold Standard was a pale shadow of its pre-war counterpart, unable to overcome structural economic issues, international tensions, and the lack of coordinated crisis response. It eventually collapsed entirely in the 1930s, signaling the end of hopes for a rapid return to pre-war globalization.
