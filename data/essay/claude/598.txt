Augustin-Louis Cauchy was instrumental in formalizing mathematics in the 19th century and raising expectations for rigor and precision. His work built on past ideas but also introduced a new level of mathematical rigor that shaped how the field developed. 

Cauchy played a key role in advancing calculus into a rigorous mathematical theory. While Newton and Leibniz had developed calculus in the 17th century, Cauchy provided proofs and logical foundations for key concepts like continuity, limits, and convergence. His 1821 book _Cours d'Analyse_ laid out his precise definitions and theorems in analysis. This helped address criticisms that calculus lacked a rigorous foundation and put the field on a sound mathematical footing with precise definitions and proofs.

Cauchy also made major contributions to complex analysis, group theory, and matrix theory. In each case, he built on existing ideas but introduced a new standard of mathematical rigor with precise definitions, theorems, and proofs. His work in complex analysis led to concepts like contour integration that remain fundamental today. His early work on group theory prefigured important 20th-century developments. And his work with matrices anticipated important concepts in linear algebra. 

However, Cauchy’s rigor had some weaknesses and limitations. His insistence on rigorous proofs and foundations led him to reject some intuitive or empirically valid concepts that he could not prove. For example, he rejected the notion of a function that is continuous but not differentiable at some points. He also failed to rigorously prove some of his own conjectures, like the Cauchy residue theorem. Mathematicians who followed built on Cauchy’s rigorous methods but also developed more flexible approaches to intuition, empirical evidence, and proof.

In conclusion, Cauchy was instrumental in formalizing mathematics through raising expectations for precision, rigor, and logical proofs. His work revamped calculus and spurred advances in complex analysis, group theory, and matrix theory. However, his strict insistence on rigor also led him to reject some ideas that later proved fruitful, showing some limits to his axiomatic approach. Cauchy shaped mathematics in crucial ways, but subsequent mathematicians built on his legacy with both rigor and more flexible methods of thinking. Overall, Cauchy’s work transformed mathematics through a new standard for logical foundations and helped the field progress in the decades after him.
