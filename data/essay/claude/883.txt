There are several major categories of men's magazines, which are targeted at specific demographics based on their content and themes. The main categories include lifestyle magazines, hobby and interest magazines, fashion and grooming magazines, and adult entertainment magazines. These categories differ significantly in their content, tone, and target audience.

Lifestyle magazines focus on general interest topics related to modern living. For example, Esquire, GQ , and Men's Journal cover a wide range of lifestyle topics including food and drink, travel, health and fitness, career, relationships, and entertainment. The content has a stylish and aspirational tone targeting an educated, upper middle-class male reader. These magazines aim for a broad reach but tend to resonate more with older, more affluent readers.

Hobby and interest magazines focus on particular leisure pursuits or areas of expertise. For example, Sport Fishing, Golf Digest , and Motorcyclist cater to enthusiasts of fishing, golf, and motorcycling, respectively. The content is highly specialized, aimed at avid participants and relies on a mix of expert and hobbyist voices. The target reader tends to be very dedicated to that particular interest or hobby. Technology magazines like Wired or Popular Mechanics also fall into this category with content aimed at men interested in science, tech, and gadgets.

Fashion and grooming magazines focus specifically on style, apparel, and self-care. Publications like Men's Health, Men's Fitness , and AskMen provide advice and tips on fitness, nutrition, style, and skincare. The content emphasizes personal health and appearance. The target reader is interested in self-optimizing through diet, exercise, and overall wellness. The tone is aspirational, promoting an idealized masculine image. These magazines tend to attract younger, image-conscious readers, especially urban professionals.
