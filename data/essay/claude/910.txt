There are several ways in which hotels can make yield management systems and their corresponding price fluctuations appear fairer to customers. Some approaches focus on how prices are presented, while others focus on offering discounts and deals. However, there are both advantages and disadvantages to each method, and hotels must balance perceptions of fairness with ensuring long-term profitability and customer satisfaction.

One approach to increase the perceived fairness of yield management pricing is to focus on transparent communication. Hotels can tell customers up front, in a clear manner, that prices may fluctuate based on factors like seasonality and availability. Explaining the rationale for price changes and giving customers advance notice is more likely to be seen as fair by guests. However, too much transparency around the specifics of the hotel's pricing algorithm could make it easier for competitors to undercut. It may also lead to some customers gaming the system by only booking during off-peak times or at the last minute.  

Hotels can also make the system seem fairer by offering price promotions and deals. Discounts, coupons, and special offers give guests opportunities to feel like they "won" by getting a good deal. Package bundles that include extras like meals, entertainment, and amenities at a lower total price also make guests feel they received value for their money. However, too many deals and discounts may erode revenue over the long run and train guests to only book when there are promotions. It can also lead to unfairness perceptions if one customer pays full price while another receives a deep discount for the same room.

A third approach is to give loyal or high-value guests preferential access to lower prices or special perks. Offering the best rates and rooms first to loyal members and repeat customers rewards them for their business and strengthens the relationship. It also encourages other guests to join the loyalty program to get access to these fairer prices and benefits. However, preferential treatment may be seen as unfair by non-loyal guests who do not receive the same treatment. It can also reduce availability for lower-paying customer segments, decreasing revenue potential.

In summary, yield management systems are a necessary tool for maximizing hotel revenue, but they often evoke perceptions of unfairness and frustration from guests. However, there are strategies hotels can employ, such as transparent communication, strategic promotions, and loyalty programs, to make their pricing appear fairer without sacrificing profits. The key is balancing fairness perceptions with business objectives - keeping guests happy and continuing to earn a good yield overall. With the right tactics, hotels can develop yield  management programs that drive both customer satisfaction and long-term profitability.
