To what extent can the European Commission be considered a governmental body? The European Commission wields significant political and legal authority over European Union member states in many domains, including competition policy, trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regulation. Yet the Commission's powers are sharply defined and constrained by the treaties that established it, so it does not match the traditional notion of an independent government with broad, flexible authority over all issues within a nation-state. This essay will analyze the extent to which the Commission possesses legislative, executive and judicial powers like a traditional governmental body by considering both its authority and its limitations.

By most definitions, effective governments maintain the ability to propose and enact laws. The Commission does have the power to draft legislation and propose it to the European Parliament and Council, which can then adopt, amend or reject proposals. The Commission has exercised this power to propose legislation across nearly all areas regulated by EU law, ranging from consumer protection to immigration to finance. However, its power is limited since the Parliament and Council can accept or reshape proposals as they see fit. The Commission cannot unilaterally pass laws. The EU treaties also sharply circumscribe the topics on which the Commission can legislate, unlike in most governments. So while the power to propose laws is a key aspect of governance, the Commission lacks full legislative authority.

Traditional governments also wield executive power by implementing and enforcing the laws. The Commission does exercise substantial executive functions, including implementing legislation by drawing up detailed rules and regulations, adopting non-binding guidelines and recommendations, and taking decisions in specific cases. The Commission also monitors compliance with EU law across member states and can take legal action against violations through infringement proceedings. However, the Commission relies on member states to apply most EU laws and policies on the ground. It lacks its own administrative capacity and relies on member states’ cooperation. So its executive power, while meaningful, is more limited than in most governments.

An independent judiciary is also commonly considered a hallmark of government. While the Commission does not have a judicial branch, it does play a significant role in enforcing EU competition law by investigating potential violations of EU antitrust and merger rules and imposing fines and remedies. The Commission acts as a de facto tribunal of first instance for competition law. However, its decisions can be appealed to the EU courts, and the courts can overturn the Commission’s rulings and fine levels. So the Commission does not have full judicial power over even this limited domain. Its authority is subject to review, and it lacks jurisdiction over most other areas of EU law.

In conclusion, while the European Commission exhibits hallmarks of governmental authority, especially the power to propose laws, implement EU policies and enforce competition rules, its powers are too circumscribed and reviewable to match the breadth of a traditional government. The Commission is ultimately created by and answerable to the EU treaties and member states. It operates in a system of shared sovereignty rather than wielding independent, self-derived authority. The Commission is perhaps best characterized as a supra-governmental administrative body embedded within the larger framework of the EU’s complex institutional order. Despite its significant policy influence, it lacks the full freedom of action that most national governments possess. The Commission's authority is real but remains limited and subject to check.
