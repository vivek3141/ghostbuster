What is Sloman's model of human reasoning, and how does it explain the variety of results found in psychological experiments investigating reasoning? Provide examples from psychological experiments to support your answer.

Stephen Sloman's model of human reasoning is that our mind utilizes multiple specialized cognitive mechanisms, rather than domain-general reasoning systems. These mechanisms are adapted to different types of reasoning tasks and contexts, which interact in complex ways to produce our judgments and decisions. This model helps explain why human reasoning seems inconsistent and varied across different contexts and experiments. 

One key mechanism in Sloman's model is the associative system, which links concepts and ideas based on co-occurrence and basic similarity. This system is implicit, automatic, and fast, but can lead to inconsistent or illogical judgments. For example, in the conjunction fallacy experiment, participants judged that Linda was more likely to be a "feminist bank teller" than just a "bank teller," because the former description activates more associations in memory. However, logically the conjunction of two events cannot be more probable than one of the events alone.

In contrast, the rule-based reasoning system applies logical rules and abstract principles, like probability theory, to make more normatively correct judgments. But this system requires cognitive control and effort, so we often do not engage in rule-based reasoning, leading to errors. For example, in the Wason card selection task, participants have to determine which cards must be turned over to test a conditional rule. Without reasoning through the logic of falsification, participants commonly fail to select the necessary cards. But with training in logic or by reframing the problem to be more intuitive, performance can improve.

There are also social and contextual factors that influence which systems are used. For example, in moral reasoning tasks like the trolley problem, responses are highly sensitive to subtle contextual factors regarding the described scenarios. Participants may give one response based on utilitarian considerations of the greater good, but another response based on the duty not to harm others. This variety reflects the fact that both moral rules and social intuitions contribute to moral judgments.

In sum, human reasoning is complex, flexible, and multifaceted according to Sloman's model. The mechanisms involved interact and compete to influence our judgments in any given situation. This model accounts for the diversity of human reasoning revealed through decades of research, and shows why human thinking, despite its power and sophistication, can also seem inconsistent and illogical at times. Overall, Sloman's theory provides a compelling and integrated framework for understanding the richness of human cognition.
