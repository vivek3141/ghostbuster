Plato argues that the just person can navigate the turmoil of existence with a stability and tranquil peace that the unjust person can never attain. In the Republic, Plato develops an analogy between the just city and the just soul to illustrate his theory of justice. For Plato, the city serves as a macrocosmic representation of the soul, with each individual performing a specific function that contribute to the harmony and well-being of the whole. Plato believes that justice resides in maintaining the appropriate hierarchical structure within the city as well as within the tripartite soul. 

Plato defines justice as harmony between different parts performing the proper function.  He proposes that the ideal city has three classes of citizens—the rulers, auxiliaries, and craftsmen—each performing their proper function. The rulers should govern wisely and love the city, the auxiliaries should defend the city bravely in war, and the craftsmen should work to provide the material goods for the city. When each part acts according to its proper function, the city will be just. Correspondingly, Plato divides the soul into three parts—reason, spirit, and appetite. Reason should rule, spirit should defend reason's judgments, and appetite should obey reason and spirit. When each part of the soul fulfills its proper function in this harmonious order, the soul will be just.

For Plato, justice is not merely an external arrangement but an inner harmony of the soul. A just soul maintains the proper ordering of the three parts under the wisdom of reason. Reason restrains the excessive honors sought by spirit and the vulgar greed of appetite. In contrast, injustice arises when the lower parts of spirit or appetite prevail over reason. Plato argues that the worst type of injustice is tyranny, arising from the rule of appetite over the other parts of the soul. The tyrannical man is driven by lust and greed, unable to restrain any whim or desire. Conversely, the most just man is the philosopher king, who uses reason to harmonize spirit and appetite in accord with virtue and wisdom.

Plato further argues that it is always in our interest to be just rather than unjust. A just soul is a harmonious, well-ordered soul where reason, spirit, and appetite perform their proper functions. The just person will act with wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice. In contrast, injustice produces a disordered and chaotic soul. The unjust person will act with folly, cowardice, intemperance, and injustice. Plato argues that only a just soul can achieve the inner harmony, balance, and tranquility that constitutes true happiness and well-being. In summation, Plato develops his theory of justice and argues for its preeminence through the analogy between the just city and the just soul. For Plato, justice creates order out of chaos both within the city and within the individual, producing stability, harmony and the well-being of all.
