The hypothesis proposed is that newspapers that are generally aligned with the policies and political leanings of Gordon Brown are more likely to publish positive reaction and analysis of his speech, while newspapers that are typically critical or opposed to Brown and his Labour government will publish more negative reaction and analysis. 

To test this hypothesis, a content analysis will be performed on articles and opinion pieces published by 10 major British newspapers within one week of Brown's speech on June 29, 2009 on the government's measures to stabilize the British economy. The 10 newspapers will include The Guardian, The Independent, and the Daily Mirror which are typically more supportive of Labour and Brown, The Times, The Daily Telegraph, and The Daily Mail which are usually more critical, as well as centrist publications like The Financial Times and The Sun.

The content analysis will systematically review all articles, columns, and editorials focused on analyzing the substance and impact of Brown's speech published within 7 days. Each news article, column or editorial will be coded as being "supportive," "neutral," "critical" or "very critical" based on the overall tone in which Brown's speech and his proposals are portrayed. Statements praising the effectiveness or ambition of the proposals would mark it as supportive, while those emphasizing potential weaknesses, inadequacies or negative impacts would be rated as critical. For example, an article arguing that the fiscal stimulus promises to help lift the British economy out of recession would be supportive, whereas one suggesting the spending pledges will lead to crippling debt and economic decline would be categorized as critical.

The results would then be analyzed to determine the frequencies of supportive, neutral and critical reaction within each newspaper. If the hypothesis is correct, it would likely find that left-leaning newspapers like The Guardian featured both a higher volume of coverage as well as a higher proportion of supportive reaction relative to critical, while the opposite would likely be true in right-leaning papers such as The Daily Telegraph. Centrist papers may publish a mix of both, indicating a range of reactions within their pages.

Of course, there are some limitations to note in this approach. The content analysis can only offer a snapshot in time, and as events unfold in the economy, newspaper reactions may shift. The categorization of "supportive" vs "critical" is also subjective, though the use of a clearly defined coding scheme aims to minimize potential bias. Still, some degree of subjectivity is inherent in such qualitative assessments. The results would not prove definitively prove the hypothesis but rather offer a reasonable assessment that contributes to a broader understanding of media alignments and reactions in British politics.

In summary, the hypothesis suggests that reactions to the speech broke down along ideological lines, with left-leaning "Labour" papers being supportive and right-leaning "Tory" papers being critical. A systematic content analysis of newspaper coverage in the days following the speech can offer evidence lending credence to this hypothesis or suggest the actual reactions were more complex and multi-dimensional. The analysis aims to provide insight into the connections between media, politics and public opinion during a time of economic crisis and uncertainty in Britain.
