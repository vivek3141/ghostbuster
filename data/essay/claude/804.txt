To a significant extent, an individual's tastes and preferences are socially constructed and shaped by the culture and environment in which they live. One's social class, exposure to media, peer groups, and other social influences all play a role in determining what we find tasteful or distasteful. 

Our social class strongly influences our tastes from an early age. The types of cultural products we are exposed to, the way we speak, the clothes we wear, the food we eat, and countless other aspects of daily life are all highly dependent on our social class. Those in higher social classes are exposed to and develop tastes for fine art, classical music, gourmet food, and prestigious brands, while those in lower social classes typically do not have access to develop those tastes. Our tastes are learned through constant exposure and become habitual and ingrained.

The media also plays a substantial role in influencing taste. Advertisements, television, movies, social media, and other media constantly portray ideals of what is fashionable, desirable, and tasteful. The brands and products promoted through media come to represent status and sophistication, while those that are not promoted do not develop the same cachet. Media also spreads new fashion trends, popularizes certain styles of music or art, and introduces cultural products to new audiences. What is portrayed in media as aspirational or prestigious strongly shapes consumer tastes and preferences.  

An individual's peer groups and communities provide another source of influence over taste. We tend to adopt the tastes of our peers, idolize the same cultural products and brands, and dismiss those our peers dismiss. The desire to fit in and gain social approval drives us to mimic the preferences of our closest circles. The spread of tastes within communities and subcultures leads to the development of distinct tastes that represent group identity.

While personal experiences, interests, and innate preferences undoubtedly play some role in the development of taste, social influences are overwhelmingly impactful. Our tastes say more about the social groups we belong to and the culture in which we live than they do about us as individuals. Taste is socially constructed through a lifetime of exposure to people, media, and environments, not founded on some inherent, uninfluenced personal preference. Overall, an individual's social class, media consumption, and communities are the most significant determinants of their socially constructed tastes.
