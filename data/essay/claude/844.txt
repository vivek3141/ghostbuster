The poems 'The Kaleidoscope' by Amy Lowell and 'Underworld' by Louise Gluck, though written decades apart, both explore themes of memory, loss, and renewal. However, they do so in structurally and stylistically different ways. Lowell's poem from 1913 employs pastoral lyricism and colorful, kaleidoscopic imagery to capture fleeting moments of beauty and intimacy. Gluck's poem from 1990 has a starker, more detached tone and fragmented form to convey the process of revisiting and reinterpreting painful memories.

In terms of structure, 'The Kaleidoscope' follows a regular stanzaic form with consistent end rhymes, giving it a melodic quality well suited to its romantic themes. The poem is cyclical, reflecting the turning of the kaleidoscope itself to create new patterns. The stanzas are interconnected through the repetition of 'ever changing' in the first and last lines. This gives the effect of memories flowing into one another. In contrast, 'Underworld' has an irregular form with uneven stanza lengths, jagged lines, and discordant breaks that mime the process of reluctant remembrance. The 'dark stairway' and 'trapdoor' metaphors suggest a descent into the psyche. While fragmented, the poem also has a cyclical quality with the repetition of 'here is my' and 'mine' in the first and last stanzas, indicating the inescapability of the past.   

Stylistically, the poems differ in their use of poetic language and imagery. 'The Kaleidoscope' is lush and sensual, employing colorful metaphors of flowers, gemstones, and stained glass. This points to happy memories of youth and love. In contrast, 'Underworld' uses stark and bleak metaphors of 'stone', 'ash' and 'dust' to depict the landscape of the psyche. The 'underworld' of the title suggests the chthonic realm of the dead or the reptilian depths of the mind. The prevalence of 'd' and 'st' sounds creates a harsh tone that reinforces the themes of difficulty and reluctance. 

In conclusion, while 'The Kaleidoscope' and 'Underworld' are both poems concerned with memory, their structural and stylistic elements serve to create very different effects. Lowell's poem has a open and sensuous lyricism that invites the reader to glimpse fleeting moments of beauty. Gluck's poem has a more brutal and confrontational style that simulates the painful process of delving into traumatic memories that shape our inner lives, for better or for worse. Through their masterful use of form, language and metaphor, both poems give the reader a window into human memory - in all its vivid and shadowed forms.
