To what extent was Europe 'secure' during the Cold War era? Discuss the policies of Containment and Stalin's expansion, the division of Germany, the emergence of international organizations and military alliances, and the doctrine of deterrence. Consider the definition of 'security' and how it applies to military, political, economic, societal, and environmental aspects. Analyze the context within which post-war Europe emerged, and the implications of American foreign policy on the security of Europe.

Europe experienced a tumultuous period in terms of security during the decades-long Cold War. In the aftermath of World War II, Europe was left devastated, divided, and insecure. However, the policies of containment adopted by the Western allies, particularly the United States, aimed to curb Soviet expansionism and create a bulwark against the spread of communism. While this increased tensions with the Soviet Union and led to an enduring division of Europe exemplified by the split of Germany, it also fostered greater cooperation between Western European nations and the emergence of international alliances like NATO that strengthened collective security.  

Security can be defined across multiple dimensions: militarily, politically, economically, societally, and environmentally. In the postwar period, Western Europe's military security was directly threatened by Stalin's desire to spread Soviet control over as much of Europe as possible. The Soviet domination over Eastern Europe as spheres of influence, the blockade of Berlin, and the invasion of Czechoslovakia demonstrated Stalin's ruthless ambition. The policy of containment – including the Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, and NATO – was intended to block further Soviet expansion in Europe by strengthening Western allies militarily and economically. 

Politically, the creation of NATO in 1949 gave Western European nations confidence in their collective security through the principle of collective defense enshrined in Article 5 of the treaty. While NATO was dominated by the U.S., it gave Western Europe a voice on the global stage and a sense of shared purpose. In contrast, Stalin exercised complete control over Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe, stripping them of political autonomy and security.

Economically, the Marshall Plan fueled the reconstruction of Western Europe through substantial American aid. By contrast, Stalin imposed tight control over Eastern bloc economies, exploiting them for Soviet gain. Societally, stark differences also emerged between the democratic and capitalist West versus the authoritarian and communist East. Western European populations generally enjoyed greater freedoms and standards of living.

Environmentally, the Cold War nuclear arms race posed risks due to radioactive fallout from weapons testing and the possibility of nuclear war. Both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. tested nuclear weapons, though some of the largest explosions were Soviet tests. The doctrine of mutual assured destruction mitigated the likelihood of direct war between the superpowers, but the possibility of nuclear catastrophe persisted.

In conclusion, while Europe faced significant insecurity in the postwar period, the policies of containment and deterrence adopted by the Western allies stabilized the military and political situation in Western Europe by blocking Stalin's ambitions for control. However, Europe remained divided for decades and security was fragile, as evident in events like the Cuban Missile Crisis. Although NATO provided collective security, Western Europe relied heavily on American support through both its foreign policy leadership and military presence. The Cold War era in Europe could be seen as a precarious time where security was never definitively achieved but instead managed and deterred. Overall, Europe achieved a modicum of security at a high cost of division and dependence on its transatlantic ally, the United States.
