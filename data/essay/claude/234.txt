There are four main selection approaches used to construct a new bacterial strain with desired phenotypic traits: natural selection, chemical mutagenesis, transduction, and direct genetic manipulation. Natural selection involves growing a starting strain of bacteria under conditions that select for a particular trait, allowing random mutations and recombinations to accumulate over generations. Chemical mutagenesis uses mutagenic agents to increase the mutation rate and speed up the evolution of new traits. Transduction is the transfer of DNA between bacteria via bacteriophages, which can introduce new genetic material into the bacterial genome. Finally, direct genetic manipulation uses techniques like transformation, conjugation, and recombinant DNA technology to make specific changes to the bacterial genome. 

To construct a new bacterial strain with the ability to metabolize lactose, one could start with a strain of Escherichia coli that cannot normally utilize lactose as a carbon source (Lac-). By growing this strain on minimal media with lactose as the only carbon source, natural selection pressure would favor any bacteria that mutate to gain the ability to metabolize lactose (Lac+). After several generations of growth, Lac+ mutants would emerge and come to dominate the population. These mutants could then be isolated as new Lac+ strains.

To accelerate this process, one could employ chemical mutagenesis using a mutagen like nitrous acid (HNO2) or ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) prior to selection on lactose media. Exposure to a mutagen will randomly mutate the bacterial genomes, increasing the chances of generating Lac+ mutants. Selection on lactose media would still be required, but mutagenesis might allow Lac+ mutants to emerge in earlier generations. 

Another approach is to use specialized transduction, harnessing a temperate bacteriophage that infects E. coli to introduce the lac operon genes necessary for lactose metabolism into the bacterial genome. If a phage lysogenized in a Lac+ strain also infects the starting Lac- strain, it may occasionally package bacterial DNA from the Lac+ genome that includes the lac operon. Infection of another Lac- cell with this phage could integrate this DNA into the recipient genome, creating a Lac+ mutant.

The most directed approach is to use recombinant DNA technology to clone the lac operon genes from a Lac+ strain, sequence the DNA to identify the genes, and re-engineer a plasmid to express the necessary genes. This plasmid could then be transformed into the Lac- strain, which would gain the ability to metabolize lactose upon acquiring and maintaining the engineered plasmid. Using antibiotic selection and screening for Lac+, a new stable Lac+ strain could be developed. 

In summary, there are four main approaches to constructing new bacterial strains with desired properties: natural selection, chemical mutagenesis, transduction, and direct genetic manipulation. Selecting the appropriate technique depends on how much control and precision is needed in developing the new strain. With careful execution of any of these methods, researchers can develop novel bacterial strains tailored to specific purposes.
