The labor theory of value is a central component of Karl Marx's critique of capitalism. According to this theory, the amount of labor time required to produce a commodity determines its exchange value, or price. Marx argues that in capitalist societies, the true origin of a commodity's value in the labor used to produce it is obscured. Commodity fetishism conceals the exploitative social relations inherent in capitalism and makes it appear as though the market alone determines value. By uncovering the social character of labor and production under capitalism, the labor theory of value reveals how the capitalist system benefits the bourgeois class at the expense of workers. 

Marx begins his analysis in Capital by distinguishing between use-value and exchange-value. The use-value of a commodity refers to its utility, or ability to satisfy human needs and wants. Exchange-value refers to a commodity's value in exchange for other commodities and is the basis of price. Marx argues that unlike use-value, exchange-value is not intrinsic to a commodity. It is not determined by the material characteristics of the commodity itself. Rather, the exchange-value of a commodity is a social construction—it depends on the commodity's relationship to other commodities in the market.

According to Marx, the ultimate source of a commodity's exchange-value is the labor required to produce it. The labor theory of value holds that the amount of "socially necessary labor time" needed to produce a commodity in a given society and at a given time determines its value. The value of a commodity thus depends on the labor time embodied in its production, not the level of skill, training, or difficulty involved. What matters is the quantity of average, "abstract" labor time, not the specific qualities of the concrete laboring activity. 

Commodity fetishism refers to the tendency in capitalist societies to perceive social relationships between people as relationships between things. The circulation of commodities in the market hides the relationships between producers, and it appears as though commodities have a life of their own. Their values seem intrinsic to the commodities themselves. But according to Marx, value is created by human labor, and it does not originate in the market or in the material attributes of the commodities. Commodity fetishism masks the exploitation of workers that is built into the system of commodity production and exchange.

The concepts of use-value and exchange-value represent a key dichotomy in Marx's analysis of the commodity. Use-value refers to the utility of a commodity, which depends on its material properties and consumer needs. Exchange-value refers to the social valuation of a commodity, which depends on the amount of abstract labor time required for its production. Although use-value depends on the concrete, qualitative properties of a commodity, exchange-value depends solely on the quantity of labor time spent producing it, regardless of the type of labor. According to Marx, in a capitalist system, the use-value of a commodity becomes merely a material substratum that serves as a vehicle for its exchange-value.

Private labor refers to the concrete, particular laboring activity of individual producers, while social labor refers to the total aggregate of labor in a society reduced to simple, homogeneous units of labor time. Although commodities are produced through many small, private acts of labor, their value depends on the total amount of social labor required for their production in a given society at a given time. The value of a commodity thus depends not on the specific private laborers who produce it but on the average quantity of abstract social labor it embodies.

In summary, the labor theory of value is fundamental to Marx's critique of political economy. It reveals how the ostensibly neutral market mechanism obscures the exploitative social relations at the heart of capitalism. By distinguishing between use-value and exchange-value and between concrete private labor and abstract social labor, Marx illuminates the ways in which capitalism reduces qualitatively different types of labor to a universal standard of value that benefits the bourgeois class. The theory exposes commodity fetishism—the tendency to perceive relationships between people as relationships between things—and it uncovers how the circulation of commodities masks the appropriation of surplus value from workers. The labor theory of value provides a framework through which we can critically analyze the dynamics of capitalist society.
