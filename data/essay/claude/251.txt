The 1932 House of Lords decision in Donoghue v Stevenson was a landmark case that had a profound impact on English tort law and the development of the law of negligence. In particular, it recognised for the first time a general duty of care owed by manufacturers to consumers. The opinions of Lords Atkin, Macmillan, and Buckmaster were instrumental in shaping the outcome of the case and its subsequent application. 

Mrs Donoghue brought a claim against Mr Stevenson, a manufacturer of ginger beer, after she drank a bottle containing the decomposed remains of a snail which had been manufactured by him. The key issue was whether Mr Stevenson owed a duty of care to Mrs Donoghue as the ultimate consumer, even though there was no contractual relationship between them. The House of Lords held that Mr Stevenson did owe such a duty of care. 

Lord Atkin articulated what became known as the "neighbour principle" - that one must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which one can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure one's neighbour. Lord Atkin defined one's neighbour broadly to include anyone closely and directly affected by one's acts. Applying this principle, he found that a manufacturer such as Mr Stevenson owed a duty of care to the ultimate consumer of his product, like Mrs Donoghue. This formulation of a general duty of care for negligence cases was groundbreaking and became very influential.

Lord Macmillan and Lord Buckmaster, in their concurring judgments, placed more emphasis on the fact that ginger beer was an article intended for human consumption, such that care had to be taken to avoid injury to health. They held that a duty was owed to anyone who legitimately consumed the product. However, their judgments were somewhat narrower, focusing more on products intended for human ingestion.  

The "neighbour principle" has been adopted and applied widely in subsequent negligence cases involving diverse types of relationships and harm. Donoghue v Stevenson thus established a far-reaching, general duty of care for situations where it is reasonably foreseeable that carelessness may cause damage to another. The case also significantly extended the liability of manufacturers to consumers with whom they have no direct contractual relationship. Overall, this seminal case shaped the modern law of negligence in recognising a broad, general duty of care based on reasonable foreseeability of harm to one's neighbour. The eloquent judgments delivered by the Law Lords, especially Lord Atkin, laid down principles that made a lasting contribution to the development of negligence law.

In summary, the Donoghue v Stevenson case had a profound impact on the English tort of negligence. It established the precedent for a general duty of care towards one's neighbour based on reasonable foreseeability of harm. In particular, it recognised for the first time a duty of care owed by manufacturers to ultimate consumers. The reasoning and judgments of the Law Lords, specifically Lords Atkin, Macmillan and Buckmaster, were instrumental in shaping this landmark decision and the subsequent influence of the neighbour principle and duty of care on negligence law.
