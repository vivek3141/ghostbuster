Wrapping and packaging play an important role in Japanese culture and society. The meticulous wrapping of gifts and the care put into the presentation of most consumer goods reflects the deep appreciation for beauty, order, and care that pervades Japanese culture. 

Materially, the Japanese make extensive use of decorative papers, strings, and bags to carefully wrap items. Colorful patterned wrapping papers known as chiyogami are commonly used. Intricate origami paper folding techniques are employed to create decorative shapes to adorn gifts and packages. Elaborate packaging, known as "bungu kei", features multiple layers of wrapping for a single item. This demonstrates the care and effort taken to present the item attractively. The focus is on the process of unwrapping and discovering what lies inside.

Linguistically, the Japanese language has many terms relating to wrapping and presentation. For example, tsutsumi refers to the wrapping cloth or paper used to wrap an object. Oshie refers to the act of wrapping or covering something. And bunka pertains to the broader cultural concepts of gift-giving etiquette. These terms reflect how deeply embedded wrapping practices are in the culture.

Wrapping also provides insight into Japanese society and values. The meticulous presentation of gifts shows the importance of etiquette, courtesy, and conveying gratitude or goodwill. The wrapping itself becomes part of the gift and communicates the care and thoughtfulness of the giver. This focus on presentation and aesthetics illustrates the Japanese appreciation for order, beauty and visual harmony.

In contrast, wrapping practices in Western culture are typically more pragmatic and less ritualized. Gift wrap papers are more standardized and less decorative. Gifts are often simply wrapped in colored paper and string or gift bags. The actual unwrapping of gifts is often expedited to reveal the contents inside. The wrapping itself is usually discarded and less meaningful. 

In conclusion, wrapping plays a significant role in Japanese culture, reflecting core values related to beauty, harmony, courtesy, and conscientiousness. Both materially and linguistically, the Japanese incorporate wrapping into many aspects of daily life and gift-giving. Understanding these practices provides insight into Japanese society and how it differs from Western cultures.
