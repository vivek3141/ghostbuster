In his Meditations, Ren√© Descartes attempts to establish the existence of God and the external world through reasoning alone. In his ontological argument, Descartes claims that God's existence can be demonstrated a priori simply from an idea of supreme perfection in our minds. However, this argument is not persuasive as it relies on an ambiguity in the distinction between conceptual and metaphysical possibility. His argument from God's non-deceitfulness is also problematic as it not only presupposes God's existence from the ontological argument but also relies on Descartes' intuition about God's nature, which may not be shared by others. Overall, Descartes' reasoning is not compelling in demonstrating with certainty God's existence or that of the external world.

Descartes' ontological argument aims to prove God's existence from the idea of supreme perfection alone. He argues that existence is perfection and that the idea of supreme perfection must contain existence, just as a triangle must have three angles. Therefore, if we have an idea of a supremely perfect being, that being must exist. However, this argument conflates the conceptual possibility that we can imagine a supremely perfect being and the metaphysical possibility that such a being can actually exist in reality. Our capacity to imagine something says little about its actual existence. As Kant argues, existence is not really a predicate or property in the way Descartes assumes. The ontological argument thus does not succeed in proving God's necessary existence.

Descartes then argues that we can trust our senses and believe in the external world because God exists and is not a deceiver. However, this argument is unfounded for several reasons. First, it presupposes the existence of God, which Descartes has not yet established at this point without begging the question. Second, it relies entirely on Descartes' intuition that God must be perfectly good and would not deceive us. But there are no guarantees that God's nature must be perfectly benevolent as Descartes assumes. A malicious or indifferent God might allow us to be systematically deceived. Finally, even granting God's non-deceitfulness, we could still be deceived by other factors like an evil demon without it being God's fault. Descartes' reasoning here is thus circular and rests on unwarranted assumptions about God's nature and the extent of God's causal power. 

In conclusion, Descartes' ontological argument fails to demonstrate God's necessary existence as it trades on an ambiguity between the conceptual and the metaphysical. His argument from non-deceitfulness then fails because it presupposes God's existence, relies on Descartes' intuitions about God's nature, and does not exclude the possibility of deception from other sources. While Descartes aims to establish metaphysical foundations for knowledge through reasoning alone, his arguments do not succeed in providing the epistemic certainty he seeks. His reasoning is not compelling for those who do not share his intuitions about God and existence. Descartes thus fails to prove either God's existence or the existence of the external world with any strong degree of justification.
