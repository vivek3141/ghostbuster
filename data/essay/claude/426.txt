The Empire Glass Company utilizes a budgetary control system to set targets, allocate resources, and evaluate performance in order to achieve its organizational goals. The budget acts as a plan that incorporates the company's strategic direction, specifies key activities and projects, and assigns responsibilities. However, the budgetary control system in the Glass Product Division has several weaknesses that undermine its effectiveness.

A key strength of the budgetary control system is that it helps to create a shared corporate direction by forcing the different departments and divisions to consider how their plans link together. The budgeting process requires the Glass Product Division to align its plans with the overall company strategy. However, a weakness is that the budget may not fully reflect customer needs or changes in the external environment. The Glass Product Division should incorporate more external and forward-looking data into its planning and budgeting procedures to ensure budgets are realistic and flexible.

Another strength of the budgetary control system is that it outlines clear expectations for revenue, costs, and performance which help drive accountabilities. However, the reward structure based primarily on budget targets may discourage risk-taking and innovation. The Glass Product Division should consider non-financial as well as financial metrics and integrate a balance scorecard framework to evaluate performance from multiple perspectives including customer satisfaction and learning and growth. This can help achieve greater mutual dependency across departments and motivate continuous improvement.  

The budgetary control system provides a structured process for resource allocation but may lead to power struggles over funds and lack of cooperation. The planning and budgeting procedures need greater involvement from frontline staff and cross-functional teams to identify synergies and improve integration. While the budget provides quantitative targets, it may miss qualitative insights on key issues. Surveys, customer panels, and employee workshops can provide useful input to supplement the understanding gained from the budgetary control system.

In conclusion, the Empire Glass Company's budgetary control system faces several weaknesses in achieving cost reduction, continuous improvement, and customer satisfaction for the Glass Product Division. Addressing issues with planning and budgeting procedures, structures of accountability, and the reward system can help to overcome these weaknesses and gain a more balanced and forward-looking understanding of performance. Integrating multiple stakeholder perspectives and a greater range of metrics is key to making the budgetary control system more effective as a tool for strategic direction and performance evaluation.
