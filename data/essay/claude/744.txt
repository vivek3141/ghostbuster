Charles Dickens is renowned for his evocative portrayals of Victorian London in his novels. His vivid descriptions of the city bring its teeming streets, foggy slums, and bustling riverfront to life. However, Dickens' treatment of London has been a topic of much critical debate. Early critics and scholars tended to celebrate Dickens' lively renderings of the city and see his works as valuable historical documentation of London in the 19th century. More recent critics have adopted a more skeptical stance, arguing that Dickens' London is an imaginative construct that reveals more about the author's own perspectives and prejudices than the actual city itself. 

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Dickens' depictions of London were widely praised for their verisimilitude and seen as a faithful representation of the city during the Victorian era. Critics celebrated the "photographic accuracy" with which Dickens captured London's places and people. His novels were valued as a kind of social documentary, providing insight into the lives of ordinary Londoners, especially the poor. There was a tendency to take Dickens' portrayals of places like the slums of Jacob's Island in Oliver Twist or the courts of the Old Curiosity Shop at face value as factual reports of the city's impoverished districts.

However, as literary studies became more sophisticated, this view came under scrutiny. Critics argued that Dickens' London was more constructed than strictly factual. His city was an imaginative vision that incorporated elements of reportage and commentary but ultimately reflected Dickens' own preoccupations and prejudices. The dark, sinister slums he described were exaggerated for dramatic effect and designed to highlight themes of poverty, morality, and social injustice. His eccentric characters and overwrought plots were equally synthetic. As Peter Ackroyd wrote, "Dickens' London is a mythical or metaphorical city which has been created from elements both imagined and observed."

In recent decades, scholars have analyzed Dickens' London from a variety of perspectives. Marxist critics like Steven Marcus have seen it as a critique of the alienating effects of industrial capitalism in 19th-century England. Cultural historians have examined how Dickens' writings were shaped by and contributed to popular Victorian conceptions of London as a teeming metropolis. Feminist and postcolonial critics have criticized the marginalization of women and minorities in Dickens' fictional London. There has also been interest in how Dickens manipulates genre and narrative techniques to create particular views of the city. 

In conclusion, scholars have shifted away from seeing Dickens' London as a strictly factual reportage toward understanding it as an imaginative construct that provides insight into the social, political, and literary preoccupations of the author and his era. While still captivating readers with its portrait of Victorian London, Dickens' treatment of the city can now be seen as an elaborate fiction designed to highlight themes of social injustice, explore anxieties about urbanization, and critique the contemporary society in which he lived. The critical history of Dickens' London reflects the development of literary studies from a na√Øve mimesis theory into a more sophisticated understanding of literature as a product of its time that shapes as well as reflects cultural attitudes and beliefs.
