A statistical analysis of exam performance and various attendance measures at a university can provide insight into the factors that impact student success. By examining the relationship between metrics such as lecture attendance, class attendance, and revision lecture attendance with exam performance, we can determine if attending classes and lectures regularly has a significant effect on how well students do on exams. Furthermore, analyzing if students' A-level results and year of study influences their exam performance can illustrate how academic achievement  progresses over students' university education.  

In this analysis, the dependent variable is exam performance, as measured by the overall mark received in the exam. The independent variables are lecture attendance, measured as the percentage of lectures attended; class attendance, measured as the percentage of classes attended; revision lecture attendance, measured as whether or not the student attended an optional revision lecture before the exam; students' A-level scores upon university admission; and students' current year of study.

To determine if there is a correlation between the independent and dependent variables, a series of statistical tests can be employed. First, a Pearson's r correlation analysis can be run to evaluate if there are any linear relationships between variables. For example, this can show if there is a positive correlation between lecture attendance and exam performance, indicating that as lecture attendance increases, so does exam performance. Next, simple linear regressions can determine if any of the independent variables significantly predict the dependent variable. For instance, a regression could reveal that both lecture attendance and A-level scores are significant predictors of exam performance.  

More advanced analyses using multiple regression can also be employed to evaluate if lecture attendance, class attendance, A-level performance, and year of study together predict exam performance. A multiple regression assesses if each variable contributes significantly to the prediction while controlling for the other variables. This allows us to determine which factors have the greatest impact on student success in exams.

In summary, through a statistical analysis of various attendance measures, prior academic achievement, and student progression, we can gain valuable insight into the factors influencing university exam performance. Correlation and regression analyses are useful techniques for evaluating relationships between variables and determining significant predictors. The results of such an analysis may be useful for identifying at-risk students, improving resources for students, and optimizing learning gains. Overall, promoting strong attendance and solid academic foundations can help set students up for success and allow them to thrive in their university education.
