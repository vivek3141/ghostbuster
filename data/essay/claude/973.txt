The dramatic ball scene in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 1946 film Dragonwyck exhibits many characteristics of Classical Hollywood Cinema. The scene relies on continuity editing and an overall smooth and logical progression of shots to depict the story in a clear, fluid manner. Familiar framing, lighting, and staging techniques are used to convey themes and ideas to the audience. In addition, the extensive use of dark, shadowy mise-en-scène helps to build a mood of suspense and foreboding.

The ball scene opens with a long establishing shot of an elegant manor house lit up in the night, setting the scene for the lavish affair about to unfold. The camera then cuts to medium shots of guests dressed in opulent attire arriving at the grand entrance and being announced by name as they enter the ballroom. These transitions between shots employ the continuity editing techniques of matching on action and shot/reverse-shot to create smooth edits that proceed logically from one framing to the next. 

Once inside the ballroom, familiar medium and medium close-up shots, and careful staging and framing predominate as guests mingle and dance. Characters are artfully arranged in balanced and symmetrical compositions within the frame. The hosts, Nicholas and Johanna, are first framed together as a couple to highlight their married status, but soon Nicholas is frequently shown alone or interacting tensely with his servant Patricia, foreshadowing the betrayal to come. The mise-en-scène reinforces these themes, with Nicholas often framed by the large portrait of his intimidating ancestor, the first Lord of the Manor, looming in the background.

Dark, shadowy lighting also pervades the ballroom interior, casting areas of the scene in an air of mystery and gloom. Much of the periphery of the ballroom is shrouded in shadow, isolating the characters together in pools of light. This chiaroscuro lighting and shadow imagery builds a sense of suspense and impending danger, reinforced by the ominous score.  

Overall, the ball scene in Dragonwyck makes effective use of the conventions of Classical Hollywood Cinema to tell its story. Continuity editing, familiar framing and staging, dark mise-en-scène, and a dramatic score work together to create a fluid yet suspenseful sequence that focuses the viewer's attention and foreshadows the turmoil to come. The scene is a quintessential example of the techniques used during the era to craft a compelling cinematic experience for audiences.
