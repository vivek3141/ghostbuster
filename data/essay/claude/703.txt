Characterizing and purifying sugar functionalized polymers presents several challenges due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of these materials. A variety of methods have been developed to analyze these polymers, each with its own set of limitations. 

Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is a common method used to determine the molecular weight distribution of sugar polymers. In GPC, polymer samples are separated based on their hydrodynamic volume as they pass through porous beads packed into a column. By comparing the retention times to those of polymer standards, the molecular weights of different polymer chains can be estimated. However, GPC has limited resolution and cannot provide information on the chemical structure or functional groups of the polymers. It also requires the polymers to be soluble in a suitable solvent, which can be challenging for highly functionalized or crosslinked sugar polymers.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for determining the chemical structure of sugar polymers. By analyzing the chemical shifts and coupling constants in 1H and 13C NMR spectra, the identity and connectivity of monomer units, functional groups, and linkages can be established. While NMR provides a wealth of structural information, it typically requires high sample concentrations and long acquisition times. It may also struggle with complex, heterogeneous samples containing many different polymer structures. NMR is not inherently quantitative, so it does not yield direct molecular weight information.

Mass spectrometry (MS) can be used to determine the molecular weights and sequences of sugar oligomers and polymers. In matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS, samples are co-crystallized with a matrix and then bombarded with a laser to generate intact ions that are separated and detected based on their mass-to-charge ratios. Electrospray ionization (ESI) MS is a softer ionization technique suitable for more fragile molecules. While very sensitive, both MALDI and ESI MS require highly purified samples and their signals can be suppressed by impurities. They typically only provide information on the molecular weights of lower molecular weight species, so they have limited utility for characterizing high molecular weight polymers.

Purification of sugar polymers usually involves precipitation or extraction to isolate the target polymer, followed by dialysis or ultrafiltration to remove salts and small molecules. Chromatographic techniques like GPC, ion-exchange chromatography, and affinity chromatography are also commonly employed. These methods can be time-consuming, often resulting in incomplete separation, and they require the polymer to have certain physical and chemical properties to enable effective purification. 

In summary, there are many useful methods for characterizing and purifying sugar polymers, but each has its own advantages and limitations. A multi-method approach, combining separation techniques with both bulk and molecular level characterization, is often needed to obtain a complete understanding of these complex materials. Continued advancement of analytical tools will further aid in the analysis of heterogeneous sugar-based polymers.
