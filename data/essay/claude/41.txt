The Cambridge Engineering Selector (CES) software allows engineers to evaluate and select suitable materials and manufacturing processes for a wide range of engineering projects and product designs. Using the extensive materials and process information available within its comprehensive databases, engineers can filter options based on project requirements such as geometric constraints, cost, environmental impact, and performance specifications.  

For example, if an engineer needs to select a material for a high-temperature component in a jet engine, they can filter the options by specifying a minimum working temperature, e.g. 3000Â°F. The search results may return superalloys like Inconel, titanium alloys, ceramics like silicon carbide, and refractory metals. By comparing properties like tensile strength, thermal conductivity, resistance to creep and oxidation, a suitable material can be selected for further analysis.

Manufacturing process selection can be done in a similar way by specifying parameters such as required tolerances and surface finish, potential for automation or mass production, and available equipment or budget. For a precision, high-volume component, the engineer may evaluate molding, stamping or machining options, while for a low-volume or prototypical part, 3D printing or manual machining may suffice.

In summary, software like CES equip engineers with a systematic approach for identifying, filtering, comparing and selecting materials as well as manufacturing processes. The projects and products designed and built with these tools are able to make full use of the vast range of options available in the advanced materials and processes of today's technologies. Overall, the CES aims to facilitate well-informed decisions that meet both the technical and commercial requirements of a diverse set of engineering projects.
