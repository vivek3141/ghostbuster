The railroad narrative of progress in the 19th century United States shared some similarities with the axe and mill narratives that came before it, but the railroad was also fundamentally distinct in its massive influence on the American economy and politics. 

Like the axe that tamed the wilderness and the mill that drove early industrialization, the railroad was a symbol of progress and innovation. The transcontinental railroad in particular captured the American imagination in the 1860s and 1870s. It demonstrated the power of human engineering and technology to overcome immense challenges. The sight of the "iron horse" steaming across the open plains fueled a sense of national pride in industrial achievement.

However, the railroad's impact was immeasurably greater than these prior narratives of progress. The railroad utterly transformed the American economy, enabling the first truly national market to emerge. Goods and people could now travel across the country in a matter of days, allowing for the specialization of agriculture and industry. The railroad boosted trade and commerce on an unprecedented scale. It also facilitated westward expansion and connected the country through a web of infrastructure that influenced where cities and towns arose.

Politically, the railroad was enormously influential as well. The Pacific Railway Act of 1864 was one of the most significant pieces of legislation in the 19th century, providing government bonds and land grants to support transcontinental rail construction. The railroads became immensely powerful corporate actors that shaped government policies. They employed armies of workers, spent huge sums on equipment and resources, and generated both great wealth and corruption. Debates raged around regulating these powerful companies and the role of government in enabling their success.

In the end, while the railroad shared some qualities of earlier symbols of progress like the axe and mill, its impact was so immense that it defined a new narrative of technological and economic transformation in America. The transcontinental railroad in particular captured the nation's imagination and demonstrated the almost miraculous achievements made possible through ambition, determination, and industrial might.  The political and economic consequences of the railroad revolutionized society in a way that the axe and mill alone could never match. The railroad truly stands apart as the defining narrative of progress in 19th century America.
