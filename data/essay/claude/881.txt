The city of Oxford is home to four major bookstores—Blackwell's, Borders, Waterstone's, and WH Smith—that attract a wide range of customers due to their varying locations, layouts, inventory, and atmospheres. In this report, I will analyze the key attributes and retail strategies of each bookshop to determine how they appeal to different target markets.

Blackwell's, located on Broad Street in the heart of Oxford city centre, is the oldest and largest bookshop, occupying multiple floors of an imposing historic building. Its vast selection of over 200,000 new, used, and rare books—especially academic texts and secondary literature—attracts serious readers and students. The multi-level labyrinthine layout of small rooms creates an intimate, almost private browsing experience conducive to serendipitous discoveries. The scholastic ambiance, overlooking the courtyard of Balliol College, appeals to intellectually curious customers seeking a quintessential Oxford book-buying experience.

In contrast, Waterstone's on St. Giles Street has a more modern open-plan design spread over two floors. Its front tables feature prominent displays of popular fiction and non-fiction, especially the latest bestsellers, aimed at casual readers and tourists. While also carrying a wide range of books, Waterstone's focuses on highly commercial mainstream titles in an attempt to draw in a larger customer base seeking trendy and accessible reads. Its central location, glass storefront, and sleeker décor give it a hip and contemporary feel that contrasts with the traditional atmosphere of Blackwell's, appealing to younger and more popular audiences.  

Borders, located in the Clarendon Centre shopping mall, closed down in 2019 due to the pressures of online retail competitors and changing reader trends. When it was open, it carried a range of commercial fiction and non-fiction, especially in popular genres like crime, thrillers, and romance. Its generic big-box layout and chain brand identity attracted deal-seeking customers in search of discounted bestsellers and impulse buys. The mall location suggested an attempt to capture weekend shoppers and families in addition to dedicated readers. However, its formulaic design and inventory failed to establish a distinctive brand identity and loyal customer base in the competitive Oxford book market.

Finally, WH Smith on Cornmarket Street focuses on convenience items like stationery, magazines, and entry-level fiction and non-fiction. While also selling a modest selection of books, especially Oxford-themed gift titles aimed at tourists, the dominant range of general merchandise indicates its primary customer base comprises passersby looking for quick impulse purchases and everyday essentials rather than serious book readers. The small ground-floor layout and limited book range lend it the feel of a neighborhood shop meant for practical community use rather than an inviting space for extended browsing or in-depth discovery.  

In summary, the major bookshops of Oxford have carved out distinct niches by catering to different readers and purposes. Blackwell's and Waterstone's dominate the dedicated book market by offering a choice between traditional or contemporary ambiances and stocking either academic or popular titles. The now-defunct Borders occupied a middle ground as a casual mainstream outlet. And WH Smith serves local needs as a convenient spot for essentials and small gifts rather than substantive book browsing. Through their locations, layouts, inventory selections, and general atmospheres, each store has adopted a retail strategy aimed at matching a particular set of customers and their book-buying motivations.
