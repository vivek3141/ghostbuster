The relationship between gender and pay amongst employees in a bank is complex with many factors that determine how compensation is awarded across the workforce. By analyzing the demographics and pay distributions of employees in a typical U.S.-based bank, significant insights can be gained into how different employee groups may face pay gaps or disparities in compensation. 

Looking at education levels, it is common for banks to hire candidates with at least a bachelor's degree for both entry level and more senior positions, especially in areas such as lending, wealth management, and trading. For example, according to Glassdoor, the typical education for a personal banker is a bachelor's degree. There are not substantial differences in minimum education requirements between men and women for most roles. However, when considering factors such as job position and level within the organization, differences emerge in how average pay varies by gender.

Job positions at a bank range from entry-level tellers and customer service representatives to executive leadership roles such as Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer. According to reports from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and Payscale, men dominate senior leadership roles while women make up the majority of tellers and customer service representatives. These differences translate into significant pay gaps between men and women when analyzing by job position. Senior leadership roles tend to be the highest compensated but are male-dominated, while more junior women-dominated roles such as tellers tend to be lower paid. 

When controlling for factors such as job position, education, and experience level, a wage gap remains between equally qualified men and women, otherwise known as the “adjusted pay gap.” According to Glassdoor research, for bank tellers with equal qualifications, there is about a 3% wage gap between men and women. Extrapolating that to higher-level positions, the pay gap widens significantly. This is evidence that gender discrimination and unconscious bias likely factor into how women are compensated in the banking industry relative to men, even when making the comparison amongst equally qualified individuals. 

Race also intersects with gender and pay in important ways. According to research from the Pew Center, Hispanic and Black women face wider pay gaps relative to white men compared to white women, who still face significant gaps in their own right. For example, Black women earn $0.67 and Hispanic women earn $0.59 for every $1 earned by white men. When considering the double impact of gender and racial discrimination, women of color face substantial pay disparities in the banking industry and wider workforce that cannot be explained by factors such as job position or qualifications alone. In summary, while education levels are similar across gender and race, discrimination and bias contribute to disadvantages in pay and career advancement for women and minorities in banks. By analyzing pay distributions, significant evidence emerges that gender, race, and the interaction of both category substantially impact compensation. Overall, women and minorities face discrimination and systemic barriers to equal pay and opportunity within the banking sector.
