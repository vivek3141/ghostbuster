Indexicals and demonstratives are words whose semantic content depends on the context of utterance, such as ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘this’, and ‘that’. They are important for a theory of sense because they show that the meaning of a word is not always fixed, but can vary based on the context. However, they also pose problems because their meaning can be ambiguous or indeterminate. Words like ‘left’, ‘rich’, and ‘now’ illustrate this, as they sometimes function as indexicals but other times do not. 

Indexicals like ‘I’ and ‘you’ depend entirely on context for their meaning. When I say ‘I’, the referent changes depending on who is speaking, and when I say ‘you’, the referent depends on who is being addressed. The meaning of these words cannot be determined without this contextual information. Demonstratives like ‘this’ and ‘that’ also depend on context, specifically the speaker’s intentions and the audience’s frame of reference. When a speaker uses ‘this’ or ‘that’, the intended referent is meant to be identified based on the utterance context, like a physical gesture or shared visual space.

Indexicals and demonstratives show that word meaning is not absolute or fixed, but depends on the speaker, audience, and context. However, they pose problems for a theory of sense because their meaning can be ambiguous, indeterminate, or depend on unarticulated elements of context. For example, if I say ‘this is interesting’ without any gesture or shared visual space, the referent of ‘this’ may be indeterminate. The meaning depends entirely on my unexpressed intentions, which my audience has no access too. Ambiguity may also arise when a speaker uses an indexical like ‘that’ to refer to one of multiple possible referents.

The words ‘left’, ‘rich’ and ‘now’ illustrate how the same word can sometimes act as an indexical but other times not. The word ‘left’ depends on contextual factors like the speaker’s spatial perspective and frame of reference. When I say ‘turn left’, the meaning changes based on which direction I am facing. However, in the sentence ‘left-leaning policies’, ‘left’ does not depend on the speaker’s context and means the same thing regardless of who uses the word. The word ‘rich’ also sometimes functions indexically, as in ‘he’s rich compared to me’, where the meaning depends on a contextual comparison class determined by the speaker. But in the sentence ‘rich people should pay more taxes’, ‘rich’ is not an indexical. 

The word ‘now’ is an example where there are differing views on whether its meaning depends on context. On one view, ‘now’ rigidly picks out the present moment whenever it is uttered, so it refers to the same time interval regardless of context. However, others argue that ‘now’ depends on the speaker’s context, and the interval it refers to changes based on when it is uttered. There are reasonable arguments on both sides, showing the complexity of determining when a word should be considered an indexical.

In conclusion, while indexicals and demonstratives highlight how word meaning can depend on context, they pose problems due to ambiguity and indeterminacy. The examples of ‘left’, ‘rich’ and ‘now’ show that the status of a word as an indexical is not always clear-cut. Resolving these issues requires developing a more sophisticated theory of sense that incorporates unarticulated elements of context, determines howmuch a word depends context to qualify as an indexical, and provides systematic methods for resolving ambiguities and indeterminacies in meaning.
