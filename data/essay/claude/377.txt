Compotech Industries Plc is evaluating three capital investment projects to determine which would be the most financially viable option based on net present value (NPV) analysis. NPV calculates the present value of future cash flows to determine the current worth of a project. Project A has an initial investment of $500,000 and generates $150,000 in annual cash inflows for 5 years. At a discount rate of 10%, the NPV of Project A is $196,619. 

Project B requires an initial $750,000 investment but produces $300,000 in annual cash flows over 7 years. The NPV of Project B is $358,593 given the same discount rate. Project C demands $1 million upfront but results in $500,000 in cash flows each year for 10 years, yielding an NPV of $801,593. 

Based solely on NPV, Project C is the most valuable option and should be selected. However, there are some limitations to consider. NPV does not account for qualitative factors like employee satisfaction or customer goodwill. It also does not consider alternative valuation methods, such as payback period, that may influence the decision. Conducting a cost-benefit analysis to weigh qualitative pros and cons as well as exploring other techniques could provide useful additional information.

While Project C aligns best with the goal of maximizing shareholder value in the long run, it requires a significant upfront investment that introduces more financial risk. The company's ability to fund such a large outlay and tolerance for risk are important strategic considerations. Project B may be a "safer" medium-term option that still provides substantial returns. Depending on Compotech's positioning and risk appetite, B could be optimal. 

In summary, based solely on NPV, Project C is the best choice. However, a comprehensive analysis weighing strategic factors, qualitative impacts, alternative appraisal methods and financial risk is needed to make the final determination. NPV should be used as a guide but not the only measure of a good investment decision. The advantages of NPV in quantifying value must be balanced with an understanding of its limitations and incorporation of broader strategic goals. The project that aligns with both short-term financial aims as well as the overall vision of the company will provide the greatest benefit.
