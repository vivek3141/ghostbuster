The relationship between worker happiness and productivity is complex and depends significantly on how we define happiness. If we define happiness strictly in terms of positive emotions and moods, the relationship may be tenuous. While a good mood can temporarily boost creativity and openness to new ideas, it may not directly translate into sustained gains in productivity. However, if we define happiness more broadly to include a sense of meaning, purpose, and fulfillment from one's work, the relationship to productivity becomes much stronger. 

When we think of happiness, we often think of positive emotions like joy, contentment, and excitement. Having these positive emotions at work, especially when engaged in creative tasks, can enhance productivity. Positive moods promote more flexible and open thinking, allowing us to see more connections between ideas and come up with more innovative solutions. However, emotions are fleeting, and the productivity gains from a good mood tend to be short-lived. Sustained productivity over the long run depends on more stable psychological factors.

A deeper sense of happiness comes from finding purpose and meaning in one's work. When work feels purposeful, aligned with one's values, and impactful, workers tend to be far more motivated and productive. They engage in their work with a growth mindset, pursuing mastery and excellence. They take pride in their work and go above and beyond basic job requirements. In contrast, when work lacks meaning or purpose, workers become disengaged, doing the bare minimum to get by. They see their work as "just a job" rather than a calling or craft.

The specific factors that create a sense of meaning and purpose at work differ for each individual. For some, meaningful work might involve developing expertise and skills, achieving flow states, collaborating with coworkers, serving customers well, or contributing to a cause larger than oneself. The key is that the work aligns with the individual's intrinsic motivation and core values in some way. When this alignment is present, the drive to succeed and flourish at work comes from within. External rewards and recognition remain secondary.

In summary, while fleeting moods and emotions may temporarily impact productivity, the relationship between lasting worker happiness and productivity hinges on a deeper sense of meaning, purpose and fulfillment. When people can pursue work they find intrinsically motivating, they tend to be the most productive, engaged, and excellence-driven. Overall productivity depends on optimizing work at both the job and individual level to create the conditions for this sense of meaning to emerge. Focusing on purpose and meaning, not just mood and morale, is key to unlocking the power of worker happiness.
