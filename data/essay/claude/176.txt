Employee involvement (DEI) programs have become increasingly popular in organizations over recent decades. DEI aims to give employees more voice, influence and responsibility over their work. This can lead to a range of benefits for the organization, such as improved productivity, motivation, and retention. However, for DEI programs to be effective, they require significant investments in communication and teamworking, as they can represent major cultural changes that need to be carefully implemented. 

There are several key motives driving the adoption of DEI programs. One is the desire to tap into the knowledge and experience of frontline employees. Employees directly involved in work processes often have valuable insights into how to improve efficiency, quality, and productivity. By giving them more influence over decision making, their knowledge can be better utilized. This can help identify opportunities for innovation and solve complex problems.

A second motive is to increase employee motivation and commitment. When employees feel more involved and empowered in their work, it can lead to greater job satisfaction and motivation.  They gain a sense of ownership over work processes and outcomes, rather than just following orders. This in turn can reduce turnover and increase retention of top talent. Loyal and committed employees are vital for organizational success.

A third motive is the need for flatter and more agile organizational structures. Traditional bureaucratic hierarchies are slow to adapt to changing market conditions. DEI helps shift more decision making to self-managing teams, allowing organizations to be more flexible and responsive. By delegating more authority to teams closest to customers and work processes, they can quickly identify and act on new opportunities.  

However, for these benefits to be realized, DEI programs require substantial investments in communication and teamworking. Simply informing employees that they now have more responsibility is not enough. Teams need to be trained in communication, problem-solving, and conflict management techniques so they can work collaboratively. Senior leaders also need to communicate a clear vision for the changes to address uncertainties and gain buy-in.

Communication and teamworking strategies aim to foster an open exchange of ideas, build shared understandings, and align employees around key goals. For example, cross-functional teams can be created so people from across departments can collaborate. Work systems and spaces can also be redesigned to enable more face-to-face communication. Ensuring teams have a clear purpose and goals, as well as the autonomy and resources to achieve them, creates the conditions for effective self-management. 

Leaders also need to provide ongoing feedback and coaching to support teams. As teams gain more authority and autonomy through DEI programs, they require guidance to ensure they have the capabilities and are aligned with organizational objectives. Leaders should meet regularly with teams to discuss challenges, provide advice, and review performance. This helps address issues early before they become major problems.

In summary, while the motives for implementing DEI programs are well-intentioned, their success ultimately depends on the effectiveness of communication and teamworking strategies. When implemented well with proper resourcing, training and leadership support, DEI programs can achieve the desired results of enhancing organizational performance through the knowledge, skills and motivation of employees. However, without these critical enablers, DEI will likely fail to live up to its promise. Communication and teamworking are the foundation for translating employee involvement rhetoric into reality.
