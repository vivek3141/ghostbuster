The emergence of the managerial class in the early 20th century was the result of several factors related to the growing complexity and scale of industrial production. As factories grew larger, it became increasingly difficult for a single owner or entrepreneur to oversee all operations. Middle managers were required to monitor production processes and supervise labor. The rise of multidivisional corporations operating across geographical regions and industries also demanded a cohort of salaried managers to coordinate activities. 

Some historians argue that the rise of management was a consequence of competitive pressures in markets and the need for greater efficiency and coordination. However, others counter that the managerial class emerged to exert control over labor and maximize profits. There is merit to both views. On the one hand, competition encouraged the adoption of new technologies and processes that required oversight by managers. Assembly lines, for example, needed managers to set production targets and quotas. On the other hand, managers were also charged with minimizing costs, including those associated with labor. 

The rise of management had a profound impact on industrial societies. Most notably, it contributed to the separation of ownership and control. Shareholders became passive owners while salaried managers made key business decisions. This raised principal-agent problems as managers did not always act in the interests of owners. The managerial class also introduced a new layer of hierarchy and bureaucracy into organizations that changed relationships between workers and employers. There was a stark divide between the largely middle-class managers and working-class laborers.

Managers exercised a high degree of control over the lives of workers by setting strict work schedules and enforcing rules regarding conduct and output. Some critics argue this control was exploitative while others counter it increased productivity and economic growth. There are elements of truth in both views. Strict controls and oversight maximized output but also limited workers’ autonomy and job satisfaction.

The rise of management has had a lasting impact on today’s society. Most modern organizations have a managerial hierarchy to oversee their operations. However, some argue that management has become too influential and controlling. Critics point to overly bureaucratic organizations, short-term thinking linked to quarterly reporting cycles, and widening pay gaps between managers and average workers. Defenders counter that management continues to generate economic prosperity and helps coordinate complex, globalized business activities. 

There are valuable lessons to draw from understanding the historical rise of the managerial class. Finding the right balance of control and autonomy, aligning incentives of managers and shareholders, and maintaining an equitable distribution of resources remain pressing issues today. Overall, management rose from the need to coordinate industrial production but has since become a powerful social class in its own right. Analyzing its origins and consequences provides insight into the key debates around business, labor, and hierarchy that shape capitalist economies.
