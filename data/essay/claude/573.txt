Judicial review refers to the power of the judiciary to review the actions of the legislative and executive branches of government to determine whether they are constitutional. While judicial review is an established power of the judiciary in many democracies, there are several contentious issues regarding its availability and utility.

One issue is whether judicial review allows unelected judges to overturn the will of elected representatives and undermine democracy. Critics argue that judges who are not directly accountable to voters should not be able to invalidate laws and policies made by elected officials. However, supporters counter that judicial review enhances democracy by protecting the will of the people as expressed in the constitution. It prevents tyranny of the majority by safeguarding the rights of minorities from potential abuse by elected institutions. 

A second issue is whether judges have the expertise and competence to make complex policy decisions. Critics contend that judges are ill-equipped to evaluate policy choices that elected representatives are better placed to make. Supporters argue that judges are capable of understanding policy implications with the help of expert witnesses and that their impartiality places them in a good position to arbitrate on policy.

A third issue relates to the subjective nature of judgments in some cases. Critics argue this can lead to inconsistent or politically-motivated decisions undermining the rule of law. Supporters counter that reasonable disagreements are inevitable and judges generally issue well-reasoned judgments based on an impartial application of the law. Strict rules guiding judgments and the possibility of appeal also help minimize subjectivity.

These contentious issues are relevant to a hypothetical case of a student expelled from school for drug use who challenges the decision in court. Regarding the first issue, some may argue that the court should defer to the school as an elected body. However, others would counter that the court has a duty to protect the student's rights. On the second issue, the court must weigh complex policy factors regarding discipline and education. Critics may argue that the court lacks expertise to evaluate these, while supporters would note the court's impartiality. Finally, subjective views on drug use in schools could influence the judgment, though strict application of policy and laws would curb subjectivity.

In conclusion, while judicial review remains contentious, there are good arguments on both sides of the issues. In specific cases, the persuasiveness of these arguments may depend on the particular circumstances and values at stake. The hypothetical case highlights how these long-standing debates around judicial review would likely shape arguments regarding the court's proper role in reviewing the school's decision.
