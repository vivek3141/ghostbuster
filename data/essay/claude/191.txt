The role of principles in deciding legal cases is a complex and debated topic in legal philosophy and jurisprudence. Some legal theorists, like Ronald Dworkin, argue that principles are crucial for coherence and legitimacy in the legal system. In contrast, the Critical Legal Studies Movement argues that an overreliance on principles leads to incoherence and indeterminacy in the law. 

Dworkin believes that principles, along with rules, form the foundation of the law. Principles refer to the moral standards that underpin individual laws and guide how they should be interpreted. For Dworkin, principles help ensure that like cases are treated alike and the law develops in a coherent fashion. Judges should consider principles when rules do not clearly apply or lead to unjust outcomes. By relying on principles, judges can make the law responsive to moral concerns and balance competing rights and interests.

However, the Critical Legal Studies Movement argues that an appeal to principles often obscures the indeterminacy of the law and the subjective choices judges make. Principles can be interpreted in multiple ways and used to justify contradictory outcomes. There are many possible principles that could apply to any given case, and judges have discretion in choosing which principles to prioritize. The law appears coherent and objective when judges appeal to principles, but in reality there are many possible interpretations and no clearly right answers. Principles end up masking the incoherence in the system rather than remedying it.

In conclusion, while Dworkin believes that reliance on principles brings coherence and legitimacy to the law, the Critical Legal Studies Movement argues that principles highlight the inherent indeterminacy in the legal system. There are compelling arguments on both sides of this debate. Principles seem necessary to achieve justice and make the law responsive, yet they also introduce an element of subjectivity and discretion that undermines the rule of law. The role of principles in law remains an open and complex question in legal philosophy.
