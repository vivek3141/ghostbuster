Consideration and intention to create legal relations are two fundamental requirements for the formation of a valid and enforceable contract. Consideration refers to the exchange of something of value between parties, while intention to create legal relations determines whether the parties intended their agreement to be legally binding. These doctrines serve to distinguish contracts from other types of agreements, such as social or domestic arrangements, and to determine seriousness and formality.

In modern contract law, consideration has largely become a formalistic requirement rather than a substantive one, but it continues to play an important role in determining contractual validity. Consideration must be sufficient but does not need to be equal or adequate, allowing for greater flexibility. However, the controversial topic of past consideration remains unresolved. Regarding intention to create legal relations, the courts use an objective approach to determine the reasonable personâ€™s view in assessing intent. The presumption of intent varies between commercial and social agreements.

The purposes of the doctrines largely remain consistent with contract theory; to promote economic exchange, secure execution of serious agreements, and prevent excessive litigation. However, substantial criticism exists for consideration, with some jurisprudence arguing it should be abolished or reformed.  Public policy challenges, especially estoppel, have also impacted the doctrines. Economic duress and unconscionable bargains can imply deficient consent, thereby undermining intention to create legal relations.

Overall, consideration and intention to create legal relations continue to serve important functions in modern contract law, but there is debate about their specific requirements, interpretations, and validity. There have been significant developments lessening the strict application of these doctrines, indicating the law may move further toward a more holistic approach in determining contractual validity. However, abolishing either doctrine entirely risks compromising key pillars of contract theory and stability. Minor reforms may be preferable to outright abandonment. In conclusion, consideration and intention to create legal relations remain essential, if imperfect, elements of contract formation with an evolving but enduring role in contract law.
