Ren√© Descartes introduced the idea of mind-body dualism, proposing that the mind and the body are distinct substances. However, this dualism gave rise to what is known as Descartes' paradox of mind and body: if the mind and body are separate substances, how do they interact with and influence each other? Descartes attempted to resolve this paradox through the argument that God connects the mind and body. 

According to Descartes, the mind is a non-physical substance whose essence is thinking, while the body is a physical substance whose essence is extension in space. In his Meditations, Descartes arrived at the clear and distinct idea that "I am a thinking thing" (Second Meditation), and that this thinking thing is separate from the body, which is just extended matter subject to mechanical laws of physics. However, Descartes also recognized that in ordinary experience, the mind and body seem intimately connected, as when a mental act of willing results in the physical movement of one's arm. 

This apparent connection between mind and body led to Descartes' paradox. As separate substances, mind and body share no properties in common and so cannot causally interact. Yet Descartes also could not deny the experience of mind-body interaction and influence. To resolve this paradox, Descartes argued that the mind and body are joined and the interaction between them enabled by God. In his Sixth Meditation, Descartes wrote: "There is no reason which can show that God could not make the material world in the same way as I now understand it, and ... join a thinking substance to it, and place the bodily sensations which we have within ourselves in that thought." In other words, God, being all-powerful, made the mind and body such that they seem interacting, by correlating mental experiences to physical ones.

Descartes' solution of distinguishing mind and body as separate substances but relying on God's power to join them is problematic for several reasons. First, it seems implausible that God would systematically deceive us into believing falsehoods about the nature of our own existence. The intimate connection between mental acts and physical actions suggests they share an underlying metaphysical bond, not just a correlation enforced from without. 

Second, distinguishing the mind from the body in a radical ontological way does not necessarily entail that they are entirely separate and causal disconnected. Two entities can remain distinct in essence or function but still fundamentally intertwined. As Spinoza later argued, mind and body may be distinct attributes of the same underlying substance, a compromise that allows their distinction to be upheld while accounting for their interaction. 
	
In conclusion, Descartes' distinction between the thinking thing and the extended thing led to his paradox of their seeming interaction. His solution invoking God's power fails to convince, as it relies on a systematic deception by God and does not recognize other options for upholding mind-body distinction while allowing for causal interaction. Descartes established mind-body dualism but could not resolve the paradox that arose from it through his benevolent God theory alone. Overall, Descartes' arguments in distinguishing mind and body do not necessarily preclude the possibility of their intimate and even interdependent union.
