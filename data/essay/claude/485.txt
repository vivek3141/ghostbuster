Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel One Hundred Years of Solitude is full of magical and fantastical elements that infuse the story with a sense of wonder and whimsy. Two of the most significant magical symbols in the novel are the pig's tail that grows out of the newborn Aureliano Segundo and the yellow butterflies that accompany the arrival of Mauricio Babilonia. These symbols take on deeper meaning and significance as the story unfolds.  

The pig's tail grows out of Aureliano Segundo shortly after he is born to Fernanda del Carpio and Aureliano Buendía. The tail is a fantastical and inexplicable phenomenon, shocking all who see it. Even the local priest cannot offer a reasonable explanation for its existence. The tail comes to symbolize the eccentric and absurd nature of the Buendía clan, as well as the element of unreality that permeates the town of Macondo. The pig's tail marks Aureliano Segundo as different and special in a magical way, for better and for worse. It brings him good fortune and luck as a child, allowing him to win at dice and gain great wealth. However, it also makes him an outcast and spectacle. He has to have it removed as a teenager to start courting Petra Cotes. The pig's tail is a perfect example of the illogical whimsical events that happen in Macondo, events that are simply accepted as a normal part of life by its citizens.

The yellow butterflies are another important magical symbol in the novel. They first appear as Mauricio Babilonia, the mechanic, is still a young man newly employed by the Buendías. He arrives in a cloud of yellow butterflies that follow him everywhere. The butterflies come to represent the ethereal and mysterious nature of Mauricio, who is a romantic and whimsical character associated with love and poetry. The yellow butterflies follow him for the rest of his life, acting as a kind of calling card announcing his arrival. They lend a dreamy, fanciful air to any scene Mauricio appears in, reflecting his imaginative and artistic spirit.

When Mauricio begins a clandestine romance with Amaranta Ursula, the yellow butterflies accompany them and come to symbolize their blossoming love and passion. Tragically, when Mauricio is shot by Fernanda's son-in-law, the butterflies disappear, representing the end of Mauricio and Amaranta Ursula's love affair. The vanishing butterflies highlight how fragile and ephemeral love and beauty can be in the world of the novel. Like the pig's tail, the yellow butterflies are a magical symbol that adds whimsy and poignancy to the story in equal measure.

In conclusion, the pig's tail and yellow butterflies are two of the most significant magical symbols in One Hundred Years of Solitude. They represent the fantastical and absurd nature of events in Macondo, as well as deeper thematic ideas related to love, beauty, luck, and tragedy. Marquez employs these magical symbols masterfully, using them to infuse the novel with a sense of wonder and meaning not found in purely realist fiction. They showcase his brilliance in blending magical realism and literature to create a story that is both utterly fantastical and deeply human.
