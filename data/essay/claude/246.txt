The perceived conflict between "Islam" and the "West" has been exaggerated and mischaracterized in public debates and policymaking. This false narrative of a supposed fundamental clash between two distinct civilizational entities has been perpetuated through several historical and ongoing factors. It has served to radicalize elements of Muslim-majority societies and has negatively impacted Western policymaking and conflict management approaches.

Broadly speaking, there is a false portrayal of "Islam" as a single, monolithic bloc that is fundamentally at odds with Western liberal values. In reality, Islam is an immensely diverse religion comprised of over 1.8 billion adherents with varying cultural, political and ideological beliefs. The majority of Muslims reside in pluralistic societies and democracies, with beliefs and practices that accommodate liberal values. However, a radical Islamist fringe minority promotes a globalized ideology that is in conflict with liberalism and pluralism. This minority has been wrongly perceived as representative of Islam as a whole.

This false perception has deep historical roots but gained significant traction following the September 11 terrorist attacks and subsequent "War on Terror." Key proponents of the "clash of civilizations" theory have characterized Islam as inherently incompatible with Western culture. Western political discourse frequently conflated "Muslims" with "Islamists", and the violent actions of extremists were depicted as representing widespread Muslim beliefs. The military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as human rights abuses such as torture and rendition at Guantanamo Bay further contributed to the perception of a profound conflict between the West and Islam.   

The perceived conflict has served to radicalize elements of Muslim societies through several mechanisms.  Firstly, it has increased the attraction of radical groups claiming to represent Islam against external threats. It has also enabled repressive regimes to garner legitimacy by positioning themselves as defenders of Islam. The prolonged Western military interventions and unilateral policies in Muslim-majority countries have fueled anti-Western sentiments and damaged trust in Western actions. Finally, discriminatory policies such as the "Muslim ban" have polarized communities and empowered extremist narratives of Western hostility toward Muslims. 

In reality, the threat posed by radical Islamists does not implicate Islam as a whole or reflect an inevitable civilizational clash. While radical groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS promote a violent Islamist ideology, their beliefs and actions are rejected by most Muslim-majority countries and Muslim communities worldwide. Hence, an effective policy approach should focus on targeted counterterrorism measures against radical groups, avoid rhetoric of an "Islamic" threat, and seek to build alliances with Muslim partners through diplomacy and cooperation.

In summary, a nuanced understanding of the diversity within Islam and each society is needed to counter the false narrative of an inevitable conflict between the West and Islam. Most Muslims strongly condemn Islamist extremism and wish to cooperate against shared threats. By avoiding rhetoric that fuels polarisation and radicalization, and through prudent policymaking and alliance building, the threat of radical Islamists can be addressed without implicating or antagonizing Muslim communities as a whole.
