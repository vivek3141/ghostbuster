Schopenhauer believes that compassion, or "fellow-feeling," is one of the rare instances in which human beings can escape the egoistic motives and desires that dominate their existence. For Schopenhauer, the fundamental reality of the world is the blind, striving Will - an endless, purposeless force that manifests itself in all natural phenomena and living beings. The Will manifests itself in individual human beings as the will to life - an unquenchable desire for life, existence, and the satisfaction of needs. This leads human beings to be almost entirely egoistic in their actions and motivations. They are driven primarily by their own desires, interests, and needs. 

Compassion, for Schopenhauer, is one of the few capacities human beings have to escape this egoism and Will. When we feel compassion for another being, we temporarily negate our own will and interests, and feel the suffering of the other as if it were our own. We escape the principle of sufficient reason that ordinarily traps each being within its own interests, and see another's distress "with different eyes." Compassion allows us to recognize that there is no ultimate difference between ourselves and others, that all are manifestations of the same Will. In this way, compassion is the only source of genuinely altruistic action. It prompts us to help others for their own sake, not because of what we can gain from it.

However, Schopenhauer acknowledges that compassion also serves the interests of the Will in a broader sense. By prompting us to help others in distress, compassion aids in the preservation of the species. It helps ensure the survival and continuation of life as a whole, which is the Will's sole aim. In this sense, compassion may originate from the same mindless, striving Will as all other human motives. While the individual may gain nothing from the compassionate act, the Will realizes its objective in continuing the existence of its manifestations. Schopenhauer thus suggests that compassion is in a sense illusory - we feel as if we are acting from a "selfless" motive, but we are really just instruments of the Will.

This connects to Schopenhauer's view that morality as a whole arises, not from reason or genuine freedom of will, but from the demands of the blind Will in human beings. The moral impulse is ultimately traceable to the Will's need to preserve humanity as a whole and maintain social bonds between individuals. Compassion in particular promotes these aims, as it prompts people to help others even at a cost to themselves. However, Schopenhauer suggests that the experience of compassion can at least temporarily free us from egoism and raise us to a higher level of moral insight into our shared identity.  

In sum, Schopenhauer portrays compassion as one of the sole means of escape from egoism and transcending our narrow individual interests. However, he also sees it as arising from and serving the interests of the blind, striving Will that constitutes the inner nature of all things. Compassion exhibits the paradoxes that mark Schopenhauer's moral philosophy - it is both the one source of genuine altruism and moral action, and yet itself a product of the aimless, amoral Will that Schopenhauer sees as the essence of all reality. His views on compassion thus capture both the possibility of moral excellence and its ultimate illusoriness in a world dominated by the Will.
