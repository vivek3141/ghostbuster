Frank Jackson's Knowledge Argument is an influential thought experiment that seeks to undermine physicalism, the view that all facts are physical facts. Jackson posits a scenario involving Mary, a  neuroscientist who has lived her whole life in a black-and-white room and gained knowledge about the physical world through black-and-white television and books. According to Jackson, when Mary first sees a red tomato upon leaving the room, she will learn something new - she will learn what red looks like. This seems to suggest that there are non-physical facts about consciousness that physical knowledge alone cannot provide.

Jackson argues that Mary gains knowledge of qualia upon seeing color for the first time. Qualia refer to the subjective, phenomenal experiences associated with sensations, such as the "what it is like" to see red. Because Mary has complete physical knowledge about color and the human visual system, the new knowledge she gains must be knowledge of qualia. Thus, Jackson claims there are non-physical mental facts that cannot be captured by physical facts alone. This contradicts physicalism, demonstrating an explanatory gap. 

Some objections argue that the knowledge Mary gains is not factual knowledge but instead a new ability or skill to imagine and conceptualize color. However, Jackson responds that new abilities arise from new knowledge, and Mary does gain new knowledge of what red looks like. Others argue that Mary only gains knowledge of qualia in a trivial sense, or that qualia are reducible to physical facts. However, Jackson argues if qualia were truly reducible, Mary's new experience would not provide any new knowledge. His argument depends on qualia being non-physical and irreducible.

While Jackson's argument is influential, it faces several difficulties. The scenario assumes that complete physical knowledge about the world is possible, which is controversial. It also assumes that knowledge of qualia is factual propositional knowledge rather than a kind of know-how. Additionally, Jackson does not provide a clear explanation for how non-physical mental experiences can interact with the physical world. For these reasons, while Jackson highlights issues with physicalism, he does not provide a satisfactory positive explanation of qualia.

In conclusion, Jackson's Knowledge Argument uses the compelling scenario of Mary and her experience of color to argue against physicalism. He claims Mary gains factual knowledge of qualia upon seeing color for the first time, demonstrating that there are irreducibly non-physical facts about consciousness. However, while this argument highlights difficulties for physicalism, Jackson does not provide a fully satisfactory explanation of the nature of qualia and their relationship to the physical world.
