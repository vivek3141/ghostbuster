DNA fingerprinting, also known as DNA profiling, is a technique used to identify individuals based on the unique genetic code in their DNA. DNA fingerprinting examines segments of DNA that are highly variable from person to person in the population. By analyzing several of these highly variable DNA segments in an individual's genome, a unique DNA fingerprint can be generated that theoretically is unique to that individual. 

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the molecule that stores genetic information in all living organisms. DNA is composed of two strands that wind around each other in a double helix shape. Each strand is made up of repeating units called nucleotides, which each contain a phosphate, a sugar called deoxyribose, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). The two DNA strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases in a very specific manner: A always pairs with T, and C always pairs with G. This complementary base pairing results in a ladder-like structure with the phosphate and sugar components forming the ladder's sides and the bases forming the rungs of the ladder.

The sequence of the four nitrogenous bases along a DNA strand forms the genetic code that determines the sequence and types of amino acids that a cell uses to construct proteins. Areas in the genome where the DNA sequence varies the most between individuals are known as polymorphic sites or loci. For DNA fingerprinting, scientists target areas of DNA that contain specific polymorphic loci with short sequences of DNA that repeat consecutively multiple times. These areas are known as short tandem repeat (STR) sequences. The number of times an STR sequence is repeated varies between individuals, resulting in different length fragments at that site in the genome. This is known as restriction fragment length polymorphism. 

To generate a DNA fingerprint, technicians must first obtain a DNA sample from the individual, such as blood, saliva, or hair follicles. Next, the DNA must be extracted from the cells in the sample. Extraction is done using a chemical reaction that bursts open the cells and releases the DNA strands. The DNA is then purified using a centrifuge and filtration to isolate the DNA from other cell parts and chemicals. 

The purified DNA sample is then subjected to polymerase chain reaction or PCR to multiply the amount of DNA at specific STR loci. PCR uses DNA polymerases, strands of DNA used as primers, and nucleotides to copy the DNA at the targeted STR sequences. By repeating this copying process multiple times, PCR can generate thousands to millions of copies of the STR loci.

The amplified STR loci are then separated by size using gel electrophoresis. Electrophoresis passes an electric current through a gel matrix containing the DNA fragments. Smaller fragments move through the gel faster than larger fragments. The fragments separate into bands that represent the different lengths of STR repeats at each targeted locus. The banding pattern of STRs, known as an electropherogram, generates a visual representation of the individual's unique DNA fingerprint.

In summary, DNA fingerprinting examines highly variable sections of an individual's DNA known as short tandem repeats or STRs. By targeting multiple STR loci in the genome, technicians can generate a unique DNA profile for identification purposes. The process requires extracting and purifying DNA from a sample, amplifying the STR regions using PCR, and then separating the STR fragments by size using gel electrophoresis. The final banding pattern represents the individual's one-of-a-kind DNA fingerprint that can be used for applications like forensic identification, paternity testing, and genetic genealogy.
