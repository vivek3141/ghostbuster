Tsunamis are massive ocean waves that are caused by abrupt displacements of large volumes of water. They are usually generated by earthquakes occurring below or near the ocean floor, but can also be caused by underwater landslides or volcanic eruptions. Unlike typical surface waves on the ocean that are generated by wind, tsunamis travel at very high speeds across the open ocean, up to 500 miles per hour. As the tsunami approaches the shore, the shallowing sea floor causes the tsunami to slow down, decrease in wavelength, and increase dramatically in height. Tsunamis can reach up to 100 feet high at the coast, causing catastrophic damage.

The key difference between tsunamis and regular wind-generated waves is their source of energy. Wind creates waves by transferring its kinetic energy to the water's surface. The energy and power of wind waves depends on factors like wind speed, duration of wind, and the distance over which the wind is blowing. In contrast, tsunamis are generated by a sudden displacement of water from earthquakes, landslides, or volcanic eruptions. The total energy of a tsunami is determined by the volume of water displaced and the speed at which it is displaced. 

A common misconception about tsunamis is that they are giant surfable waves. In reality, tsunamis move through the deep ocean as long wavelength disturbances that would not typically be detectable to someone floating on the surface. It is only when the tsunami waves reach shallower coastal waters that they become waves with high crests and deep troughs. By the time tsunamis reach the shore, they can cause devastating damage due to their massive size, high speed, and destructive force. 

Another myth is that tsunamis travel as a single massive wave. Rather, tsunamis contain a series of waves that can continue for hours. The first wave is not necessarily the largest. The danger can remain for the entire time the waves are coming in, which can be difficult to determine exactly. Tsunamis also do not always arrive as a wall of water as often depicted in movies. They can cause damage through flooding or the back-and-forth motion of water as multiple waves come in and recede, known as drawback. Drawback can be especially hazardous as it can sweep away objects and people in its path.

In summary, tsunamis are dangerous natural phenomena caused by underwater disturbances that displace large volumes of water. They are distinct from wind-generated waves and can have devastating impacts on coastlines due to their massive size, high speeds, long durations, and destructive forces. By better understanding how and why tsunamis form, as well as debunking common myths, we can work to better detect, monitor, and warn people about these threats to life and property.
