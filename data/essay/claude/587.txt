The "passionlessness" debate during the nineteenth century in the United States centered around the question of whether women, in particular, lacked strong passions and sexual desires. The ideology of passionlessness was closely linked to the "Cult of True Womanhood," which glorified women as pure, pious, domestic, and submissive. According to this ideology, women were naturally more virtuous and spiritual than men, and lacked intense physical urges and appetites. 

Proponents of passionlessness pointed to both religion and science to support their views. Religiously, women were seen as closer to the divine and less prone to sin. Scientifically, women were believed to have smaller genitalia and less sensitive nervous systems, making them less lustful. These beliefs were promoted especially among the middle and upper classes. For elite women, passionlessness justified their position in the private, domestic sphere, and emphasized their moral superiority over men.

However, the ideology of passionlessness was also repressive for many women. It denied them full humanity and dignity, portraying them as physically and intellectually inferior to men. It also justified the sexual double standard that gave men much more freedom to express desire and sexuality. For enslaved black women, the notion that "real women" lacked passion was especially damaging. They were stereotyped as highly sexual and promiscuous to rationalize the sexual abuse they endured.

In conclusion, while the "passionlessness" debate and Cult of True Womanhood professed to honor and celebrate women, in reality they were profoundly limiting and oppressive. They denied women autonomy and dignity, and were used to justify discrimination and abuse. Although passionlessness afforded some upper-class white women an elevated social status, for the vast majority of women it reinforced patriarchal control over their minds, bodies, and lives during the nineteenth century. Overall it is clear that for most women, passionlessness was more repressive than liberating.
