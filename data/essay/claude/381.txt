The 'shirking model' of efficiency wages explains involuntary unemployment as the result of firms paying workers higher than market-clearing wages in order to elicit higher effort levels. The model predicts an inverse relationship between unemployment and real wages, in which higher wages reduce the incentive for workers to shirk by raising the opportunity cost of job loss. Employers set wages above the market rate to prevent shirking, while workers provide higher effort to avoid unemployment. Macroeconomic changes that tighten the job market will reduce shirking, raise wages and effort, and increase supervision within firms.  

The essence of the shirking model is that employers often have imperfect information about worker effort, which allows workers to sometimes shirk their responsibilities and provide less than the desired level of effort. To mitigate this problem, firms pay wages that are higher than the market-clearing rate, which creates an incentive for workers to provide high effort to avoid losing a well-paying job. The higher the wages, the higher the cost to workers of being caught shirking and potentially losing their job. This higher pay for higher effort is known as an 'efficiency wage.'

However, by setting wages above the market rate, firms necessarily hire fewer workers than if they paid the market wage. This results in higher unemployment for a given wage level. The model therefore predicts an inverse relationship between unemployment and real wages. When wages are high, the incentive to avoid shirking is also high, so unemployment is low as most workers maintain high effort. But when wages are low, the threat of job loss is less severe, so more workers shirk and are thus unemployed. Employers essentially face a trade-off between paying higher wages or dealing with higher costs from shirking and supervision.

Workers play an essential role in this model by providing the higher effort that higher wages aim to elicit. When the job market is tight and the opportunity cost of job loss is high, the incentive to shirk is low, so most workers provide high effort. But when jobs are scarce, the cost of unemployment is lower, so more workers shirk which raises costs for firms. Macroeconomic policies and conditions that reduce unemployment, such as expansionary policy or economic growth, will make shirking less desirable for workers, reducing costs for firms. 

In summary, the shirking model of efficiency wages explains involuntary unemployment as the result of firms paying above-market wages to motivate higher worker effort. It predicts an inverse relationship between unemployment and wages and highlights the role of both employers in setting wages and workers in providing effort. Macroeconomic changes that tighten the job market can curb shirking, raise wages and effort, and increase supervision. The model provides key insights into how the relationship between firms and workers within an economy can influence the level of unemployment.
