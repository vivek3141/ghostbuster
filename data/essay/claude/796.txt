What is the evidence for suturing versus nonsuturing shallow first and second degree lacerations and tears of the labia, vagina, and perineum after childbirth? 

After childbirth, many women experience tearing of the genital area including the labia, vagina, and perineum. These tears are classified as first, second, third, or fourth degree based on severity. First and second degree tears, which are shallow or superficial tears, are common and typically heal on their own without complications. However, some clinicians opt to suture these minor tears to promote healing and improve cosmetic appearance. There is debate, though, on whether suturing shallow tears provides any benefit over nonsuturing or allowing tears to heal spontaneously.

Several studies have found no major advantages to suturing first and second degree tears. A randomized controlled trial followed over 1,000 women after vaginal delivery and compared suturing versus nonsuturing of minor tears. The study found no difference in pain, dyspareunia, incontinence, or urinary symptoms between the groups up to 12 months postpartum. The sutured group had a slightly better cosmetic outcome but took longer to heal. Another randomized trial came to a similar conclusion that suturing did not provide added benefit for pain, dyspareunia, or incontinence. These results suggest suturing may not improve outcomes or recovery for shallow tears.

However, some studies have found potential benefits of suturing minor lacerations. A study of over 4,000 women found that those with sutured second degree tears had lower odds of having an unhealed third or fourth degree laceration at a postnatal visit compared to those without suturing. Other research found lower odds of hematoma formation and wound disruption when suturing superficial perineal tears. While rare, some cases of delayed hemorrhage have also been reported with nonsutured tears. These findings indicate suturing could help prevent complications like increased bleeding, poor healing, or more severe tears.

In contrast, nonsuturing has some advantages as it requires no anesthesia or suturing procedure and has lower risk of suture-related issues like infection or granuloma formation.  Nonsuturing also leads to less pain and faster healing according to some research. A study found higher pain scores up to six weeks postpartum in women with sutured first and second degree tears compared to those without suturing. Similarly, a randomized trial found women with nonsutured minor lacerations resumed sexual activity earlier, indicating faster healing.

In summary, while there is debate on the benefits of suturing versus nonsuturing shallow tears after delivery, most evidence suggests that suturing does not provide major advantages for recovery or outcomes. However, suturing may lower risks like hematoma or poor wound healing and provide slightly better cosmetic results. Nonsuturing avoids the risks of suturing and may lead to less pain and quicker recovery but risks slightly higher odds of wound complications. Overall, both suturing and nonsuturing of first and second degree tears are reasonable options with pros and cons, so clinicians and patients can determine the best approach based on individual factors and preferences.
