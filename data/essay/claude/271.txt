Henrik Ibsen was a pioneer of modern drama who challenged many of the prevailing attitudes of his time through his plays. In 'A Doll's House', he uses the protagonist Nora Helmer to critique the patriarchal nature of 19th-century European society. Throughout the play, Nora is depicted as a 'doll'—a helpless object whose identity and agency are defined by the men around her, reinforcing the subordinate role of women in society.

From the very beginning, Nora is infantilized by her husband Torvald, who calls her "helpless little squirrel", "little featherhead" and "my little skylark". His pet names reflect how he sees her as frivolous, irrational and naïve. Nora also describes herself as her father's "doll child" and later Torvald's "doll wife". The doll metaphor represents how Nora is objectified and valued primarily for her beauty and submissiveness. She has been conditioned all her life to behave as her father and husband want. 

Nora's economic dependence on the men in her life also reflects the unequal power dynamics of the time. When Nora's father fell ill, she had to forge her father's signature to take out a loan to finance his recovery, demonstrating how as a woman she did not have control of her own finances. Now, Nora continues to be financially dependent on Torvald, having to ask him for money and secretly borrowings from others to pay off her debt. She lives in fear of Torvald finding out, aware of her vulnerable position.

However, as the play progresses, Nora starts to become conscious of her doll-like existence and develops a desire for independence. Her friend Mrs. Linde's return and her husband's impending new job highlight Nora's own lack of purpose and autonomy. She comes to see her life with Torvald as deeply stifling and limiting. In a defiant act, Nora slams the door on her husband and children in the final scene, choosing freedom over the comforts of the home. 

Through the journey of Nora's awakening, Ibsen delivers a sharp critique of the rigid gender roles of 19th-century society that denied women outlets for personal growth and financial independence. 'A Doll's House' serves as a radical call for greater freedom and equality for women, highlighting the need for them to break out of metaphorical doll's houses that they were trapped in. Overall, Nora comes to represent the New Woman emerging in Scandinavian society—one with a sense of self and prepared to forge her own path in a male-dominated world.
