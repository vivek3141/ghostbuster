Food policy and regulation in the UK has historically faced significant challenges and inadequacies that seriously undermined consumer trust in the system. Prior to the establishment of the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in 2000, responsibility for food safety in the UK was divided among multiple government departments and agencies. This fragmented system led to conflicts of interest, inconsistencies, and a lack of transparency that often favoured industry interests over public health.  

A key issue was that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) was responsible for both promoting the food industry and regulating food safety. This conflict of interest meant that MAFF was incentivized to prioritize the interests of food producers and retailers over consumer protection. For example, MAFF was slow to act on evidence in the late 1980s and 1990s linking bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or “mad cow disease”) in cattle to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans. Despite warnings from scientists, MAFF continued to allow contaminated beef into the food chain, leading to a major crisis that caused 176 deaths from vCJD. 

The division of responsibilities across multiple departments also meant a lack of coordination that allowed issues to slip through the cracks. For example, a Salmonella outbreak in the late 1980s that caused hundreds of cases of food poisoning was linked to infested chocolate, showing failures in regulation across agriculture, food processing, and imports. However, no single agency had a complete overview of the system to identify the problem early on.

In response to these failures, the Food Standards Agency was established as an independent non-ministerial department in 2000 to regulate food safety in the UK. The FSA was designed to operate transparently and prioritize public health over commercial interests. By removing responsibilities from MAFF, it eliminated the conflict of interest that had plagued regulation. The FSA also streamlined the regulatory system under a single agency to improve coordination across the farm-to-fork continuum.

In many ways, the FSA has been successful in overcoming past inadequacies and restoring consumer trust. It took swift action during food safety events, such as coordinating with retailers for widespread product recalls during a 2005 Salmonella outbreak linked to contaminated bolognaise sauce. The FSA’s transparency, including publishing the results of food surveys and hygiene inspections, has increased public confidence in regulation...
