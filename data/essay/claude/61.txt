Ren√© Descartes put forward an influential argument for mind/body dualism - the view that the mind and the body are distinct substances. He argues that the mind and the body have different essential properties, so they cannot be the same thing. The mind is essentially thinking, while the body is essentially physical. This view allows for the mind to be individually intelligible, as it is independent from the physical body. 

Descartes argues that the mind and the body can be clearly and distinctly perceived as different things. He invokes the method of radical doubt to call into question all of his previous beliefs about the world. The one thing he cannot doubt is that he is a thinking being - as even doubting requires thinking. From this, he deduces the essential attribute of the mind is thought. In contrast, the essential attribute of the body is that it is an extended physical substance. The mind does not share this attribute. Since the mind and body have distinct essences, they cannot be the same substance.

Descartes proposes that the mind and body causally interact, with the mind directing the body. But the mind is non-physical, while the body operates according to the laws of physics. This raises the question of how two fundamentally different substances can interact at all. Descartes acknowledges this is puzzling but maintains that the mind and body were designed by God to communicate, even if we don't fully understand how this is possible. The important point for Descartes is establishing that the mind is really distinct from the body. 

With the mind and body being separate substances, the mind can exist and operate independently of the physical body. This means the mind is individually intelligible - it does not depend on the body to function. Even if I had no body, my mind would continue thinking as that is its essence. The mind is self-sufficient in a way that the body is not. The body relies on a mind (or its physical substratum) to direct its actions, but the mind relies only on itself.

In conclusion, Descartes provides a compelling case for mind/body dualism based on fundamental differences in the essential attributes of mind and body. This view is necessary to establish the mind as an individually intelligible entity, one that does not rely on the functioning of the physical body. The mind can operate and exist independently as a thinking, non-physical substance, even if the body were to be no more. Descartes' radical doubt method reveals thought as the essence of mind, distinct from the essence of extension that belongs to the body. This allows us to perceive the mind and body as quite separate things.
