The early states that emerged in mainland Greece during the Bronze Age, from around 2000 BCE to 1200 BCE, displayed several defining features. They were primarily based around fortified palatial centers that were the seats of power for emerging elite classes. The power of these elites was based on control of resources, especially agricultural surplus and trade networks. At the same time, the character and power bases of these states impacted their organization and form. They lacked aspects of centralization that would emerge in later states. Power was concentrated at the local level in the hands of palace elites, and there were limited bureaucratic institutions.

The Mycenaean states that ruled mainland Greece were organized around fortified palace centers, with the most prominent at Mycenae, Tiryns and Pylos. These palatial centers served as the seats of power for an emerging elite class. The power and control of resources by these elites allowed the accumulation of wealth and the mobilization of resources required to construct the massive "cyclopean" walls and public works projects for which the Mycenaeans are known. Power and status were based on control of resources, especially agricultural surplus and trade. Linear B tablets provide evidence that the palaces exercised economic control over agricultural land and oversaw the collection and distribution of staple goods. Maritime trade also supported the rise of the Mycenaean elites. 

However, the Mycenaean states lacked major institutions of centralization that would emerge in later states. Power was concentrated at the local level, in the hands of the palace elites. There is little evidence for Mycenaeanstate-controlled centralized institutions, bureaucracy, or military forces. The palaces appear organized to meet their own local needs without strong connections to a broader state apparatus. Most interactions appear to have occurred at a regional and local level. 

The Minoan civilization on Crete emerged around 2000 BCE, centering around the palaces at Knossos, Phaistos, and Mallia. As in Mycenaean Greece, power was concentrated in the control of agricultural surplus and trade networks by palace elites. The Minoans relied heavily on maritime trade, exchanging luxury goods with Egypt and the Near East. Frescoes at Knossos depict the storage of jars, presumably filled with agricultural surplus like grain or olive oilâ€”allowing palace control of these critical resources.

Although more centralized than Mycenaean palaces, there is little evidence for strong state institutions in Minoan Crete. Power remained concentrated among the palatial elites, with a reliance on personal contact and loyalty. The growth and fall of the Minoan palaces, and broader shifts in Minoan culture seem regional or tied to particular palatial centers, rather than reflecting a coherent state policy or institutions. The lack of Minoan bureaucracy and records in Linear A script point to limits in political centralization and state institutions in Minoan society.

In conclusion, the early Bronze Age states that emerged in Mycenaean Greece and Minoan Crete were characterized by fortified palatial centers as the base of power for an emerging elite class. Control of agricultural surplus and trade networks allowed these elites to amass wealth and political power. However, power remained concentrated locally in the hands of palace elites. There is little evidence for the bureaucratic institutions or military organizations that would typify later states. Political centralization and state formation were limited, with regional and local dynamics remaining predominant. Socio-political structures were built around personal loyalty, kinship and clientage rather than strong state institutions.
