John Clare's poem "The Badger" presents a central interpretive dilemma in balancing its layers of meaning. On the surface, the poem depicts the badger's behavior and habits in detail with a naturalist's precision. However, the badger also serves as a complex metaphor for both political allegory and personal biography in Clare's work. 

The most straightforward reading of the poem is as a close observation of the badger's natural history. Clare describes the badger emerging from its sett at night, its fur and claws, its tendency to drag prey backwards into its hole, and other traits in a straightforward descriptive manner with scientific accuracy. For Clare, a keen observer of the natural world, such precise naturalism was an end in itself.

At the same time, the poem employs the badger as a metaphor for political allegory about enclosure and the loss of common lands. The badger's sett represents a natural claim to place and security that is prior to human definitions of property. When the badger is "dragged out" and "lost in clouds / Of dust and shouts and dogs and boys", it represents the violence of displacement from ancestral lands. The badger is a symbol for the common people denied their traditional rights by the enclosure movement. 

Finally, the metaphor of the badger extends to Clare's own personal biography of displacement and homelessness. Like the badger, Clare was "dragged out" from his native locale and "lost" when he was committed to an asylum far from home. The badger's confused circling in "wildering fear" represents Clare's own bewildered wandering and desire to return home. The sett signifies Clare's lost childhood, before he was "turned out" from the familiar places of his youth by the forces of politics and personal tragedy.

In conclusion, "The Badger" only seems like a simple animal portrait. Through rich metaphorical implications, Clare transforms the badger into a powerful political and personal symbol. The dilemma for readers is in balancing these diverse metaphorical meanings with each other and with the poem's surface naturalism. Ultimately, these layers of meaning are inextricable and intertwined, giving "The Badger" its strength and resonance. By focusing on this one animal, Clare raises far larger questions about place, identity, and society that remain highly relevant today.
