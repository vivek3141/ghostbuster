The use of both nitroxide mediated radical polymerisation (NMRP) and atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP) initiators in polymer synthesis can generate block copolymers of polystyrene. This is due to the relative independence of the NMRP and ATRP mechanisms during polymer chain propagation. 

NMRP relies on the reversible termination of propagating polymer chains by nitroxide radicals to control molecular weight. Initially in the single electron transfer process, a monomer molecule's available electron is transferred to a nitroxide to form a nitroxide anion and a carbon-centered monomer radical. The monomer radical can combine with other monomer radicals to form polymer chains with nitroxide end groups. The nitroxide end groups interact with the chain end to reversibly terminate its growth, then de-terminate to continue chain propagation in a controlled manner.

In contrast, ATRP manipulates the concentration of active polymer chain ends through a catalyst system. The ATRP catalyst, often a copper compound, activates a dormant alkyl halide end group by a single electron transfer to form an active polymer chain end that can propagate for some time before being reversibly deactivated. The catalyst maintains a pseudo-steady state concentration of active end groups, which results in controlled polymer chain growth.

When NMRP and ATRP initiators are combined, they can independently generate block copolymers of polystyrene. During the initial polymerisation, the NMRP mechanism results  in polymer chains with nitroxide end groups. Upon addition of the ATRP initiator and catalyst, the ATRP mechanism can activate the dormant alkyl halide end groups to continue chain propagation. Two distinct blocks - one controlled by NMRP and the other by ATRP - can be formed. The presence of remaining nitroxide end groups indicates the NMRP mechanism remains active. Similar results demonstrating the formation of block copolymers from NMRP and ATRP have been achieved experimentally.

In conclusion, the simultaneous use of NMRP and ATRP initiators to form polystyrene can result in block copolymers, indicating the relative independence of the NMRP and ATRP mechanisms. While NMRP utilises reversible chain termination by nitroxide radicals and ATRP employs a catalyst system to reversibly activate and deactivate polymer chain ends, they can operate concurrently without substantial interference. The generation of block copolymers demonstrates that despite their different approaches to controlling polymerisation, NMRP and ATRP achieve similar outcomes in synthesising well-defined polymer structures.
