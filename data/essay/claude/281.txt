The SWOT analysis framework is a useful strategic planning tool to evaluate the internal strengths and weaknesses of an organization, as well as the opportunities and threats from the external environment. However, like any framework, it has both benefits and limitations that must be considered when applying it.

A key strength of the SWOT analysis is that it provides a structured and simple approach to assessing a variety of factors that can impact a business or its strategy. By evaluating both internal and external factors, it provides a holistic view of the organization and competitive landscape. The internal analysis of strengths and weaknesses also promotes self-awareness about what the organization does well and areas that need improvement. This can help teams identify priorities and focus on leveraging strengths and improving weaknesses. 

In terms of weaknesses, the SWOT framework is subjective and static. It relies heavily on individual experiences and perceptions, which can be prone to biases and variabilities between different evaluators. The analysis is also often done at a fixed point in time, even though internal and external factors are constantly evolving. Regularly revisiting and updating the SWOT analysis is required to ensure key factors are not missed. The simplicity of the matrix framework can also mean that complex relationships and interactions between elements are overlooked. Some factors could be both strengths and weaknesses, or could be both opportunities and threats. The SWOT framework may oversimplify these kinds of complex relationships.

To apply the SWOT analysis effectively, businesses should gather input from a diverse range of employees to get different perspectives and reduce individual biases. They should also revisit the analysis periodically to stay up to date with changes. The factors identified in the analysis should be tied back to strategic decisions and priorities. Simply listing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats is not enough - they need to inform appropriate strategies, mitigating weaknesses and threats and capitalizing on strengths and opportunities. 

In summary, the SWOT analysis can be a useful tool for strategic planning when used properly with awareness of its limitations. Like any framework, it needs to be applied thoughtfully and revisited regularly to provide meaningful insights that can help shape organizational strategies and priorities. By following good practices, SWOT analysis can be an effective approach for businesses and industries in making strategic decisions.
