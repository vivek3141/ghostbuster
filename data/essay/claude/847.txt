The opening paragraphs of Louise Erdrich's novel 'Tracks' and Sharon Olds' poem 'Her First Week' both defy genre norms and employ literary techniques to draw the reader in and set the overall tone for the works. However, they do so in strikingly different ways.

Erdrich's novel 'Tracks' opens with a lyrical third-person description of the North Dakota landscape stretching out "shining under the haze of dust, swollen where the sun sank, the earth destitute" (Erdrich 3). Although this is the opening of a novel, not a poem, Erdrich uses poetic language and imagery to create a sense of the bleak and harsh landscape. The effect is to transport the reader into a specific time and place, signaling that setting will be integral to the story. The poetic tone also gives a sense of the spiritual connection between the landscape and the Native American characters. However, the land is described as "destitute", foreshadowing the struggles the characters will face. In just a few sentences, Erdrich defies the expectation of prose and uses poetic technique to set the tone for a work of historical fiction.  

In contrast, Olds' poem 'Her First Week' plunges the reader abruptly into raw, visceral imagery and stream-of-consciousness: "She is taking it off, / peeling it down past her navel, hips / cramped to push the tight / nylon off" (Olds 1-4). The jarring effect defies the convention of more lyrical or metaphorical openings in poetry. However, the disjointed style and focus on the physicality of a woman undressing is an unflinching approach that signals the feminist themes and subversion of poetic norms that shape Olds' work. The short, abrupt lines mirror the image of the woman peeling off her clothing, creating a claustrophobic effect for the reader. While Erdrich's opening is lyrical and rooted in spirituality, Olds' is sharply physical and psychological, plunging into a female consciousness grappling with identity and sexuality.
