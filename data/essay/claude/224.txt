What Factors Construct Human's Class Identity and How Is It Differently Constructed for Men and Women?

Human class identity is constructed through a complex interplay of social, economic, and cultural factors. For both men and women, occupation and income are two of the most significant determinants of class. However, class identity is also shaped by factors like education level, aspirations, social circles, and lifestyle choices. Moreover, there are some key differences in how class identity is constructed for men and women. 

A person’s occupation and income are strongly correlated with their class identity. Those in higher-status, higher-paying occupations, especially professions like medicine, law, and engineering, are more likely to identify as middle or upper class. Those in lower-paying service sector jobs or manual labor occupations are more prone to identify as working class or lower class. Income also plays a major role, as those with higher household incomes can more easily afford indicators of middle or upper class status like home ownership, vacations, private schools for their children, and other luxuries.

While occupation and income are important for both men and women, social and cultural factors shape class identity in gendered ways. For men, their occupation plays an especially significant role in shaping their view of themselves and how others evaluate their social class. As traditional breadwinners, the type of job a man has held has long been tied to his self-worth and status. For women, their own occupation and income plays a role but so too does their spouse or partner’s class status. Women have also faced more constraints and barriers in the workplace that limit their opportunities for higher-paying, higher-status jobs. As such, their class identity is often more strongly tied to their household’s collective social and economic position rather than their own accomplishments alone.    

Education level also impacts a person’s class identification. Those with college and postgraduate degrees are more likely to identify as middle or upper class, whereas those without a college education are more prone to identify as working class or lower class. Education shapes one’s career opportunities, income potential, social circles, and attitudes in ways that align with a particular class identity. However, women face disadvantage here too, as women were historically less likely to receive higher education and still today face barriers such as lack of access, expectations to prioritize family over career, and discrimination. So, while an educated man may translate his degree into a high-powered career and upper class lifestyle, an equally educated woman may end up in a lower-paying job and struggle more to match that lifestyle, impacting her own view of her social class.

A person’s aspirations and lifestyle also reflect their class identity. Those with aspirations of professional success, home ownership, world travel, and other markers of upward mobility are more inclined to identify as middle class or striving to become middle class. In contrast, those focused on financial stability or job security alone are typically more working class in their self-identification and aspirations. In terms of lifestyle, choices regarding healthcare, retirement planning, housing, recreation, and assets signal one’s class status. Purchasing decisions are also shaped by class with those of higher classes preferring certain brands, services, and luxuries. Lifestyle and aspirations, however, are also highly gendered. Women may desire and make purchasing decisions that reflect a higher social class, but lack control or access to resources that would enable such a lifestyle, especially if financially dependent on a spouse. Their class aspirations may also be more constrained by expectations to put family needs first before their own career or leisure interests.

In conclusion, while occupation, income, education, aspirations, and lifestyle all contribute significantly to shaping human class identity, there are some important differences in how class is constructed for men and women tied to larger social and economic inequalities. For men, occupation and income in particular have an immense influence on their class self-perception and public image. For women, their own occupation and income as well as their spouse’s status, family responsibilities, constraints on their opportunities and choices, and other barriers all intersect to impact how they identify and are identified with a particular social class. Overall, class identity is highly complex for all individuals, but gender introduces additional layers of complexity and disadvantage for women in navigating their own class status and affirming their class aspirations.
