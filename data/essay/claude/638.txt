Public prosecutors play an essential role in the pre-trial phase of criminal procedures across common law and civil law jurisdictions. However, the degree of independence afforded to prosecutors varies between countries, which in turn affects how they carry out their responsibilities regarding investigations and alternative case disposals.  

In England, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has a high degree of independence from political interference, but works closely with the police during investigations. The CPS has the power to direct police to conduct further inquiries, but in practice prosecutors rely heavily on police evidence gathering. The CPS can also discontinue cases for lack of evidence or public interest. This significant discretion has led to criticisms that the CPS is too closely aligned with police interests. On the other hand, the Director of Public Prosecutions in England has security of tenure, protecting against arbitrary removal, demonstrating a balance between independence and accountability.

In France, public prosecutors (procureurs) have traditionally had a hierarchical relationship with the Ministry of Justice and little independence. However, reforms in 2013 aimed to increase prosecutorsâ€™ autonomy in case disposition while maintaining democratic accountability. Prosecutors supervise police during investigations in an inquisitorial system and have wide discretion to dismiss cases. However, they can still be overruled by their judicial superiors, limiting full independence. The French system has been criticised for granting too much power to prosecutors without adequate checks and balances.

In Germany, public prosecutors (Staatsanwaltschaft) have a special independent and impartial status enshrined in the Constitution. They are hierarchically subordinate to the Ministry of Justice but independent in their core functions of investigations and prosecution. Prosecutors direct and oversee police during preliminary investigations, and have extensive discretion to terminate cases without trial. Restrictions exist through judicial review and democratic oversight by parliament. On balance, the German model provides prosecutors with meaningful independence coupled with accountability . 

In conclusion, public prosecutors play an important pre-trial role across the countries examined, but their independence varies substantially. England establishes prosecutorial independence through security of tenure, but close police-CPS relationships limit this in practice. France aspires to increase prosecutorial independence and discretion, but hierarchical constraints persist. Germany constitutionally enshrines prosecutorial independence with judicial and parliamentary accountability, achieving an equilibrium that could serve as a model for other nations seeking to balance independence and responsibility. Overall, no system achieves total independence, but Germany provides prosecutors the strongest foundations for impartiality in discharging their pre-trial functions.
