Before a court can evaluate the merits of a case involving a challenge to administrative action, such as the decision of a state school to expel students for drug use, it must first determine that certain procedural requirements have been met. These procedural issues relate to the courtâ€™s jurisdiction to hear the case and the proper involvement of the parties. If these procedural issues are not addressed satisfactorily, the court may dismiss the case without considering the substantive arguments. 

The first procedural issue to consider is whether the claimants have standing to bring the case before the court. To have standing, the claimants must have a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the proceedings and in their outcome. In a case involving expulsion from school, the students themselves would clearly have standing to challenge the decision, as they are directly affected by the disciplinary action. The parents of the students may also have standing, as the education and welfare of their children are at stake. However, other parties without a direct personal interest, such as community groups, would likely lack standing to pursue the case.

A second related procedural issue is whether the claimants have presented an arguable case. This requires the claimants to demonstrate that there is a serious issue to be tried. If the court believes the claim is frivolous or vexatious, it may dismiss the case as constituting an abuse of process. In an expulsion case, the students would need to show that there are reasonable grounds for contending that the expulsion was unjust or improper in some way. For example, they may need to demonstrate that the disciplinary panel acted outside its legal authority or violated principles of procedural fairness. If no arguable error can be identified, the court will likely uphold the original decision without hearing evidence and arguments on the merits.

A third procedural consideration is whether the rules of procedural fairness were followed by the administrative decision-maker, in this case the school disciplinary panel. The panel must provide the students facing expulsion a fair hearing and the opportunity to respond to the allegations against them. Key requirements of procedural fairness include adequate notice of the allegations, disclosure of relevant evidence, the right to call and question witnesses, and an impartial and unbiased panel. If these rules were violated in a material way, the court may overturn the decision on procedural fairness grounds without considering the merits of the expulsion.

Finally, the court will examine whether the decision to expel the students was reasonable and proportionate in light of all the relevant circumstances. This involves determining whether the punishment fits the offence and is within the range of disciplinary actions that could be taken against the students. The disciplinary panel must act rationally and reasonably in imposing their chosen penalty and must consider any legitimate expectations as to process the students may have. For example, if past practice suggested students would receive a suspension rather than expulsion for a first offence, the students may have a legitimate expectation that the panel would follow that approach. If the panel acts unreasonably or ignores any legitimate expectations, the court may overturn the expulsion on the grounds that the penalty was disproportionate or unfair.

In summary, there are four main procedural issues a court will consider before evaluating the merits of a challenge to an administrative decision: standing of the claimants, whether they have an arguable case, procedural fairness of the decision-making process, and whether the outcome was reasonable and proportionate. In the case of students expelled from state school, the students themselves will usually have standing, the decision can be challenged if the disciplinary panel erred or acted improperly, the panel must follow the rules of procedural fairness, and the expulsion must be a proportionate response. If these procedural requirements are not satisfied, the court may intervene on the basis of the process alone.
