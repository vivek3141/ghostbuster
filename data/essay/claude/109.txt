Public executions served several purposes in early modern England. Primarily, they were a means of deterring criminal behavior and maintaining social control. By putting executions on public display, authorities instilled fear in spectators and reinforced moral and legal codes of conduct.

Some prisoners refused to follow the expected script and died defiantly maintaining their innocence.

Attitudes towards executions were mixed and evolved over the centuries. Many believed they were a necessary deterrent against increasingly brutal crimes in London. Others saw them as barbaric, especially as sensibilities changed in the 18th century. The spectacle of a public execution was seen as uncivilized by some.

Critics argued that public executions brutalized society and made punishment a form of public entertainment rather than justice. There were also concerns that the publicity and spectacle surrounding executions glorified the criminal and encouraged
