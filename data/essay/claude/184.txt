Susan Blackmore's theory of memetics, coined in her seminal work The Meme Machine, proposes that ideas, behaviors, and cultural attributes spread and evolve in a manner analogous to genes. Memes, the units of cultural transmission, compete for survival in the "meme pool" of human culture and mind. Blackmore argues that this process can explain the development and spread of religion, language, technology, and all of human culture. 

However, the memetic theory has faced significant criticism on multiple fronts. First, the definition of what constitutes a meme is ambiguous and difficult to operationalize. Memes are meant to be the cultural parallel to genes, but there is little consensus on what specific cultural units qualify as memes or how they can be measured and studied empirically. Genes have a clearly defined biological basis, whereas memes remain fuzzy conceptual constructs. This makes the memetic theory difficult to evaluate scientifically and limits its explanatory power. 

Second, it is unclear how well memetics can scale up to explain complex real-world social and cultural phenomena. While certain isolated ideas or behaviors may spread virally, most cultural traits depend heavily on a network of associations, contextual influences, and evolved cognitive dispositions. Memetics tends to favor a simplified model of imitation and competition that does not reflect how culture is created, spread, and shaped in practice. Culture depends more on cooperation, remixing of existing elements, and active human agency than the memetic theory acknowledges.  

Finally, Blackmore's own application of memetics to critique religion reveals issues with the theory's objectivity and consistency. She argues that religious memes spread by disabling critical thinking and enforcing imitation, allowing religious beliefs to outcompete rational or scientific ones. However, this analysis reflects an atheistic bias that leads to an overly cynical view of religious belief. It also contradicts her view that memes spread based on their own adaptive benefits for human psychology and culture. Religious beliefs provide meaning and social benefits for many, rather than spreading purely through suppression of reason.

In conclusion, while memetics offers a provocative theory of cultural evolution, it faces significant limitations in its definition, applicability, and objectivity. For the memetic theory to evolve into a more robust framework, it must develop a more precise definition of memes, better account for the complexity of how culture forms in practice, and avoid biases that lead to inconsistent applications of the theory. With progress on these fronts, memetics could provide useful insights into cultural transmission and change. But as it currently stands, the theory is more thought-provoking than scientifically or socially useful.
