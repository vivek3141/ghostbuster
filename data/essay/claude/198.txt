Indicators of development such as life expectancy, infant mortality rate, and adult literacy rate were used to investigate the relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and military expenditure as a percentage of GDP in 50 randomly selected countries in 2002. Data on these indicators were obtained from the World Development Indicators database, and Excel was used to analyze the data and look for statistical relationships. 

The life expectancy in a country is a measure of the overall health and well-being of its population, and there is a strong, positive correlation between life expectancy and GDP per capita across countries. Countries with higher GDP, such as Norway and Japan, tended to have higher life expectancy, often over 80 years. Poorer countries like Sierra Leone and Central African Republic had much lower life expectancy, under 50 years. Infant mortality rate is also an indicator of a country’s health and development, as it measures the number of infants dying before their first birthday per 1,000 live births. There was a strong, negative correlation between infant mortality and GDP, with wealthier nations experiencing less than 5 deaths per 1,000 births, and poorer countries over 100 deaths.

Adult literacy rate measures the percentage of people over 15 years old who can read and write. There was a clear positive relationship between literacy rate and GDP. Most high-income countries boasted literacy rates over 95%, while many low-income countries were below 50%. GDP itself is a measure of a nation’s economic activity and standard of living. The 50 countries in this analysis covered a wide range, from under $1,000 per capita in the poorest countries up to over $30,000 in the richest nations.

In terms of military expenditure, there was no clear relationship with GDP. As a percentage of GDP, military spending varied widely for countries at all income levels. Some poorer countries spent a high percentage, over 5% of GDP, on their militaries, as did some wealthier nations. Other countries at both ends of the income spectrum spent less than 1% of GDP on defense. There appeared to be no correlation between standard of living or human development and proportional spending on the military.

In conclusion, while higher GDP per capita was strongly associated with higher life expectancy, lower infant mortality, and higher literacy, it did not show a clear relationship with military expenditure relative to GDP. Wealthier, more developed nations tended to display better outcomes on health and education indicators, but they varied widely in their spending on defense as a percentage of their economy. The lack of a statistical relationship suggests that military expenditure depends more on a country's unique security concerns and strategic priorities than on its overall level of prosperity or development.
