There are several factors that can affect a student's exam performance. Statistical techniques such as means, medians, correlations, and regression analysis can help explore and quantify the relationship between these factors and exam scores. Data from a survey of second year econometrics students can be analyzed to determine the impact of attendance, sex, year of study, and course selection on exam performance.

A student's attendance in class and engagement with the course material is one of the most significant factors affecting their exam performance. Students who attend more classes and spend more time studying the material will have a stronger grasp of concepts and topics covered on the exams. The mean and median attendance for students can be calculated to get a sense of the central tendency. Then the correlation between attendance rates and exam scores can be measured to determine the strength and direction of the relationship. A strong positive correlation would indicate that as attendance increases, so do exam scores. 

A student's sex or gender is another attribute that could potentially impact their exam performance. Calculating mean exam scores for males and females and comparing the median scores can reveal any differences in central tendency. Then measuring the correlation between sex and exam performance can uncover any relationships. A statistically significant correlation may suggest that one sex tends to outperform the other on exams, on average. However, sex alone does not necessarily cause differences in achievement, so additional factors would need to be controlled for.

A student's year of study, whether first year, second year, or higher, may also affect their exam performance. More advanced students with more experience in a subject area and more practice with exams in their field of study may achieve higher scores, on average. Comparing mean, median, and correlations for exam performance across student years can indicate any trends. Stronger positive correlations for more senior students suggest greater experience and expertise translates to improved exam performance. 

The specific courses that students take can significantly impact their scores on course exams. Certain courses may be more challenging, focus more heavily on quantitative concepts, or test in ways that play to some students' strengths over others. Exploring differences in mean and median exam scores between courses using a technique like analysis of variance (ANOVA) can detect any statistically significant distinctions. Some courses may emerge as more difficult, based on lower mean scores. Correlations can also measure how much of the variance in exam performance is explained by the particular course taken.

Other lifestyle factors like money spent on food, coffee, and alcohol may also correlate with a student's exam performance, either positively or negatively. Students who spend more on sustenance and caffeine may have more time and resources to devote to studying, which could boost their scores. On the other hand, more lavish lifestyles or excessive alcohol consumption could detract from studying and hamper exam performance. Correlation analysis and cross-plots of these factors and exam scores would add to the broader understanding of influences on student achievement.   

In summary, analyzing means, medians, correlations, and regression models for the factors of attendance, sex, student experience, course selection, and lifestyle habits can lend many insights into the determinants of success on college exams.  While some factors may emerge as statistically significant, they only ever partially explain variations in performance from individual to individual.  Every student's story is different, so quantitative data should be interpreted carefully and judiciously. Overall, a mix of personal attributes, behaviors, choices, and skills ultimately shape a student's ability to excel on their exams.
