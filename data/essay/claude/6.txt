The experiments conducted by Joshua Lederberg and Edward Tatum in the 1940s aimed to establish the order of genes on the Escherichia coli chromosome involved in amino acid metabolism and sugar catabolism. They used bacterial conjugation, a process of genetic recombination, to determine which genes were linked and mapped the order of a number of genes on the E. coli chromosome. 

Bacterial conjugation involves the transfer of genetic material between two bacteria. Donor bacteria contain F-factor or F-plasmids, which are able to transfer to recipient bacteria. The transfer of F-factors leads to the exchange of chromosomal genes that are in close proximity to the point of F-factor integration. By observing which combinations of mutations or wild-type alleles were transferred together, Lederberg and Tatum inferred that those genes must be linked and located near each other on the chromosome.

Lederberg and Tatum studied mutants with defects in the metabolism of amino acids and sugars to establish the gene order. They identified single-gene mutants, called auxotrophs, with mutations in specific metabolic pathways. When they mixed auxotrophic donor strains with wild-type recipients, they checked which metabolic functions were restored in the recipients after conjugation. The genes that were co-transferred and enabled the restoration of the same metabolic pathways were concluded to be genetically linked. Using this approach, they mapped the order of several genes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids such as threonine, leucine, and proline, as well as genes involved in sugar catabolism.

The mapping of linked genes on bacterial chromosomes showed that bacteria could evolve through horizontal gene transfer and acquire new combinations of alleles. When beneficial alleles are acquired together due to their proximity, it can allow bacteria to adapt to their environments. The clustering of genes encoding related functions also enables their co-regulation. However, the close linkage of genes is problematic when undesirable genes, such as those conferring antibiotic resistance, are also co-transferred. The spread of multi-drug resistance in bacteria is an example where linkage of resistance genes poses risks.

While the experiments of Lederberg and Tatum were groundbreaking, the mapping achieved with conjugation alone was limited in resolution. The use of restriction enzymes that cut DNA at specific sites allowed for a much more precise mapping of the E. coli genome. By cutting the chromosome into smaller pieces that could be separated with gel electrophoresis, it was possible to determine the position and order of genes relative to each other at a higher resolution. The development of DNA sequencing later enabled the complete mapping and sequencing of the E. coli genome.

In summary, Lederberg and Tatum used conjugation to establish the order of several genes involved in amino acid and sugar metabolism on the E. coli chromosome. Their work demonstrated how genetic recombination in bacteria can lead to the evolution of new metabolic abilities but also the spread of undesirable traits. More advanced techniques like restriction mapping and DNA sequencing were required to achieve precise and complete mapping of the E. coli genome.
