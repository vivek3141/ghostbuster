The main econometric analysis and regression model used in this essay is a multivariate OLS regression model to explore the impact of several independent variables on the dependent variable of exam marks. The key independent variables focused on include: revision lecture attendance, ability as measured by prior A-level scores, and hours spent on lectures. Dummy variables are also included to control for differences in cohort year.

The inclusion of variables that could impact exam performance aims to determine if certain factors are statistically significant while controlling for other independent variables. The first variable considered is revision lecture attendance. The expectation is that higher attendance would correlate with higher exam marks, holding other factors constant.A positive and significant coefficient would indicate this. A statistically significant but negative coefficient could signal issues with the revision lecture materials or structure of the courses.

The second variable is the students' ability as measured by A-level scores prior to university admission. The expectation is that higher ability, as measured by high A-level scores, should correlate with higher exam marks. A positive and significant coefficient would support this. If the coefficient is negative, there could be issues with teaching to students of different abilities or the material may need to change to align better with students' knowledge bases.

The third variable is the number of hours students report spending on lectures. The expectation is that more time studying lectures and materials covered in those lectures should correlate with higher exam scores, ceteris paribus. However, the relationship may be nonlinear, and at a certain point, more hours spent studying provides diminished returns or even lower exam marks if students are overstudying or less efficient in their studying approach. Therefore, a positively significant coefficient would indicate studying impacts scores up to a certain point, while a nonlinear correlation could show eventually lower predicted scores with many hours spent studying. 

Dummy variables are also included to control for differences across the years, with the first year of data serving as the comparison baseline. The dummy variables can determine if scores in certain years were significantly different compared to the baseline year, holding other factors constant. Significant and negative (positive) coefficients would indicate lower (higher) scores for those years compared to the baseline. Including dummy variables reduces omitted variable bias by controlling for year differences that could otherwise impact the estimates.

The Chow test can determine if the coefficients in the model are stable over the time periods analyzed or if there is a structural break, in which case separate regressions should be estimated. A significant Chow test would indicate instability in the coefficients, while an insignificant result would mean the model's coefficients are consistent over time. Understanding this constancy, or lack thereof, is important for determining if one regression model can accurately represent the entire time period. Significant Chow test results would warrant separate regressions for each subset where coefficients differ significantly.

In summary, the regression analysis helps determine what factors, specifically the independent variables focused on, significantly impact the dependent variable of exam scores, while controlling for other influences. Understanding how and why the coefficients change or do not change over time gives further information about the relationships between the variables during the periods studied. The inclusion of dummy variables controls for differences between years, and the Chow test examines if a structural break exists in the data.
