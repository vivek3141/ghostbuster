Should the UK introduce compulsory identity cards for all citizens? This is a complex issue with arguments on both sides. On the one hand, identity cards could help combat terrorism, reduce identity fraud, and assist law enforcement in their investigations. However, compulsory identity cards also raise significant civil liberties concerns, are an administrative burden, and may not achieve the intended outcomes.

There are several arguments commonly made in favor of introducing compulsory national identity cards. First, identity cards could help prevent terrorism by making it more difficult for potential terrorists to travel anonymously or open bank accounts. In theory, identity cards will make it easier for security services to track suspects and identify connections between individuals. However, the extent to which identity cards curb terrorism is debated, as determined terrorists can still travel under fake identities or use anonymous payment methods.  

Second, identity cards are argued to reduce identity fraud by making it harder for criminals to impersonate others or open accounts in fake names. According to UK Finance, identity fraud costs £1.1 billion per year, affecting nearly 200,000 people. Identity cards could reduce these types of fraud by requiring people to prove their identity when accessing services. On the other hand, identity thieves have been adept at circumventing other security systems, so identity cards may not eliminate identity fraud and could simply cause criminals to shift to other types of fraud.   

A third argument for identity cards is that they will give police and border control officials a useful tool for verifying people's identities and tracking suspected criminals. Identity cards could speed up processes like checking passengers at borders or verifying that someone is who they claim to be. However, others argue that identity cards will not give law enforcement substantially more power than they already have and may encourage overly intrusive stops and searches. There are also concerns that identity cards could be misused for mass government surveillance.

In contrast, there are several arguments against introducing compulsory identity cards. First, identity cards infringe on civil liberties by subjecting citizens to a constant requirement to prove their identity and giving the government significant power over people’s data and movements. There are concerns about how much data will be collected, who will have access to it, and how it may be used in the future. Once a system of identity cards and associated databases is in place, it could be vulnerable to function creep, with increasing amounts of data collected and shared across agencies over time.

Second, a compulsory identity card system would be an enormous administrative burden that costs billions of pounds to establish and maintain annually. The UK government’s previous attempt to introduce identity cards in the mid-2000s was scrapped in 2010 due to escalating costs. Critics argue that the funds required would be better spent on more effective law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts. The time and money required for citizens to continually renew and replace their identity cards may also outweigh any benefits.

In conclusion, while there are arguments on both sides, the potential downsides of introducing compulsory identity cards for all UK citizens are substantial. Identity cards pose risks to civil liberties, would require enormous financial and bureaucratic resources to implement, and may not achieve the intended goals of reducing terrorism, crime, and fraud. The costs to privacy and freedom could outweigh the potential security benefits. There are likely other, less intrusive policy options available to address these issues that do not require subjecting the entire population to a constant identity verification regime.
