The function and significance of time differs greatly between Jane Austen's novel 'Emma' and William Shakespeare's play 'The Winter's Tale'. In Emma, time progresses in a linear, chronological fashion, spanning the course of two years and representing the mundane realities of everyday life in 1800s England. In contrast, time in The Winter's Tale is fluid, jumping forward by sixteen years in the middle of the play. This compressed time scale and the gap between the two halves of the play highlights the transformative power of time and the possibility for change in one's character and fortunes.  

In Emma, time progresses naturally and sequentially through the seasons, reinforcing the novel's focus on everyday social interactions and relationships in a small town. The events of the novel span two years, from autumn to autumn, reflecting Emma's gradual maturation and development over this ordinary period of time. The unhurried pacing of the novel, with detailed accounts of Emma's visits, outings, and card games, emphasize the mundane rhythms of daily life. The changes that occur happen gradually, prompted by supposedly minor events and interactions that accumulate to produce real transformations in Emma's outlook and situation by the novel's end. The steady, progressive movement of time through the changing seasons parallels Emma's coming of age and the small revelations that advance her self-knowledge and wisdom.

In contrast, time in The Winter's Tale is erratic and volatile. The play is evenly split between Sicily and Bohemia, separated by a gap of sixteen years in which significant events remain hidden from the audience. The shift in locations and the compression of time serve to highlight how much characters and relationships can change in the face of loss and regret. Leontes' descent into jealous rage occupies the first half of the play, but the second half takes place long after he has come to repent of his mistaken actions. The missing gap of sixteen years leaves his reconciliation with Hermione and Perdita, as well as the restoration of his kingdom, pleasingly ambiguous and open to interpretation. The sudden acceleration of time reinforces the play's theme of loss and regret, as well as the possibility of forgiveness and redemption.

In conclusion, Austen's Emma and Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale employ contrasting treatments of time to highlight their principal themes and ideas. The steady progress of mundane time in Emma reflects the gradual process of maturity and self-knowledge. In contrast, the erratic and volatile time scale of The Winter's Tale reinforces the transformative power of loss and regret, as well as the potential for forgiveness and restoration. The differences in the representation of time are thus crucial to understanding the deeper meanings and ideas addressed in these two influential works of English literature.
