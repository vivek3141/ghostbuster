Sloman's dual systems theory of reasoning proposes that humans have two separate cognitive systems for reasoning and decision making. The first system is a fast, implicit, emotionally-tinged, and automatic system while the second is a slow, deliberative, and explicit system (Sloman, 1996). The theory suggests that these two systems often operate at the same time in response to a situation, sometimes leading to conflict.

The fast and implicit system, also known as System 1, is characterized as a habit-based system that works automatically without deliberation. This system relies on heuristics and associations developed over time through experiences. For example, our System 1 would allow us to respond in a flash to catching a falling object without having to think through the motor movements involved. This system is also attuned to emotions and intuition. Many of our spontaneous reactions and gut instincts come from System 1. Being fast and automatic, this system does not tire easily and can handle parallel processing, allowing us to do several implicit things at once. However, the speed and biases of System 1 make it prone to psychological fallacies and errors. 

The slow and deliberative system, known as System 2, involves conscious reasoning and logical thinking. This system is intentional, effortful, and can follow learned rules. Solving a complex math problem or logical reasoning requires System 2. While System 1 is fast, System 2 requires time and mental resources. Our conscious attention can only handle one System 2 task at a time. System 2 can override System 1 but it also relies on System 1 to provide intuitions and suggestions which it can then evaluate and monitor. When we are distracted or under cognitive load, System 1 has more influence on our thinking while System 2 is less able to monitor for errors.

Evidence for the dual systems theory comes from many areas of research. For example, studies on implicit biases show the rapid and intuitive responses reflecting System 1, such as implicit stereotyping. However, when people are made aware of the bias and have sufficient motivation and cognitive resources, their System 2 can override the bias to make fair judgments, reflecting the interaction between the two systems.  

In daily life, we frequently experience conflicts between the intuitive suggestions from System 1 and the rational analyses from System 2. For example, when making important decisions, our first impulse may be based on gut instinct but we deliberately evaluate options based on logical reasoning to reach a well-considered choice. Our spending behavior often reflects situations where we give in to the temptation from System 1 rather than the financial prudence from System 2. Voters may also experience conflicts between their habitual partisan tendencies versus rational evaluations of policies and candidates.

In summary, Sloman's dual systems theory proposes the coexistence of instinctive intuitive processes and deliberative reasoning in human thinking. Understanding both systems and how they interact is important to gaining insight into human judgment and decision making, both in applied and theoretical domains. Overall, the dual systems theory provides a compelling model for understanding both human rationality and irrationality.
