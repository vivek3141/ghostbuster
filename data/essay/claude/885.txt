The objective of using photoelasticity in a laboratory is to observe and measure the stress distribution in a transparent material. Photoelasticity utilizes the property of birefringence in certain transparent materials like plastic to visualize the stress pattern. When a photoelastic material is subject to external loads, it exhibits a pattern of light and dark bands called isochromes. These bands correspond to changes in the refractive index of the material due to the stress distribution. By observing the isochromes, the stress distribution can be mapped.

Photoelasticity is commonly used to determine the stress concentration factor in a material. The stress concentration factor refers to the ratio of the maximum stress to the nominal stress in a loaded component. To determine the stress concentration factor, a model of the component is made from a photoelastic material and loaded in a similar manner. For example, to find the stress concentration factor of a plate with a hole, a plastic plate model with a hole of the same size and at the same location can be built and loaded in tension. The isochromes formed around the hole will be observed to determine the point of maximum stress. The stress at this point divided by the nominal stress applied gives the stress concentration factor.  

Some key benefits of using photoelastic measurements are that they provide a full-field stress visualization and the experiments are simple to set up. Complex stress distributions can be mapped with high resolution. The measurements are also non-invasive since they rely on optical instruments. However, there are some drawbacks. The results can depend on the material properties and preparation of the model. Scale effects can be significant as it is difficult to manufacture large photoelastic models. The technique only provides stress information in two dimensions, lacking information on the third dimension. It also requires transparent materials which may not always represent the actual materials in use.

In summary, photoelasticity is a useful experimental method to visualize stress patterns and determine parameters like the stress concentration factor. When applied judiciously by considering the benefits and drawbacks, it can provide valuable insights into the behavior of stressed components.
