Meat-eating played a crucial role in the evolution of the human genus Homo and the emergence of modern humans (Homo sapiens). The incorporation of meat into the diet of our early human ancestors is believed to have provided greater caloric density and protein, which powered the physiological and cognitive changes that separated the Homo lineage from the other great apes. 

The increase in meat consumption by early Homo species roughly 2 million years ago coincides with a period of rapid encephalization and a larger body size in the fossil record.  Meat is a source of many nutrients necessary for brain growth and development in humans, especially the fatty acids DHA and ARA and B vitamins. The additional calories from meat also allowed Homo erectus and later human ancestors to grow larger bodies, extending growth periods for offspring and allowing larger birth canal and pelvis sizes in females. The higher calorie intake reduced selection pressure for energy efficiency and may have made long-distance walking and migration over vast ranges possible.

The expensive tissue hypothesis argues that the human digestive tract shortened to accommodate a diet higher in calorie-dense meat, freeing up energy for the brain to expand. While disputed, the expensive tissue hypothesis provides a compelling explanation for how a meat-rich diet could drive encephalization if the digestive tract sacrificed non-essential tissues. An alternative but not mutually exclusive hypothesis is that cooperative caregiving, especially by grandmothers ("grandmothering"), provided dependable supplementary nutrition to weaned offspring, permitting larger brain sizes and longer development. Grandmothering and food sharing have been observed in modern hunter-gatherer groups.

Meat-eating enabled more reliable access to concentrated sources of nutrition, which in turn permitted the geographic expansion of human ancestors out of Africa. H. erectus, the first obligate biped, emerged from Africa roughly 1.9 million years ago and dispersed throughout Eurasia. The ability to hunt large game and consume more meat supported the high energy demands of long-distance walking and fueled migration to new areas of the Old World. Improved hunting technology like stone tools also made meat acquisition more efficient, providing selective advantages to those groups with the cognitive and physical capacity to create and use these tools.

In summary, the role of meat in the human diet had profound implications for human evolution. Access to meat contributed to increases in body and brain size, improvements in technology, and geographic expansion out of Africa. While debate continues over the relative contribution of meat versus other factors like cooperative breeding, there is little doubt that increased meat consumption differentiated the Homo lineage from earlier hominins and ultimately made humans biologically and behaviorally modern. Overall, multiple hypotheses focusing on diet, energy allocation, caregiving, and technology provide a holistic perspective on how meat catalyzed human evolution.
