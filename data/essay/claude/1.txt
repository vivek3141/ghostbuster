Social class had a profound influence on how women experienced madness in Victorian England. For upper-class women, madness was often seen as a symptom of the constraints of respectable femininity. For working-class women, madness reflected the hardships of poverty and difficult labor. Overall, madness provided Victorian women of all classes an outlet to express distress and unhappiness in a society that offered them few other options.

For upper and middle-class women, madness was linked to the rigid ideals of femininity and domesticity that defined their lives. Victorian women were expected to be chaste, dutiful, and subservient to the men in their lives. They had few avenues for self-expression or independence outside marriage and motherhood. The pressures to conform to these ideals and the narrowness of women's roles drove some to madness. The language of madness provided a culturally acceptable way for women to express feelings of dissatisfaction, anxiety, or distress in the face of oppressive social expectations.

In contrast, for working-class women madness was more often attributed to the hardships of poverty, difficult physical labor, and lack of agency or control over their lives. Poor women frequently worked long hours in factories, as domestic servants, or doing odd jobs to scrape by. They had little recourse when subjected to violence or abuse. The harsh conditions of working women's lives and their lack of social or political power meant madness could seem a natural consequence of their circumstances. Their madness was viewed more as an unavoidable overflow of the miseries of everyday life rather than a sign of frailty or non-conformity as with middle-class women.

While psychiatry gained authority over madness and mental health issues over the Victorian era, women's experiences were framed through existing class and gender prejudices. Doctors often dismissed or minimized the role of social causes in working-class women's madness. They were more inclined to attribute upper-class women's symptoms to hereditary flaws or weaknesses in temperament. Women across classes had little say over how their madness was defined or treated. They were subject to the biases and interventions of the male doctors who dominated psychiatry and had the power to deprive them of liberty and override their will through forced institutionalization or restraint.  

In conclusion, Victorian women's experiences of madness were highly dependent on their social class. For middle-class women, the ideal of the dutiful wife and mother contributed to feelings of anxiety, distress and dissatisfaction that found expression in madness. For working-class women, madness was more readily attributed to the harsh conditions of poverty, abuse, and deprivation that characterized their lives. While Victorian psychiatry claimed authority over madness, it interpreted women's symptoms through the lens of class and gender biases that marginalized women's own experiences and perspectives on their mental health.
