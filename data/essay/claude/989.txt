The authors argue that large floodplain environments in Europe, specifically along major river valleys such as the Danube and Rhine, were critical to the spread and intensification of farming during the Neolithic period. They provide multiple lines of evidence to support this argument, though their approach is limited by the lack of detailed archaeological evidence across many regions of Central and Western Europe during this period.  

The authors first point to historical records and previous research indicating that floodplains and river valleys contained fertile alluvial soil, aquatic resources, fuel wood, and a regulated water supply - elements that would have drawn early farmers and supported the spread and growth of agriculture. The floodplains also would have provided connectivity between regions via water transport, encouraging the spread of both crops and farming knowledge. Archaeological evidence, such as the Linear Pottery culture sites located along the Danube, also demonstrates this pattern of early farming settlement along floodplains.

Pollen records provide further evidence for the authors' argument, indicating increased deforestation and crop cultivation along major Central European rivers during the Neolithic. For example, records from La Draga in Spain and Aldencote in England show how farming spread rapidly along river valleys, replacing woodlands with fields. Isotope analyses of skeletons also suggest that Neolithic populations in the Danube Gorges obtained much of their diet from river and floodplain resources. According to the authors, this demonstrates how integral the rivers and floodplains were to sustaining early farming groups in the region.

While the evidence presented in the article is compelling, the authors' approach is limited by the uneven geographic and chronological distribution of Neolithic archaeological sites across Europe - they do not discuss evidence from many regions in Western Europe, for example. The article would also have been strengthened by considering alternative factors that influenced the spread of farming, such as climate change. However, based on the evidence from Central Europe that is presented, the authors make a convincing case that fertile floodplains along major rivers were crucial to the spread and intensification of farming in Europe during the Neolithic period due to the abundance of resources and connectivity they provided. Their argument highlights the important relationship between environments and the farming societies they support.
