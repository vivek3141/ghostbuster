Arguments for Reinstating or Maintaining Capital Punishment

Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, involves the legal execution of an individual as punishment for a criminal offense. As of 2020, 55 countries have abolished capital punishment in law or practice, while 54 countries retain it. In the United States, 22 states have abolished the death penalty, while 28 states still retain it. There are several arguments commonly made in favor of reinstating capital punishment in abolitionist states or maintaining it in retentionist states.

One key argument is that capital punishment acts as a deterrent against heinous crimes like murder. The rationale is that the severity of the punishment serves as a deterrent for criminal behavior. Proponents argue that if the death penalty is imposed, it will deter others from committing murder due to fear of receiving the same punishment. Several studies have found evidence that capital punishment has a deterrent effect, though the validity of these studies is disputed. Still, for many retentionists, the possibility of deterrence, however small, justifies maintaining the death penalty. 

A second argument is that capital punishment provides just retribution for the most heinous crimes like aggravated murder. According to this argument, certain crimes are so morally reprehensible that they warrant an equally severe punishment like death. Retentionists argue that the only appropriate retribution for taking another life is having one's own life taken. This view of just deserts suggests that the punishment should fit the crime and that the most serious offenses warrant the most serious sanctionâ€”the death penalty.

A third argument is that capital punishment saves legal costs to taxpayers. Retentionists argue that housing and feeding convicted murderers for life is expensive. By imposing the death penalty, legal costs are avoided and funds can be allocated to other needs. However, some studies have found that death penalty cases can actually cost more than life imprisonment due to longer trials, complex appeals processes, and higher security death row facilities. Still, cost-saving remains a common argument made by proponents of capital punishment.

In conclusion, the main arguments commonly made in favor of reinstating or maintaining the death penalty are deterrence, just retribution, and cost-saving. However, there are also compelling arguments against capital punishment, including possibility of wrongful execution, lack of deterrent effect, and cruel/inhumane nature. There are good reasons on both sides of this issue, but ultimately, it involves complex moral and legal considerations with which reasonable people may disagree.
