What factors contributed to the increased frequency of famines in India from 1765 to 1900, and which can be considered the primary cause?

There were several factors that contributed to the increased frequency of famines in India between 1765 and 1900. These include climate changes and resulting crop failures, economic changes under British rule that disrupted traditional systems of grain storage and distribution, disproportionate tax burdens on peasants that reduced their ability to save grain and cope with shortages, lack of famine relief efforts by the British, and British India's increased exposure to global grain price fluctuations. While climate induced crop failures were the direct cause of reduced food supply during some famines, human economic choices and policy failures were the primary factors that turned crop failures into full-scale famines during this period.  

The increased frequency of famines coincided with the period of British control and economic reorganization in India starting in 1765. Prior to British rule, famines were infrequent and less severe. Local rulers and communities had systems in place to distribute grain surpluses across regions during shortage periods. The British dismantled many of these traditional systems through political centralization and free market policies. They also placed a heavy tax burden on peasants, often taking up to half of the crop, leaving little left over for peasants to save to cope with future shortages.  

Britain's profit-seeking policies also integrated India's economy into global commodity markets, exposing local grain prices to greater fluctuations. When global grain prices rose sharply, peasants had to sell more of their grain to pay the same tax rates, leaving less for saving or consumption. The opposite effect occurred when global prices declined sharply, reducing the price peasants received for their crop even as their taxes remained fixed. These interactions with global markets introduced new risks and price shocks that Indian cultivators had no experience with and little ability to mitigate.  

With greater centralization under British rule also came a weaker localized response to crop failures. The British government provided almost no famine relief during this period, adhering to laissez-faire economic principles and unwilling to spend funds on subsiding poor Indians. Local communities and rulers had previously undertaken relief efforts such as reducing or waiving taxes, distributing grain from surplus regions, and providing public works programs during times of shortage. But under British rule, these localized coping mechanisms were dismantled while nothing replaced them.

While the coincidence of several notable El Ni√±o-induced droughts from 1870 to 1900 directly caused reduced food supply in parts of South Asia, turning environmental challenges into humanitarian catastrophes required human failures and policy choices that left Indians particularly vulnerable to crop disruptions. Economic exposure to global markets, disproportionate tax burdens on peasants, dismantling of local systems to distribute surplus grain across regions, and lack of relief programs were the primary factors that allowed crop failures to develop into famines that claimed millions of lives during this period in India. In conclusion, while nature created conditions for famine, human choices ultimately determined their severity and deadliness.
