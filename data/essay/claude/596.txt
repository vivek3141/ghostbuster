Gabriel Garcia Marquez's famous novel One Hundred Years of Solitude utilizes the literary technique known as "magical realism" to weave magical and fantastical elements into an otherwise realistic narrative. These supernatural events serve several key functions within the novel.

First, the magical elements reflect the power of memory and storytelling within the Buendía family. Early in the novel, we are introduced to the idea that the Buendías share the magical ability to be "clairvoyant in their solitude" and see events from the past (Marquez, p. 30). This notion of perception across time through memory becomes embodied in the supernatural. Melquíades introduces the amazing "daguerreotype laboratory" which can capture memories in a physical form (Marquez, p. 38-39). Rebeca and Amaranta Úrsula both have encounters with ghosts from the family's memory, and Aureliano Segundo experiences a mysterious repetition of the past when he encounters the scene from his childhood at the circus. These instances show memory's power to transcend time and return to haunt or amaze us, in a magical way. 

The fantastical elements also reflect the cyclical and repetitive nature of history. The novel suggests that time is circular, not linear, and events are doomed to repeat themselves. We see this in the repetitions of names, personalities, and events across generations. The arrival of the railroad is announced multiple times but never materializes. Remedios the Beauty ascends to heaven, repeating a similar miracle from the family's history. These repetitive cycles are intensified and exaggerated through the use of magical realism, such as when Aureliano Babilonia encounters the ghostly figures who have been wandering the earth for centuries. The magical realism helps highlight how the family is trapped in these historical cycles.

Finally, the supernatural events in the novel reflect the isolation and solitude of Macondo.  Macondo is a place cut off from external reality, where the Buendía family's magical reality thrives without interference. However, as Macondo opens up to the outside world, the magical realism starts to fade. The last instance of magic occurs with Aureliano Babilonia's discovery of the parchments, as if the family's magic dies with the patriarch José Arcadio. The ending suggests that as Macondo is absorbed into the modern world, its solitude and magic are lost.

In conclusion, Garcia Marquez uses magical realism in One Hundred Years of Solitude to reflect the power of memory, represent the cyclical nature of history, and illustrate Macondo's solitude and isolation. The supernatural events shape our understanding of the Buendía family and their doomed town of Macondo, showing how their magical reality is tied to their solitude and inevitable progress of linear time.
