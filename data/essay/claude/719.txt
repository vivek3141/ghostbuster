Early embryogenesis in invertebrates such as In In requires precise coordination of intrinsic factors and intercellular signaling pathways to generate the complex multicellular organisms from a single cell. Intrinsic factors refer to factors within the cells themselves that drive development, such as maternal mRNAs and proteins deposited in the egg during oogenesis. These provide spatial cues for cell fate and division in the early embryo. 

For example, maternal mRNAs and proteins are asymmetrically distributed in the In In egg to establish the anterior-posterior axis. The posterior region of the egg is enriched for molecules like Snosecad protein that promote posterior cell fates. In contrast, the anterior region expresses factors such as Evenstriped that drive anterior development. Through the differential segregation of these intrinsic factors during early cell divisions, the anterior-posterior axis is established prior to zygotic transcription.

Intercellular signaling pathways are also crucial for coordinating development across cells. One important pathway is the Ourless signaling pathway. In In, the Ourless signal is produced in endomesodermal progenitor cells. It then binds to the Notto receptor in overlying ectodermal cells, activating a signaling cascade that results in the expression of Stripeless. Stripeless then represses anterior cell fates, allowing the ectoderm to adopt a posterior fate. Through this intercellular signaling, the endomesoderm induces posterior development in the ectoderm during gastrulation.

In conclusion, both intrinsic factors segregated within cells as well as intercellular signaling pathways are required to coordinate early development in In In. Maternal factors help establish the anterior-posterior axis, while signaling pathways like Ourless refine cell fate decisions across cell layers. These mechanisms work together to begin transforming the single-celled zygote into a complex, multicellular embryo.
