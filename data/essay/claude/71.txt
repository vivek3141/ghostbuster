Calvinism was the most successful brand of Protestantism in 16th century Europe due to several key factors. First, John Calvin and his followers were able to effectively spread Calvinist teachings through the publication and dissemination of writings, especially Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion. Second, Calvin and his followers showed tremendous missionary zeal in spreading the faith across Europe. Third, the decentralized and resilient structure of Calvinism allowed it to spread rapidly without relying on a single leader. Fourth, even after Calvin's death, Calvinism continued to spread due to its self-sustaining structure. 

To begin with, Calvin's writings, especially his Institutes of the Christian Religion, were instrumental in spreading Calvinist beliefs across Europe. The Institutes outlined Calvin's views on matters of Christian faith and life, including his doctrines of predestination and election. Over 200 editions of the Institutes were published in several languages during Calvin's lifetime, spreading his ideas far beyond Geneva where he lived. Calvin also founded a college and seminary to train missionaries to spread his teachings across Europe.

Moreover, Calvin and his followers showed remarkable missionary zeal. Calvin sent preachers and organizers to lead new churches throughout Europe, especially in France, the Netherlands, Scotland, England, Poland, and Hungary. These missionaries planted new Calvinist congregations, trained leaders, and moved on to continue spreading the faith. They were willing to face persecution and even martyrdom for the sake of spreading Calvinism. 

Furthermore, Calvinism had a decentralized structure that allowed it to spread widely even after Calvin's death in 1564. Unlike Lutheranism which was concentrated in German and Scandinavian territories and relied heavily on Martin Luther, Calvinism did not rely on a single leader or central institution. Each Calvinist congregation was self-governing, and working together in a Presbyterian structure. This resilient model allowed Calvinism to take root and spread throughout Europe even without Calvin's direct leadership.

Finally, Calvinism continued to spread rapidly even after Calvin's death, showing its ability to sustain itself. In France, Calvinism spread among nobility and grew in pockets of the countryside despite persecution. By the 1560s, there were over 2,000 Calvinist churches in France with over a million members. Calvinism had particular appeal among merchants and craftsmen in cities and towns, who saw Calvinism as a faith that emphasized moral discipline, hard work, and prosperity. 

In conclusion, through the spread of Calvin's writings, the missionary work of Calvin and his followers, its decentralized structure, and its endurance after Calvin's death, Calvinism became the most successful branch of Protestantism in 16th century Europe. Its rapid spread throughout France and beyond showed how it resonated with certain groups, like urban merchants, and had a message that transcended borders. Overall, Calvinism's adaptability and appeal allowed it to become the dominant Protestant faith of the time.
