Gothic romance fiction emerged in the 18th century as a reaction against the Enlightenment ideals of reason and logic. Gothic stories focused on the emotions, the fantastical, the supernatural, and the uncanny. Key themes in Gothic fiction include mystery, fear, darkness, death, isolation, madness, and the uncertainty of human identity. These themes are embodied in dark, atmospheric settings with ruined castles, abbeys and monasteries, secret passageways, and frightening symbols of the past.

A central element of Gothic fiction is the portrayal of female subjectivity and the representation of women’s anxieties. Women in Gothic stories are often represented as vulnerable, fearful, and under threat. This reflects the social anxieties of women in the 18th and 19th centuries, including fears of unwanted pregnancy, loss of identity, lack of freedom, and male dominance. The Gothic ‘damsel in distress’ is a common trope, reflecting fears of feminine powerlessness. However, female characters in Gothic fiction are not always passive victims—they are often resilient, resourceful, and act with agency to overcome threats.

Female subjectivity in Gothic fiction is expressed through the inner thoughts, emotions, and anxieties of women. Gothic romance stories were often told through female perspectives, allowing readers to identify with women’s experiences and inner lives. For example, Ann Radcliffe’s Gothic novels like The Mysteries of Udolpho are narrated through the viewpoint of Emily St. Aubert, whose emotions, reactions, and anxieties shape the story. Radcliffe gives women’s inner experiences a prominence that was rare in fiction at the time.

The anxieties represented in Gothic fiction include fears of confinement and restrictions on women’s freedom. Gothic settings like the castle are metaphors for the domestic confinement of women. The castle walls, locked doors, and secret rooms reflect the claustrophobic and oppressive experience of women enclosed in the home. Threats of imprisonment, entrapment, and restriction on movement are common in Gothic fiction, paralleling social constraints on women’s freedom.
