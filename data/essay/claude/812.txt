This proposed investigation aims to conduct an in-depth taxonomic study of nocturnal primates, specifically the lorises and galagos, in Southeast Asia and Africa. These nocturnal primates are understudied compared to their diurnal counterparts, the monkeys and apes. However, nocturnal primates play an important role in the ecosystem as predators of insects and dispersers of seeds. Their survival is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as poaching. 

Taxonomic research, including genetic analyses and morphological studies, is needed to better understand the diversity within the groups of lorises and galagos. There are currently around 20 species recognized but some subspecies are likely to be elevated to full species once studied in detail. For example, the Javan slow loris, found on the Indonesian island of Java, is currently classified as a subspecies of the Sunda slow loris but ongoing research suggests it is a distinct species. Improved understanding of diversity will help with conservation planning and targeting of resources.

Population assessments are also lacking for most nocturnal primates due to the challenges of studying these cryptic, fast-moving animals at night. The proposed research aims to conduct surveys across Southeast Asia and Africa to gain population estimates and identify areas of higher abundance as well as localities where species may be at risk of extinction. These data can inform updates to conservation status listings on the IUCN Red List and highlight priorities for habitat protection and connectivity. 

Finally, the proposed research seeks to gain insights into the behavior and ecology of nocturnal primates which remain poorly understood. Little is known about their reproductive biology, diet, ranging patterns and other aspects of their natural history. Radio-collaring and tracking some individuals may provide valuable information to guide conservation planning. The more we know about these nocturnal primates, the better equipped we will be to protect them and ensure their long term survival amid ongoing pressures.

In summary, this proposed taxonomic and ecological investigation into nocturnal primates will significantly contribute to conservation efforts by improving our knowledge about diversity, distribution, abundance, behavior and natural history of these cryptic and understudied animals. The research can positively impact conservation policy and action plans to safeguard these nocturnal primates in Southeast Asia and Africa.
