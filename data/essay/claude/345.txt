The period from 1700 to 1850 in Britain marked a time of massive institutional changes that reshaped agriculture in fundamental ways. Some of the most significant changes included enclosure of common land, shifting markets and networks of exchange, changes in land tenure arrangements, and the adoption of new agricultural technologies. 

One of the most consequential changes was the enclosure movement, in which common lands that had previously been shared by communities were privatized and fenced off. Although enclosure had begun in the late Middle Ages, it accelerated rapidly in the 18th century.  Between 1760 and 1820, some 6 million acres in England - about one quarter of the land - were enclosed. Enclosure allowed landowners to shift from an open field system of agriculture to more intensive and productive farming operations. They could experiment with crop rotations and breed new livestock breeds without worrying about their neighbors' activities on common land.

Another major change was the expansion and formalization of markets for agricultural goods, labor, and land. As cities and trade networks grew, farmers gained new opportunities to commercialize their operations and increase production of cash crops to sell for profit. Many areas that had previously focused on subsistence farming transitioned to produce grains, wool, and livestock to sell to merchants and traders. These market changes gave farmers incentives to increase productivity through enclosure, drainage of wetlands, and other improvements. 

Changes in land tenure also spurred agricultural changes. As copyhold tenures declined, more farmers became leaseholders and renters rather than subsistence smallholders. Leaseholding farmers had incentives to maximize productivity to pay rent. At the same time, as more land became owned by wealthy gentry and nobles rather than small yeoman farmers, landowners pushed their tenants to adopt new practices to increase the value of their lands.

Finally, the spread of new agricultural technologies - including new crop rotations, selective livestock breeding, drainage techniques, and mechanical inventions - allowed farmers to greatly improve productivity. Jethro Tull's seed drill, introduced in 1701, allowed farmers to sow seeds more efficiently and productively. Charles Townshend  popularized new crop rotations in the 1730s, showing how nitrogen-fixing crops could restore fertility to the soil. And Robert Bakewell developed new stockbreeding techniques that produced sheep and cattle that gained weight more quickly.

In conclusion, the institutional changes in British agriculture between 1700 and 1850 - including enclosure, market changes, shifts in land tenure, and new technologies - led to massive increases in productivity, output, and prosperity. By 1850, British agriculture was commercialized, specialized, and more scientifically advanced than ever before, setting the stage for Britain to become the world's foremost industrial and economic superpower during the 19th century.
