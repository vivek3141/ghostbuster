There are several factors that have led to the argument that class analysis is no longer relevant for historical analysis. First, the rise of postmodernism and theories of fragmentation and diversity have challenged the Marxist notion that history can be explained primarily based on economic structures and class conflicts. Postmodernists argue that there are many intersecting identities and social dynamics beyond just class that shape people's experiences and social outcomes. Marxist theories are seen as overly simplistic. 

Second, the emergence of new social movements around issues like gender, sexuality, race and the environment have led some historians to argue that class is not the primary driver of historical change. These new social movements are seen as equally or more significant in propelling social transformations. The primacy of class conflict has been called into question.

Third, the collapse of the Soviet Union and end of the Cold War undermined the perceived inevitability of class struggle leading to a socialist revolution. The Soviet experiment showed the potential totalitarian dangers of an avowedly Marxist regime. This led many historians and social theorists to distance themselves from Marxist theories and class analysis.

Fourth, the rise of consumer culture and growth of the middle class in Western societies has been seen by some as diminishing the relevance of class. Large segments of populations have gained access to consumer goods and lifestyles that were once limited to the upper classes. This "embourgeoisement" of society appears to contradict Marxist notions of polarization and heightening class conflict under capitalism.

However, there are also arguments frequently made in favor of the ongoing relevance of class analysis. First, economic inequality has been rising in many Western societies, indicating that class dynamics are still highly significant. While the nature of class may be changing, class conflict and struggle persist. 

Second, Marxist theories provide a macro-level analysis of historical change that still offers insight. While postmodern theories emphasize diversity and fragmentation, Marxist class analysis provides a big picture framework for understanding how economic and social structures shape human affairs over the long run. The two approaches can be combined.

Third, class identities and struggles continue to be hugely influential in many non-Western societies as well as in movements against global capitalism. A theory of history based primarily on Western intellectual trends may overlook dynamics that remain highly relevant in much of the world.

In conclusion, while postmodernism and the emergence of new social movements have led some to proclaim the "death of class", class analysis still remains vitally relevant as an approach to historical analysis, especially when combined with other theoretical frameworks. Class dynamics continue to shape economic and social realities throughout much of the world. Marxist theories provide a macro-level analysis of historical change that other approaches often lack. The factors that have challenged class analysis have not fully undermined its explanatory power or relevance as a tool for historical understanding. Both postmodern and Marxist theories have value, and they can be combined for a nuanced analysis of history that recognizes both diversity and underlying structural dynamics.
