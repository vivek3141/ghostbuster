Japanese imperialism played a crucial role in the development of economic interdependence and regional cooperation in Asia Pacific. In the early 20th century, Japan pursued an aggressive policy of imperial expansion, conquering Taiwan, Korea, and parts of China. This created a Greater East Asian economic sphere that was dominated by Japan. The Japanese empire extracted raw materials and agricultural goods from its colonies and exported manufactured goods in return. This created economic linkages and flows of goods, capital, and labor between Japan and its colonies. 

After World War II, Japan’s imperial system collapsed. However, the infrastructural, economic and trade linkages that were built during this time persisted and shaped the post-war economic order in East Asia. Japan’s former colonies went on to achieve rapid economic growth and industrialization. They became major trading partners with Japan, exporting raw materials and components and importing Japanese technology, machinery and consumer goods. This interdependent trade system was the foundation for Japan’s post-war economic miracle as well as the growth of the “East Asian Tigers” like South Korea and Taiwan.

This system of regional interdependence based on trade and manufacturing supply chains has endured to the present day. China and Southeast Asian countries have also joined these regional production networks and trade flows. This dense web of economic interconnection is the basis for various proposals for deeper regional cooperation and integration in East Asia, such as ASEAN+3 and the East Asia Summit.

However, there are also new challenges that complicate regionalism. There are geopolitical tensions between Japan and China, as well as competing territorial claims by Southeast Asian countries in the South China Sea. There is also a backlash against globalization and economic interdependence, as evidenced by the US-China trade war. ASEAN countries are concerned about becoming too economically dependent on China. These centrifugal forces threaten to undermine regional cooperation.

In conclusion, Japan’s imperial expansion and the Greater East Asian economic sphere it created planted the seeds for regional interdependence in East Asia. Although the imperial system ended after WWII, the trade flows and economic linkages endured and shaped the remarkable postwar growth of East Asian economies. However, new geopolitical tensions and a desire for greater economic independence pose challenges to deepening regional cooperation. The future of regionalism in East Asia will depend on whether countries can overcome these divisive forces and build on their long historical ties of economic interconnection.
