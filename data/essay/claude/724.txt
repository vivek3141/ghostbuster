George Eliot explores the theme of outsiders and outsider characters in many ways in her novel Adam Bede. One of the most prominent outsider characters is Dinah Morris, a Methodist preacher whose religious beliefs and vocation set her apart from the mainstream society of Hayslope village. Dinah is portrayed as a positive figure who brings spiritual comfort to others, yet her role as a female preacher is seen as strange and unconventional by many in the village. Eliot uses Dinah's character to critique the rigid social roles and expectations for women in 19th century England. 

Other outsider characters in the novel include Hetty Sorrel and Captain Donnithorne. Hetty is a poor orphan taken in by her aunt and uncle, the Poysers, who do not fully accept her. Hetty struggles to find her place and purpose in life, and is portrayed as vain and selfish in her pursuit of Captain Donnithorne, the charming yet irresponsible landowner's son. Both Hetty and Captain Donnithorne make choices that go against social norms and end up facing negative consequences, showing Eliot's view that rebellion against social conventions often ends badly.

A major literary method Eliot uses to explore outsider themes is her use of pastoral tropes - setting much of the novel in the countryside village of Hayslope and describing rural, agrarian life. By placing outsider characters in this conventional pastoral setting, Eliot highlights how they disturb the established order. The pastoral village acts as a metaphor for close-knit, tradition-bound society. When outsiders like Dinah and Hetty act in unconventional ways, it threatens the harmony and stability of village life.

Eliot also uses many allusions and references to outsider figures from religion, mythology and literature. For example, Dinah is likened to St. Theresa, an influential mystic who was seen as an outsider in her time. References to Greek mythology, the Bible, and other literary works create layers of meaning regarding outsider characters and themes.

In conclusion, George Eliot deftly deploys literary techniques such as pastoralism, allusion, and complex outsider characters like Dinah Morris to explore issues of individuality, non-conformity and rebellion against social norms in Adam Bede. The novel suggests that while outsiders may disturb the established order, they also bring positive change and spiritual nourishment to society. Overall, Eliot uses her portrait of rural English life in the early 19th century to highlight the tensions between tradition and progress in a thought-provoking and timeless way.
