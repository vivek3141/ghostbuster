The viscosity of a fluid refers to its resistance to flow. Some fluids have a viscosity that remains constant as the flow rate or shear stress changes. These are known as Newtonian fluids. Other fluids, known as non-Newtonian fluids, have a viscosity that changes with the flow rate. Three common fluids—evaporated milk, tomato soup, and custard—demonstrate different viscosity properties.  

Evaporated milk is a Newtonian fluid. Its viscosity remains largely unchanged as the flow rate increases or decreases. At low flow rates or shear stresses, the evaporated milk flows smoothly. As the flow rate increases, the viscosity remains the same. The milk continues to flow smoothly at a rate proportional to the applied shear stress. When the flow rate decreases again, the viscosity does not change. The evaporated milk maintains consistent viscosity across different flow regimes.

Tomato soup exhibits shear-thinning behavior, meaning its viscosity decreases as the flow rate increases. At low flow rates, the tomato soup has a thick, viscous consistency that resists flowing. As the flow rate rises and shear stress increases, the soup flows more easily, its viscosity dropping. The key compounds in the soup that give it this shear-thinning property are polysaccharides and other hydrocolloids that can change shape or unravel in response to forces. When the flow rate decreases again, these compounds re-form and the viscosity returns to its initial higher value. Due to this changing viscosity with change in shear stress, tomato soup is a non-Newtonian, shear-thinning fluid.

Custard displays shear-thickening behavior, meaning its viscosity increases with increasing flow rate. At low flow rates, custard has a viscosity similar to that of evaporated milk and flows readily. However, as the flow rate rises and shear forces increase, the custard’s viscosity climbs dramatically. Its consistency becomes quite viscous, resisting flow. The shear forces applied cause the hydrocolloids and proteins in the custard, like starch and egg proteins, to entangle and insoluble aggregates to form, increasing viscosity. When the flow rate abates, the structures in the custard gradually disentangle and disperse, returning viscosity to its initial lower level. Custard is thus a non-Newtonian, shear-thickening fluid due to this dependence of viscosity on shear rate.

In summary, the three fluids—evaporated milk, tomato soup, and custard—have quite different viscosities that vary with the speed of flow. Evaporated milk maintains a largely constant viscosity and is Newtonian. Tomato soup has decreasing viscosity with increasing speed, demonstrating shear-thinning behavior. Custard shows increasing viscosity with increasing speed, exhibiting shear-thickening behavior. The viscosity changes in the non-Newtonian tomato soup and custard are due to rearrangements of and interactions between compounds like proteins, polysaccharides, and hydrocolloids in response to applied shear stresses. The ability to understand how viscosity varies with shear rate for different fluids is useful across many fields, including engineering, biology, and food science.
