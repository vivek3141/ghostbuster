-Lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, inhibit bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by targeting penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that are responsible for cross-linking peptidoglycan subunits during cell wall assembly. Specifically, -lactams are structural analogs of the terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine residues of peptidoglycan precursor molecules. They bind covalently to the active sites of PBPs, which are transpeptidases and carboxypeptidases that cleave the D-alanyl-D-alanine bonds of peptidoglycan subunits and cross-link the subunits. By binding to PBPs, -lactams block the cross-linking of peptidoglycan, inhibiting cell wall synthesis and ultimately leading to cell lysis and death.

Bacteria have evolved -lactamase enzymes as a resistance mechanism against -lactams. -Lactamases hydrolyze the -lactam ring of -lactam antibiotics, inactivating them before they can reach their targets. To overcome -lactamase resistance, -lactam antibiotics have been modified by adding -lactamase inhibitor groups that protect the -lactam ring. Another strategy is to synthesize -lactams that mimic the peptidoglycan precursor molecules but substitute the D-alanyl-D-alanine with groups that -lactamases cannot hydrolyze, such as methylenes. These modified -lactams can avoid -lactamase hydrolysis but still bind to and inhibit PBPs.

Mimetic peptides that mimic the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of peptidoglycan precursors have shown little inhibition of DD-peptidases, which are PBPs that specifically cleave the D-alanyl-D-alanine bonds. There are a few possible explanations for their low activity. First, the mimetic peptides may have conformations that differ from the natural peptidoglycan precursors, preventing effective binding to the active sites of DD-peptidases. Second, the interactions between the mimetic peptides and DD-peptidases may be weaker than the natural substrates, leading to lower affinity and inhibition. Third, the mimetic peptides could be acting as weak competitive inhibitors but at much lower concentrations than the natural peptidoglycan precursors in the cell, allowing the precursors to outcompete the mimetic peptides for binding to DD-peptidases. Further study into the structural and biochemical properties of mimetic peptides and their interactions with DD-peptidases would help determine why they have shown limited inhibition of these enzymes.

In summary, -lactams inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and blocking PBPs, specifically the DD-peptidases and transpeptidases involved in peptidoglycan cross-linking. Resistance to -lactams conferred by -lactamase enzymes can be overcome by modifying -lactams to avoid hydrolysis or adding -lactamase inhibitors. Mimetic peptides have shown little ability to inhibit DD-peptidases, possibly due to differences in conformation or binding interactions compared to natural peptidoglycan precursors or lower effective concentrations in the cell. Elucidating the reasons behind the low activity of mimetic peptides against DD-peptidases could aid in the development of more potent peptide-based antibiotics.
