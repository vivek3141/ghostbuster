The choice of data structure for any application involves weighing several factors to determine the optimal approach. For an online plant catalogue, the designer must consider properties such as lookup speed, insertion and deletion efficiency, storage space, and more. When comparing a hash table and an AVL tree for this use case, there are arguments for and against each option.

A hash table offers outstanding lookup performance, with O(1) time complexity for lookups in the average and best cases. This means searches for plant names or other catalogue attributes can be performed extremely quickly. The hash table's speed comes from its use of a hash function to map keys directly to memory locations. However, hash tables require wasted storage space for empty "slots" and are limited to one-dimensional keys. They also have O(n) worst case lookup, though this can be mitigated with secondary hash functions.  

In contrast, AVL trees offer O(log n) lookup time on average, though worst case is O(n). They require no wasted space and can store multi-dimensional data. AVL trees are self-balancing, so insertion and deletion also have O(log n) time complexity. However, their lookup performance is not as fast as a hash table's, a factor that heavily influences the catalogue use case. AVL trees also require more complex algorithms and mechanics to function.

For the online plant catalogue, lookup speed was likely a top priority in the data structure choice. Hash tables offer unparalleled speed for lookups, even if storage space and multidimensional keys are sacrificed. A catalogue's purpose is for users to search for and find plant information as quickly as possible. The O(1) hash table lookup, paired with secondary hash functions to handle collisions, would enable lightning fast searches that immediately return results on even the largest catalogues.  

Though AVL trees have advantages for storage, insertion, and deletion, their slower O(log n) lookups make them a poor choice for an application where fast searches are the highest priority. The added programming and algorithmic complexity of AVL trees also increases opportunities for errors.  For a large-scale, commercial application, the superior simplicity and speed of hash tables trumps the benefits of AVL trees for this specific use case. 

In summary, while both hash tables and AVL trees have strengths and weaknesses, the specific priorities and functional requirements of the online plant catalogue led to the selection of a hash table. When performance and a simple implementation are most important, hash tables cannot be beat. Their rapid O(1) lookups enable the fast and scalable searches needed for a high-volume commercial application. By weighing the most significant factors for the catalogueâ€™s design, the choice of a hash table over an AVL tree is justified.
