The early twentieth-century Argentine poet Alfonsina Storni frequently explored feminist themes in her poetry, using vivid language and imagery to challenge the strict gender roles and societal expectations for women during that time period. Storni's poetry gave a voice to women's experiences and expressed a desire for greater freedom and independence.

One of Storni's most well-known poems, "You Want Me White," directly confronts the expectation that women should be meek, chaste, and obedient. The poem's title itself is ironic and defiant. The speaker refuses to be the idealized "white" - that is, pure and submissive - woman that society demands. She says, "You want me woman, / holy and meek... / You want me pretty, / an unworn jewel...You want me white / as a lily in the light." However, the speaker rejects these expectations, declaring: "But I'm not white! / I'm mulatto, I'm indigenous, / cholera, mongrel, pampa fold...I'm everything you reject." Through this bold declaration, the speaker claims her identity as a strong, non-conforming woman who does not need male validation or fit into narrow ideals of femininity.  

Similarly, in the poem "Rebel Girl," Storni adopts a defiant stance against traditional gender roles. The speaker portrays herself as a rebellious girl who refuses to be "obedient" or "demure." Instead, she states: "I'll not obey...I'll always go / against the current." The metaphor of going against the current represents the speaker's nonconformity and resistance to societal norms. She continues to declare her independence, saying "Nor docile nor sweet /will you find me. My soul forever / will be turbulent." Here, the speaker frames her rebellious spirit as her "soul" - her essential self. The repetition of "nor" and parallel structure emphasizes her rejection of the feminine qualities of docility and sweetness. Overall, the poem is a bold assertion of the speaker's freedom and nonconformity as a woman.

Storni's poems also explore female desire, passion, and sexuality in a way that challenged patriarchal notions of women as chaste and demure. For example, in "You Gave Me Passion," the female speaker unabashedly addresses her lover, saying: "You gave me ardent passion / to burn my calmness and my reason." The passion feels like a fire that burns away her propriety and self-control. She continues, "Now I know thirst for kisses, / for caresses, for wildness." The repetition of "for" emphasizes her longing and desire for sensual pleasure and erotic intimacy, which women were not socially permitted to express at the time. The speaker does not feel shame for these desires but rather celebrates them. Through this, Storni gives women a voice to claim their sexuality in a healthy and self-sufficient way.

In conclusion, Alfonsina Storni's early feminist poetry rebelled against the strict gender roles for women in early 20th-century Argentina. Through defiant and ironic language, vivid metaphors, and open expressions of women's desire, Storni established a female identity independent of male validation or societal expectations of femininity. Her poems have resonated with generations of women and established her as an important feminist voice in Latin American poetry. Overall, Storni used her craft to empower women and create space for their experiences during a time when such space was severely limited.
