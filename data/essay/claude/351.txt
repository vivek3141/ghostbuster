The British employment relations environment has different perspectives on the role of conflict in the workplace ranging from pluralist, unitarist, and radical views. The pluralist school views conflict as inherent and inevitable in the employment environment and focuses on how it can be constructively managed through bargaining between different groups. The unitary perspective positions conflict as a disturbance in shared interests and values and that it should be suppressed in favor of harmonious relationships. Finally, radical scholars see conflict as an inevitable result of the inherent structures of inequality and exploitation in the capitalist system. 

The pluralist view sees conflict as a natural outcome of the divergence of interests between employers and employees. Given this inherent tension, the pluralist school focuses on developing mechanisms  for balancing these interests through collective bargaining and negotiation, with the overall goal of achieving a fair and equitable compromise. Pluralists believe conflict can be managed institutionally through the establishment of rules and procedures, and groups representing workers and employers can bargain over wages and conditions. This perspective has strongly influenced the system of collective labor relations and institutions that developed in post-World War II Britain.

In contrast, the unitary perspective sees the employment relationship as one of shared interests and values between employers and employees. From this view, conflict is seen as a temporary disruption of this harmonious relationship and something that needs to be minimised or eliminated. The unitarist view aims for cooperation, shared goals, and common interests. Unitarists see conflict as resulting from poor communication or a lack of employee understanding, and it can be overcome through improved consultation, communication, and managerial leadership. This view aligned with a more traditional model of British industrial relations where managerial authority was largely unfettered by collective labor institutions.

Finally, radical scholars argue that conflict is an inevitable outcome of the unequal power dynamics inherent in the capitalist system. They see society divided into two groups - the bourgeoisie or capitalist class who own the means of production, and the proletariat or working class who sell their labor. From this view, the employment relationship is one of inherent exploitation and domination, with the interests of the two groups fundamentally opposed. Most versions of radical theory argue that this conflict can only be resolved through wholesale transformation of the capitalist system itself. While radical perspectives are more marginal, they highlight some of the deeper power dynamics at play in the British industrial relations system.

In conclusion, theories of pluralism, unitarism, and radicalism provide distinct perspectives on the role of conflict in the employment relationship in Britain. While pluralism has been very influential, changes in the workforce and economy have also seen some re-emergence of unitary and radical perspectives. Overall, conflict remains an inescapable feature of employment relations in Britain, with debates centered around not whether it exists, but rather its causes and implications.
