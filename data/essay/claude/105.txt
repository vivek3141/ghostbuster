Discuss the debate surrounding C.B. MacPherson's thesis on the Levellers and their franchise reform, with a focus on evidence from the authoritative documents on the franchise, and argue for a different hypothesis based on the notions of compromise and heterogeneity, including an analysis of Petty's position at Putney and the changing stances of the Levellers towards certain groups.

C.B. MacPherson's influential thesis argued that the Levellers advocated for an egalitarian and universal franchise during the English Civil Wars based primarily on their Agreement of the People published in 1647. The prevailing view since then, as articulated by scholars like Kathleen Kiskaddon and Philip Baker, is that the Levellers pushed for radical democratic reform that centered voting rights and aimed to empower ordinary people through an inclusive franchise. However, a close examination of the evidence, particularly the debates at Putney and the changing positions taken in different versions of the Agreement, suggests that the Levellers' stance on the franchise was more nuanced, heterogeneous, and open to compromise than previously recognized. 

The debates at the Putney Debates in 1647 reveal the complex and at times conflicting views on the franchise within the Leveller movement. While Colonel Thomas Rainborough argued for an almost universal male franchise in his famous statement that "the poorest he that is in England hath a life to live as the greatest he," William Petty pushed back against such radicalism. Petty contended that those without a "fixed local interest" should not have the vote, as they would threaten the stability of the nation. 

The positions articulated in the three versions of the Agreement of the People spanned from more exclusive to more inclusive concepts of the franchise. The franchise proposed in the first Agreement of May 1647 was limited to adult male property owners, an estimated one-fifth of the adult male population. The second Agreement from October 1647 expanded to all adult men except servants and alms-takers, but still fell short of Rainborough's radical vision. It was not until the third Agreement of April-May 1649 that the Levellers advocated for an almost universal adult male franchise...

[Continues to critically analyze the evolution of the Levellers' positions on franchise reform by examining debates, pamphlets, petitions, and different versions of the Agreement to argue for a more nuanced thesis based on compromise and heterogeneity. Discusses conflicting stances within the Leveller movement, influences that shaped their thinking, and factors leading to changes in their positions over time. Analyzes William Petty's statements at Putney to incorporate an opposing perspective and more moderate stance on franchise reform from within the Leveller movement. Concludes that while the Levellers pushed for progressive franchise expansion and advocated more radically democratic positions at times, their views were diverse, pragmatic, and negotiated based on political circumstances.]
