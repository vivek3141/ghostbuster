In Pierre Choderlos de Laclos's epistolary novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses, letter writing acts as a metaphor for the corrupt and manipulative relationships between characters. The novel is constructed entirely through letters between characters, demonstrating the art and hidden strategies of correspondence in 18th century France. However, the letters also reveal the ironic disparities between the characters' stated intentions and the underlying motivations behind their words. 

The Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont, the two main correspondents, use letter writing as a tool to exert power over others and fulfill their selfish desires. In Letter 4, Valmont asks Merteuil to help him seduce a young girl, Cécile de Volanges, as a challenge to stave off his boredom and desire for conquest. However, Merteuil recognizes his intentions are not purely for amusement but rather to spite Cécile's lover, Danceny. Valmont claims Cécile is "not worth the trouble of a refusal" yet his persistent scheming to seduce her reveals his deeper motivations to manipulate others for his entertainment. The irony emerges in the gap between Valmont's claims of nonchalance and his actual obsessive behavior.

Merteuil also utilizes letters to manipulate others while maintaining a facade of innocence and virtuous intent. In Letter 81, Merteuil offers condolences to Cécile's mother, Madame de Volanges, over Valmont's seduction of Cécile. Merteuil claims "it was impossible for you or anyone else to have foreseen such an unimaginable turn of events" when in reality, she orchestrated the entire affair with Valmont. The dramatic irony stems from the reader's knowledge of Merteuil's deception through her letters to Valmont, letters which remain hidden from Madame de Volanges. Merteuil's false show of empathy highlights her skill in duplicity and manipulation.

The letters thus reveal the performative nature of the characters' actions and words. Valmont and Merteuil construct elaborate deceptions and artifices to appear one way while behaving in entirely contradictory manners. The irony emerges from the gap between the character's words and their motivations, with some of their deepest drives and schemes remaining concealed or only hinted at within the letters. Overall, the epistolary form allows for a multifaceted exploration of the characters' complex and often corrupt relationships, with irony acting as an revelatory device to strip away the layers of artifice and performance within their correspondences.
