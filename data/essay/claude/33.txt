The story board model of jury decision making suggests that jurors make decisions by organizing relevant evidence and arguments into narratives or “stories” that make intuitive sense. According to this model, jurors rely less on logical, evidence-based reasoning and more on constructing plausible stories that align with their preexisting beliefs and intuitions. The story model of jury decision making provides a framework for understanding why juries sometimes reach verdicts that seem to contradict the facts or evidence presented in a trial.

Proponents of the story board model argue that jurors approach deliberations with the goal of constructing a narrative that explains what happened, not solely evaluating evidence in an objective manner. Jurors draw on their own experiences and beliefs to interpret evidence in a way that creates a compelling story. Information that fits within a juror's narrative is given more weight, while information that contradicts the story is ignored or discounted. The story that is most coherent and aligns closest with a juror's intuitions is the one most likely to shape the final verdict. 

The story model helps explain why juries can be highly unpredictable and reach verdicts not strictly supported by evidence. Jurors may favor emotionally appealing stories over those supported by facts. Information that evokes an emotional reaction tends to be given extra weight in the deliberation process. The narrative that emerges is not necessarily the most factually accurate one, but the one that resonates most powerfully on an intuitive level. The story model also suggests that the earliest story to take shape during deliberations - what some legal scholars call the "anchoring narrative" - strongly influences the final verdict. It is difficult for jurors to abandon an established narrative, even when faced with contradicting evidence.

The story board model stands in contrast to the "evidence-based" model of jury decision making. The evidence-based model posits that jurors objectively evaluate the facts and evidence presented at trial and reach a verdict rationally and logically based on the preponderance of evidence. According to this view, juries follow the jury instructions provided by the judge and consider each piece of evidence carefully and objectively. They question witnesses, ask for clarification on evidence and testimony, and discuss the facts thoroughly from multiple angles. After rigorous debate, the jury reaches the verdict most consistent with the facts. 

In reality, jury deliberations likely involve elements of both storytelling and evidence-based reasoning. The narrative that develops depends heavily on the evidence presented, but is also influenced by jurors' interpretations, beliefs, and intuitions. Anchoring narratives may shift as new evidence comes to light. Emotion and logic both play a role. The story model provides insight into the psychological dynamics at work in complex jury deliberations. Recognizing these dynamics can help legal teams construct cases and arguments in a way that resonates on both logical and intuitive levels. The story board model highlights the need to not only consider the facts, but also understand how people construct meaning from those facts.
