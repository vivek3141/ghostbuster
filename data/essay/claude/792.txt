Reflective practice is a decision-making approach increasingly used in healthcare that involves systematically reflecting on and learning from experiences to inform future practice. This essay discusses how reflective practice can be used as a decision-making process in healthcare and outlines theoretical frameworks that exist for making decisions, including evidence-based practice and person-centered care. An example of a care intervention using reflective practice is presented and analyzed to demonstrate the impact of structured reflection.

Reflective practice involves consciously revisiting experiences to examine how they were handled and to determine how practice could be improved in the future. It provides opportunities for healthcare professionals to thoughtfully consider the effectiveness and impact of their actions on those in their care. Several theoretical frameworks can guide reflective practice and decision making in healthcare. Evidence-based practice is centered on integrating the best available research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values in care decisions. Person-centered care prioritizes understanding individuals' unique needs, values, and preferences to provide care aligned with what matters most to them.

These approaches can be combined with reflective practice, in which experiences and interactions with patients are revisited systematically to determine whether care was evidence-based, patient-centered, and achieved the desired outcomes. Reflection also allows for recognition of cognitive biases or oversights that could influence care negatively.  Structured reflection, in which specific prompts are used to guide the reflection process, can enhance the benefits of reflective practice. An example of using reflective practice to improve care is a nurse case managing a patient with several chronic illnesses. Initially, the nurse developed a care plan focused heavily on optimizing the patient's various medical treatments without fully considering the patient's personal priorities and values. However, in revisiting the experience reflectively using structured prompts, the nurse realized their oversight and resolved to redesign the care plan to align interventions with what mattered most to the patient. The nurse was then able to implement a revised plan that addressed both the patient's disease states and quality-of-life needs through a collaborative partnership, achieving an optimal outcome. Overall, reflective practice enables
