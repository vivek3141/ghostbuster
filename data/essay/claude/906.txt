What Lessons Have You Learned from Your Experience Working in a Restaurant and How Do You Plan on Applying Them in Your Future Hospitality Career?

Over the last few years working as a server and bartender in a busy neighborhood restaurant, I have learned numerous valuable lessons that I plan to apply in my future career in the hospitality industry. First, I learned the importance of listening to guests and anticipating their needs. To be an effective server or hospitality worker, you need to pay close attention to the guests, listen to what they are saying directly and pick up on subtle cues, and then work to anticipate what they might need next to ensure a great experience. If they mention they are in a rush, you know to get them their check promptly. If you hear them request more water, you should bring an entire pitcher to the table to save yourself another trip. Close listening and anticipating needs is key.

Second, I learned the importance of teamwork in a restaurant. There are so many tasks that need to get done from setting up before opening to cleaning up after closing, not to mention all the work during peak service periods. Effective teamwork where everyone pitches in to help each other ensures that guests receive prompt, attentive service and that the entire staff can maintain a positive attitude during busy shifts. Teamwork also means communicating well—sharing information about table statuses, timing of food, unavailable menu items, and more. Strong communication and team cohesion help the shift run smoothly for both guests and staff. 

Finally, I learned that in hospitality, attitude and work ethic are everything. Coming to each shift with a positive attitude, ready to work hard to provide great service makes all the difference. No table or guest should be able to tell if you’re tired or would rather be elsewhere. A positive, caring attitude and strong work ethic help ensure each guest leaves with a positive impression, even on your most difficult days.

In my future hospitality career, I plan to build on these foundational lessons. I will make a point to actively listen to guests, anticipate needs and learn to read subtle cues to provide amazing customized experiences. I will go into each new job looking to build a cohesive, team-focused work environment based on clear communication and a willingness to collaborate and help each other. And I will maintain a positive, guest-focused attitude and strong work ethic each and every day to provide consistent high quality service. The lessons I’ve learned by serving hundreds of restaurant guests will no doubt shape my skills and outlook as I move into new roles in the hospitality industry. With close attention to these fundamental principles, I aim to become a hospitality professional capable of creating truly memorable experiences for each and every guest.
