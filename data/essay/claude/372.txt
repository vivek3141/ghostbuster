The European Employment Strategy (EES) refers to the coordinated employment policies and recommendations adopted by European Union member states to promote employment, job creation, and improved quality of work throughout the EU. The EES was first introduced in 1997 as part of the European Employment Strategy by the European Commission. It aims to provide overarching employment policy guidance and recommendations for EU member states based on the employment policy objectives and targets agreed upon at the EU level.   

The EES has evolved substantially over time in response to the changing economic and social context in Europe. When first launched, the EES primarily focused on promoting job growth through macroeconomic policies and improving labor market functioning. In the 2000s, the EES broadened its scope to address issues such as labor force participation, skills development, job quality, and social inclusion. The EES also adopted a stronger focus on flexicurity - combining labor market flexibility with employment security. In 2010, the Europe 2020 strategy further reinforced the EES by setting the targets of achieving a 75% employment rate for 20-64 year-olds and lifting at least 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion in the EU by 2020.

A key objective of the EES is to promote equal opportunities and address the challenges faced by vulnerable groups in the labor market, including women, elderly workers, and youth. For women workers, the EES aims to improve work-life balance, close the gender pay gap, and boost female labor force participation through policies such as affordable childcare and flexible working time arrangements. For elderly workers, the EES recommends measures to promote active aging, lifelong learning, and longer working lives through pension reforms, age-friendly work environments, and skills training programs for older workers. For youth, the EES proposes actions to ease school-to-work transitions such as apprenticeships, traineeships, job counseling, and youth guarantee schemes to ensure that all young people under 25 receive a good-quality job offer, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of leaving school.

Based on an analysis of the EES priorities and recommendations as well as evaluations of the implementation and impact of EES measures, youth are likely to benefit the most from the EES policies. This is because youth unemployment has been consistently highlighted as a key challenge, leading to a stronger focus of EES recommendations and resources on improving youth employment outcomes. The EES youth-targeted recommendations, especially the youth guarantee schemes, have also been the most developed and specifically aimed at directly tackling the barriers faced by young jobseekers in entering the labor market. In contrast, the EES measures for women and elderly groups remain more general and uneven across countries. The impacts of existing measures on gender equality and longer working lives are also more long-term and difficult to assess. Therefore, compared to women and elderly workers, youth are likely to experience the most significant and immediate impacts from the EES policy priorities and recommendations.

In conclusion, the EES aims to promote a high level of employment, job quality, and social cohesion across the EU. It addresses the challenges faced by women, youth and elderly groups in the labor market through targeted policy recommendations and measures. However, youth are likely to benefit the most from the EES given the stronger focus and more developed set of EES priorities addressing youth employment issues. The EES provides an important framework for improving the employment and social outcomes of different groups in the EU labor force, but continued monitoring and adaptations are needed to enhance its effectiveness and impacts.
