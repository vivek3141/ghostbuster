Frank Jackson's thought experiment about Mary challenges the concept of physicalism, the view that everything in the world, including consciousness, can be explained in purely physical terms. Physicalism suggests that if Mary knew all the physical facts about color, she would know everything there is to know about color experiences. 

Jackson asks us to imagine Mary, a brilliant scientist who knows all the physical facts about color and color vision. However, Mary has been trapped in a black and white room her whole life and has never experienced colors. According to physicalism, Mary should know everything about the experience of seeing red when she is released from the room and sees a red rose for the first time. However, Jackson argues that when Mary first sees the red rose, she will learn a new fact - what it is like to experience the color red. This suggests that there are non-physical facts about consciousness - the qualia or subjective experiences - that cannot be captured by a complete knowledge of the physical facts.

To further illustrate his point, Jackson describes another thought experiment involving Fred, a man who has never tasted pineapple. Like Mary, Fred knows all the physical facts about pineapple and the experience of tasting it. However, when Fred first tastes pineapple, he will learn new facts about what pineapple tastes like that were not accessible to him before. This shows that conscious experiences involve non-physical qualia that emerge from physical processes in the brain but cannot be reduced to them.

Based on these thought experiments, Jackson claims that there are non-physical facts about consciousness - the qualia like what red looks like and what pineapple tastes like. These subjective, felt qualities of experience cannot be fully explained by the physical facts about color perception or taste. Jackson argues that physicalism fails as a theory because it cannot account for these qualitative aspects of consciousness. Qualia are real phenomena that arise from the physical world but are not physical themselves. They represent a "hard problem" that physicalism cannot solve.

In response to objections, Jackson clarifies that qualia are not mysterious or supernatural, but are part of the natural world that emerges from physical processes in the brain. However, they are not reducible to physical facts and thus pose a challenge to strict physicalism. Jackson argues that any theory of consciousness must incorporate and explain the existence of qualia, the intrinsic felt qualities of experience that shape the character of our mental lives. Overall, Jackson's thought experiments about Mary and Fred provide a compelling case against physicalism and for the existence of non-physical facts about consciousness. His discussion of qualia highlights an important gap in physicalist explanations of the mind that must be addressed.
