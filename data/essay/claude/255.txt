Felicity and Amy could potentially be held liable for several criminal offenses based on the chain of events described, including theft, attempted theft, robbery, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. This essay will analyze the elements of each of these offenses under current English law and discuss criticisms of the relevant statutes.  

Theft, pursuant to the Theft Act 1968, is defined as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. Based on the fact that Felicity and Amy took a handbag containing a wallet and phone from a woman in a coffee shop with the clear intention of keeping these items, their actions likely constitute theft. The main criticisms of the theft statute relate to the vague definition of “dishonesty” and the fact that temporary deprivations of property are not captured.

Attempted theft occurs when a person takes steps towards committing a theft but does not complete it. When Amy unsuccessfully tried to take a handbag from another customer but failed to do so, this could amount to attempted theft. However, attempted theft requires more than mere preparation alone, so some overt act directly contributing towards the full offense must have taken place. The main criticism here is that the line between preparation and attempt is not always clear. 

Robbery refers to theft accompanied by force or the threat of force, and is an aggravated form of theft. By using threats and intimidation to steal the handbag, wallet and phone from the elderly woman, Felicity and Amy’s actions likely constitute robbery. Robbery is considered a very serious offense due to the violence involved. Criticisms relate to the broad definition of “threat of force” and the harsh sentences imposed.

Finally, assault occasioning actual bodily harm refers to any person who unlawfully assaults another, thereby causing actual bodily harm. By pushing the elderly woman to the ground, causing physical injuries requiring hospital treatment, Felicity’s actions likely amount to this offense. The main criticisms are that the sentencing for this offense is too lenient, and it is unclear what constitutes “actual bodily harm”. 

In conclusion, Felicity and Amy could potentially face charges of theft, attempted theft, robbery, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm based on their actions. However, there are several uncertainties and criticisms regarding these offenses and their sentencing under current English criminal law which could impact the outcomes of their cases.
