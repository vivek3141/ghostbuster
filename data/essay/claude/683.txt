Battered Woman Syndrome (BWS) refers to a pattern of psychological symptoms that often develop in women who are subjected to repeated physical, sexual, and/or emotional abuse by their domestic partners. The core symptoms include hypervigilance regarding one's safety, perceived lack of control and self-efficacy, distorted thinking around the abuser's behavior, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. BWS develops in response to chronic trauma and violence inflicted on women by their partners, often as a means for the perpetrators to exert power and control. It greatly affects women's thoughts and behavior, similar to effects of other types of long-term abuse and imprisonment in relationships between non-intimate partners. 

The concept of BWS was first developed in the late 1970s to account for symptoms observed in survivors of domestic violence. It has become most relevant in legal cases where abused women have killed their abusive partners during or in retaliation for acts of violence. Defense lawyers have argued that women who experience BWS should have their acts qualified as self-defense or provocation, rather than murder, due to the psychological impacts of the abuse. However, courts and lawmakers have struggled with how to apply self-defense and provocation when there is a delay between the abusive act and the woman's lethal response, or when the woman is responding to a threat perceived due to her abuse-related psychological symptoms rather than an overtly violent act.

The notion of BWS challenges traditional self-defense and provocation doctrines in several key ways. Self-defense typically requires an immediate threat of harm and a proportionate response to that threat. However, in cases of long-term domestic violence, the threat to a woman's safety is ongoing rather than immediate, and her hypervigilance may lead her to perceive threats that others would not see as imminent. Similarly, the provocation defense usually requires a sudden rage or loss of self-control in response to a provocative act by the victim. Women suffering from BWS, however, may feel constantly fearful and act in perceived self-preservation at a point in time far removed from any particular instance of abuse. Their responses appear disproportionate and rageful without the context of the abuse they have endured.

BWS is not limited to a particular race, class, or sexual orientation but can potentially impact any woman subjected to chronic intimate partner violence. However, critics argue that the initial conceptualization of BWS was based on stereotypical notions of women as weak, passive, and helplessâ€”especially White, middle-class women. Women of color and those from impoverished communities in particular often face additional obstacles to having their experiences with abuse recognized and validated in a legal system already struggling to understand issues like BWS. At the same time, the notion of BWS itself may be limited if it relies too heavily on Western concepts of PTSD and other effects of trauma that do not resonate with or account for the experiences of all abuse survivors. A culturally sensitive, socially contextualized understanding of the impacts of domestic violence on a diversity of women is needed.

In conclusion, BWS refers to the psychological impacts of chronic abuse and trauma experienced within violent domestic relationships. It has challenged traditional applications of self-defense and provocation in cases where women kill their abusive partners. However, BWS must be understood and applied carefully to account for the experiences of diverse women, as well as the highly gendered nature of domestic violence as a means of control. With a more nuanced perspective, the concept of BWS can continue to positively influence legal decisions and social responses for abuse survivors.
