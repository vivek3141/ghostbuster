Sigmund Freud was one of the pioneering figures in modern psychology who has had an enormous influence on the field. However, Freud's theories and methods have been subjected to significant criticism over the years, with opponents arguing that his work is not scientifically valid or built on unstable evidence. While Freud made important theoretical contributions, there are credible arguments that much of his work fails to meet modern scientific standards and would likely not be accepted today.

Freud developed his theories at a time when very little was known about the workings of the human psyche. His theories of psychoanalysis and the unconscious were radical and groundbreaking. Concepts such as defense mechanisms, Oedipus complex, transference, and dream symbolism have permeated popular culture. However, Freud's methods for developing and testing these theories were often theoretically circular, anecdotal, and subject to confirmation bias. Rather than following the scientific method of developing a testable hypothesis, much of his theorizing stemmed from interpreting patients' narratives and self-reported experiences. These interpretations were then used as evidence to support the very theories they had been developed to prove. His theories were not subjected to rigorous testing or validation. As such, independent studies have found little evidence to support many of Freud's famous claims, like the universality of phallic symbols in dreams or the separation of psychosexual development into strict stages. 

One of the most significant and lasting criticisms of Freud's work is that his theories are unfalsifiable. That is, there exists no evidence that could potentially contradict them. This goes against the spirit of scientific theorizing. Freud's interpretations of symbols, slips of the tongue, and childhood events were often subjective, and he handpicked examples to fit with his preconceived theories while ignoring those that did not match. For Freud, any disagreement by a patient with his interpretations was seen as "resistance" and evidence of the need for further psychoanalysis. This circular logic insulated his theories from being disproven.

On the other hand, Freud's work was pioneering for its time and led to insights that have endured and been built upon. The idea of an unconscious mind and the influence of unrecognized psychological forces have become widely accepted. Other concepts like defense mechanisms, Freudian slips, and dream symbolism remain familiar today, even if their theoretical basis is disputed. Psychotherapy and the "talking cure" have been shown effective and are a lasting legacy of Freud's work.

In conclusion, while Freud's work represented an important leap forward in understanding the human psyche that shaped psychology and popular culture for decades, much of it was built on unstable evidence and non-scientific methods. By today's rigorous scientific standards, most of Freud's theories would likely not be accepted without substantial empirical validation and a more objective analytical approach. So there are reasonable arguments on both sides of the proposition that Freud's work in psychology was built on unstable evidence, making it unsuitable for scientific acceptance. Ultimately though, Freud pioneered the study of the unconscious mind and made psychology a household name, cementing his status as one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century.
