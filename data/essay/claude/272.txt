The theatre practitioner Jerzy Grotowski developed an approach to theatre in the mid-20th century that came to be known as "poor theatre." This stark and minimalist approach stripped theatre down to its bare essentials, eliminating elaborate sets, costumes, and other elements that had traditionally been seen as necessary for the theatre. By removing these extraneous elements and focusing intensely on the actor-audience relationship, Grotowski aimed to create a highly visceral theatre experience that could probe deep existential and spiritual questions. 

Grotowski believed that much of the theatre of his time had become inauthentic and disconnected from fundamental human concerns. Lavish sets, costumes, and other production values had obscured the essential relationship between the actor and the audience. He sought to rediscover a "holy" theatre - one that could transformatively impact both actors and spectators. To achieve this, Grotowski developed an ascetic and rigorous approach to theatre that eliminated all but the most essential elements: the actor and the audience.

In his early productions with the Polish Theatre Laboratory, Grotowski stripped away nearly all physical theatre elements. There were no sets, no costunes, and a bare minimum of props. Lighting and sound design were also extremely sparse. The goal was to remove all inessential layers that could potentially come between the actor and the audience. With so many elements subtracted, the actor's craft and ability to connect with audiences became paramount. New emphasis was placed on the actor's vocal and physical expressiveness, as these were the primary means left to convey meaning and emotion. 

Requiring tremendous discipline, vocal control, and bodily mastery, Grotowski's approach was extraordinarily demanding of actors. Through intense training, the actor's whole self became the "vehicle" for the creative act. With all production elements minimized, there was nowhere for the actor to hide - their whole being was exposed during performance in a way that required supreme confidence and skill. The results, however, could be transformative for both actors and spectators. Stripped down to its barest bones, theatre became a shared experience of profound human significance and connection.

In summary, Grotowski's "poor theatre" gained its title from the extreme austerity of means in its productions. By removing lavish sets, costumes, and props, theatre was pared down to its most fundamental elements: the actor and the audience. With nothing left to distract from this core relationship, Grotowski sought to create a highly visceral form of theatre that could explore profound themes of human existence. Demanding total dedication and mastery from its actors, "poor theatre" aimed not simply to entertain audiences but rather to awaken in them a sense of personal transcendence and connection to something greater than themselves.
