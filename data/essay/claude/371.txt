The statement 'I exist' is a philosophical claim that has been debated for centuries. On its face, it seems like a straightforward claim that is obviously trueâ€”I think, therefore I am, as Descartes famously said. However, some philosophers argue that the claim 'I exist' is not actually well-formed or meaningful. There are a few reasons why this may be the case.

First, the word 'I' in the statement refers to one's own sense of self or consciousness. But it is difficult to define what exactly the self or consciousness fundamentally is. We have a sense of inner experience and a perception of continuity of self over time, but pinning down what the 'I' refers to in a definitive sense is challenging. If we can't clearly define what 'I' means, then the claim 'I exist' lacks a precise referent and may not be coherent.  

Second, existence is a complex metaphysical concept. What does it mean to say that something exists? We might say that to exist means to have a physical presence or instantiation in the real world. But the self or consciousness is not obviously physically instantiated in the same way a rock or a tree is. The self or 'I' seems immaterial. So in what sense can we claim the 'I' exists if we can't point to its physical manifestation? This further complicates the coherency of the statement 'I exist.'

On the other hand, some philosophers argue that 'I exist' is a well-formed claim because one's own consciousness has a kind of self-evident existence. Descartes claimed that even if he doubted the existence of the external world, he could not doubt the existence of himself as a thinking being. His famous line 'cogito ergo sum' or 'I think, therefore I am' suggests that the sheer experience of thinking and consciousness gives rise to an awareness of one's own existence that is indubitable. On this view, the only thing we can be absolutely sure of is the existence of our own minds. So 'I exist' does refer to something real and the statement is meaningful.

In conclusion, there are good reasons to think the statement 'I exist' is problematic and not well-formed, given difficulties in defining what 'I' refers to and what exactly existence means in this context. However, Descartes' argument that the self-awareness accompanying conscious thought gives rise to a clear sense of one's own existence suggests the claim could still be meaningful. The debate around this issue remains open, and there may not be a unanimous view on whether or not 'I exist' should be considered a coherent claim. The issues it raises around self, consciousness, existence, and knowledge will likely continue to be discussed by philosophers for a long time to come.
