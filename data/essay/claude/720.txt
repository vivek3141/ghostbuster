Victorian literature frequently explored themes of tragedy as a way to examine socioeconomic conditions and relationships during the period. Two prominent Victorian authors, George Eliot and Charles Dickens, employed tragedy in their works to explore themes related to gender relations, education, and landscape. 

In her novel The Mill on the Floss, George Eliot uses tragedy to scrutinize gender roles and education opportunities for women during the Victorian era. The protagonist Maggie Tulliver is a clever and spirited young girl who craves education and intellectual stimulation. However, her brother Tom and society at large discourage Maggie from pursuing education and attempt to slot her into a traditional gender role. Maggie's thirst for knowledge and personal growth ultimately leads to tragedy when she is unable to conform to social expectations. Maggie drowns after society rejects her passion and intelligence. Through this tragic conclusion, Eliot highlights the immense constraints placed on women in terms of access to education and personal development. She suggests that tragedy results when women are prevented from reaching their full potential.

Similarly, in Great Expectations, Charles Dickens employs tragedy to critique the Victorian education system and its limitations. The protagonist Pip is subjected to a poor education at the hands of his cruel brother-in-law Mr. Wopsle. Pip only begins to develop intellectually once he is sponsored by the affluent Miss Havisham. However, his "great expectations" are built on illusion and deceit. Pip's limited education and insight ultimately lead him to make poor decisions that bring tragedy to himself and those around him. It is only after hardship and loss that Pip gains wisdom and appreciation for the relationships in his life. Dickens implies that the failures of the education system produce tragic consequences, as students lack the knowledge and judgment to navigate difficulties and complex social relationships.   

Finally, Eliot and Dickens both use the natural landscape as a metaphorical vehicle to drive tragic events in their novels. In The Mill on the Floss, the river on which Maggie drowns comes to symbolize her constrained circumstances as well as her passion and vitality. Similarly, in Great Expectations, the mists and marshes of the countryside represent mystery, illusion, and uncertainty in Pip's world. The landscape reinforces themes of obscured truth and imperfect knowledge. The environment seems to either entrap characters or lead them into peril and misfortune.

In conclusion, Victorian writers like George Eliot and Charles Dickens employed tragedy as a means of social critique. They explored the themes of gender relations, education, and landscape to highlight the societal limitations and inequalities of the Victorian period that contributed to tragic outcomes. Through their novels, they provide a glimpse into struggles for personal growth and fulfillment in the face of rigid social conventions and injustice.
