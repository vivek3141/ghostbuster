The paradox of liberalism and its relation to European imperialism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries lies in the contradiction between the liberal ideals of equality, liberty, and self-determination, and the reality of violent expansion and subjugation of foreign peoples during this era of New Imperialism. On the one hand, liberal thinkers since John Locke had promoted the rights of man and participatory government. But on the other hand, European nations seized control over nearly the entire continent of Africa as well as territories in Asia and the Pacific, ruling over these lands and peoples with military force. 

There were a range of views on how imperialism related to liberalism. Some argued they were wholly compatible. Imperialists like Joseph Chamberlain claimed that imperial expansion spread liberal Western civilization and economic opportunity to backward peoples. They saw imperialism as a new form of trusteeship, where liberal European nations would guide native peoples to eventual independence and self-government. Others like J.A. Hobson argued imperialism undermined liberalism by promoting authoritarianism and economic domination abroad while distorting domestic politics and society back home. In his analysis, the pursuit of new markets and resources drove imperial expansion, not a civilizing mission.

A middle ground view held that imperialism could be compatible with liberalism if imperial powers respected rights and moved native peoples toward self-rule, but in practice most fell short of liberal ideals. Liberal anti-imperialists like Herbert Spencer believed that self-determination was a universal right and that Western nations had no legitimate authority to rule over others. In India, native leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji and Gopal Krishna Gokhale used the language of liberalism to demand more political representation and self-government, exposing the limits of British liberal imperialism.

In truth, both ideology and economic interests fueled New Imperialism. The "civilizing mission" doctrine reflected a genuine belief that Western civilization was superior. But the race for new markets, raw materials, and strategic bases also clearly drove imperial expansion. These twin motivations reinforced each other, as political elites pursued empire to boost national prestige as well as economic growth. In many ways, imperialism allowed Western powers to reconcile their democratic values with their more authoritarian and self-interested impulses.

In conclusion, the paradox of liberalism and imperialism in this era stemmed from the dissonance between liberal democratic ideals and the harsh inequalities of imperial rule in practice. Perspectives differed on whether they were compatible or fundamentally contradictory. But in the end, liberalism alone did not drive European imperialism. A mix of ideology and economic motivations—at times working together, at times in tension—shaped this pivotal period when Western powers came to dominate much of the globe. The paradox thus remains that liberal democracies built empires, even as their own liberal values undercut the moral justification for subjugating foreign lands and peoples.
