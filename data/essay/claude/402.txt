The existence of a general intelligence factor, often called ‘g,’ which represents cognitive abilities that influence performance across a variety of mental tasks, has been debated for over a century. There is substantial evidence from several domains supporting the existence of g. 

First, psychometric studies have consistently found that people who perform well on one type of cognitive test tend to perform well on other tests intended to measure different abilities. Charles Spearman first observed this in the early 1900s and proposed that a general mental ability—which he called ‘g’—influenced performance across intellectual tasks. Modern studies using factor analysis have found that scores on diverse cognitive tests are positively correlated, and that this correlation can be explained by a single factor, g. 

Second, cognitive task studies have found that g is related to performance on elementary cognitive processes that are engaged in many complex tasks. For example, the time required to make a simple reaction time response and the ability to maintain and manipulate information in working memory have both been linked to g. Individual differences in g are thought to reflect differences in the computational efficiency of the brain systems involved in basic information processing. 

Third, research in biological psychology has found associations between g and several biological markers. For example, g is correlated with the integrity and metabolic activity of white matter tracts in the brain, especially in the frontal lobes and parietal lobes, suggesting that efficient connectivity between brain regions supports higher g.  G is also linked to individual differences in glucose metabolism and dopamine receptor density in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. 

Fourth, evolutionary psychologists argue that g evolved in humans to facilitate complex social cognition, tool use, and adaptive problem solving. Strong selection pressures in human evolutionary history likely favored the emergence of a domain-general mental ability, so the existence of g is consistent with an evolutionary perspective.

In contrast, Howard Gardner has argued for the existence of eight or more independent ‘multiple intelligences’ such as musical intelligence, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, and interpersonal intelligence. However, critics argue that Gardner’s theory lacks empirical support and that there is little evidence the proposed intelligences are separate mental abilities. Most psychometric research has found little support for the separation of Gardner’s intelligences.

In conclusion, while Gardner and other critics argue for separate ‘multiple intelligences,’ evidence from psychometrics, cognitive research, biology, and evolution point to the existence of a general factor of intelligence, g, that represents individual differences in the efficiency of core brain processes involved in many complex cognitive functions. G appears to have emerged in human evolution to solve evolutionarily significant problems, and to provide a quantitative metric for overall mental ability. The theory of multiple intelligences lacks evidence and is inconsistent with our current scientific understanding of intelligence.
