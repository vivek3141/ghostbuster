There is an ongoing debate in ethics over whether moral truths are objective or relative. Those who believe in objective moral truths think that certain moral claims are true regardless of context or perspective. For example, that deliberately killing innocent people is always wrong, regardless of circumstances. Moral relativists, on the other hand, believe that moral truths depend heavily on context and cultural perspectives. What is morally right or wrong for one society or individual may be different for another. There are good arguments on both sides of this debate, and neither view can conclusively prove that morality should be kept private or made universally public.  

Believers in objective moral truths point out that some actions like murder, rape, and cruelty seem wrong no matter the context or perspective. If morality was relative, they argue, then we would have to accept that the Holocaust or slavery were morally right for the societies that practiced them. But most of us intuitively feel that actions like genocide are morally wrong, regardless of context. Moral relativists counter that even supposedly universal moral truths depend on cultural assumptions and beliefs. All moral claims emerge from a particular cultural, historical, and social context. There are no moral facts that can be proven in an objective, universal way.

Moral relativists argue that morality is deeply tied to cultural traditions and social contexts. Different cultures have developed different moral codes to suit their needs. What one society considers morally good another may consider evil. For example, attitudes toward sexuality, property rights, individualism versus community, and family structures differ widely across cultures. There is no objective way to judge one set of cultural values as superior. Moral relativists believe we should be tolerant of cultural differences and not impose our moral views on others.

In contrast, believers in objective moral truth argue that if morality is relative, then there is no way to judge "evil" actions like genocide as wrong. Relativism could be used to justify harmful practices like oppression of minorities or unequal treatment of women. They believe certain basic moral principles like prohibitions against murder and cruelty should be universal. Moral relativism makes it difficult to morally condemn actions that violate human rights. If everything is relative, there seems no grounds to judge one moral view as better or worse than another.

Whether morality should be private or made universally public depends in part on this debate. If there are objective moral truths, some argue we have grounds to promote those universal values and judge actions that violate them. However, others argue that even if objective moral truths exist, individuals still have a right to their own moral conscience and privacy. Enforcing moral values through law or social pressure risks tyranny of the majority. If morality is relative, then it seems we should be more tolerant of a diversity of moral views, as long as they do no direct harm. But some argue relativism makes it too easy to justify harmful practices that violate human rights. 

In conclusion, while arguments can be made on both sides, neither an objective nor relative view of morality conclusively proves that morality should be kept private or made publicly universal. Believers in objective moral truth have grounds to promote universal moral values, but must avoid imposing values in a way that violates individual conscience and privacy. Moral relativists can argue for tolerance of diversity but must avoid justifying harmful practices. There are good reasons morality should remain partly private and partly public, regardless of whether moral truths are objective or relative. The debate between these two perspectives continues, with compelling arguments on both sides.
