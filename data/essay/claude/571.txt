Entrepreneurship and Influence Between the Working Class and Detectives in London's East End 

The working class and criminal investigators of London's East End in the 19th century were inextricably linked through a network of influence and enterprise. As argued by Hobbs in "Doing the Business," the East End working class participated in both lawful and unlawful business ventures, developing a system of informal commerce that often necessitated cooperation with detectives and investigators. At the same time, detectives relied upon connections within this working class culture to gather information and advance their agendas. This interrelationship was characterized by mutually beneficial exchange and shaped by the pragmatic values of East Enders.

Hobbs employs ethnographic methods, including archival research and interviews, to explore the "web of social and commercial relationships" between the East End working class and detectives. He finds that many working class individuals engaged in unlawful activity, or knew those who did, as a means of income and entrepreneurship in an area with limited opportunities. However, rather than viewing East Enders as purely criminal, Hobbs argues they developed a system of "informal economy" and were pragmatic in their approach to business. They sought financial gain through any means available. 

Detectives understood and relied upon these pragmatic values and web of connections to further their own agendas. They formed relationships with working class individuals who could provide information, incentivizing them through payments and other favors. As Hobbs writes, "The formal and informal economies were, to a degree, symbiotic." The working class and CID developed a system of exchange that benefited both parties.

Through this analysis, Hobbs demonstrates that entrepreneurship was a driving force behind the interrelationship between these groups. The working class displayed enterprise in their approach to business, seeking out opportunities wherever they could. Detectives then tapped into these networks and connections, using similar savvy to extract information and cooperation. There was an informal economy that linked the lawful and unlawful realms of business.

However, while detectives and East Enders developed a practical working relationship, there remained an intrinsic power imbalance that shaped their interactions. As Hobbs notes, "The world the police moved in was one they never felt fully in control of." Detectives relied on the knowledge and connections of the working class, yet also maintained a position of authority over them. They incentivized cooperation through payments but also threats and intimidation.  

This complex power dynamic is reflective of the culture of pragmatism that dominated the East End. There were no steadfast rules of engagement between detectives and the working class, only a willingness to cooperate when useful for both parties. Laws were malleable as needed to serve each group's self-interest. As Hobbs argues, "for the East London working class, entrepreneurial acumen and skill were admired qualities, as was the ability to negotiate a path through the vagaries and inconsistencies of the law." Success was measured not by rigid morality but by practical gain.

In conclusion, entrepreneurship was the driving force that linked the working class of London's East End with detectives in a delicate web of mutual influence. Pragmatism and self-interest dominated this relationship, as each group tapped into the other's networks and knowledge for its own benefit. Though an imbalance of power persisted, cooperation was possible when useful and necessary for business and gain. This "informal economy" of exchange reflected the flexible and pragmatic values that shaped interactions in East End culture. Overall, Hobbs provides keen insight into this complex relationship through his close ethnographic analysis of the networks, environments, and mentalities of both groups.
