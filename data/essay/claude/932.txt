Baldwin's 1584 novel "Beware the Cat" challenges traditional notions of knowledge and education in its era by focusing on marginalized figures as sources of wisdom and by subverting accepted theories about the natural and supernatural world. In the novel, Mr. Streamer, a self-educated "eccentric" dismissed by the establishment, proves to hold insights beyond the orthodox views of church and state. Through Streamer and his familiar Mousely's observations and storytelling, Baldwin presents a different understanding of how knowledge is produced and what constitutes authority.  

Mr. Streamer, though looked down upon by others, demonstrates an inquisitive mind and breadth of learning gained through observation and reading rather than institutional education. While Streamer never attended university, his intellectual curiosity leads him to understand the world in unconventional ways. For example, Streamer comes to believe in the existence of witches and magic through his own experience witnessing a cat speak - even though such beliefs contradicted religious doctrine. Streamer's open-mindedness and trust in his own senses allows him to reach conclusions at odds with established knowledge. By making such an eccentric figure his protagonist and mouthpiece, Baldwin challenges the notion that officially sanctioned education is the sole path to wisdom.

Through Mousely the cat's tales, Baldwin further problematizes traditional authorities and offers alternative explanations of natural and preternatural phenomena. Mousely's stories provide fanciful theories about the abilities and origins of cats that contradict the science of the time. For example, Mousely claims that cats descend from rabbits, can see in the dark due to stars in their eyes, and can walk through closed doors. While fanciful, these stories suggest observational and imaginative ways of understanding the world that question institutional doctrines. By putting such unconventional ideas in the mouth of a talking cat, Baldwin playfully and provocatively undermines human concepts of knowledge, nature and the proper sources of education.  

In conclusion, Baldwin's novel proposes that true wisdom may come from unexpected places and unorthodox ideas. Through Mr. Streamer and Mousely the cat's challenges to conventional knowledge about nature, religion and education, "Beware the Cat" suggests that in order to gain a full understanding of the world, one must remain open-minded, trust one's own senses, and not rely solely on established institutions for the production of knowledge and truth. Baldwin advocates for a kind of intellectual freedom and openness to different ways of thinking that was ahead of its time.
