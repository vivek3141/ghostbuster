The concept of 'burden-sharing' refers to the idea that the costs and responsibilities of assisting and protecting refugees should be shared among countries. Rather than the country that refugees first arrive in bearing the entire burden of caring for them, other countries should provide financial, material and political support. Burden-sharing aims to distribute the costs of refugee assistance equitably based on countries' capacities and responsibilities.  

However, burden-sharing raises questions about what constitutes a 'fair' distribution of costs. There are disagreements over whether burden-sharing should be allocated based on countries' wealth, their proximity to refugee source countries, their historical ties to refugees' countries of origin, or other factors. Further questions center on whether burden-sharing should be legally mandated or voluntary, and whether it should apply in all refugee crises or only in exceptional circumstances. There are also concerns about 'responsibility-shifting,' where countries aim to minimize their own responsibilities by placing blame and costs onto others.

Discussions of justice emphasise that refugee protection should be a shared, global responsibility. As refugees are often forced to flee threats to their basic rights and humanity, affording them dignity and security is a moral duty. However, governments may prioritise their perceived national interests over moral obligations to refugees. In practice, most refugee assistance is shouldered by neighbouring host countries in the global south with limited capacity to sustain it. The injustice of the current system underscores the need for comprehensive, coordinated burden-sharing.

Recent literature has analysed both the ethics and practicalities of burden-sharing. Ethically, scholars argue for understanding burden-sharing as a duty to protect the human rights of refugees. However, governments may need to balance this duty against domestic interests, suggesting voluntary cooperation and incentive structures may be more realistic than strict obligations. Practically, experts propose improved data collection, multilateral cooperation through the UN, and increased development assistance for host countries. The EU-Turkey deal exemplifies an attempt at large-scale burden-sharing, though it remains imperfect.  

The Tampa crisis of 2001 exemplifies the failure of burden-sharing and the politics of 'responsibility-shifting.' When a Norwegian ship rescued Afghan asylum seekers in Australian waters, Australia refused to accept them. Australia claimed they were Norway's responsibility, as the ship was Norwegian, while Norway argued that Australia was obligated to accept refugees rescued within their borders. The impasse highlighted the lack of international cooperation on refugee crises. Australia's unilateral actions and hostile rhetoric were widely criticised as contrary to responsible burden-sharing.

Santos argues for understanding burden-sharing through a "transnational conception of membership and community." This proposes that refugees are a global collective responsibility because they are fellow humans, regardless of nationality or borders. Under this view, refugee protection is not a matter of state interests but of shared humanity. Implementing transnational burden-sharing would require countries to look beyond their own interests, cooperating compassionately to fulfil moral and legal duties to refugees as global citizens. However, critics argue this conception is idealsitic and incompatible with state sovereignty.

In conclusion, while burden-sharing is critical to establishing a just refugee protection regime, it raises complex ethical and practical challenges. Progress will require countries adopting a spirit of shared responsibility, cooperating through multilateral mechanisms and incentivising equitable burden-sharing across borders. The transnational conception suggests an ideal for burden-sharing, grounded in a vision of shared humanity beyond state interests. Overall, the future of burden-sharing depends on governments recognising that refugee crises require global collective action based on principles of ethics and justice.
