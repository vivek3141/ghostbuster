The neurological system consists of the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which are both involved in sending and receiving signals to control our body. The CNS comprises the brain and spinal cord. The brain acts as the control center, integrated sensory information and signaling the body to response. The PNS consists of nerves that travel between the rest of the body and the CNS. 

There are various brain scanning techniques used to study the neurological system. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses magnetic fields to produce high resolution 3D images of the brain. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can detect changes in blood flow related to neural activity in the brain. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans use radioactive tracers to detect metabolic changes and visualize brain activity. Electroencephalography (EEG) uses electrodes on the scalp to measure patterns of electrical activity in the brain.

Future applications of brain scanning and neurological research include developing treatments for brain disorders and diseases, improving augmented and virtual reality technologies, enhancing brain-computer interfaces to restore movement for paralysis patients, and even uploading human consciousness.

Ganglions are clusters of nerve cell bodies located in the PNS. They contain cell bodies, dendrites, and some synapses. Ganglions act as relay stations, processing and transmitting signals between the CNS and nerves in the PNS. For example, the dorsal root ganglion located along the spinal column contains cell bodies of sensory neurons that transmit signals from sensory receptors to the spinal cord. Ganglions thus play an important role in communication within the neurological system.

In summary, the neurological system includes the complex CNS and PNS, which work together to control our body. Brain scanning techniques are useful tools for studying the neurological system, and continued research in this field will enable many exciting future applications. Ganglions also facilitate signaling within this system as relay stations between the CNS and PNS.
