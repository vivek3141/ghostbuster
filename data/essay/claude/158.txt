The 'Third Way' refers to a political philosophy advocating a blend of both economic liberalism and social democracy. The dominant Third Way doctrine within New Labour defined its approach to the welfare state and social policy between 1997 and 2010. The key proponents of the Third Way within New Labour included Tony Blair and Anthony Giddens. The fundamental Third Way argument was that neither a socialist collectivism or free market capitalism could alone adequately address the socioeconomic challenges of a globalized 21st century. Instead, a Third Way of thinking that combined market mechanisms with government intervention was necessary.

The values underpinning the Third Way are distinct from a New Right philosophy in their defense of an interventionist government role in addressing socioeconomic challenges and use of public services. However, the Third Way also embraces elements of New Right thinking in its acceptance of the role of markets and private enterprise. The Third Way thus proposes a 'steering' role for government rather than either the roll-back of the state favored by neo-liberals or the expansion of direct state control proposed by traditional socialism. In this sense, the Third Way represents a new political synthesis of these traditional ideological opposites. 

However, critics argue the Third Way is not a coherent new philosophy but rather a re-branding of well-established neoliberal and center-left policy ideas. The policies enacted by New Labour under the Third Way banner--such as privatisation of public services, flexible labour markets, and welfare reform emphasizing 'workfare'--largely continued the policy directions set under the previous Conservative administrations. The Third Way was also criticized as overly accommodating globalization through weakening the domestic welfare state and worker protections. Supporters counter that the Third Way successfully modernized social democracy by recognizing the need for both social justice and a dynamic market economy.

In my view, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. The Third Way constituted an important theoretical reorientation of center-left politics towards a new accommodation with globalization and capitalism. However, in policy terms, the Third Way was primarily a continuation and development of established Blairite and neoliberal tendencies rather than a radical new departure. The Third Way was a politically significant 'Big Tent' philosophy for its time but lacked a coherent welfare policy vision of its own. Its legacy and relevance today is thus questionable. Overall, the Third Way should be viewed as an important stage in the evolution of social democracy but not as a definitive philosophy for welfare policy.
