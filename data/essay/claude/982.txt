There has been a rise in reported food poisoning cases over the past 20 years. This has been attributed to several factors. Firstly, there is increased trade and transport of foods across countries and continents. This means that contamination occurring in one country can lead to outbreaks in another far away. With more people now traveling abroad as well, they are exposed to foreign foods and bacteria that their bodies may not be accustomed to, leading to higher rates of infections. 

Secondly, there are more immunocompromised people in the general population now due to conditions like HIV, other chronic illnesses, and medical treatments like chemotherapy. These groups have a higher chance of getting infected and developing serious symptoms from foodborne pathogens. In addition, both adults in a household now commonly work outside the home. This means more eating out at restaurants and takeaways which may have poorer food handling standards compared to home-cooked meals.  

The three main food safety hazards are: biological hazards such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites; chemical hazards such as pesticides, toxins, and allergens; and physical hazards such as objects that can cause choking or injury. To prevent biological hazards, proper cooking and cold storage of foods are critical. Employees should practice frequent hand washing and not handle ready-to-eat foods when ill. Surfaces should be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized.To counter chemical hazards, foods must be sourced from approved and regulated suppliers. Staff should be trained on proper use of chemicals for cleaning and pest control. For physical hazards, food preparation areas should have proper lighting, ventilation, and use of protective gear like gloves.  

Lack of food safety awareness stems from insufficient food safety education. Not all schools provide practical food handling courses. Education campaigns targeting home cooks and food handlers should be implemented. Food business operators should receive mandatory accredited training on food safety management. Comprehension levels vary among people and information should be in easy-to-understand formats.  

There are laws like the Food Safety Act and Food Hygiene Regulations that food businesses must comply with. These cover requirements such as having a Food Safety Management System, use of potable water, pest control procedures, waste disposal systems, record keeping for temperature monitoring and staff training. Regular inspections are also conducted by health departments. However, limitations in resources for audits and enforcement mean that some food operators may not always strictly follow regulations.

In summary, a variety of factors have contributed to the rise in food poisoning over the years but with improved awareness, training, and compliance to laws, foodborne illness can be reduced. Individuals and food operators should jointly share responsibility in upholding food safety standards and practices. Overall, a multi-pronged approach is needed across society to remedy this important public health issue.
