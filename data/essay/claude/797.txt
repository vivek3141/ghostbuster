Describe the process of team work within a multi-professional culture, using appropriate models and reflective cycles. 

Successful teamwork involves effort, coordination, and a shared commitment to a goal. When the team consists of members from multiple professions and cultures,  additional effort is required to facilitate understanding and cooperation. Modeling the team process and engaging in reflective cycles can help a multi-professional group navigate challenges and maximize effectiveness.

One useful model for multi-professional teamwork is Tuckman's stages of group development: forming, storming, norming, and performing. During the forming stage, members come together and get acquainted, but interactions are polite and roles are unclear. In the storming stage, as members become more familiar, differences in perspective or approach can lead to conflict and power dynamics emerge. For a multi-professional team, these differences may relate to variations in priorities, expertise, and organizational culture across professions. Addressing conflict openly and finding common ground is key to moving to the norming stage, where roles become clearer, processes are established, and consensus develops. At the performing stage, the team is executing and functioning at a high level. Members have learned how to collaborate across perceived differences and leverage their distinct strengths towards meeting shared goals. Applying patience and revisiting stages as needed allows a team to progress through forming and storming to norming and ultimately performing.  

A reflective cycle is another useful tool for multi-professional teamwork. The cycle begins with planning the team's approach, followed by acting to carry out plans, observing the results and experiences, reflecting to evaluate effectiveness, and then re-planning based on lessons learned. Reflection, in particular, is crucial for diverse teams. It means honestly sharing perspectives on what is working, not working, and could be improved in terms of communication, integration of ideas, and ability to achieve desired outcomes. A reflective cycle then means revising approaches to build on insights gained through this reflective process. By reflecting regularly and openly, a multi-professional team can gain valuable meta-knowledge about team functioning to complement the knowledge and skills that members contribute from their own domains. 

Continued cycles of modeling, action, observation and reflection allow a multi-professional team to achieve a high level of performance over time. With each cycle, the team 
develops a stronger shared  mental model that transcends their professional affiliations and fosters an integrated team identity. The path to effective teamwork is not straightforward, but with effort and persistence, a multi-professional team can leverage diversity into a key strength through collaboration, mutual understanding, and a commitment to reflective practice. In the end, a well-functioning diverse team can achieve outcomes that would not have been possible through a single profession alone.
