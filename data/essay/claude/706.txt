Val Gillies' approach to discourse analysis of addiction counters the traditional scientific and medical definitions of addiction by focusing on the power of language and discourse in constructing experience and meaning. Rather than seeing addiction as a disease rooted in individual biology or psychology, Gillies approaches addiction from a social constructionist perspective. She argues that concepts like "drug addiction" or "alcoholism" are not objective scientific categories but are shaped by the discourse and language we use to talk about substance use.  

Gillies examines the historical emergence of the concept of addiction, showing how it arose in the early 1900s not from new scientific discoveries but from moral concerns over intemperance. The concept of addiction was shaped by metaphors of slavery and images of the addict as lacking in willpower or morality. These ways of thinking and talking about addiction established it as an individual problem and a question of moral character rather than a social issue. The disease model of addiction that later emerged also reinforced individual blame by framing addiction as a chronic illness that required medical treatment and lifelong abstinence to overcome.

Gillies argues that we need to challenge these dominant discourses of addiction that focus on individual psychology or biology. She draws on post-structuralist theories of discourse and language to argue that the meanings and understandings we have of addiction are created through discourse, not objectively given. The language we use to talk about addiction constructs certain subject positions and ways of thinking about the issue that have real impacts and material consequences. By exposing the historical and cultural contingencies in the dominant discourses of addiction, Gillies aims to open up spaces for new ways of thinking and new possibilities for action.  

A key strength of Gillies' discursive approach is that it illuminates the power dynamics involved in the construction of addiction. It shows how dominant discourses that make addiction an individual problem also absolve society of responsibility and place blame on the addicted subject. Recognizing the social construction of addiction exposes the moral judgments and assumptions that pervade much of our common sense and scientific thinking about addiction. It allows us to consider how we might construct addiction differently by changing the language and metaphors we use.

However, there are also weaknesses in an exclusively discursive approach. While discourse shapes knowledge and subjectivity, it cannot be reduced to just discourse. Biological, social and other factors also contribute to and interact with the phenomenon we call addiction. A discursive approach may overstate the power of language alone to determine how addiction is understood and experienced. It needs to be combined with other social scientific and humanities approaches to provide a full understanding of addiction.

In conclusion, Val Gillies provides an important challenge to dominant views of addiction by using discourse analysis to uncover the social construction of addiction. Her approach highlights how the language we use to talk about addiction shapes how we understand, experience and treat it. Though limited if adopted exclusively, when combined with other approaches a focus on discourse can yield valuable insights into the power dynamics and moral judgments that pervade society's relationship with addiction. Overall, Gillies' work makes a persuasive case for challenging the myth that addiction is solely a question of individual biology or choice.
