Leopold von Ranke and the Development of Scientific History

Leopold von Ranke was a pioneering 19th-century German historian who helped establish history as an academic discipline and developed key principles that shaped the objective and scientific study of history. Ranke came from a modest Lutheran family and was educated to become a minister. However, he became interested in history and embarked on an academic career. He is most associated with the rise of scientific empiricism and objectivity in history.   

Ranke rejected the prevalent philosophies of history of his time, including speculative philosophies of history that viewed history moving in a linear progressive direction. Instead, Ranke sought to study history scientifically based on evidence in primary sources. His key doctrines were to study historical events "as they really were" (wie es eigentlich gewesen) without biases or preconceptions, relying on facts verified by primary sources. For Ranke, only primary sources could provide objective facts - facts that were true for their own time. Secondary sources and moral judgments only obscured the truth.

Ranke applied this empiricist methodology in his historical works, focusing on documentary evidence from archives and manuscripts. For example, in his History of the Latin and Germanic Nations (1824), Ranke used sources in Vienna's imperial archives to construct a factual history of the rivalry between the Holy Roman Empire and the Roman Catholic Church from 1494 to 1514. His scholarly use of archival records and emphasis on impartiality set a standard for scientific history.  

Ranke also emphasized the individuality and uniqueness of historical periods and events. He rejected the search for historical laws or patterns, arguing that each period should be understood in its own terms. This anti-theoretical stance reinforced his empiricism - one should not approach history with preconceived ideas or theories but let the facts speak for themselves. At the same time, Ranke did believe that certain moral and spiritual factors, like religion, shaped history. However, these were historical facts to be investigated, not philosophical assumptions.

In summary, Ranke's philosophy of history and methodology were groundbreaking in elevating history into an empirical science based on objective evidence from primary sources. His focus on establishing historical facts, eschewing moral judgments, embracing the uniqueness of historical contexts, and studying the influence of spiritual factors like religion established principles that continue to shape the discipline of history. Through his own extensive historical works, Ranke also helped establish history as a respected field of academic study in German universities. Although later criticized as implying an unrealistic empiricism, Ranke's philosophy of scientific history marked a pivotal turn in the professionalization and methodological sophistication of the discipline.
