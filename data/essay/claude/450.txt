Piaget's theory of cognitive development has had a significant influence on education and curriculum design. His theory proposes that children progress through four stages of cognitive development chronologically: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. As children move through these stages, the way they understand, perceive, and interact with the world changes. Piaget's theory suggests that children in the preoperational stage, typically ages 2 to 7, are egocentric and lack the ability to conserve or reason logically using abstract hypothetical thinking. Therefore, science curriculum for primary schools should focus on concrete learning and include hands-on activities to match the cognitive abilities of children in this age range. 

While Piaget's theory provides useful insights into how children's thinking and learning changes as they age, it also has several limitations. One major critique is that Piaget underestimated the cognitive abilities of children, especially young children. Recent research has found that even infants are capable of logical reasoning, symbolic thought, and abstract thinking at a younger age than proposed by Piaget. For example, studies show that children as young as 4 years old can understand basic science concepts and relationships when information is presented in an age-appropriate manner. This suggests that science curricula for primary students should include more opportunities to develop abstract and logical thinking skills, rather than focusing mostly on concrete learning activities.  

Information processing theories provide an alternative perspective on cognitive development that addresses some of the limitations in Piaget's theory. These theories suggest that the development of memory, attention, reasoning, and problem-solving skills are largely influenced by biology and experience. As children age, their increasing knowledge and experiences change the way they think, not just qualitatively different stages of thinking as proposed by Piaget. From this view, the science curriculum for primary schools should emphasize activities that help children develop stronger cognitive and metacognitive skills through practice and experience, rather than assuming their thinking is limited by their developmental stage.

Overall, while Piaget's theory of cognitive development provides a useful framework for understanding how children's thinking changes with age, it likely underestimates the cognitive abilities of young children and oversimplifies the developmental process. Science curricula for primary schools would benefit from incorporating activities that challenge children's abstract and logical thinking skills, not just concrete learning. A focus on developing cognitive skills through practice and experience, as suggested by information processing theories, may be a more effective approach than matching activities to assumed developmental stages. A balanced perspective, using insights from multiple theories, will provide the most appropriate guidance for developing educational curriculum and policy.

In summary, Piaget's theory offers a classic model of child development but has clear limitations. Alternative theories, such as those focused on information processing, provide more nuanced perspectives on how children learn and develop cognitively. For primary science education, a multidimensional approach that incorporates developmentally appropriate challenges, concrete learning activities, and opportunities to improve cognitive skills through experience would be the most beneficial based on our current understanding of child development and learning. Overall, while Piaget's theory was groundbreaking, additional perspectives from modern research and theories are needed to design effective curriculum and fully support children's learning potential.
