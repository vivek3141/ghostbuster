The White Horse is a hotel and restaurant located in a small historic village that caters to tourists, locals, and business travelers. To improve The White Horse’s business strategy, I would make the following recommendations based on a SWOT analysis and an evaluation of their extended marketing mix:

A SWOT analysis identifies the internal factors of strengths and weaknesses, as well as the external factors of opportunities and threats that can influence a business’s success. The key strengths of The White Horse are its historic charm and ambiance, high quality fare using local ingredients, and personalized and attentive service. However, some weaknesses include inconsistent occupancy rates due to seasonality, lack of brand awareness beyond the local area, and facilities and rooms in need of upgrades to meet the expectations of more discerning travelers. 

There are opportunities to build on food and agritourism trends by emphasizing the farm-to-table experience and its picturesque village setting. Partnerships with local attractions like nearby historic homes and a vineyard can also drive traffic and repeat visitors. However, threats facing the business include increased competition from larger branded hotels, rising costs for supplies and labor, and shifts in travel patterns or tourism preferences that move away from historic small towns.

To leverage these strengths, address the weaknesses, capitalize on opportunities, and counter threats, The White Horse should focus its business strategy on the following elements of the extended marketing mix:

Product: Maintain high quality of food, beverage, and service but upgrade facilities and rooms to match. Promote packages that include extras like meals, activities, or access to local attractions.

Price: Adopt variable and dynamic pricing based on occupancy and season to maximize revenue. Offer bundled packages and loyalty programs at a discount to encourage repeat bookings and word-of-mouth marketing.

Promotion: Increase brand awareness through social media, PR, and partnerships. Highlight historic architecture, farm-to-table fare, and personalized service. Run special events and promotions in shoulder seasons.

Place: Pursue cross-promotional opportunities with area attractions, tour groups, wedding planners, and conference organizers. Make it easy to book the venue for events, meetings, and group travel. Improve visibility and signage for walk-in traffic. 

People: Invest in ongoing staff training to enhance customer service and knowledge of the local area. Empower frontline staff to personalize experiences for guests. Foster a culture of hospitality and community involvement.

Physical environment: Renovate and upgrade facilities and rooms while preserving historic character. Create an ambiance of relaxed elegance. Improve layout for hosting events and larger groups. Enhance curb appeal and wayfinding for first impressions.

Process: Review and improve operational efficiency, consistency, and communication to provide seamless guest experiences. Streamline booking, check-in/out procedures. Empower staff to resolve issues and handle special requests promptly.

In summary, by focusing on strengthening its positioning and the total customer experience through these strategic recommendations, The White Horse can better differentiate itself, build brand loyalty, increase occupancy rates and revenue, and ensure a sustainable future for this historic business. With a clear and well-executed business strategy based on its unique strengths and the local area, The White Horse is well-poised to thrive for years to come.
