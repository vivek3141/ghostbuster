How Does the Life Cycle Affect Leisure Choices in Terms of Visiting Bars and Clubs?

Over the course of our lives, our needs, priorities, and roles change. These changes influence how we spend our leisure time, including how often and why we visit bars, clubs, and other nightlife entertainment venues. In our youth, we tend to visit bars and clubs more frequently as we explore our independence and form our identities. As we age and enter more committed relationships, often progressing into marriage and parenthood, our priorities shift and our nightlife patronage declines. However, later in life, as responsibilities ease and we have more freedom again, we may reconnect with bars and clubs for their social opportunities.

In our late teens and twenties, visiting bars and clubs is a major part of our leisure and social lives. This age cohort is typically unmarried, without children, gaining independence from their parents or guardians, and exploring ways to spend their leisure time. Bars and clubs offer opportunities to try different alcoholic drinks, listen to music, dance, play bar games, and most importantly, socialize and mingle with potential romantic or sexual partners. The atmosphere of bars and clubs also matches the excitement and energy of youth. Frequent visits to bars and clubs at this life stage are a way for young people to forge their identities through shared experiences with peers.   

As people enter their thirties, life changes often involve committed relationships, marriage, and starting families. With these added responsibilities, priorities shift away from nightlife toward family time and household duties. Visiting bars and clubs declines for several reasons. Going out at night becomes more difficult with children, and paying for babysitters is an added expense. Money that might have been spent at bars and clubs is now needed for family essentials. Also, the loud, energetic atmosphere of bars and clubs is less appealing and can be an ordeal when all you want to do is relax after a long day of adulting. The desire to impress peers and find romance is less strong with an established partner. For these reasons, bar and club patronage typically drops substantially during this life stage.

In later life, as people enter their forties and beyond, responsibilities like active parenting decrease and there is more freedom and income. bars and clubs can again become part of the leisure repertoire, but for different reasons than before. As a source of entertainment and social connection, bars and clubs appeal to older adults who may have more solitary lifestyles due to being single, divorced or widowed. The opportunity to get out of the house, listen to music, chat with others, and enjoy some drinks is reinvigorating for those with fewer household demands. However, the late nights and louder environments tend to have less appeal, and more casual bar and pub visits are preferred over busy clubs.

In summary, how we use our leisure time and choose to visit bars and clubs is strongly influenced by our life cycle. Youth frequent bars and clubs to explore independence, build identity and find romance. Adults in their thirties and forties decrease patronage due to responsibilities of committed relationships and parenthood. Older adults return to bars and clubs to combat isolation, reconnect with social life and rediscover a source of enjoyment and entertainment from their youth. Although the specific venues and frequency of visits change across the life cycle, bars and clubs remain a place where we can celebrate life's stages with others.
