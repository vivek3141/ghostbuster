Does globalisation cost job in Britain? 

Globalisation refers to the increasing integration of economies and societies around the world through greater movement of goods, services, capital and people. Over the past few decades, Britain has experienced a steady increase in cross-border flows of trade, foreign direct investment (FDI) and migration. While globalisation is associated with greater economic efficiency and growth, it also brings challenges to the labour market as increased exposure to international competition and migration may reduce job opportunities for domestic workers. This essay examines the impact of globalisation on employment in Britain through analysis of key indicators at both the national and industry levels.

At the national level, Britain has seen continual growth in international trade and FDI inflows in recent decades, indicating increasing global economic integration. From 2000 to 2018, the total value of exports and imports of goods and services increased by over 50% and 70% respectively in real terms. Similarly, annual FDI inflow has more than tripled from US$45 billion in 2000 to US$145 billion in 2018. While trade and FDI expansion have supported economic growth and job creation in exporting and FDI-receiving sectors, they may also have negative impacts on jobs in import-competing and domestically-oriented industries due to international competition.

An increase in global migration flows presents another channel through which globalisation may affect British employment. Net migration to Britain has increased from 48,000 in 1997 to 282,000 in 2016. Migrant workers fill essential jobs and promote economic growth but may also displace domestic workers or reduce their wages in low-skill sectors. A study using multiple regression analysis finds that while immigration has not significantly reduced overall employment rates in Britain, it is correlated with a small decrease in employment of low-skilled domestic workers. 

At the industry level, globalisation appears to have divergent effects on employment across sectors. Industries such as financial services that benefit from global integration through trade and investments have experienced strong job growth. In contrast, manufacturing industries facing major competition from imports and offshoring have declined substantially. According to a report by UK Trade Policy Observatory, globalisation accounted for 40-50% of manufacturing job losses between 1978 and 2009. However, manufacturing job losses were also driven by other factors like technological changes, suggesting globalisation may not be the only driver of declining employment in import-competing industries.

In conclusion, while globalisation has supported economic growth and job creation in Britain, increasing cross-border flows of trade, investment and migration have likely had some adverse impacts on employment, especially for low-skilled domestic workers and in import-competing manufacturing industries. However, the effects seem to be small relative to the overall changes in the British labour market. As globalisation brings both opportunities and challenges, policymakers should adopt measures to expand the benefits of globalisation and provide assistance for workers negatively affected. But reversing globalisation itself is neither practical nor beneficial.
