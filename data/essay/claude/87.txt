The role of Cabinet government in the British political system has clearly declined over time for a number of reasons. The Cabinet, comprising the Prime Minister and other senior ministers, was originally envisioned as the center of executive decision making and the driving force behind policy in the British government. However, its power and influence have gradually weakened due to several factors.

First, the growth of the Prime Minister's power at the expense of the Cabinet has contributed to its decline. As the leader of the majority party in Parliament, Prime Ministers have amassed more control and authority over time. Prime Ministers now have larger staffs and policy units to develop their own agendas, and they dominate Cabinet meetings and deliberations. The PM has also accrued more power over ministerial appointments and reshuffles, using these privileges to consolidate control. The result is that Cabinet ministers owe their positions to the PM and are less able to act as independent power brokers.  

Second, the increasing complexity and technical nature of policy issues has reduced the Cabinet's role. As government has expanded to deal with economic, scientific, and social challenges, policy making has become more specialized. It is difficult for part-time Cabinet ministers to develop expertise across all areas and provide meaningful input and oversight. Much policy development now takes place in departmental ministries, executive agencies, and advisory bodies, with the Cabinet only ratifying decisions already made by technical experts. Its function has become more symbolic than practical.

Third, the Cabinet's decision making power has declined relative to that of Parliament. Parliament, especially the House of Commons, has asserted its authority over all areas of policy through reforms expanding its ability to scrutinize, debate, and vote on government bills. The Cabinet is constrained in the policies it can pursue by the need to maintain the confidence of Parliament. It cannot take unilateral action without securing Parliamentary approval. This limits its power to set the agenda and make bold moves.

In conclusion, the Cabinet's traditional role as the heart of British executive government and policy making has declined substantially. It has lost ground to the Prime Minister, the civil service, and Parliament. However, it still remains symbolically important as the apex of ministerial government and continues to function, albeit in a more limited manner, in deliberating and ratifying policies and maintaining political consensus. Its diminished but enduring role reflects the adaptation of British governance to modern demands while preserving elements of its historical foundations.
