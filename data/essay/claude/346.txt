The transport revolutions in Britain between 1750 and 1860, including the rise of canals, turnpike trusts, and railways, led to significant reductions in transport costs that had major impacts on the economy. However, railways were the most important of these innovations in enabling economic growth due to their larger social savings, more substantial dynamic effects, and stronger forward and backward linkages compared to canals and turnpike trusts. 

Social savings refers to the reduction in costs to society from lower transport expenses, including cheaper goods, more productive workers, and greater mobility. Railways offered substantially larger social savings than canals or turnpike trusts. Railways could transport goods and passengers at a fraction of the cost of canals or roads, enabling cheaper goods for consumers and lower costs of living. The massive expansion of the railway network in Britain between 1830 and 1860 also allowed for much greater mobility of labor, facilitating worker migration to growing industrial cities and boosting labor market efficiency. In contrast, while canals did reduce transport costs compared to roads, they were limited to areas with available waterways and still relatively expensive compared to railways. Turnpike trusts also only modestly improved road quality and transport efficiency.

Beyond social savings, railways also had the strongest dynamic effects on the economy by stimulating complementary investments and economic activity. The spread of railways drove investments in coal and iron production to supply railway construction, as well as machinery and manufacturing to supply railway equipment. They also spurred development around railway lines and stations, boosting real estate values. In contrast, canals had more limited dynamic effects beyond some stimulus for coal and construction. Turnpike trusts had negligible dynamic impacts.

Finally, railways had substantial forward and backward linkages with other industries that strengthened economic growth. Forward linkages refer to demand for inputs, while backward linkages refer to the use of outputs. Railways had strong linkages with the iron and coal industries as suppliers of key inputs. They then transported these raw materials to manufacturers and distributors, creating backward linkages. Railways also transported the finished goods of manufacturers to markets across Britain, further stimulating production. While canals did have some limited forward and backward linkages, turnpike trusts provided negligible linkages beyond local road transport.  

In conclusion, while canals and turnpike trusts did contribute to lower transport costs in Britain between 1750 to 1860, railways were the most significant innovation driving economic growth during this period. Through greater social savings, more powerful dynamic effects, and stronger forward and backward linkages, the rise of railways stimulated substantial economic activity, investment, mobility, trade, production, and demand throughout Britain. Railways proved to be the revolutionary transport technology that enabled rapid industrialization and modern economic growth.
