The aggregate supply (AS) curve depicts the total supply of goods and services in an economy at different price levels. However, the shape and properties of the AS curve differ across major economic schools of thought - Classical, Keynesian, and New Keynesian.

In the Classical model, the AS curve is vertical in the long run. This is because Classical economists assume that wages and prices are fully flexible and markets always clear. Any changes in aggregate demand (AD) will lead to changes in the price level but not the level of output or employment, as supply always adjusts to match demand. In the short run, the AS curve is upward sloping as firms adjust production and wages are "sticky." However, markets eventually equilibrate at the vertical long-run AS curve. 

In contrast, the Keynesian model assumes wages and prices are rigid, and markets often operate below full employment equilibrium. Therefore, the AS curve is horizontal in the long run, indicating any increase in AD leads to increased output and employment, not higher prices. In the short run, the AS curve is also upward sloping. The Keynesian model suggests government policy like increased government spending can stimulate economic growth during downturns.

The New Keynesian model incorporates elements of both Classical and Keynesian models. Like the Keynesian model, wages and prices are rigid in the short run. However, like the Classical model, the New Keynesian model assumes rational agents and eventual market clearing. Therefore, the New Keynesian AS curve is upward sloping in the short run but vertical in the long run. Fiscal and monetary policy can impact output in the short run before inflation results.  

In conclusion, the shape and slope of the AS curve depends on the underlying assumptions in each economic model about wage and price flexibility, market clearing, and rational agents. Government policy has different effects on output, prices, and employment in each model based on these assumptions. The Keynesian and New Keynesian models suggest fiscal and monetary policy can stimulate the economy, at least temporarily, whereas the Classical model suggests policy is neutral with no long-run impact. Overall, the AS curve is a useful way to understand differences between major schools of macroeconomic thought.
