Michel de Montaigne's preface to his Essays establishes a framework for how readers should approach and understand the subsequent chapters in the book. In the preface, Montaigne conveys three key ideas that shape how readers analyze his work.

First, Montaigne frames his essays as "attempts" and "tests" of his judgment, not as definitive or authoritative statements of truth or wisdom. He sees writing as an exploratory process to better understand himself and the world around him. This spirit of open inquiry and skepticism permeates the rest of the Essays. For example, in Chapter 1, "By Diverse Means We Arrive at the Same End," Montaigne muses on the relativity and malleability of customs and moral laws across societies, challenging the notion of any absolute or universal rules. His tentative and questioning tone echoes his message in the preface about the provisional nature of his judgments.  

Second, Montaigne emphasizes in the preface that his project is to portray himself, "simply and candidly," for better or worse. This pledge of radical self-honesty and fidelity to his own experience guides how he structures chapters and selects topics. Many chapters meander through anecdotes and stories from Montaigne's own life before drawing wider conclusions. For instance, in Chapter 3, "Our Affections Carry Themselves Beyond Us," Montaigne begins by reflecting on his relationship with his close friend Etienne de la Bo√©tie to explore friendship and philosophy at large. His own personal loss and grief allow him to expose deeper truths about human bonds and mortality. Montaigne's promise in the preface to depict himself without pretense gives coherence to the work's overall confessional and introspective nature.

Finally, Montaigne characterizes his essays as following his "own whim" and "random inspiration." This signals to readers not to expect a systematic or logical ordering of chapters. Some chapters ponder ethics and the good life, others discuss sleep or the education of children, while still others cover ancient history or New World discoveries. The meandering, unstructured arrangement of topics is consistent with Montaigne's aim to record his raw thoughts as they occur to him. The preface primes the reader for the work's desultory and spontaneous style, jumping between subjects according to the author's whims and digressions.  

In sum, the preface to Montaigne's Essays foreshadows its unconventional form and prepares readers for the exploratory, personal, and haphazard nature of the chapters. By highlighting his modesty of judgment, commitment to self-portraiture, and preference for following his own inclinations, Montaigne sets the interpretive frame through which his essays can be understood and appreciated. The preface shapes readers' understanding by revealing the author's intentions and approach before delving into the wide-ranging topics of each individual chapter.
