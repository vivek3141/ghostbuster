The aim of the experiment was to study the factors affecting the activity of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase as well as to determine the kinetics of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme found in the human body that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphate esters in an alkaline environment. In this experiment, the substrate used was p-nitrophenyl phosphate, which is hydrolyzed into p-nitrophenol and phosphate by alkaline phosphatase.

Three factors were studied that can affect enzyme activity: pH, temperature, and product inhibition. Enzyme activity depends on the pH of the solution because enzymes have an optimal pH range where their structure is most stable and catalytic activity is highest. Outside this range, the enzyme structure and activity are compromised. Temperature also affects activity because at higher temperatures, molecular motion increases which can denature the enzyme structure. However, within an optimal temperature range, enzyme activity will increase with temperature due to increased molecular collisions and reaction rates. Finally, product inhibition occurs when the products of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction bind to the active site and inhibit further activity. 

Enzyme kinetics were studied to determine the effects of substrate concentration on the rate of product formation. By measuring the absorbance of p-nitrophenol over time at different substrate concentrations, a kinetic curve could be constructed to show how reaction rate depends on substrate concentration. The kinetic parameters Michaelis constant (Km) and maximum reaction rate (Vmax) were calculated from the kinetic curve. Km indicates the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of Vmax and represents the affinity of an enzyme for its substrate. A lower Km indicates higher affinity. Vmax represents the reaction rate when the enzyme active sites are saturated with substrate.

From the results of this experiment, the optimal pH for alkaline phosphatase was found to be around 9 to 10, the optimal temperature was around 40°C, and high concentrations of product (p-nitrophenol) were found to inhibit enzyme activity indicating product inhibition. The kinetic curve showed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics and allowed for the calculation of the kinetic parameters. Km was found to be 0.25mmol and Vmax was 0.017mmol/min indicating alkaline phosphatase has a high affinity for p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate. 

In summary, this experiment studied how pH, temperature, and product inhibition can affect the activity of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase. Enzyme kinetics were analyzed by measuring reaction rates at different substrate concentrations and constructing a kinetic curve to determine important kinetic parameters Km and Vmax which provide information about an enzyme’s affinity for its substrate and maximum reaction rate. The results give insight into the optimal conditions and kinetics of alkaline phosphatase.
