The concept of inversion has been fundamental to understanding elliptic integrals and complex functions. Inversion, in mathematical terms, refers to the process of transforming one function into its inverse function. For elliptic integrals, inversion produces a new class of functions that are periodic, unlike the original elliptic integral. These periodic functions, known as Jacobian elliptic functions, paved the way for many discoveries in complex analysis.  

Elliptic integrals are functions that calculate the arc length of an ellipse. They were first studied in detail by eighteenth-century mathematicians like Leonhard Euler and Adrien-Marie Legendre. While exploring these integrals, Abel and Jacobi made the key discovery that by inverting the elliptic integral of the first kind, they obtained a new function with period 4K(m) that was double-periodic. This was a groundbreaking finding that revealed a whole new class of periodic functions. These periodic functions are the Jacobian elliptic functions, named in honor of Karl Jacobi.

The Jacobian elliptic functions have properties analogous to the circular trigonometric functions like sine and cosine. But unlike the trigonometric functions, the elliptic functions have two periods. This makes them quasi-periodic rather than strictly periodic. The discovery of these quasi-periodic functions was a major milestone that demonstrated periodicity could exist for non-circular geometries. It paved the way for mathematicians to construct other quasi-periodic functions, which have since been used to model a wide range of phenomena in physics, engineering, and beyond.

The inversion technique that produced the elliptic functions also turned out to be fundamental for studying other complex functions and integrals. In the nineteenth century, mathematicians used inversion to explore functions like the Riemann zeta function, theta functions, and Abelian integrals. These investigations led to many of the theories of complex analysis that remain central to mathematics today. Concepts such as analytic continuation, conformal mapping, and Riemann surfaces all grew out of studies involving inversion of elliptic and related functions.  

In summary, the discovery of inversion and its application to elliptic integrals opened up an entire field of new periodic and quasi-periodic functions. These functions provided a foundation for many key ideas in complex analysis. Inversion proved to be a simple but profoundly consequential technique that gave mathematicians a tool for finding connections between families of functions and gaining deep insights into their properties. Its impact on mathematics in the centuries since has been broad and enduring.
