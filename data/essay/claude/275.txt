The stakeholder model of corporate social responsibility considers the interests of all stakeholders affected by a company's operations, including employees, customers, suppliers, and the local community. This is in contrast to the shareholder model which primarily focuses on maximizing shareholder wealth. For companies like Nestle, adopting a stakeholder model for addressing social responsibility issues can help build a more ethical and sustainable business that benefits both shareholders and other stakeholders in the long run.

Nestle is one of the world's largest food and beverage companies, but it has faced numerous controversies over the years related to its corporate governance and corporate social responsibility practices. By primarily focusing on shareholder interests, Nestle has made decisions that negatively impacted other stakeholders and received widespread public criticism as a result. For example, in the 1970s, Nestle was criticized for misleading mothers in less developed countries into using infant formula instead of breastfeeding, which led to illnesses and deaths among infants. Nestle was slow to respond to these concerns, prioritizing sales over social responsibility. 

More recently, Nestle has faced criticism over its bottled water operations, including concerns about plastic pollution, unjustified water rates, and damage to natural environments. Nestle's chairman has even stated that access to water is not a human right, demonstrating the company's narrow focus on profits over other stakeholder interests. However, Nestle has started to shift to a more stakeholder-focused model in some areas in response to these ongoing controversies. For example, Nestle now discloses results of human rights impact assessments, has specific policies and oversight mechanisms for upholding human rights, and has set new environmental sustainability goals like making 100% of its packaging recyclable by 2025.

Adopting a stakeholder approach to corporate social responsibility has significant benefits for companies over the long term. For Nestle, addressing stakeholder interests like local communities, the environment, and public advocacy groups has helped begin rebuilding its reputation and trust in its brands. Considering all stakeholders leads to more ethical and sustainable decision making that ensures the company's long term viability. Companies that only focus on shareholders often make short sighted decisions that ultimately damage their reputation, growth and bottom line. For these reasons, the stakeholder model is superior for addressing most companiesâ€™ social responsibilities compared to the shareholder model. Overall, Nestle still has a long way to go, but its steps toward a stakeholder model provide an encouraging example of how companies can change for the better.
