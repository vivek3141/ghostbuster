Compassion lies at the heart of Schopenhauer's moral philosophy and plays a key role in his conception of the ethical ideal. For Nietzsche, however, compassion is at best an ineffective virtue and at worst a harmful weakness. Nietzche mounts a forceful critique of the central role Schopenhauer gives to compassion, arguing that it inhibits human greatness and excellence. An analysis of Schopenhauer's and Nietzsche's views on compassion reveals stark contrasts in their moral philosophies.

For Schopenhauer, compassion is "the basis of all genuine virtue, and its indispensable condition" (BM 202). Compassion – which Schopenhauer defines as sympathizing with the suffering of others as if it were our own – is an expression of one's metaphysical unity with all things. Because individuals are fundamentally one in the underlying Will of the world, we are able to feel the suffering of others as our own. Compassion thus stems from a correct apprehension of one's metaphysical identity and leads one to morality. As Schopenhauer writes, "compassion for the suffering of others arises from the consciousness of the whole, the One Will, with which we ourselves, as well as everything living, are identical" (BM 201-2). Compassion, then, is necessary for virtue and founded on metaphysical truths about ultimate reality. 

In contrast, Nietzsche argues that compassion "depresses us, and thereby robs us of strength precisely at the moment when most strength is needed" (D 37). He sees compassion as an expression of kindness that takes the powerful form of pity. Nietzsche argues that pity is a predominantly negative emotion tied to notions like equality, suffering, and weakness. Pity sees suffering everywhere and gives rise to feelings of powerlessness and depression. Compassion born of pity leads one to exclaim, "Life is suffering, life is sad!" (D 53). Rather than motivate human excellence as Schopenhauer claims, Nietzsche argues that compassion ultimately enfeebles individuals and societies by fostering a pessimistic outlook that sees life as essentially sorrowful and pitiful.

In conclusion, while compassion lies at the heart of Schopenhauer's moral philosophy, Nietzsche roundly rejects Schopenhauer's elevation of compassion. Schopenhauer sees compassion as foundational for virtue and stemming from one's metaphysical identity with all beings. Nietzsche argues compassion arises from pity, robs one of strength, fosters pessimism, and inhibits human excellence. Their opposing views on compassion reflect the radical differences in their moral philosophies overall. For Schopenhauer compassion leads to virtue; for Nietzsche it leads to weakness.
