Schopenhauer's philosophy is centered on the notion of an inherent will that serves as the ultimate metaphysical substrate of the phenomenal world. For Schopenhauer, the will is the inner driving force behind all of reality and existence. It is the blind, aimless striving that propels all of life and animates all of nature. The will is intended to both ground the diversity of individual phenomena in an ultimate unity and provide a limit to the knowable universe that contains it.  

There are two main difficulties in grasping Schopenhauer's concept of the will. The first is that the will itself cannot be directly known or represented since we only have knowledge of phenomena, not the underlying inner essence of things. The will is intended to explain phenomena, not be one itself. The second difficulty is the ambiguity in Schopenhauer's notion of the will, which is described in conflicting ways. At times, the will seems to be a kind of vital life force, at other times a mindless metaphysical principle of endless striving and dissatisfaction.

For Schopenhauer, we can gain knowledge of the will indirectly through intuition, not reason. We know the will through inward self-reflection and recognizing our own aimless striving, desires and dissatisfactions. We also recognize the will externally in nature, in the endlessly struggle for survival and reproduction. The will is most directly known in our own lived experience of willing and striving. Through denying the illusory principle of sufficient reason in ourselves, we can achieve a kind of mystical insight into the will as the essence of all reality.  

Schopenhauer's vision of the world as unity is based on overcoming the illusion of individuality and recognizing that there is only one will at the heart of all phenomena. For Schopenhauer, the world as representation is fragmented into a plurality of distinct objects and subjects because our intellect carves up the continuous flow of perception into individual things. But through recognizing the will in ourselves and nature, we can gain a kind of insight into the ultimate oneness beyond representations. All manifestations of the will—in ourselves, in nature, in all things—are just the objectification of the same blind striving.

Schopenhauer argues we can achieve this insight primarily through two means: experiencing our own bodily nature and suppressing our conscious ends or aims. By recognizing ourselves merely as natural beings through experiencing things like willing, movement and bodily drives, we can gain insight into the will that animates all of nature. By suspending our personal desires, aims and wants, we can achieve a kind of disinterested intuitive insight into the endless striving of the will as a metaphysical principle beyond all individual manifestations.Through these paths, we can reach Schopenhauer’s vision of the world as unity, as will, beyond the principum individuationis. Overall, Schopenhauer's concept of the will serves as the linchpin of his philosophy, grounding his metaphysics, epistemology and ethics.
