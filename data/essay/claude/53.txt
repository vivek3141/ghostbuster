Research into the cognitive development of specific concepts can be incorporated into the primary school science curriculum by focusing lessons and activities on concepts that align with students' developmental abilities at different ages. This approach may be more appropriate than the age-centric, domain general approach advocated by Piaget that relies on broad stages of cognitive readiness. 

Recent research has identified the specific ages at which children develop an understanding of foundational science concepts like gravity, matter, living things, and more. For example, children do not fully grasp the idea that the volume of a substance remains the same despite changes in shape until ages 9-10. Five- and 6-year-olds start to understand living things have life cycles, but do not fully understand reproduction until age 8. This research can inform the sequence and content of science lessons to align with students' cognitive abilities.

Focusing science lessons on concepts that match students' developmental stages is more appropriate for primary school aged children than relying on Piaget's broad stages of development. Piaget proposed that children progress through four discrete stages: sensorimotor (0-2 years), preoperational (2-7 years), concrete operational (7-11 years) and formal operational (11 years and up). In each stage, he argued children's thinking is constrained in universal ways. However, modern research shows cognitive development progresses at different rates across domains. Children may reach concrete operational thinking in some domains, like logic or spatial skills, earlier or later than in other domains.  

Tying science lessons to research on concept development acknowledges these differences and supports students' learning in an individualized way. For example, lessons on living things could focus on life cycles with 5- and 6-year-olds but progress to reproduction and inheritance with 8- and 9-year-olds. While 7-year-olds may struggle with density and floatation, they are ready to understand basic forces like gravity acting on objects. Adjusting activities and explanations to students' developmental levels within a domain, instead of relying on broad stages, helps ensure lessons are engaging, comprehensible and build on prior knowledge.

In summary, primary school science curricula should incorporate research on concept development by aligning lessons and activities with students' cognitive abilities at different ages. This approach helps students construct knowledge in an individualized way rather than assuming all children of the same age are in the same broad stage of cognitive development. Activities geared toward the developmental level of understanding for specific concepts will support student learning more so than a strictly age-based curriculum. This research-based approach should replace or supplement the age-centric model advocated by Piaget.
