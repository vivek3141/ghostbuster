Kayano Shigeru's book 'Our Land Was A Forest' provides both positive and negative aspects in its attempt to create empathy for the Ainu people and share their culture and experiences. On the positive side, the book provides a first-hand account of Ainu life from the perspective of Kayano, who was born into an Ainu family in Hokkaido. Kayano shares intimate details of Ainu rituals, beliefs, and daily life, including stories of fishing, hunting, and food preparation. This helps to vividly bring Ainu culture to life for readers and give a sense of their deep connection to nature and the land. 

However, the book has some limitations in fully achieving Kayano's aims. Firstly, the book focuses primarily on Kayano's early life, covering only up until his teenage years. As such, it provides a rather narrow window into Ainu life and culture. The book would have benefitted from spanning more of Kayano's lifetime and the broader arc of Ainu history in the 20th century. Secondly, Kayano's writing style is rather straightforward and journalistic. While this makes the book accessible to a wide audience, it reduces its ability to provide a deeply empathetic account of the Ainu experience. A more poetic or literary style may have better conveyed the emotional depths of what Kayano and his community endured.

Overall, 'Our Land Was A Forest' is a valuable introduction to Ainu culture and way of life, as told by an insider's voice. However, its aims in creating empathy are only partly achieved due to its limited scope and journalistic style. To gain a fuller understanding of the Ainu people, it should be read alongside other historical accounts and resources. While Kayano's book helps bring awareness to this marginalized group, a single work cannot comprehensively capture the diversity of Ainu experiences and the injustices they faced under Japanese colonization. To that end, Kayano's book should be seen as a starting point, not an end point, for exploring Ainu history and building empathy for their cause.

In summary, the book has clear positives in its first-hand depiction of Ainu life, but certain limitations in scope and style prevent it from fully achieving a deep empathy for the Ainu people. To create more comprehensive understanding, it should be supplemented with additional resources and accounts. On balance, however, 'Our Land Was A Forest' serves as a valuable and accessible introduction to an important but often overlooked people.
