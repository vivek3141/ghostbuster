The futurist movement emerged in 20th-century Italy with the goal of revitalizing culture and challenging people's conventional ways of seeing and thinking. Central to the futurist vision was a rejection of the past and an embrace of technology, speed, and dynamism. The futurists sought to create an art that captured the experience of modern life. They believed that traditional art forms like painting and sculpture were out of touch with the fast pace and revolutionary spirit of the machine age.

In order to achieve their vision, the futurists developed new performance innovations that aimed to break down the divide between art and life and radically transform audience experience. They wanted audiences to feel the energy, passion, and aggression that the futurists felt were essential to modern experience. Three key innovations were: parole in libertà or “words in freedom;” serate futuriste or "Futurist evenings;" and manifestos as a performative act.

Parole in libertà was a new poetic form developed by futurist F.T. Marinetti meant to liberate words from the constraints of syntax and grammar. The result was a dynamic, chaotic form meant to mirror the associations and rhythms of the mind. Marinetti and others would recite poems in this style at Futurist evenings, performing them with a theatrical flair and energy meant to shock and energize audiences. 

The serate futuriste or Futurist evenings were multimedia events incorporating visual art, poetry, music, dance, and more. They were highly interactive and aimed to bombard audiences with Futurist ideas. Audiences might be provoked, insulted, or sprayed with perfume. The futurists wanted to elicit visceral reactions and leave a lasting impression.

Futurist manifestos themselves were also a performative act. With their aggressive and confrontational style, the manifestos were meant not just to proclaim Futurist ideas but also to shock readers and generate reaction. The manifestos used expressive typography and bombastic language to convey the rebellious spirit of Futurism. They were an essential part of the Futurist desire to provoke a revolution in thought and culture.

In conclusion, the Futurists aimed to revitalize culture through performance and dynamism. Their innovative performances were meant to free audiences from the burden of tradition and immerse them in the spirit of modernity that the futurists championed. Through their performances, the futurists brought art and life together with the goal of transforming both.
