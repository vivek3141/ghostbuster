The minority rights of Anglophones in Quebec have a complex historical and legal context. Historically, Quebec was founded as a French colony and the majority of its population were French speakers. However, following the British conquest of New France in 1760, Quebec came under British rule. The Quebec Act of 1774 established French civil law and the right to practice the Catholic faith, but English became the official language of government. This created a French-speaking majority but legally enshrined the rights of an English-speaking minority.

In the 1960s, the Quebec sovereignty movement sought to affirm the distinct French identity of Quebec. The Official Languages Act of 1969 made French the official language of Quebec. The Charter of the French Language in 1977 further restricted the use of English, making French the primary language of education, work, and commerce. These laws privileged the rights of the French-speaking majority but limited the minority rights of Anglophones. The Anglophone minority argued that these laws violated their constitutional rights to free expression and threatened their cultural and linguistic heritage.  

The theory of consociational democracy, whereby power is shared by groups to protect minority rights, has been examined in this context. Legal rulings have upheld the use of the notwithstanding clause to override certain Anglophone rights, but also affirmed rights to English education and bilingual commercial signs. The United Nations Human Rights Committee ruled in Ballantyne (1993) that some Quebec language laws violated freedom of expression. Domestically, Ford (1991) upheld the right to English education. Internationally, Quebecâ€™s language policies have been criticized, but Quebec argues it must protect French in North America.

There are challenges in balancing the rights of the French-speaking majority and Anglophone minority. Legal rulings have been inconsistent, and there is no consensus on the appropriate balance of rights. Solutions could include constitutional amendments to more clearly define language rights, pursuing asymmetrical federalism where Quebec has more autonomy over language, or further decentralizing power to regional governments. Protecting both Anglophone and Francophone cultures while uniting Quebec remains complex with no simple answers. Overall, the minority rights of Anglophones must be understood in the historical context of Quebec's French identity and tensions between majority and minority language rights.
