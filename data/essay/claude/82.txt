The aims of the experiment were to determine the subcellular location of the succinate dehydrogenase enzyme within liver cells. Succinate dehydrogenase is an enzyme that plays an important role in cellular respiration and the Krebs cycle. By determining which organelles and compartments within the liver cell contain this enzyme, scientists can better understand how cellular respiration works. 

To investigate the distribution of succinate dehydrogenase, researchers first had to separate the liver cells into different fractions containing specific subcellular compartments. This was done through a process of differential centrifugation, using centrifuges at varying speeds. The slower speeds isolated the larger cell fractions like nuclei, while faster speeds separated the smaller mitochondria and microsomes. By analyzing which fractions contained high levels of succinate dehydrogenase enzyme activity, the researchers could identify which organelles housed the enzyme.

The results of these experiments showed that succinate dehydrogenase was primarily located in the mitochondria, the organelles responsible for generating ATP through cellular respiration. Detecting high levels of the enzyme within the mitochondrial fraction confirmed the key role mitochondria play in cellular energy production. Minimal enzyme activity was detected in the microsomal fraction, indicating succinate dehydrogenase is not primarily located within this cell compartment. 

Determining the subcellular location of enzymes has many commercial applications. For example, if a pharmaceutical company is developing a new drug meant to target a specific enzyme like succinate dehydrogenase, knowing exactly where that enzyme resides within the cell will help in designing the drug to reach that target. Localizing the enzyme also provides more details about the biochemical pathways it is involved in, which can inform what factors may influence the activity or regulation of that enzyme. This can open up more avenues for further research and development.

In summary, the experiment aimed to determine where succinate dehydrogenase is located within liver cells by fractionating the cells into distinct compartments and measuring enzyme activity within each fraction. The results identified the mitochondria as the primary location, confirming its key role in cellular respiration. Pinpointing the subcellular location of enzymes has commercial applications in drug development by identifying targets and pathways that could be impacted. Overall, the experiment provides valuable details about how this vital cellular process works.
