Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive method for monitoring a person's oxygen saturation level in the blood (called SpO2). A pulse oximeter device uses a sensor to measure the level of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood to determine blood oxygen levels. It does this by shining light through the skin and measuring the amount of light absorbed. Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin absorb different wavelengths of light, so the pulse oximeter can calculate the oxygen saturation based on the amounts of red and infrared light absorbed.   

Pulse oximetry has become a widely used monitoring tool for many medical applications. It is used extensively in hospitals, emergency response settings, and home healthcare. Some of the major applications of pulse oximetry include monitoring patients under anesthesia during surgery, monitoring lung function and respiratory conditions like COPD or asthma, diagnosing and monitoring oxygen levels for conditions like pneumonia or heart failure, and monitoring oxygen levels in newborn babies. Pulse oximetry is noninvasive, inexpensive, and provides real-time measurement of blood oxygen levels which is why it has become so useful.

However, pulse oximetry does have some limitations. It cannot directly measure the amount of oxygen in the blood, only the level of oxygenated hemoglobin. Conditions like carbon monoxide poisoning or certain medication overdoses can disrupt the oxygen-hemoglobin relationship and provide false pulse oximetry readings. Pulse oximetry also provides limited information about a patient's respiratory status or acid levels in the blood. It only measures oxygen levels, so other tests are needed for a full patient assessment.

Advances in pulse oximetry are focused on providing more sophisticated monitoring over longer durations. New wireless and wearable pulse oximeter devices can provide continuous long-term monitoring which may be useful for managing chronic respiratory or heart conditions. Pulse oximeters are also being integrated into multi-parameter monitors that can track other vital signs like blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate. These advances will expand the applications of pulse oximetry for remote patient monitoring and mobile healthcare.

To compare different pulse oximeter devices, an experiment can be conducted with human subjects at rest and during exercise. Multiple pulse oximeters are attached to the subjects and SpO2 readings are recorded at rest and during increasing levels of exercise intensity. The readings from different devices can then be compared to determine accuracy and look for variations in the results. This type of experiment highlights any differences in performance between devices during stable conditions and conditions where blood oxygen levels are changing. The accuracy, precision, and response times of the devices can be evaluated to determine which pulse oximeter provides the most reliable measurements, especially during dynamic changes in oxygen levels.
