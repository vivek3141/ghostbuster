The rise of professional medicine in 18th-century Britain reinforced existing class and gender divisions in society, restricting women's autonomy over their health and bodies. As medicine became a recognized profession during the Enlightenment, it adopted the dominant ideology that women were inferior and subordinate to men, both intellectually and physically. The medical field was dominated by elite, university-educated men, while most women had little access to medical knowledge or training. This gendered hierarchy was reinforced through the discourse of medicine itself, which portrayed women as weak, emotional creatures prone to disease and hysteria.

Within the medical field, women were treated as second-class citizens. They were barred from attending medical schools or becoming licensed physicians. Midwifery was one of the only medical roles open to women, but even midwives faced restrictions and were subordinated under male physicians and surgeons. Most women had to rely on male doctors for treatment, but the cost often prevented working-class women from accessing physicians at all. The lack of medical knowledge among women made them dependent on men and vulnerable to exploitation or mistreatment by physicians. 

The medical literature of the time reinforced notions of women's inferiority. Women were portrayed as ruled by their reproductive systems, and conditions like "hysteria" were seen as uniquely feminine maladies caused by the uterus or excessive emotion. Menstruation and pregnancy were also pathologized. Such theories were used to justify the exclusion of women from education and professions requiring rational thought. They also contributed to the victimization of women within medicine, as radical or traumatic "treatments" like bloodletting, purging, and forced confinement were often applied to overcome women's "unnatural" conditions.

In conclusion, the rise of professional medicine in Enlightenment Britain affirmed the subordinate role of women in society and resulted in their widespread mistreatment and victimization within the medical field. Through its male-dominated hierarchy, its discourse of women's bodies as inherently defective, and its oppressive treatment regimens, medicine functioned as an instrument of control that denied women autonomy and agency over their own health and reproduction. The consequences were grave inequality in health care and outcomes between men and women that would persist for centuries to come.
