Exercise treatment alone versus exercise treatment with the use of a resting hand splint in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis of the hand in maintaining or increasing range of movement and muscle strength

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the joints and other tissues of the body. In the hand, RA can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness, limiting range of motion and grip strength. Exercise and splinting are two common treatments for RA of the hand, but there is debate about whether exercise alone or the combination of exercise and splinting is more effective. 

Exercise, such as finger stretches and strengthening exercises, has been shown to benefit hand function in people with RA. Exercise helps maintain flexibility and muscle strength, and can slow the progression of deformities. Multiple studies have found that exercise programs lead to improvements in range of motion, dexterity, and grip strength. For example, a 2015 study evaluated an 8-week exercise program focusing on finger range of motion and strengthening exercises in 20 people with RA of the hand. The researchers found significant improvements in range of motion in all measured joints, as well as a 15% increase in grip strength.

While exercise is effective, the addition of splinting may provide further benefits. Splints are rigid or soft devices that support and immobilize the joints. They are thought to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, prevent or slow joint damage, and complement the effects of exercise. A 2003 study compared the effects of hand exercises, a volar resting hand splint, and the combination of both in 60 people with RA over 12 months. The combination group showed the greatest improvement in range of motion and grip strength. 

However, some studies have found little or no difference with the addition of splinting. A 2008 systematic review evaluating 10 studies on the use of resting hand splints found insufficient evidence to determine whether splinting provides additional benefit over exercise alone. Similarly, a 2014 study found no significant differences in hand function between 20 RA patients who exercised with a resting splint and 20 patients who exercised without a splint over 6 weeks.

In summary, while exercise is essential for maintaining and improving hand function in rheumatoid arthritis, the evidence is mixed on whether the additional use of resting hand splints provides further meaningful benefits, especially over the long run. Exercise alone can significantly improve range of motion and strength, however, for some patients splinting may provide added pain relief and prevent deformities. Given the variable nature of RA, the combination approach may suit certain patients better depending on disease severity and personal preferences. Patients should discuss the options with their rheumatologist and occupational therapist to develop an effective customized treatment plan.
