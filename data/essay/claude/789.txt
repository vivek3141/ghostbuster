Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers in the brain that transmit signals between neurons. They are essential for communication between neurons and enabling a range of brain functions and behaviors. Neurotransmitters are stored in vesicles in the axon terminal of a neuron. When an electrical signal travels down a neuron's axon and reaches the axon terminal, it triggers the vesicles to fuse with the cell membrane and release the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft, the small space between neurons. 

The released neurotransmitters then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to receptor proteins on the dendrite of the next neuron. These receptors act as "locks" that fit specific neurotransmitter "keys." When a neurotransmitter binds to a receptor, it activates the receptor, which in turn activates a signal in the next neuron. The signal is either excitatory, increasing the chance that the next neuron will fire an electrical signal, or inhibitory, decreasing the chance of the next neuron firing. Different neurotransmitters have different effects - some are excitatory, some inhibitory, and some both depending on the type of receptor.

Once the neurotransmitters have bound to receptors and activated the next neuron, they are cleared from the synaptic cleft by reabsorption into the neuron that released them, a process called reuptake, or by enzymes that break them down. This clearing resets the system so that the next electrical signal will again trigger the release of fresh neurotransmitters. 

The effects of many drugs involve influencing levels of neurotransmitters. There are several ways drugs can act on neurotransmitter systems. Agonists directly activate neurotransmitter receptors, mimicking the effects of the natural neurotransmitter. Antagonists block neurotransmitter receptors, inhibiting the effects of the natural neurotransmitter. Reuptake inhibitors block the reabsorption of neurotransmitters into the releasing neuron, increasing the levels of the neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. Enzyme inhibitors block the enzymes that break down neurotransmitters, also increasing their levels in the synaptic cleft.

Drugs can be delivered to the brain and body in several ways. Systematic routes of drug delivery include oral, sublingual, rectal, inhalation, transdermal, intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous. Oral delivery (ingestion) is the most common but has slow and uneven absorption. Intravenous delivery (injection into the vein) has fast and complete absorption but is invasive. Transdermal (applied to the skin) and inhalation methods are non-invasive but absorption can be difficult to control. The route of delivery determines a drug's speed of action and the levels of the drug that can be achieved in the brain and body.

In summary, neurotransmitters are essential for communication between neurons. They relay signals across synapses that activate receptors to continue conveying information in the brain. Many drugs achieve their effects by interacting with neurotransmitter systems through various mechanisms and routes of systematic delivery. Understanding neurotransmitters and their complex interactions with drugs is key to understanding brain function and pharmacology.
