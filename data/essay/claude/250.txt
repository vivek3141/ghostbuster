Georg Simmel, a German sociologist writing in the early 20th century, argued that the modern metropolis produced a distinct urban way of life and mode of interaction that was unique to the era. In his essay "The Metropolis and Mental Life," Simmel describes the sensibility of the modern city as one marked by alienation, indifference, and a blasé outlook resulting from the overstimulation of the senses. 

For Simmel, pre-modern life was characterized by predominantly rural, agrarian societies where most social interactions were face-to-face, personalized, and governed by strong social controls and close-knit ties between individuals. In contrast, the modern metropolis was defined by an absence of these familiar social controls, as city dwellers encountered huge numbers of strangers and a diversity of cultural influences in a relatively close space. This physical proximity combined with social distance led to new forms of autonomy and individuation in the metropolis. However, it also produced feelings of estrangement and a blasé attitude as a coping mechanism.

Simmel argues that in order to navigate the metropolis and encounter so many strangers in public, city dwellers developed a blasé sensibility - a form of distance and indifference to one's surroundings as an adaptation to the overstimulation of external impressions and events. This blasé outlook is a mode of self-preservation against the threatening fluctuations and instability of metropolitan life. It grants one a degree of inner composure and comfort, even as external interactions are more fleeting and impersonal. For Simmel, this blasé mentality both liberates and anesthetizes the individual.  

Simmel's work has been criticized for its implicit assumptions about pre-modern life and its overgeneralization of the metropolitan experience. His arguments have also been seen as overly subjective accounts that ignored wider social structures. However, many contemporary sociologists have supported Simmel's central arguments and further demonstrated how urban environments shape social relationships and individual psychology. Studies of "urban overload" show how overpopulation and proximity negatively influence well-being and social trust. Research on the "stranger society" similarly highlights how anonymity and diversity in cities relate to more individualistic values and looser social ties. On the whole, Simmel's analysis of the distinctive qualities of metropolitan life and their impact on human relationships and culture remains highly relevant today, despite the limitations of his methodology and historical context.
