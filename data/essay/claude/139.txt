The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, approved by the French National Assembly in 1789, was one of the most significant documents to emerge from the French Revolution. It established basic human rights and principles for the postwar French nation and sought to reform French society according to Enlightenment ideals of equality, freedom, and justice. 

The Declaration articulated for the first time in French history a vision of basic rights and equality for all citizens under the law. It proclaimed that "men are born and remain free and equal in rights" and that these rights are "liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression." In a direct repudiation of the Ancien Regime's system of privileges for the aristocracy and Catholic Church, the Declaration stated "all citizens, being equal in the eyes of the law, are equally eligible to all dignities and places of public administration, according to their abilities, and without any other distinction than that of their virtues and talents." This articulated a radically new idea of equal opportunity based on merit rather than birth.

The Declaration also affirmed key civil liberties and protections that did not exist under the absolute monarchy of Louis XVI. It guaranteed rights to property, free speech, freedom of religion, presumption of innocence, and protection against cruel punishment. No one could be arrested or imprisoned without legal justification, and all citizens had the right to a fair trial by a jury of their peers. The Declaration thus shifted power away from the arbitrary rule of the king toward the rule of law.  

In practice, the Declaration did not extend equal rights to all in French society, notably women and people of color in France's colonies. However, its vision of basic rights and equality before the law fueled the ambitions of marginalized groups who fought for greater democracy and representation. The Declaration inspired other democratic constitutions around the world and today remains an iconic statement of the democratic values of the Enlightenment.

The Declaration of the Rights of Man was a pivotal moment in the French Revolution. It articulated for the first time the revolutionary ideal that all citizens have equal rights and liberties under the law. It aimed to remake French society according to principles of democratic justice and human rights that continue to shape democracies around the world today. Though imperfect, its impact on the course of human freedom has been profound.
