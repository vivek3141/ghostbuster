Dual diagnosis, or co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders, is highly prevalent among mental health service users in the UK and US. Estimates indicate that over 50% of individuals with severe mental illness also meet criteria for a substance use disorder. This high prevalence represents a major challenge for mental health and addiction services. Dual diagnosis is associated with poorer outcomes, increased risk of homelessness, incarceration, and health problems. However, the most effective interventions for addressing dual diagnosis remain debated.

A systematic review of studies across Western Europe, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand found a lifetime prevalence rate of dual diagnosis of 37% among individuals with psychotic disorders. In the UK, studies report rates between 35-50% for individuals with severe mental illness. Comparable rates have been found in US studies. A large US study found 47% of individuals with schizophrenia also met criteria for an alcohol or substance use disorder. These high rates indicate dual diagnosis should not be an “unexpected finding” but is rather the norm among many mental health populations.

Dual diagnosis is associated with significantly worse outcomes compared to single disorders. A UK study found dual diagnosis patients had higher hospitalization rates, more total hospital days, and higher risk of compulsory treatment compared to patients with mental illness only.  Dual diagnosis also increases the risk of incarceration, homelessness, medical problems, self-harm and suicidal behavior. A US study found a threefold increase in risk of death for individuals with dual schizophrenia and substance use disorders compared to schizophrenia alone. The poorer outcomes associated with dual diagnosis place a high burden on healthcare systems and society.

Despite recognition of the impact and prevalence of dual diagnosis, consensus on effective treatment approaches has been elusive. The debate centers around whether sequential or parallel treatment of the mental health and substance use disorders is more effective. Sequential treatment, where one disorder is prioritized and stabilized before the other, has been the traditional approach but has been criticized as less effective in addressing the intertwined nature of dual diagnosis. Integrated or parallel approaches combine both addiction and mental health treatment, but evidence for superior outcomes is mixed.   

A UK randomized control trial compared an integrated motivational intervention, Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT), to treatment as usual for dual diagnosis patients. While the integrated approach led to better substance use outcomes at 12 months, no differences were found in symptoms, quality of life or hospitalization. The authors conclude integrated treatments may only convey “small benefits” for some outcomes. In contrast, a US study found an integrated dual diagnosis program reduced substance use and improved functioning compared to standard care. Qualitative studies also suggest patients prefer integrated care models that address both their mental health and addiction in a coordinated way.

In summary, dual diagnosis is highly prevalent but associated with poorer outcomes and places major burdens on healthcare systems. Although integrated treatment approaches show promise, evidence for their superior effectiveness over traditional sequential approaches is mixed. More high-quality research is needed to determine how best to organize and deliver services for this complex population with multiple inter-related needs in order to improve both mental health and addiction outcomes, and relieve burdens on the overall healthcare system. Ongoing development and  evaluation of both new and existing integrated programs and interventions is still required to address this ongoing and significant public health issue.
