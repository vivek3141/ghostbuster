In her ethnography "Nightwork: Sexuality, Pleasure and Corporate Masculinity in a Tokyo Hostess Club", Anne Allison analyzes several aspects of Japanese society in the 1990s. She focuses especially on the intersecting topics of family life, work and leisure, and gender roles. 

One of the main themes Allison explores is the relationship between work and family in Japan. She observes how Japanese salarymen frequently spend long hours at the office and hostess clubs, to the detriment of their family lives at home. Their jobs require long overtime hours and socializing with clients and coworkers after work, meaning they often do not return home until late at night. As a result, their family roles are subordinated to their corporate responsibilities. Their wives are left largely alone in the domestic sphere to manage the household and raise children.

Allison also examines concepts of work, leisure and pleasure in Japanese society. For the salarymen, their time at hostess clubs blurs the boundaries between work and leisure. Although they are socializing for pleasure, their patronage of hostess clubs is tied to corporate rituals and obligations. The excess and lavish entertainment of the bubble economy period in Japan enabled and encouraged such spending at hostess clubs. However, this "work hard, play hard" mentality came at the cost of time with family and in some cases financial troubles.

Finally, Allison's ethnography focuses on gender roles and the objectification of women in Japan. The hostesses she interviews express the sentiment that they feel like "things" to be consumed by men. The primarily male clients of the hostess clubs largely view the hostesses as sexual objects used to facilitate pleasure and cater to their demands. The patriarchal system in Japan situates women in the domestic sphere and as objects of desire for men. The hostess role, while well-paid, continues this subordination of women to please and serve men. 

In conclusion, Allison's ethnography presents critical insights into family life, work and leisure, and gender in Japanese society. Her analyses highlight both the tensions as well as deep interconnections between these central aspects of culture in Japan during a pivotal time of economic development and societal change. Overall, she paints a picture of a patriarchal society coming to terms with capitalism, ge
