Al-Baqarah A.M Fyzee's 1965 article "The Muslim Law  of Divorce" aims to provide a comprehensive yet balanced overview of the Islamic laws and principles concerning divorce. The primary focus of Fyzee's analysis is to educate readers about the correct laws and procedures of divorce according to early Islamic jurists, while also acknowledging some of the problematic practices that have arisen. 

Fyzee examines three main categories of divorce in his analysis: talaq, or repudiation of the wife by the husband; khul ́, or redemption by the wife through payment of compensation; and judicial divorce ordered by a qadi or Muslim judge. Fyzee relies on Islamic primary sources including the Qur'an and ahadith to lay out the foundations of each type of divorce and emphasizes that they should only be practiced "under exceptional circumstances" according to "strict rules of procedure and propriety."

Fyzee approaches the topic of Islamic divorce with an evident intention for objectivity and balance. While outlining the rights and laws of divorce that favor male prerogative, he also dedicates an entire section to "Rights and Remedies of Women" in case of abuse. He clarifies misinterpretations of certain Qur'anic verses and ahadith used to justify deviation from proper practice. Fyzee also juxtaposes past and present by lamenting the contemporary abuse of unilateral talaq, where the intended checks and balances have been stripped away, enabling capricious repudiation with "gross disregard of the wife's right and interests."

Fyzee does not shy away from addressing sensitive issues where the law of divorce has been misused, though he does so in a composed manner. He acknowledges practices used to deprive women of their financial rights, and the use of "so-called 'talaq-tul-bida'​ or innovated repudiations" not founded upon juristic precedent. However, Fyzee aims to educate rather than attack, drawing upon Islamic teachings about justice, propriety and corroboration as the basis for his criticism. He appeals for a "return to the pristine purity of the Shar​i'a", but an evolved understanding suited for modern circumstances. 

The primary audience for Fyzee's article is educated Muslims, both laymen and scholars, who wish to understand the proper Islamic laws of divorce and identify irreligious innovations that have become culturally accepted. His dry and legalistic tone, quoting of Qur'anic verses and ahadith in original Arabic, and detailed citation of past jurists' works indicate an audience well-versed in Islamic law. At the same time, Fyzee explains concepts and Arabic terms with the care and consistency of an introductory text, suggesting a secondary audience of non-Muslims with an interest in Islamic jurisprudence. Overall, Fyzee's appeals to "the true Islamic spirit" and closing recommendation of a codified system of personal laws appropriate for modern India demonstrate his hope to reach an audience in positions of legal authority and influence.

In conclusion, Fyzee's essay serves as an exemplar of scholarly analysis on a sensitive topic of Islamic jurisprudence. His expansive knowledge, balanced presentation, and courage to address misapplications of Islamic divorce law while appealing for judicious reform and revival of the religion's spiritual essence combine to make this work informative, thought-provoking, and relevant even today. Fyzee makes a valuable contribution to not only understanding the rightful purposes and practices of divorce in Islam, but also stimulating critical thought about the lived reality of Muslims in secular societies.
