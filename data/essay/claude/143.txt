The events of May 1968 in Paris were a pivotal moment that led to the emergence of a new, radical feminism in France. The massive student and worker protests that brought France to a standstill that summer challenged many prevailing social norms and spurred the rise of identity politics movements. Among these was a militant feminism that critiqued the deep-seated patriarchal structures of French society.

Women played an active role in the May 1968 events, accounting for 1/3 of the protesters. However, they were marginalized within the movement's leadership, which was dominated by males. French women realized that the radical calls for social change by student leaders did not include a critique of male domination or a demand for women's liberation. In response, they formed their own protests and action groups to raise feminist demands for abortion rights, equal pay, and an end to media objectification of women.

The feminist activism in May 1968 marked the birth of radical feminism in France, which turned its critical lens upon French society itself. Earlier French feminists had focused primarily on gaining women's suffrage. The radical feminists of May 1968 described women's oppression as systemic, embedded within French institutions, culture, and everyday life. They attacked traditional gender roles that limited women to the domestic sphere and depicted women as objects of male desire.

One of the most influential articulations of this new French feminism was Marie Cardinal's 1975 book The Words to Say It. It uses a dreamy stream-of-consciousness style to depict a young woman's alienation in a male-dominated society that denies her agency and subjectivity. The protagonist struggles against the limited set of rigid "words to say it" that confine women's self-expression. Overall, the book paints a stifling portrait of life as a woman in post-1968 France, exposing the failures of the era's revolutionary movements to seriously address women's oppression.  

In conclusion, the events of May 1968 catalyzed the emergence of radical feminism in France, spurred by women's experiences of marginalization within the male-dominated protest movements. Radical feminist ideas developed an incisive critique of the systematic oppression of women that was built into French society and culture. Marie Cardinal's The Words to Say It gave influential literary expression to the radical feminist consciousness that emerged from May 1968, capturing women's alienation and disillusionment in its aftermath. This new, revolutionary feminism left a lasting impact on French politics and culture in the decades to come.
