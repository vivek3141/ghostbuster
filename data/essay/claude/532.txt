Ikea's main performance objectives for its operations are low cost, high volume, and speed. The company's overall low-cost competitive strategy directly influences these objectives. Ikea aims to produce furniture and home goods at very low costs so they can sell at affordable prices to a very large customer base. To achieve high volumes, Ikea designs streamlined operations to rapidly and efficiently manufacture, distribute, and sell its products. 

Unlike traditional furniture competitors that focus on high quality, high margin items, Ikea's low-cost strategy translates into performance objectives centered around driving costs out of the entire value chain. Strategic decisions to achieve these objectives include: simplified, modular furniture designs; flat-packed products for low-cost shipping and customer assembly; and large warehouse-style stores to minimize retail overheads. Combined with a limited range of styles, these strategic choices allow Ikea to optimize operations for speed and efficiency.

While a "Scandinavian feel" to Ikea's designs helps with marketing and building the brand, it creates some tension with the company's operational objectives. Matching this design aesthetic means forgoing some opportunities to simplify and standardize that could further reduce costs. However, Ikea has been able to reconcile these tensions through modular and customizable furniture that still achieves a Scandinavian style. Ikea also leverages its reputation for good design to justify charging lower but still adequate prices. Overall, Ikea's performance objectives and competitive strategy have been very synergistic, with a distinct operational focus that is reinforced by key organizational decisions within the company.

In summary, Ikea's main performance objectives are low cost, high volume and speed. Its low-cost competitive strategy directly shapes these objectives and the strategic choices Ikea has made to optimize its operations. While there is some tension between marketing Ikea's "Scandinavian feel" and absolute cost minimization, the company has navigated this well through its signature designs and by emphasizing affordability. Ikea's tight strategic alignment between competitive priorities and operational performance objectives has enabled its great success.
