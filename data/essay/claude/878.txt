The poems 'The Kaleidoscope' by Douglas Dunn and 'Underworld' by Lavinia Greenlaw both explore the theme of grief following the death of a loved one. However, the poems employ different forms, language, and cultural references to convey the emotional experience of loss.

Douglas Dunn's 'The Kaleidoscope' adopts a loosely structured form without a fixed rhyme scheme or meter to reflect the scattered and fragmented nature of grief. The kaleidoscope metaphor suggests grief as a jumble of emotions, memories, and sensory details that shift and recombine unexpectedly. The poem incorporates short phrases and sentences reminiscent of the stream-of-consciousness and momentary details as seen through a kaleidoscope: “Glint of tin...velvet shapes...the candles of anemones”. This form and the repetition of images like anemones symbolize how memories resurface and rotate through the mind. 

In contrast, Lavinia Greenlaw's 'Underworld' employs a tightly structured form with four stanzas of four lines in iambic pentameter. The rigid form contains and controls the poet's grief, reflecting how she seeks solace in the permanence of artistic expression. The repetition of 'underworld' in each stanza gives the poem a ritualistic quality as a way of coping with death. The classical underworld myth also provides a cultural framework for conceptualizing death. The poem is more distanced and less emotionally raw than 'The Kaleidoscope' in its references to Orpheus and Mnemosyne rather than intimate details of loss.

The language in the two poems also differs in conveying the poets' grief. Dunn's poem utilizes informal, emotionally-charged words to capture personal loss: “sick”, “dazed”, “lonely”, “miss you still”. The exclamation “O God, how I miss you still!” directly expresses the poet's anguish. In contrast, Greenlaw's choice of poetic diction and reference to Greek mythology creates a more detached tone: “shades”, “Orpheus sought”, “Mnemosyne”. However, the repetition of “silent, invisible” in each stanza highlights the poet's awareness of the loved one's absence and her inability to see or hear them anymore.

In conclusion, while the poems 'The Kaleidoscope' and 'Underworld' both deal with grief over the death of a loved one, they employ different forms, language and cultural references to convey the complexity of loss and memory in unique ways. Dunn's poem adopts a personal, emotionally immediate perspective compared to Greenlaw's more distanced elegy, but together they reflect the shared human experience of bereavement.
