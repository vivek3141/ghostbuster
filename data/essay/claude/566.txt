Norbert Elias's theory of long-term social processes offers several key benefits in understanding and analyzing social change. Unlike theories that focus on short-term events or specific institutions, Elias takes a broad historical perspective to identify gradual and large-scale shifts in societies over time. His approach addresses both individual human agency as well as macro-level social changes to provide a holistic understanding of how and why societies evolve. By establishing a notion of progress or increasing complexity, Elias also provides a universal framework for comparing societies across time and space. 

A key benefit of Elias's theory is that it traces shifts over long periods of time, often centuries or even millennia. This long-term view allows Elias to identify gradual processes of change that unfold slowly across generations. Short-term or event-based theories, on the other hand, risk missing these gradual transformations by focusing on temporary social disruptions or crises. Elias's historical method examines social structures and individual psychologies in a given era and analyzes how they gradually change and build upon the past. This allows him to theorize, for example, how the "civilizing process" unfolded in Western Europe over 500 years through a slow intensification of self-restraint among individuals and increasing social interdependence.

While long-term, Elias's theory does not neglect human agency or blame abstract social forces. Rather, Elias sees a reciprocal relationship between individuals and society. Individual actions and choices accumulate over time to shape social structures, but those social structures also mold individuals' personalities and behaviors. As individuals become more self-restrained and interdependent over generations, for instance, social norms also evolve to encourage and institutionalize those traits. This multi-level analysis moves beyond simplistic "structure-agency" debates by showing how they constitute and influence each other.

 A key concept in Elias's theory is the notion of increasing social complexity, interdependence, and rationalization over time. This establishes a sense of directionality or progress as societies transition from less to more complex organizational forms. However, this progress is not universal or inevitable but depends on the unique choices and events in each society's development. Elias uses this concept of uneven societal progress to compare different cultures and understand divergences in their trajectories. Those that are more successful in reducing violence and developing social interdependencies, in Elias's view, tend to thrive. This framework, while controversial, provides a broad rubric for systematically comparing and evaluating world societies.

Some examples of characteristics that Elias's theory highlights include: decreasing acceptance of violence and increasing self-restraint; expanding social interdependencies and networks; and intensifying rationalization of social structures and individual thought. According to Elias, Western civilization has been marked by a long-term "civilizing process" across these dimensions. Violence has become increasingly illegitimate and taboo, especially as the state's monopoly over force has solidified. Social life has become more complexly integrated, as people rely on and identify with far larger networks. And "rationality" has come to permeate more spheres of life, including economic, political, and personal realms. 

In conclusion, Norbert Elias's theory of long-term social processes provides a historical and multilayered framework for theorizing social change. By tracing gradual shifts over long periods of time, incorporating both individual agency and macro-forces, establishing a notion of societal progress, and identifying key characteristics like violence levels or social interdependence, Elias offers a comprehensive approach for understanding why and how societies evolve. His theory gives researchers tools for grasping both continuity and change, synthesizing micro and macro perspectives, and putting single events or institutions into broader historical context.
