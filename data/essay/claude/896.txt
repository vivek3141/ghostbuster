The primary concerns when designing the site layout were usability, navigation, and providing relevant information to users. To optimize usability and navigation, a simple and clean layout with minimal clutter was  implemented. The site has a header with the site name and navigation links, which remain at the top of all pages so users can easily navigate between sections. Content is organized clearly with headings and bullet points where appropriate to facilitate quick information finding. The home page provides an overview of the core content and products offered.  

The site contains details on products, pricing, reviews, and more. Information on user behavior informed what should be prioritized on the homepage and navigation links. The most viewed and searched for information is placed prominently on the homepage. All information is linked in a logical flow from general to more specific. For example, the product category page links to individual product pages with specs, pricing, and reviews.  

Debugging was done through testing the site across browsers and mobile devices to ensure consistency and identify any display issues. Friends and family members reviewed the site to provide feedback, enabling further refinement of content, layout, and navigation. The site meets the key requirements identified in the coursework specification, including showcasing the company products, facilitating purchases, sharing company information, and enabling customer reviews and feedback.   

The end product is a functional yet simple site that performs as intended. However, there are limitations, including some incompatibility with older browsers, lack of more advanced features like a product customization tool, restricted product selection, and limited global reach. Operations can be improved by optimizing the site for more browsers, expanding the product line, enabling customization options, translating content for more languages, and implementing targeted digital marketing campaigns to increase traffic. Overall, the primary site concerns were adequately addressed, but there remains significant room for scalability and improvement to support business growth.
