Augustin-Louis Cauchy made several crucial advances in the field of real analysis and developed foundational concepts that shape our modern understanding of calculus. He helped formalize the definitions of infinite quantities, limits, and continuity that underpin calculus. 

Cauchy disproved Lagrange's belief that any function could be represented by a Taylor series expansion. Cauchy showed that the Taylor series expansion only converges for functions that are infinitely differentiable over the domain of convergence. This led Cauchy to develop a more rigorous definition of the definite and indefinite integral that did not rely on the Taylor series. Cauchy defined the integral as the limit of sums, allowing him to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

Cauchy rigorously defined continuity and limits. He defined a limit as the value a function approaches as its input approaches some value, if it exists. He defined continuity as a function having a limit at every point in its domain. These definitions allowed Cauchy to prove theorems relating continuity to differentiability and integrability.

Cauchy's work established a precise framework for calculus; however, his proofs have been criticized as lacking rigor. Cauchy relied on intuitive rather than formal reasoning and did not use the formal limit process we recognize today. His proofs assumed results that had not yet been proven. These deficiencies are partly due to the informal nature of mathematics during Cauchy's time. Nevertheless, Cauchy established the groundwork that allowed later mathematicians like Weierstrass to formalize analysis with modern rigor.  

In conclusion, Cauchy made seminal contributions to the field of real analysis, developing key concepts such as limits, continuity, and the integral. While his proofs lacked modern rigor, Cauchy's innovative ideas and intuition established the framework for the formal real analysis built by later mathematicians. Cauchy's work was instrumental in shaping calculus into the powerful tool it has become for mathematics, science, and engineering. Overall, Cauchy's profound insights irrevocably changed mathematics.
