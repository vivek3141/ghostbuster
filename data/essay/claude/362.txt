Future Cars: Color Changing, Spherical Wheels, and Adaptable Shapes 

Automobiles have come a long way since their invention in the late 1800s. While early cars were simple mechanical devices used for basic transportation, today's vehicles incorporate advanced technologies like computerized systems, GPS navigation, and autonomous driving capabilities. However, cars of the future may include even more radical and fantastical features not seen in today's models. 

One possibility for future cars is the ability to change color on demand using electronic color changing mechanisms. Cars could have touchscreen displays that allow the driver to select a different vehicle color scheme with the touch of a button. Microscopic color-changing panels on the vehicle exterior would then shift to display the newly selected color. This could allow drivers to easily change the color of their car to match their outfit, mood, or the season. Some may see this as an unnecessary gimmick, but for others it could be an exciting new way to express themselves through their vehicle.

Another far-fetched idea is the use of spherical wheels rather than traditional circular wheels. Spherical wheels could provide greater maneuverability, allowing a vehicle to move laterally without changing its forward orientation.  This could improve a vehicle's capability to parallel park in tight spaces or navigate narrow roads. However, spherical wheels may face challenges related to steering, braking, and managing forces from acceleration or uneven road surfaces. Significant technological hurdles would need to be overcome to make spherical wheels practical and safe for commercial vehicles.  

Finally, future cars could have adaptable shapes that morph based on driving needs. Vehicles could expand to provide more interior space during long drives or contract for easier parking in small spaces. Certain models may even become amphibious, changing shape to hydroplane on water. Shape changing cars could improve the driving experience, but they would require advanced technologies like morphable body panels, flexible structural components, and intelligent software to control the shape adaptations. Cost and manufacturing challenges may limit this concept to high-end vehicle models.

In conclusion, while color changing mechanisms, spherical wheels, and adaptable car shapes seem like science fiction, continuing progress in automotive technologies could make these features a reality in future cars. However, significant costs, safety risks, and technological barriers would first need to be addressed. For the time being, these radical concepts will remain mostly in the realm of imagination. Overall, the future of automobiles is bright, and cars are likely to become even more advanced, eco-friendly, and responsive to human needs. The road ahead promises to be an exciting one!
