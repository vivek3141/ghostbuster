John Locke provides an important account of the distinction between knowledge and opinion in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding. For Locke, knowledge requires certainty grounded in perceiving the agreement or disagreement of ideas, whereas opinion is mere probable conjecture or belief. This distinction marks an important shift from previous epistemological theories that focused on perception or certainty alone as the basis for knowledge. 

In his Essay, Locke sets out to examine the "original, certainty, and extent of human knowledge." He wants to determine the limits of human understanding to avoid pointless speculation beyond what we can truly know. The first step is distinguishing knowledge from belief or opinion. For Locke, knowledge requires the perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas. When we perceive the agreement between two ideas—for example, that the idea of a circle matches the idea of a figure whose points are equidistant from its center—we have intuitive knowledge. When we can deduce the agreement or disagreement of ideas through a chain of reasoning—for example, a mathematical proof—we have demonstrative knowledge. In either case, knowledge depends on a perceived connection between ideas, not merely a belief that something is true.

Opinion or belief, on the other hand, involves judgment without this perceived connection and so lacks the certainty of knowledge. Belief that something is true or probable is not knowledge if we do not perceive the agreement of ideas. For example, belief in eyewitness testimony or newspaper reports would be opinion for Locke, not knowledge, because we do not directly perceive the agreement of ideas. We only judge that something seems likely to be true based on the report of others, and our judgment could be mistaken. Opinion can range from near certainty (as in the probabiliism popular at the time) to conjecture and fiction. But no matter how firmly we are convinced of an opinion, without perceiving the connection between ideas, we cannot have knowledge.

Locke's distinction between knowledge and opinion represents a significant shift from previous epistemological frameworks. Ancient and medieval theories of knowledge emphasized perception and certainty but did not highlight the perceived agreement of ideas as the essential basis for knowledge. For example, Aristotle defined knowledge as justifiable true belief, while Avicenna considered intuition and certain knowledge to rest on clear perception alone. By contrast, Locke argues that perception and certainty are not enough: we need to perceive the actual relation between ideas to have knowledge. Otherwise, we are left with mere opinion, belief, and conjecture.

In sum, Locke provides an influential account of the difference between knowledge and opinion. For Locke, knowledge requires intuitively or demonstratively perceiving the agreement or disagreement between ideas, whereas opinion is belief that falls short of this standard. This distinction marks an important shift toward a more connective view of knowledge that moves beyond mere perception or belief. Overall, Locke gives us a compelling framework for determining the limits of human understanding and avoiding empty speculation beyond what we can know with certainty.
