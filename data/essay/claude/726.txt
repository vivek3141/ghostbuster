Romantic poets in late 18th and early 19th century Britain employed poetic language and various tropes to challenge popular opinions supporting slavery and the oppression of slaves. Four poets in particular—William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey and William Cowper—used their works to critique the institution of slavery and advocate for greater sensibility and humanity. However, they differed in their approaches and the extent to which they promoted outright revolution.

William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge were close friends and collaborators who conveyed antislavery messages in some of their works. For example, in Wordsworth's poem “Nuns Fret Not at Their Convent's Narrow Room” (1807), he uses the metaphor of the nun's cloistered life to represent the constrained and unfree life of slaves. The poem suggests that spiritual freedom can be found even in confined spaces, just as slaves could be inwardly free. This notion of inner freedom argues against the popular belief that slaves were content in their oppression and countered proslavery arguments. However, Wordsworth and Coleridge avoided outright condemnation of slavery in much of their work and instead focused more broadly on human suffering and humanity's relationship to nature. 

In contrast, Robert Southey and William Cowper were more vocal in their antislavery views and direct in their criticism of slavery. Cowper's poem “The Negro's Complaint” (1788) gives a voice to slaves, describing the horrors of the slave trade and plantation life. Using tropes of sensibility and the suffering slave, Cowper elicits empathy and challenges arguments that slaves could not feel and reason as Europeans did. In his turn, Southey argued against slavery in poems such as “Poem on the Slave Trade” (1797) which described slaves as “wretched victims” of tyrannical and unjust laws. Southey employs emotional language and humanitarian tropes to sway readers against slavery. Unlike Wordsworth and Coleridge, Southey and Cowper were more willing to condemn slavery outright and call for its abolition.

In conclusion, Romantic poets like Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey and Cowper challenged popular support of slavery through their poems. While they employed similar tropes of sensibility and humanitarianism to convey antislavery messages, they differed in the extent to which they openly condemned slavery and called for revolution. Their works were instrumental in turning public opinion against slavery and advancing abolitionism in Britain. Overall, their poems remain powerful examples of literature being used to advocate for political change and promote human rights.
