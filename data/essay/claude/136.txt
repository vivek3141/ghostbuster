Emma Bovary's decision to live her life as if it were one of her beloved romance novels ultimately leads to her tragic downfall. Throughout Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary, Emma rejects the mundane aspects of her life as the wife of a country doctor and seeks to live out her fantasies of passion and adventure. However, her insistence on living in a dream world and her disregard for the consequences of her actions make it difficult for the reader to fully sympathize with Emma.   

Emma marries Charles Bovary early in the novel expecting her life to mirror the romance stories she has read, full of excitement and passion. However, she soon finds that marriage and motherhood do not live up to her expectations. She grows bored and resentful of her ordinary life and seeks escape in her imagination and in adulterous affairs. Her first lover, Rodolphe, appeals to Emma's romantic sensibilities by waxing poetic about their undying love and planning to run away together. Although Rodolphe has no intention of following through, Emma falls for his false professions of passion. She is crushed when he abandons her but soon seeks other lovers to lift her out of the tedium of her daily life.

Emma's refusal to accept the responsibilities and dissatisfactions of adulthood make her a sympathetic character to a degree. Her plight as an intelligent, imaginative woman stuck in a dull marriage during a time with limited opportunities for women creates some empathy on the part of the reader. However, Emma takes this desire for escape to an irresponsible extreme. She spends money with abandon, racks up debts, and lies constantly to her husband to fund her lavish lifestyle and love affairs. She appears to have learned nothing from her first betrayal by Rodolphe and continues to see the world as she wishes it to be rather than as it really is. By the time she is ravaged by unhappiness and debt, the reader's sympathy for her plight may be limited.  

Ultimately, Emma meets a tragic end in keeping with the tumultuous events of her life. She commits suicide by poisoning herself, seeing no other escape from the consequences of her actions. Emma's story serves as a warning against the dangers of refusing to accept reality and of living as though life has no consequences. While Flaubert seems to judge Emma's actions as irresponsible and selfish, he also creates empathy for a woman who sought passion and freedom in the limited avenue available to her. The reader both understands and condemns Emma's decision to live her life as if it were one of her romance novels.
