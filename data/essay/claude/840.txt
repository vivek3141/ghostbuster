Working in groups on shared assignments is both challenging and rewarding. I recently worked with a group of peers on a collaborative project to prepare a policy memo for a Global Governance class. Using Gibbs' (1988) reflective cycle, I reflected on the key dynamics, including communication, roles, and focus, within our group as well as how our diversity impacted our work together. Ultimately, building trust and developing cultural competence through effective communication were essential to the success of our team project.

Upon receiving the group work assignment, we met and discussed how to approach the task. A few of us had worked together before and were able to establish some rapport, while others were new additions who initially seemed reluctant to share their thoughts. At first, assigning roles felt forced and inauthentic rather than emerging organically based on strengths and interests. However, as we began working, it became clear that certain roles were necessary, and members gradually gravitated towards the roles they were most comfortable with, e.g. project manager, researcher, writer, editor. Clarifying these roles helped establish direction and accountability.              

Our group's diversity was both a benefit and a challenge. Having members from different cultural backgrounds brought valuable new perspectives to our work but also more opportunities for misunderstandings. Cultural competence and communication were key to overcoming these challenges. Making an effort to understand different communication styles, clarify meaning by asking follow-up questions, and share how certain phrases or interactions were interpreted from different cultural standpoints built understanding. It was important to approach these interactions with patience, empathy and an open mind.

As we collaborated, communication emerged as the most critical dynamic. We had to communicate frequently through multiple channels to ensure everyone felt included and knew what they needed to contribute. Having a shared Google doc where we could constantly update one another on progress and ask questions was invaluable. While face-to-face meetings were ideal for discussing complex topics, we also held video chats for those unable to meet in person.

There were moments of tension and disagreement within the group, but we were ultimately able to provide constructive criticism and feedback to one another. Developing trust and a sense of shared responsibility in the group took time but was crucial. By dividing work evenly and meeting deadlines, we held one another accountable and built cohesiveness as a team. Not designating an official leader and instead making decisions collectively gave everyone a sense of ownership over the final product.  

In conclusion, working in a group on a collaborative project was a valuable learning experience. Reflecting on the group dynamics using Gibbs' model has given me insight into aspects I would approach differently next time, such as clarifying roles earlier and bringing potential cultural misunderstandings to the surface to address them proactively. However, building trust and a sense of shared purpose, maintaining open communication, and developing cultural competence will always be vital for productive teamwork. Overall, the diversity within the group combined with our ability to leverage different strengths made for an effective working dynamic and a rewarding final result.
