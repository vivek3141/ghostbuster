Gareth's case for judicial review is based on the argument that the judge who presided over his original trial was biased against him and failed to afford him a fair trial. Judicial review allows courts to review the decisions of lower courts and administrative bodies to ensure that proper procedures were followed and that the decision was fair and just. Gareth is arguing that due to the bias of the judge against him, his original trial did not meet the standard of procedural fairness and justice required under the law. 

There are several factors that are considered in determining whether a rule against bias has been breached in a particular case. The first factor is whether there was actual bias or a reasonable perception of bias. Actual bias refers to when a judge has a personal prejudice or preconception about a party that prevents them from deciding the case objectively based on the facts and the law. A reasonable perception of bias exists where an informed observer looking at the circumstances in totality could reasonably perceive bias, even if actual bias did not exist. The key question is whether the judge’s conduct gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias in the mind of a reasonable and informed litigant.

A second factor is whether the potential bias relates to one of the parties themselves or their witnesses or lawyers. Bias against a party to a proceeding goes to the integrity of the system of justice and requires disqualification of the judge. Bias against a party’s counsel or witnesses may still give rise to a perception of bias, but the judge has more discretion on whether to recuse themselves from the case. A third factor is whether the judge relied on personal knowledge or views rather than relying solely on the evidence presented in court. Judges must avoid bringing any preconceptions or privately obtained information into their decision making. Their ruling must be based strictly on the facts and arguments presented openly in court by the parties.  

In summary, for Gareth to succeed in a judicial review application arguing bias, he must show that there were circumstances surrounding his trial that would give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. The key factors the court will consider include: whether there were indications of actual personal bias against Gareth or a reasonable perception of bias; whether any potential bias was directed at Gareth himself as a party to the proceeding; and whether the judge appeared to rely on any privately held views rather than relying solely on the evidence and submissions presented in open court. If Gareth can demonstrate any of these factors were present based on a totality of the circumstances, he may convince the court on review that his trial did not afford him procedural fairness and natural justice.
