Mexico's accession to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1992 was driven by a combination of factors, including the hegemonic influence of the United States, the significant economic discrepancies between the U.S. and Mexico, and Mexico's desire to boost economic growth. NAFTA provides an illustrative example of the complex dynamics between developed and developing economies pursuing economic integration.

The dominant role of the United States in the global economic system in the early 1990s allowed it to shape the terms of NAFTA to its benefit. The U.S. had a strong interest in accessing Mexico's markets and resources, as well as reducing costs by offshoring manufacturing to Mexico. The U.S. wielded its hegemonic power during negotiations to secure an agreement highly favorable to U.S. commercial interests. For example, the U.S. was able to insert provisions strengthening intellectual property laws, removing barriers to U.S. agricultural exports, and protecting U.S. investors. Mexico had little choice but to accept these asymmetrical terms if it wanted access to the U.S. market.

The vast discrepancies in economic development between the U.S. and Mexico also drove Mexico's motivation to join NAFTA, despite the imbalanced nature of the agreement. Mexico's economy in the early 1990s was small and developing, while the U.S. economy was advanced and many times larger. NAFTA promised to boost Mexico's economy by expanding export markets, attracting foreign investment, and catalyzing job growth. Mexico hoped these economic benefits would outweigh the costs of unequal terms of trade with its much larger neighbor. 

Indeed, in the decade after NAFTA's implementation, Mexico's economy grew at its fastest rate in decades. Maquiladoras, or manufacturing plants producing goods for export, mushroomed along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trade between the U.S. and Mexico more than tripled. However, this rapid economic growth masked deeper issues, like job insecurity, inequality, and overreliance on the U.S. market. When the U.S. economy faltered in the mid-2000s, Mexico suffered a deep recession. It is an open debate whether Mexico's long-term economic prospects improved under NAFTA.

Mexico's experience in NAFTA illustrates many of the dynamics common to economic integration between developing and developed nations. Developing countries are often compelled to join trade blocs on terms that disproportionately benefit developed countries, due to asymmetries in market size and economic leverage. However, developing countries also join seeking economic opportunities, even when the costs of unequal treaties may outweigh the benefits. There are complex trade-offs that developing nations must evaluate in the global system.

In conclusion, Mexico joined NAFTA primarily due to the hegemonic influence of the United States and the allure of economic gains, despite the problematic imbalance in the agreement. NAFTA significantly boosted Mexico's economy in some dimensions but also increased its dependence on the U.S. and economic insecurity. Mexico's accession to NAFTA highlights how developing countries may be driven to accept unfavorable terms in trade agreements with dominant partners in hopes of long-run benefits, even if these benefits are uneven or do not wholly materialize. Overall, Mexico's experience in NAFTA offers a cautionary tale for developing countries pursuing free trade deals with more powerful economies.
