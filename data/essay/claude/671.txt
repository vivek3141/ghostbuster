The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA) had a significant impact on solicitors, accountants, and bankers dealing with trustees in the UK. The POCA imposed new obligations on these practitioners to conduct thorough customer due diligence, monitor accounts and transactions for suspicious activity, and report anything suspicious to the authorities. Failure to comply with these requirements puts practitioners at risk of criminal prosecution. While the POCA aims to crack down on money laundering and the financing of terrorism, the additional obligations have created substantial difficulties and disruption. 

Under POCA, practitioners have an obligation to conduct Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) on clients and transactions that present a higher money laundering risk, such as trusts and companies with complex ownership structures. EDD requires practitioners to scrutinize the source of funds and wealth of clients and beneficial owners. For trusts and companies, this can require looking through layers of ownership to identify the ultimate beneficial owners, which is often challenging and time-consuming. The additional due diligence requirements have increased the workload and costs of practitioners.

POCA also requires practitioners to monitor accounts and transactions for 'suspicious activity' that may constitute money laundering. Determining what constitutes 'suspicious' activity can be difficult, and practitioners face criminal penalties for failure to report. As a result, practitioners may defensively report transactions that have a low probability of actually constituting money laundering. This leads to a large volume of unnecessary Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) being filed with the authorities, who then have the difficult task of determining which SARs merit further investigation.  

While the reporting obligations aim to detect and prevent money laundering, they also create difficulties for legitimate clients and transactions. Clients may face questioning or temporary freezing of their accounts due to defensive SAR filings, and some transactions may be delayed or even blocked pending review. These disruptions and compliance costs are an unintended consequence of the POCA, and likely deter some legitimate business in the process.

Practitioners do have some statutory and common law defences available under POCA, including the 'consent' defence. If practitioners obtained consent from the authorities prior to handling suspected criminal property, they have a defence against charges of money laundering. Practitioners can also defend themselves by demonstrating they reported the relevant suspicions to the authorities as soon as practicable, took all reasonable steps to mitigate risks, and acted without actual knowledge or suspicion of money laundering. Reliance on a 'third-party defence' by outsourcing due diligence obligations to a third party is risky and not guaranteed to provide a defence.

In practice, making a disclosure under POCA poses legal and practical challenges. When filing a SAR, practitioners must strike a balance between providing enough detail to demonstrate reasonable suspicion, while avoiding potentially defamatory or prejudicial statements about clients. SARs are also confidential, but if charges are brought against a client, details from SARs may be used as evidence, putting practitioners in a difficult position. SAR filings can also damage client relationships and expose practitioners to potential civil claims, although POCA does provide some protections against liability for disclosures made in 'good faith'.

On balance, while POCA's disruptions and difficulties are substantial, anti-money laundering efforts are necessary to uphold the integrity of the financial system and society. The compliance obligations on practitioners are imperfect but aim to give law enforcement valuable intelligence and tools to trace and seize criminal assets. Reforms to streamline reporting processes, provide more guidance on suspicious indicators, and introduce a mechanism for consent/feedback on SAR filings could help ease the unintended burdens of POCA, without compromising its policy aims. Practitioners also have a role to play through developing efficient risk-based due diligence procedures, and maintaining open communication with clients and authorities regarding any disruptions. Overall, POCA's benefits to society likely outweigh its difficulties, if adequately balanced and mitigated.
