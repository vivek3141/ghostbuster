There are several key determinants of exam performance for econometrics students that should be included in a model to explain their influence. The first and most obvious determinant is the number of hours a student spends studying and preparing for the exam. All else being equal, students who study more will perform better on tests. Studying helps students master the course material, practice problems, and commit key concepts and definitions to memory, all of which directly contribute to better exam scores. 

A second important determinant is a student's class attendance and participation. Students who attend lectures regularly and actively participate by asking questions and engaging with the professor and other students tend to perform better on exams. Attending class exposes students to the full scope of material that may be covered on the exam and allows for interactive learning. Participating in class also helps reinforce concepts and uncover areas that may need further study. While some students may be able to perform well without regular attendance, especially if all lectures are recorded, most students benefit from in-person attendance and participation.

The student's aptitude and ability for the subject matter is another obvious determinant of exam performance. Students who have a higher innate ability or talent for econometrics and an aptitude for data analysis, statistics, and quantitative reasoning will likely outperform their peers on the exam, all else being equal. Of course, aptitude is not the only factor, and hard work and preparation can help make up for gaps in natural ability. But especially in highly technical subjects like econometrics, a student's base aptitude will place some constraints on how well they can grasp and apply complex concepts and methods. 

Beyond student-level factors, elements related to the design and delivery of the course itself will also impact exam performance. A clear and structured sequencing of topics, transparency about learning objectives and assessment methods, the provision of practice problems, quality of instruction, and availability of supplemental resources like office hours or teaching assistants will all support students in learning and preparing for exams. Students with access to these best practices in course and curriculum design will develop a better understanding of expectations and build more confidence in their ability to succeed on the exam.  

While there are many additional minor factors, a good model of econometrics exam performance should include at least the following major determinants: hours spent studying, attendance and participation, aptitude for the subject, and aspects of course design. These factors are interconnected but also independently significant contributors to learning and ultimate success on course assessments like final exams. Controlling for all other factors, strengthening any of these determinants will likely improve exam performance for students.
