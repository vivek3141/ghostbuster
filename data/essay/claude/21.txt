Attentional skills and inhibitory control are two interdependent yet distinct cognitive abilities that improve with age during childhood and adolescence. Attentional skills refer to the ability to selectively focus on relevant information while ignoring irrelevant details in the environment. Inhibitory control is the ability to override a dominant behavioral response in favor of a subdominant one, also known as behavioral inhibition. As children age, their attentional skills become more refined allowing them to maintain focus on tasks for longer periods while also filtering our distractions. Their inhibitory control also strengthens, enabling them to suppress inappropriate responses and interrupt ongoing behaviors when needed. 

Gender differences in attentional skills and behavioral inhibition emerge early and persist into adolescence and adulthood. Numerous studies have found that females generally outperform males on tasks measuring selective attention, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control at all stages of development. For example, girls tend to be faster and more accurate than boys of the same age when making judgments about visual stimuli and switching between mental sets. Girls also show an earlier maturation of attentional skills as evidenced by stronger neural responses in attention-related brain regions during the middle childhood years.

With respect to inhibitory control, research has uncovered gender differences in inhibition times of a motor response during both quiet and distracting conditions. A study examining children between 6 to 10 years of age found that girls were quicker to inhibit movements in a stop-signal reaction time test compared to boys of the same age, demonstrating their superior inhibitory control. These differences were amplified when an auditory distraction was introduced, suggesting that boys are more susceptible to the effects of competing stimuli during an inhibitory task. The differences in inhibition times could not be attributed to general reaction times as boys and girls did not differ in go trials without interference.

Developmentally, there are significant improvements in both attentional skills and inhibitory control between ages 6 to 12 years reflecting the maturation of the prefrontal cortex during middle childhood and early adolescence. However, gender differences tend to remain stable or even widen over this period. An interaction effect between age and distraction condition is also evident, with differences in inhibition times between boys and girls becoming more pronounced with the introduction of an auditory distraction, especially for older children. This pattern suggests that attentional distraction has a greater disruptive impact on inhibitory control for boys relative to girls, particularly in late childhood and early adolescence when gender differences in brain development are most salient.

In summary, this essay discussed how attention and inhibitory control advance with age during development in all children but at different time courses between girls and boys. Females demonstrate an advantage over males on selective attention, cognitive flexibility and behavioral inhibition during childhood and adolescence. While abilities strengthen with age for both genders, the impact of distraction on inhibition seems more detrimental for boys, especially in late childhood, leading to significant differences in inhibition times relative to girls. A complex interplay between development, gender and environment shapes the emergence of these cognitive skills from an early age.
