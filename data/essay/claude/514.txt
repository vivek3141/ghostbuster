Thomas Hobbes and John Locke were two of the most influential political philosophers of the seventeenth century. They both wrote extensively on social contract theory and the origin of political authority, but came to very different conclusions regarding the ideal form of government. Hobbes was a proponent of absolute monarchy, arguing that an all-powerful sovereign was necessary to maintain peace and stability. In contrast, Locke advocated for a limited constitutional monarchy with separation of powers and checks on the authority of the ruler. 

Hobbes believed that the primary goal of government was to ensure safety and order. In his seminal work Leviathan, Hobbes argued that without a common power to keep them in awe, humans exist in a "state of nature" that is a state of war of "every man against every man." Due to this fundamental equality and natural human selfishness and aggression, life in the state of nature is "solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short." Hobbes posited that to escape this intolerable situation, humans enter into a social contract and establish a political society under a sovereign power. They trade their natural liberty for safety, sacrificing some rights and autonomy in exchange for protection. 

According to Hobbes, only an absolute monarchy can provide the stability and security that people seek to gain from the social contract. The sovereign must have complete and undivided power to keep subjects in awe and prevent descension back into the chaos of the state of nature. Hobbes argues that limiting the sovereign's power or dividing sovereignty would weaken it and undermine its purpose. While subjects give up natural liberty to enter society, the sovereign retains the absolute "right of nature" to do whatever is necessary to preserve peace. The sovereign is not party to the initial contract and cannot be judged or constrained by subjects.

In contrast, Locke believed that the primary goal of government was the protection of natural rights and liberties, not simply peace. He argued that people form political societies to better secure rights they already possess in the state of nature, including rights to life, liberty, and property. While the state of nature is inconvenient, Locke did not share Hobbes' view that it is a state of war. For Locke, inalienable natural rights place constraints on what can be given up in the social contract and what power can be conferred to government. People only surrender enough power to government to secure their rights, not so much that it becomes arbitrary or threatens those very rights.
