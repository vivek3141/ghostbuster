An individual's perception of whether an object is alive or not depends on several factors. Two key hypotheses in this determination are the Newtonian violation hypothesis and the intentionality hypothesis. The Newtonian violation hypothesis suggests that perceiving an object violate our expectation of non-living objects, such as by moving spontaneously or changing direction suddenly, leads us to perceive it as alive. In contrast, the intentionality hypothesis proposes that we perceive objects as alive based on whether they appear to have intentionality, that is, whether they seem to have goals and make purposeful movements to achieve those goals. 

In addition to these hypotheses, several other cues are involved in perceptions of aliveness. These include an object's goal-directedness, the context in which we encounter the object, and our prior knowledge about similar objects. Goal-directedness refers to the degree to which an object's movements seem aimed at achieving a particular end or purpose. Objects that move in a very directed, non-random fashion are more likely to be perceived as alive. For example, a robot that navigates an obstacle course in an efficient, purposeful manner would be judged as more alive than one that moves randomly and bumps into obstacles.

The context in which we see an object also shapes our perception of its aliveness. We are more prone to view objects as alive when we encounter them in a naturalistic setting versus an industrial one. For instance, a flying object in a forest would likely be perceived as an animal, while the same object in a factory would likely be seen as a machine. Our prior knowledge further influences whether we deem an unfamiliar object as living or nonliving. We will categorize the new object as alive or not alive based on how similar it appears to familiar objects that we know to be either living or nonliving.

In many cases, perceiving an object as alive or not alive depends on integrating multiple cues, rather than any single factor. For example, we may observe an object move in a seemingly spontaneous and unmechanical fashion, violating our expectation of Newtonian motion (supporting the Newtonian violation hypothesis). However, if the object lacks other attributes of aliveness such as goal-directed, intentional movements, and if we encounter it in a context where we expect to find nonliving objects, and it shares features with familiar nonliving objects, then we would likely perceive it as nonliving despite its unusual motion.

Perceiving aliveness is a complex process involving many interacting influences, from low-level motion cues to higher-level conceptual knowledge. The hypotheses and additional factors reviewed here - Newtonian violation, intentionality, goal-directedness, context, and prior knowledge - provide a framework for understanding how we make the fundamental distinction between what is alive and not alive in the world around us. Overall, they show that aliveness is in the eye of the beholder, colored by both bottom-up cues from our senses and top-down effects from cognition and experience.
