Karl Polanyi's concept of 'embeddedness' is central to his critique of the self-regulating market in his seminal work 'The Great Transformation.' For Polanyi, prior to the rise of market capitalism in the 19th century, economies were 'embedded' within social and political institutions. Economic activity was subordinate to social relationships and political regulation. However, with the rise of market capitalism, the economy became disembedded from society and politics. The self-regulating market economy emerged as an independent sphere that marginalized social and political constraints. 

Polanyi argued this led to a 'great transformation' as the self-regulating market disrupted traditional social structures and mechanisms of economic reciprocity. The emergence of the self-regulating market was a myth for Polanyi because the economy can never truly become independent from society and politics. For Polanyi, the economy is always embedded within broader social and political systems, even in capitalist market economies.

The concept of embeddedness enhances our understanding of the contemporary global economy by highlighting how even global finance is still embedded within social and political structures. Although global financial markets appear detached from regulation and society, they rely on political institutions and policies to facilitate capital mobility and are themselves shaped by social relationships and power dynamics. 

Polanyi's double-movement provides a framework for understanding how society responds to the rise of market capitalism. When the self-regulating market causes social disruption, there are counter-movements to re-embed the economy within social and political institutions. For example, the global financial crisis has led to calls to re-regulate finance. However, there has also been a counter-counter-movement against increasing financial regulation. There is an ongoing tug-of-war between the movement to disembed capital from constraints and the counter-movement to re-embed economies within social and political structures.

In conclusion, Polanyi's concept of embeddedness is crucial to understanding his critique of the utopian myth of the self-regulating market. All economies are embedded within social and political systems. Polanyi's framework remains highly relevant to analyzing contemporary capitalism and global finance. There are ongoing movements and counter-movements to alter the relationship between the economy and society that shape the development of global capitalism. Polanyi's 'great transformation' remains an ongoing dynamic within the global economy. Overall, the concept of embeddedness provides a more realistic and holistic way of understanding modern economies that incorporates the social and political, rather than viewing the economy in isolation.
