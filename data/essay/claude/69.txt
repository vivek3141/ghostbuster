The Church Missionary Society's Wellington Valley Mission in Australia was established in 1832 with the objective of converting the local Wiradjuri Aboriginal people to Christianity and assimilating them into European culture. However, the mission ultimately failed and closed in 1842 due to a combination of factors. The three main reasons for its failure were: 1) cultural misunderstandings and conflicts between the missionaries and the Wiradjuri people; 2) disunity and infighting within the missionary group itself; and 3) lack of support from the Colonial Administration and Church Missionary Society leadership. Of these, cultural conflicts and misunderstandings were the primary causes leading to the breakdown of the mission.

The missionaries had little understanding of Wiradjuri culture and society, and did not respect the indigenous way of life. They saw Aboriginal spirituality and cultural practices as primitive and evil, and were intent on imposing their Christian beliefs and British customs. They frowned upon traditional Wiradjuri customs like polygamy, and attempted to forcibly change practices around marriage, dress, and child-rearing. The Wiradjuri resented this cultural imposition and interference in their daily lives. There were also misunderstandings over the meaning and use of land. The missionaries did not comprehend the complex Wiradjuri system of communal land ownership, and their unauthorized use and fencing of land angered the local people.  

Cultural clashes were exacerbated by communication difficulties. The missionaries struggled to learn the Wiradjuri language, and were often dependent on a few Wiradjuri intermediaries who could act as interpreters. This limited their ability to meaningfully engage with most Wiradjuri people and convey Christian concepts. It also meant the missionaries could not grasp the nuances around Wiradjuri laws, spirituality and traditions. Most Wiradjuri had little interest in learning English or adjusting their way of life to missionary expectations. They primarily interacted with the mission due to the rations and supplies on offer. 

Disunity and personal conflicts among the missionaries severely weakened the mission. There were disputes over policies around land, the distribution of goods, and approaches to conversion. Rev. Watson took an aggressive and authoritarian stance that alienated others. His deputy, Handt, actively conspired against him. Other missionaries were unsuited to the harsh Australian conditions and the challenges of this work. The mission went through five superintendents in 10 years due to this unrest and turnover of personnel.

The British Colonial authorities provided minimal support due to their own limited resources and greater interest in the welfare of settlers. The Church Missionary Society head office in London offered little practical support and guidance to overcome obstacles on the ground. They primarily viewed the mission in abstract evangelical terms and did not appreciate the difficulties of the remote Australian environment and cross-cultural challenges involved. By the time senior leaders intervened, the divides between groups were too wide to repair.

In conclusion, while there were other contributing factors, cultural misunderstandings and differences were the fundamental reasons why the Wellington Valley Mission could not succeed in its aims. The missionary goal of conversion and assimilation went against the interests and wishes of the Wiradjuri people. Despite some periods of cooperation and exchange, the wide divide between cultures, beliefs and ways of living ultimately proved impossible to overcome due to a lack of meaningful understanding and respect between the two groups. The failure of the mission serves as a lesson in the need for cross-cultural understanding and sensitivity when attempting to effectively work across lines of deep difference.
