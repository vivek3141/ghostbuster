Is the European Union an Incipient Form of Cosmopolitan Democracy? 

The European Union (EU) is a unique political and economic partnership between 27 European countries that has grown in scope and influence since its inception in 1993. While the EU started primarily as an economic collaboration to facilitate free trade and movement between nations, it has evolved into a broader political union with supranational institutions that shape policymaking across many areas of governance. Some theorists argue that the EU demonstrates aspects of an emerging “cosmopolitan democracy” - a form of democracy that transcends national borders and identities, promoting shared governance and political participation across countries. However, the EU also faces significant challenges in achieving key attributes of cosmopolitan democracy, including a shared European identity, transparent and accountable institutions, and greater public participation in EU policymaking.

Proponents argue that the EU evinces key features of cosmopolitan democracy. Most centrally, the EU has supranational institutions, including the European Parliament and Council of the EU, that make policy decisions through intergovernmental cooperation and sometimes override national sovereignty. The EU also protects certain cosmopolitan values, like human rights, rule of law, and liberal democracy, through treaties and charters that member states must uphold. Freedom of movement across borders, through the Schengen area, also reflects a cosmopolitan vision of shared economic and political space. 

However, the EU lacks other important elements of cosmopolitan democracy. Foremost, Europeans do not share a strong collective identity or sense of shared destiny, instead prioritizing their national identities. Public participation and engagement with the EU remains very low, in part because its institutions are perceived as remote, bureaucratic, and lacking transparency or accountability. The influence of larger nations in shaping EU policies also undermines the principle that all citizens have a fair say in decision making.

Proponents argue the EU’s supranational governance and promotion of liberal values represent an incipient form of cosmopolitan democracy that could strengthen over time. However, significant obstacles around identity, participation, and institutional reform pose challenges to achieving a robust cosmopolitan system of democracy in Europe. Overall, while the EU demonstrates some aspects of cosmopolitan democracy, it lacks other important features - especially around shared identity and participation - to fully embody the concept at present. Reforms may be needed to make the EU’s governance more transparent, accountable, and reflective of citizens’ voices across nations if it is to more fully achieve a cosmopolitan democratic vision.

In conclusion, the EU evinces some key features of cosmopolitan democracy, including supranational institutions, promotion of liberal values, and freedom of movement. However, the lack of a shared European identity, limited public participation in EU governance, disproportionate influence of large nations, and perceptions of a “democratic deficit” in its institutions all pose obstacles to the EU fully achieving cosmopolitan democracy. The EU construction thus represents more of a starting point toward cosmopolitan democracy than a fulfillment of the concept. Significant reforms would be needed to make progress toward a robust and participatory form of democracy at the European level.
