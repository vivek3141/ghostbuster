There are several factors that contribute to inequalities in health across populations and countries. Some of the major factors include socioeconomic differences, access to healthcare, health literacy, and behavioral choices. 

Socioeconomic status is one of the biggest factors affecting health inequalities. Those from lower income groups often live in less than ideal conditions with higher exposure to health hazards. They have less access to nutritious food and safe spaces for physical activity. The constant stresses of financial hardship also take a major toll on health. In contrast, those from higher socioeconomic groups can afford healthier lifestyles, have lower health risks, and tend to live longer. Reducing poverty and improving living conditions can help tackle these socioeconomic inequalities in health.

Lack of access to affordable, quality healthcare is another significant contributor to health inequalities. When healthcare is unaffordable or unavailable, health issues go undetected or untreated. Preventive care also lags in these situations, allowing chronic diseases and other health problems to persist and worsen over time. Lack of healthcare is especially problematic for marginalized groups like immigrants, ethnic minorities, disabled individuals or those living in rural/remote areas. Improving access to healthcare through universal healthcare, expansion of free or low-cost clinics, broader health insurance coverage, and investment in healthcare infrastructure can help reduce health inequalities from lack of access.  

Health literacy also plays an important role in health inequalities. Some populations lack awareness and knowledge about health risks, prevention and management of diseases, and available healthcare resources. They may have cultural beliefs or literacy barriers that prevent them from fully understanding health issues. Targeted health education and public health campaigns to improve health literacy in underserved communities can help address these gaps. The information should be conveyed in a culturally sensitive manner and in the appropriate languages and mediums for maximum impact.

Individual behavioral choices and lifestyle factors are also linked to health inequalities. Choices around diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol use, hygiene, etc. can substantially impact health, especially over the long run. Some populations may make less than ideal health choices due to lack of awareness, limited options, or other socioeconomic factors. Health promotion campaigns, financial incentives, and policies such as taxation of unhealthy products or subsidies for nutritious foods are some ways to influence behaviors and improve health equity. However, there also needs to be recognition that individual choices are constrained by the broader environments people live in. Long term changes to structural factors are also needed.

In summary, the major contributors to health inequalities are socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, health literacy, and individual behaviors. Tackling these inequalities will require multidimensional efforts to improve living conditions, make healthcare affordable and accessible to all, promote health education, and support healthy behaviors and choices. Both short-term and long-term policy changes are needed to reduce health disparities and achieve health equity in populations. Overall, a combination of practical initiatives and broader structural changes in society will be most effective in tackling the root causes of health inequalities.
