The demographic trends of early modern England, as interpreted by the seminal work of Wrigley and Schofield in their 1981 book The Population History of England 1541-1871: A reconstruction, were characterized by rapid population growth over the period studied. Wrigley and Schofield estimated that England's population grew from around 2.7 million in 1541 to 9.7 million in 1871, a nearly 4-fold increase over approximately 330 years. This translates to an average growth rate of around 0.45% per year for this period. 

Wrigley and Schofield attributed this rapid growth primarily to declining mortality rates, especially declining infant mortality and mortality from infectious diseases. They estimated that life expectancy at birth increased from around 32-33 years in 1550 to around 42 years in 1870. They argued that fertility rates remained largely stable over this period, with most parishes exhibiting a rate of natural increase close to zero, indicating stable population growth that was enabled primarily by the decline in mortality.

However, this interpretation and the methods used by Wrigley and Schofield have been debated and criticized subsequently. One key area of debate is the relative importance of declining mortality versus increasing fertility in driving the population growth. Some historians, such as R.S. Schofield and E.A. Wrigley, have argued that Wrigley and Schofield underestimated the role of increasing fertility, especially in the 18th century. Wrigley and Schofield estimated fertility using crude birth rates, derived from parish registers. But these were prone to under-registration and thus led to underestimates of true birth rates, especially in the 18th century. Adjusting for this, some historians have argued that fertility rose significantly from the late 17th century, contributing substantially to population growth in addition to declining mortality.

Another methodological criticism of Wrigley and Schofield's work is their reliance on family reconstitution studies to estimate fertility. These studies attempted to link mothers to children in parish registers to estimate fertility rates. However, the poor quality and incompleteness of parish registers made this an unreliable method. Many children went unrecorded, leading to underestimates of fertility. Alternative methods using age-specific marital fertility rates have produced higher fertility estimates, especially for the 18th century, suggesting Wrigley and Schofield substantially underestimated fertility change.

In summary, while Wrigley and Schofield provided groundbreaking work that documented and interpreted remarkable population growth in early modern England from 1541 to 1871, their methodology and conclusions have been debated. Subsequent research suggests they underestimated the role of increasing fertility, especially in the 18th century, in driving population growth. The poor quality of parish register data on which they relied likely led to underestimates of both birth and death rates, understating the role of both declining mortality and increasing fertility. Overall, most modern interpretations point to a complex interplay of both increasing fertility and declining mortality in generating England's demographic transformation.
