The rise of the internet has had a profound impact on the tourism industry, particularly on how tourism products and services are distributed to customers. Traditional electronic distribution channels involve a chain of intermediaries connecting the tourism supplier to the customer. These include global distribution systems (GDSs) which provide a centralized database of products, and travel agencies which help customers search and book the products on the GDSs. 

GDSs were originally developed by airlines but now contain inventory for hotels, car rentals, cruises, and package tours. The major GDSs are Amadeus, Sabre, and Travelport which collectively provide over 90% of flight bookings worldwide. Airlines, hotels and other suppliers upload their product information and rates to the GDSs. Travel agencies then access the GDSs to search and book the products on behalf of customers. Some large travel management companies have also developed their own customized travel portals connected to multiple GDSs. These traditional intermediaries charge fees and commissions for facilitating the transactions between the suppliers and customers.

The rise of the internet has significantly impacted this traditional distribution model and the intermediaries involved. Customers now have direct access to more travel information and the ability to book online, leading to disintermediation of travel agencies. Research shows over 60% of travelers now book at least some portion of their trips online. Major OTAs like Expedia and Booking.com have gained significant market share, offering price comparison and one-stop shopping for travel products. 

Suppliers have also embraced the internet, establishing their own websites and mobile apps to directly reach customers. For example, many airlines now generate over half of their bookings through their own channels. Hotels also receive a large portion of bookings through their own websites, especially for last minute or package deals. The internet provides suppliers a low-cost channel to distribute inventory that they fully control.

The loss of commissions and fees from customer bookings has been damaging for many travel agencies and other intermediaries. However, some agencies remain competitive by focusing on specific market segments, such as corporate travel or luxury travel. They provide additional value through expert knowledge and consulting services.
