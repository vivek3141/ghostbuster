Should DNA samples be retained by police for the purpose of facilitating the detection and prevention of criminal activities and is it in compliance with Article 8(1) and 14 of the European Convention of Human Rights?

The retention of DNA samples by police for the purposes of crime detection and prevention has been a controversial issue, involving a balance between individuals' rights to privacy and the interests of public safety. Article 8(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights protects the right to respect for one's "private and family life, his home and his correspondence." Article 14 prohibits discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights set forth in the Convention.

On the one hand, the retention and use of DNA samples can be argued to violate individuals' right to privacy under Article 8. A person's DNA contains extremely sensitive information about their biology, ancestry, predispositions to diseases, and other traits. Retaining samples indefinitely and using them to detect potential criminal involvement raises privacy concerns, especially if the samples are collected from people never charged or convicted of an offense. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that blanket policies allowing indefinite retention of DNA samples are disproportionate and violate Article 8.

On the other hand, DNA evidence has become crucial for identifying perpetrators of crimes in many cases where there are no other viable leads. Retaining samples, and running them against evidence from unsolved cases, has facilitated the detection and conviction of dangerous offenders who might otherwise escape justice. Most countries have instituted laws allowing police to retain DNA samples for limited time periods and for specific purposes, such as detecting or prosecuting a criminal offense. When properly regulated, the use of DNA in this manner can be compatible with the rights to privacy and non-discrimination.  

To balance these competing interests, DNA retention policies must be narrowly tailored and proportionate to legitimate law enforcement goals. Samples should not be retained indefinitely but instead should be destroyed once they are no longer needed for a specific criminal investigation or prosecution. The type of DNA information analyzed should be limited to non-coding regions unrelated to traits, predispositions or ancestry. Strict rules should govern the use of DNA samples to ensure they are only matched against evidence from identified crimes and not used to conduct large-scale "genetic fishing expeditions." With appropriate regulations and oversight, the retention and use of DNA samples can facilitate crime-solving in a manner consistent with the rights to privacy and non-discrimination under the European Convention of Human Rights.
