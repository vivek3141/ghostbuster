The accounting scandal at Freddie Mac in 2003 dealt a significant blow to the auditing profession and severely damaged its credibility. Freddie Mac, one of the largest government-sponsored enterprises in the U.S., misstated billions of dollars on its financial statements over several years in an attempt to meet investor and regulatory expectations. Its auditor, Arthur Andersen, failed to detect the fraud and issued unqualified audit opinions on the falsified statements. 

The Freddie Mac scandal highlighted major weaknesses in the auditing system and profession. First, it demonstrated the inherent conflicts of interest in the auditor-client relationship. Arthur Andersen had a long and lucrative relationship with Freddie Mac, creating a risk that the auditors would not want to antagonize the client or risk losing its business. The desire to retain clients and revenue may have consciously or unconsciously impacted Arthur Andersenâ€™s objectivity and professional skepticism.  

Second, the scandal revealed deficiencies in auditing standards and practices at the time. Auditors were taking a more principles-based approach rather than following strictly prescribed rules. They also relied too heavily on management representations and did not do enough to verify the accuracy of financial statements independently. These factors allowed Freddie Mac's management to manipulate the books and avoid detection.

Finally, the scandal damaged the reputation of and trust in the auditing profession. Investors and regulators questioned whether audits added real value if they could not uncover such a large fraud. It led to calls for more regulation of the profession, which came in the form of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. That law set higher standards for audits, required auditor independence, and created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to regulate auditors.

To restore credibility, the auditing profession must continuously reevaluate and strengthen its standards. Auditors should follow a rules-based approach to minimize discretion and reinforce independence from clients. They need to exercise greater professional skepticism by verifying more information directly rather than relying on management representations. The PCAOB must also maintain strict oversight of audit firms to ensure compliance with all ethical and technical standards.

The impact of major scandals like Freddie Mac is often vast and long-lasting. But the auditing profession can work to rebuild trust and credibility over time through reform and by reaffirming its commitment to professional integrity, objectivity, and protecting the public interest. With diligence and transparency, the profession can move past this scandal and operate at a higher ethical standard going forward.
