The aim of the experiment conducted by Adelberg, Mandel, and Chen in 1965 was to determine the order of certain genes involved in amino acid and sugar catabolism in Escherichia coli. The researchers used specialized transduction, a process in which bacteriophage transfers host DNA between bacteria, to determine which genes were adjacent to one another on the bacterial chromosome. 

To carry out the experiment, the researchers first selected mutant strains of E. coli that were unable to metabolize certain amino acids or sugars. They then infected these mutant strains with phage P1, which can transduce pieces of bacterial DNA during infection. The phage particles were then used to infect wildtype E. coli. If a phage particle carried the DNA for a particular mutation, it could transduce that mutation to the wildtype cells. By selecting for cells that gained the ability to metabolize certain compounds, the researchers could determine which mutant DNA the phage had transferred.

The results of the experiment established the order of several genes important for amino acid and sugar catabolism. Unexpectedly, the researchers found that the genes for histidine (his), proline (pro), and  lysine (lys) metabolism were very close together, indicating they were likely part of an operon. They also found the genes for lactose (lac) and galactose (gal) metabolism were adjacent. These results demonstrated how genes for related metabolic pathways can be linked in bacteria.

To carry out conjugation, the researchers mated Hfr donor strains of E. coli with F- recipient strains on agar plates. The Hfr strains contained an integrated F plasmid, so they could conjugate plasmid and chromosomal DNA to the recipient cells. Nalidixic acid was included in the plates and salts solution to selectively kill the donor cells after conjugation. By killing the donors, the researchers ensured that any metabolic changes they observed were due to DNA transferred from the donors to the recipients, rather than simple mixing of the strains.

In summary, the researchers used specialized transduction and conjugation to determine the order and linkage of genes important for amino acid and sugar metabolism in E. coli. Their results established that genes for related pathways were often clustered together in operons. The experiment demonstrated the power of microbial genetics techniques for studying bacterial genetics and physiology.
