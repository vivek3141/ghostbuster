Both Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan and Max Weber's political writings explored conceptions of the state and political authority that were distinctively modern. Hobbes's Leviathan, published in 1651, articulated a theory of the social contract and absolute sovereignty that marked a radical break from previous modes of political thought. For Hobbes, individuals in the "state of nature" before government lacked security and comfort, so they established political societies and governments to provide stability. They sacrificed their individual power and consented to the absolute authority of the sovereign. 

This notion of the social contract providing legitimacy to a sovereign's nearly unlimited power was a novel way of thinking about politics that aligned with emerging modern ideas like individualism and rational self-interest. The sovereign in Hobbes's theory gains power not through divine right or tradition but through the consent of the governed. However, Hobbes argued for a level of sovereign authority that appears tyrannical: the subjects cannot rebel or dissent once they establish sovereignty. The state is the only authority that can judge the sovereign's use of power.

Max Weber also articulated a theory of the modern state, though his views differed in key ways from Hobbes. In works like "Politics as a Vocation," Weber argued that the modern state is defined by its successful monopolization of force. Modern political institutions govern through a rational, bureaucratic system of administration and a professional civil service and military. For Weber, the legitimacy of the modern state's authority derives not from a social contract but from popular opinion and recognition of its effectiveness.

Unlike Hobbes, Weber believed that modern rulers' authority could be limited by political values like justice, ethics, and expediency. The subjects retain their capacity for judgment about rulers and policies. Weber was more concerned than Hobbes with defining sovereignty and authority in a way that protects individual liberty and political participation. In this sense, Weber's articulation of the modern state is more recognizably liberal and democratic than Hobbes's notion of absolute sovereignty.

While Hobbes and Weber both explored the concept of sovereignty and political authority in a way that broke from premodern notions of divine right or tradition, their views differed fundamentally on the level of authority granted to the sovereign and whether that authority remained subject to subjects' judgment and consent. Hobbes's Leviathan expressed a view of absolute sovereignty that aligned with modern ideas of individual self-interest but not with modern democratic values. In contrast, Weber's vision of rational, bureaucratic administration and popular legitimacy articulated a recognizably modern yet liberal democratic view of the political system. Overall, comparing these two thinkers highlights the tensions between authority and liberty that continue to shape modern politics.
