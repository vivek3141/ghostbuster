The most likely reason for the development of primate traits is adaptation to living in trees. Several lines of evidence support this theory.

First, the earliest primates originated around 65 million years ago and were adapted to arboreal living. The earliest fossils show evidence of primates with opposable thumbs, strong grasping hands, and a reliance on fruit and leaves, which are more abundant in trees. These adaptations helped primates efficiently forage for food and navigate the canopy. Primates are believed to have descended from tree shrew-like mammals, with primates developing stronger grasping hands, forward-facing eyes for better depth perception, and a flexible spine to aid in climbing. These adaptations provided a selective advantage for an arboreal lifestyle.

Second, modern primates exhibit a number of traits ideal for living in trees, from flexible limbs to dexterous hands to strong grasping muscles. Limbs that can rotate fully in all directions, an opposable thumb, and grasping hands provide primates with a significant advantage for climbing, hanging, and navigating branches. Forward-facing eyes also provide stereoscopic vision and depth perception ideal for jumping between trees and estimating distances. A reliance on fruits, leaves, and some insects as a diet is also consistent with life in the trees.

Third, primates that live mostly in trees, such as lemurs, lorises, spider monkeys, and gibbons exhibit more specialized arboreal adaptations, while ground-dwelling primates like gorillas, baboons, and chimpanzees show adaptations for terrestrial life with more robust bodies, shorter digits, and less dexterous hands. This suggests a correlation between degree of arboreality and anatomical adaptation. The more time a primate spends in trees, the more specialized their traits become for that lifestyle over generations of natural selection. Those on the ground do not need such specialized traits and in some cases have lost certain arboreal features.

In conclusion, the preponderance of evidence from primate origins, anatomy, ecology, and evolutionary relationships supports the theory that adaptation to tree-dwelling life was the primary reason for the initial development of primate traits. While later adaptations allowed some primates to descend to the ground, arboreal adaptation appears to be the most plausible explanation for the origin and diversification of primate characteristics, anatomy, and physiology over millions of years. The alignment between arboreal specialization and anatomical attributes across the primate order provides the most compelling reason for the emergence of primate traits.
