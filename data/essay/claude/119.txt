There is a well-established positive relationship between a nation's income level, as measured by GNI per capita, and the life expectancy of its citizens. In general, as countries become wealthier, life expectancies increase due to improvements in living standards, access to healthcare, education, and overall quality of life. However, the strength of this relationship varies in different regions and income levels. 

Upper middle-income countries, with GNI per capita between $3,956 to $12,235, demonstrate a strong correlation between rising income and longer life expectancies. As these countries, concentrated in Latin America, East Asia, and Eastern Europe, have experienced economic growth and raised per capita incomes over recent decades, their life expectancies have also substantially increased. For example, in China, average life expectancy has increased from 66 years in 1991 to 76 years in 2017, as GNI per capita rose from $1,270 to over $15,000. Similar trends can be observed in Colombia, Brazil, South Africa, and Mexico. Improvements in healthcare, education, infrastructure, and poverty reduction programs have all contributed to longer lifespans.

However, the relationship appears more complex for countries in Central Asia and Europe. In these regions, life expectancy varies significantly at similar income levels, suggesting that other factors such as healthcare systems, environment, and lifestyle may play an equally or even more significant role. For example, life expectancy in Czechia is 79 years with GNI per capita of $22,530, while in the mid-income Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, life expectancy is only 73 and 70 years, respectively, despite GNI per capita levels of $25,920 and $18,220.    

Even at higher income levels, varying levels of life expectancy persist in the Central Asia and European region. The high-income nations of Estonia and Latvia have much lower life expectancies of 77 years, compared to 83 years in Norway and Spain, despite relatively comparable GNI per capita. In contrast, small increases in income can yield large life expectancy gains in the poorest countries where access to basic necessities remains limited. For example, between 2000 to 2015, Tajikistan's GNI per capita rose from $310 to $1,270, and life expectancy increased from 67 to 73 years.

In conclusion, while GNI per capita and life expectancy are positively correlated at a global level, the strength of this relationship depends on a country's income level and geographic region. For upper middle-income countries, significant improvements in life expectancy have accompanied economic growth. However, in Central Asia and Europe, life expectancy varies more widely at similar income levels, indicating that other factors like healthcare, environment, and lifestyle may be equally or more salient in determining longevity. Overall, the relationship between income and life expectancy is not straightforwardâ€”socioeconomic, cultural, and policy contexts shape population health in complex ways.
