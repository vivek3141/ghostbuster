The transition from high school to university is one that brings about numerous changes for emerging young adults, particularly females. One of the most significant changes is moving away from home and family environments for the first time, and developing independence and autonomy over one’s daily life including eating behaviors. For many young women entering university, this transition also coincides with the development of new friendship networks and a desire to fit in, which can influence eating habits and the risk of disordered eating.

The effects of moving away from home for the first time have been shown to significantly impact the eating behaviors of female students in their first year of university. Without the direct supervision, control and meal preparation of parents, young women are left to make their own choices about what, when and how much to eat each day. For some, this newfound independence and flexibility can lead to less healthy eating habits and weight gain, known as the “Freshman 15.” For others, the stress and anxiety associated with this life transition may manifest as a loss of appetite, irregular eating, or other unhealthy patterns.

A study by Nelson et al. (2008) compared the eating habits of first year female university students to non-university females of the same age. They found that university women ate fewer family meals, had a higher consumption of fast food and snacks, and were more likely to report unhealthy weight loss behaviors. The university environment promotes an “on the go” lifestyle with little time for regular meals, while constant exposure to unhealthy food options exacerbates poor eating habits. Without the structure of family mealtimes, young women must learn to plan and prepare meals themselves, a challenging skill that often develops through trial and error.  

For university women, the desire to fit in with a new peer group also strongly influences eating behaviors during this formative first year. Making friends and integrating into university social circles becomes a top priority, and young women may alter their eating habits to match those of new friends or potential friends, even if it means engaging in unhealthy behaviors. A longitudinal study by Eisenberg et al. (2011) found that perceived peer support for eating and exercise habits in university women predicted changes in those behaviors over the first semester.
