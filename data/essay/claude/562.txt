To a significant extent, Judaeo-Christian theology inspired the development of English common law and the secular legal profession. However, this influence should not be overstated. While core theological principles of justice, morality, and equity helped shape common law and the role of lawyers, the practical necessities of governing the realm and resolving disputes were equally important in motivating legal evolution. 

The English common law grew in the Middle Ages during a period when Christianity was a dominant force in society. Key Judeo-Christian teachings emphasizing justice, morality and fairness helped inspire common law's essential character. For example, Sir John Fortescue in the 15th century explicitly cited the Bible to argue that God demands justice, which entails fair legal proceedings and good governance. The common law maxim that 'no man may be judge in his own cause' reflects scriptural notions of impartiality and objectivity. 

However, Fortescue and other jurists were also motivated by more practical secular considerations. In Fortescue's governance treatise The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy, he aimed to legitimize English laws to counter the spread of Roman civil law. He emphasized that unlike 'written' Roman law, the common law was tailored to English customs and habits. Thus, Judeo-Christian theology was a means to an end to justify common law's independence.

The development of the secular legal profession was also inspired by a combination of religious and practical motivations. For instance, William Dugdale's Origines Juridiciales (1666) traces the history of English laws and lawyers to argue that long usage and 'ancient constitution' legitimized the independence of common law courts. While Dugdale notes their ecclesiastical origins, his work aimed to establish the historical pedigree of common law and lawyers' privileges against church interference. 

Similarly, Sir Edward Coke championed the common law against the king's perceived tyranny and the church's encroachment. In Dr. Bonham's case (1610), Coke cited 'natural reason' and the 'common law' to invalidate a statute that contradicted 'common right and reason'. While Coke was influenced by Protestant beliefs, his motivations were jurisdictional - to curb rival royal and clerical power over the law. Hence, religious theology informed but did not fully determine his defense of common law and the legal profession.

In conclusion, Judaeo-Christian teachings were a basis for common law and lawyers in a community permeated by Christian faith. But the interaction between theology, politics and law was complex. Jurists evoked scripture and religion to legitimize the common law against external threats, as much as out of commitment to Judeo-Christian values themselves. Theology infused common law with moral purpose but practical politics were equally significant in shaping its character and securing the independence of lawyers. Both divine and human reasoning inspired the English legal tradition.
