Shame, guilt, and embarrassment are related but distinct emotions. They are triggered by different causes and manifest themselves in different ways.

Shame arises from a perceived failure to live up to one's internalized ideals or to match the expectations of one's social group. It involves a painful personal reflection about one's perceived defects or flaws. For example, someone may feel ashamed if they are struggling with addiction, if they failed to achieve an important goal, or if they did something publicly that violated their personal values. Shame is intensely painful because it strikes at one's sense of identity and self-esteem. The desire to avoid shame can be a powerful motivator of behavior and decision making. 

Guilt, on the other hand, arises from a perceived moral transgression or failure to fulfill a duty or obligation. It is caused by a belief that one did something bad or wrong. For example, someone may feel guilty if they lied to a friend, broke a promise, or caused harm to another person. Guilt involves remorse over one's actions rather than one's perceived character flaws. While still unpleasant, guilt is less painful than shame because it is more focused on a specific behavior rather than a person's worth or identity. Guilt can also motivate people to make amends through apologies, changed behavior, or repairing harm caused.

Embarrassment arises from perceived social awkwardness or loss of status in front of others. It is triggered by events that make one feel conspicuous, ashamed, or humiliated. For example, someone may feel embarrassed if they tripped and fell in public, called someone by the wrong name, or were the subject of an awkward social interaction. Embarrassment is usually temporary and less painful than shame, though it can still be an uncomfortable experience. The desire to avoid embarrassment leads people to monitor how they are perceived by others and to follow social norms of politeness and propriety. 

In summary, while shame, guilt, and embarrassment are related social emotions, they have distinct causes and impacts. Shame arises from perceived personal flaws, guilt from perceived misbehavior, and embarrassment from perceived social awkwardness. All three aim to maintain personal and social coherence, but they do so in different ways reflective of their different origins and purposes. By understanding these differences, we can gain insight into human motivation, relationships, and the factors that shape identity and moral development.
