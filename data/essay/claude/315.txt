Temperature sensors play a crucial role in Formula One racing by enabling teams to monitor the temperature of tyres during races. By tracking tyre temperatures, teams can make strategic decisions about tyre changes and ensure the safety of drivers. Overheating tyres can lead to blowouts at high speeds, so temperature control and monitoring are critical.  

The most common types of temperature sensors used in Formula One are piezoelectric sensors and surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors. Piezoelectric sensors use crystals that generate an electric current when subjected to mechanical stress. As the temperature of the tyre changes, the crystal experiences small changes in size and shape that alter the electric current, allowing the temperature to be measured. SAW sensors use high-frequency acoustic waves that travel across the surface of a piezoelectric substrate. The velocity of these waves depends on the temperature of the substrate, so by measuring the time of flight of the waves, temperature can be determined.

These sensors are embedded at multiple locations within each tyre to monitor temperature during races. As a race progresses and tyres heat up due to friction with the road, the sensors relay temperature information back to teams. If any part of the tyre exceeds safe operating temperatures, the team can order a driver to make a pit stop to change tyres before there is risk of failure. The large forces and high speeds involved in Formula One racing mean that even a small overheating can lead to a blowout, so constant temperature monitoring and control are essential safety measures.

The sensors used must be highly precise, accurate, and able to withstand the harsh conditions within the tyres without impacting performance. They must continue transmitting data even when tyres are subjected to high g-forces while cornering and braking. The temperature information is transmitted wirelessly from the sensors to antennas on the wheel hubs, which then relays the data to the team. Real-time temperature data allows for dynamic decision making that can determine the outcome of a race.

In addition to monitoring tyre temperatures during races, the data collected by these sensors are used by teams to better understand tyre wear over time and make improvements in tyre design. By analyzing temperature profiles from multiple races, teams can identify any overheating or unusual wear patterns and make adjustments to tyre compounds and construction to optimize performance and safety. Temperature sensing is thus not only crucial during actual races but also provides important data for longer-term vehicle and tyre development.

Temperature measurement using piezoelectric and SAW sensors has applications beyond Formula One racing. These sensor types are used in many automotive systems to monitor component temperatures and enable control systems. For example, they are used in brake systems to detect overheating, in engines to monitor coolant and oil temperatures, and in batteries to track cell temperatures. Their high precision, durability, and wireless functionality make them well suited for use in demanding automotive environments. Temperature sensing is a crucial element of vehicle design, control, and safety across the automotive industry.
