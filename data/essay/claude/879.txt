Nonsense poetry deliberately subverts traditional conventions of language and poetic form to create a playful and absurdist effect. By abandoning rules of logic, grammar, and semantics, nonsense poetry frees words from their usual meanings and expected sequences. This allows for unexpected and whimsical juxtapositions of words and ideas that can tap into the creative power of language unfettered from its standard procedures and functions. 

Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll are two of the most well-known practitioners of nonsense poetry. Works like Lear's "The Owl and the Pussycat" and Carroll's "Jabberwocky" employ neologisms, portmanteau words, and nonsensical phrases and sentences to create a dreamlike and absurdist quality. For example, in "Jabberwocky" Carroll coins words like "brillig," "slithy," and "toves" that have no actual meaning but evoke a sense of whimsy through their sound and construction. By liberating words from their usual meanings, nonsense poetry allows us to appreciate the musicality, rhyme, rhythm, and aesthetic quality of language rather than just its semantic content.

Nonsense poetry also challenges our views on poetic form and meter. While poetry often follows established rules of rhyme, rhythm, and structure, nonsense poetry tends to bend or break these conventions to surprising effect. Unexpected and irregular rhymes, rhythms, and line lengths disrupt poetic form in creative ways. For example, Lear's limericks have an erratic and absurd logic in their rhyme scheme and rhythm, with lines of uneven length and stress. Nonsense poetry pushes the limits of poetic form to explore new possibilities in language.

By rejecting the constraints of logical meaning and traditional poetic form, nonsense poetry achieves a kind of liberating absurdism and linguistic playfulness. Its illogical leaps, absurd images, and whimsical rhythms and rhymes tap into the creative potential of language freed from the bounds of sense and convention. Nonsense poetry reminds us that poetry can be much more than just a medium for expressing ideasâ€”it can also be a vehicle for pure aesthetic delight and linguistic adventure. Through its defiance of rules and reveling in the absurd, nonsense poetry expands our view of what poetry is and can be.
