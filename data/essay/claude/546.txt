The magnitude of the magnetic field around a wire can be calculated using the Biot-Savart law and a selected integration path. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field dB produced by a current element Idl is proportional to the current, length of the element, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance r from the element. 

To calculate the total magnetic field around a wire, we need to integrate the contributions from all the current elements along the wire. We first select an integration path, which is a curve surrounding the wire where we want to calculate the magnetic field. A common choice is the Amp√®re circuital law path, which is a circle centered on the wire. Next, we determine the incremental current element Idl, which depends on the current through the wire I and the length of the path element dl. 

Then, for each element Idl, we calculate the magnetic field magnitude dB using the Biot-Savart law. We determine the distance r from each current element to the point at which we want to calculate the field along the integration path.  The direction of each dB element is perpendicular to the plane formed by Idl and the unit vector connecting Idl to the field point. By vector addition, we sum all the dB contributions to get the total magnetic field magnitude along our selected path.  

Finally, to get the full magnetic field vector at any point, we evaluate the total dB at many points along any closed curve surrounding the wire. The magnitude of the resulting total B vector is the strength of the magnetic field at that point in space. By systematically varying the position around the wire, we can map the entire magnetic field and visualize how it varies as a function of distance from the wire. In this way, the Biot-Savart law and path integration enable us to calculate the magnitude and vector direction of the magnetic field for any desired point in space around a long straight wire.
