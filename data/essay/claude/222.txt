The Human Relations Theory (HRT) focuses on the social and psychological needs of employees in organizations. It emphasizes that employees' performance and satisfaction are influenced by social relations and team dynamics at work. To maximize productivity, HRT suggests that managers should create a collaborative environment, build emotional connections among employees, satisfy their social needs, and empower teamworking.

One of the key propositions of HRT is that employees have social and emotional needs beyond economic rewards. Satisfying employees' needs for affiliation, esteem, and belongingness is crucial for motivation and work performance. For instance, team lunches, recreational activities, and friendship networks at work allow employees to bond and fulfill their social needs. When social needs are met, employees tend to be more satisfied, loyal, and productive. However, taken to the extreme, an overemphasis on social relations may lead to favoritism and conflict, undermining task completion.

Teamworking is another important notion of HRT. Collaboration and team spirit can enhance work motivation and problem-solving capacity. Nevertheless, teamworking also has its limits. Interpersonal tensions, power struggles, and free-riding are common challenges. Team goals may also be prioritized over organizational goals. Therefore, a balance between individual and teamwork is needed. Managers should foster team cohesion and dynamics while also evaluating individual contributions.

HRT recognizes that control mechanisms based on strict supervision and monetary penalties are inadequate and even counterproductive. Instead, control should rely on shared social norms, trust, and commitment to achieve cooperation and consent. However, soft controls and self-regulation can be difficult to implement and may lead to loss of managerial control. Manipulation techniques, such as creating the illusion of participation, can also be unethical and damage the employment relationship in the long run.

In summary, HRT provides a social perspective on management that complements the classical theories. It highlights the importance of satisfying employees' social needs, empowering teamworking, and using soft controls to gain cooperation. However, balance is needed to optimize productivity and avoid potential downsides. Practically, managers can implement regular teambuilding activities, evaluate both team and individual performance, establish shared goals, and make great effort to communicate organizational values and vision.
