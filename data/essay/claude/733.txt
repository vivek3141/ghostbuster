George Moore's depiction of Esther Waters in his novel Esther Waters and Thomas Hardy's portrayal of Tess in Tess of the D'Urbervilles feature two heroines who encounter similar circumstances as single mothers and fallen women, yet face starkly different consequences. While Esther ultimately finds contentment and independence, Tess suffers a tragic downfall. Several key factors contribute to these diverging fates. 

First, Esther and Tess come from disparate social backgrounds that shape their outlooks and options in life. Esther grows up in poverty and must work as a servant to earn her bread, giving her a pragmatic and persevering mindset. By contrast, Tess comes from a more privileged family that has fallen on hard times, and she is unaccustomed to hardship. When crises arise, Esther stoically shoulders her burdens while Tess struggles to adapt. Their backgrounds thus set Esther up for relative success and Tess for suffering.

Second, the two authors espouse contrasting views on morality and sexuality that influence how they treat their heroines. Moore takes a liberal stance, portraying Esther's "fall" and out-of-wedlock pregnancy with compassion. He suggests such actions need not ruin a woman's life. Hardy adopts a more conservative moral position in line with Victorian social conventions. He implies Tess's experience of premarital sex and unmarried motherhood irrevocably stains her purity and virtue. This difference in authorial morality translates to a happy ending for Esther but a woeful finale for Tess.

Finally, Esther and Tess exhibit diverging attitudes in how they face their troubles that impact their destinies. Esther accepts responsibility for her actions but does not see herself as irredeemably tainted. She continues striving to improve her situation through hard work and perseverance. Tess, on the other hand, internalizes social prejudices against "fallen women." She sees her misfortune as a sign of her own brokenness, which cripples her ability to change her circumstances. Esther's resolve and self-belief allow her to propel herself to security, whereas Tess's resignation leads to her tragic descent.  

In conclusion, George Moore and Thomas Hardy create two complex and compelling heroines in Esther Waters and Tess of the D'Urbervilles. Although the women encounter similar difficulties, the authors' contrasting social and moral viewpoints as well as the characters' diverging attitudes and life experiences lead to their vastly different fates. Esther's pragmatic optimism and fortitude bring her salvation, while Tess's despair and self-blame end in catastrophe. The novels thus highlight how society's judgements and women's own responses to adversity can either redeem or condemn them.
