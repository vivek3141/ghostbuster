In the last five decades, there have been significant changes in the social, political, and economic status of women in Britain. These changes have had a profound impact on how women access and interact with urban spaces in cities and towns. 

Socially, women's roles have evolved from primarily homemakers to include pursuit of higher education and careers. Women today make up nearly half of undergraduate students and graduates in the UK, and their participation in the workforce has increased from 53% in 1971 to nearly 75% today. As women's lives have expanded beyond the domestic sphere, their use of urban spaces for work, education, and leisure has increased dramatically. However, public spaces have not always accommodated women's needs. 

Politically, women have achieved greater representation and rights over the last 50 years. British women obtained the right to vote in 1918 and have since made up an increasing share of political representatives in local and national government. Legislation like the 1970 Equal Pay Act and the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act has given women greater economic and social freedoms and protections under the law. However, many public spaces continue to reflect a legacy of design primarily by and for men that does not fully consider women's experiences of safety, comfort, and access. 

Economically, women have achieved greater financial independence, now making up nearly half of the workforce and contributing substantially to household incomes. While women still face a gender pay gap, their economic gains have given them greater ease of access to urban spaces for both necessity and leisure. Nevertheless, the cost of living in major cities like London remains high, posing challenges for single women and single mothers in particular. 

In conclusion, political, social and economic changes have given British women greater freedom to inhabit and utilize urban spaces over the last 50 years. However, designers and policymakers must make further efforts to address women's priorities of safety, affordability and accommodation of changing life roles within these spaces. Public spaces that encourage women's full participation are essential for building more equitable, socially sustainable cities that serve the needs of all citizens. Overall, the changing status of women has brought both new opportunities as well as new challenges in accessing and enjoying urban spaces. With attention to these, cities can design public spaces that support women's full participation in community life.
