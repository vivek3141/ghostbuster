The Renaissance period in Europe, spanning from approximately the 14th century to the 17th century, brought about significant changes in how people viewed themselves and their place in the world. During the Middle Ages, people in Europe largely saw themselves through a religious lens and subjected themselves to the strict hierarchy of the Catholic Church. However, the combination of factors such as the scientific revolution, the Protestant Reformation, and the rediscovery of ancient Greek and Roman texts contributed to a more individualistic and human-centered worldview emerging during the Renaissance. This shifting sense of self and identity was reflected in the literature of the time, with protagonists taking control of their destinies and authors emphasizing human agency and reasoning.

The Protestant Reformation was a key factor that led to what scholars have termed the "Renaissance self" during this period. Martin Luther and other reformers challenged the strict authority and doctrines of the Catholic Church, encouraging people to develop a personal relationship with God through reading and interpreting the Bible themselves. This reduced the role of powerful institutions as intermediaries and contributed to the view of individuals as more autonomous. Similarly, the scientific revolution inspired new ways of thinking centered on human reason and empirical observation rather than religious doctrine. Key figures like Francis Bacon advocated systematic scientific methods based on gathering evidence through human senses and logic. This exaltation of human intellectual capacities and reasoning helped fuel a more individualistic Renaissance self-identity. 

Renaissance literature reflected this newfound sense of human agency and capacity for rational thought. For example, in The Prince, Machiavelli took a rational approach to politics and governance focused on practical advice rather than moralizing. His work assumed individuals could shape political events through their own will and actions. Meanwhile, Montaigne pioneered the essay form to explore ideas and the human experience through a personal lens. His Essays featured introspective musings and celebrated human consciousness and curiosity. Powerful literary characters like Shakespeare's Hamlet exemplified the Renaissance ideal of man as a reasoning, self-determining being at the center of his own story. Hamlet takes the future into his own hands and shapes events around him through the force of his mind and actions. This sense of human potency and free will represented a sharp departure from more fatalistic medieval views.  

In conclusion, the Renaissance period in Europe brought about a flowering of humanism and new ways of thinking that placed mankind at the center of events. Advancements in science, religion, and philosophy all contributed to the rise of a new "Renaissance self" as an autonomous, rational being ultimately in control of its own destiny. This rediscovered sense of human agency and capacity for free choice shaped new forms of literature with empowered protagonists and an emphasis on human reasoning, curiosity, and potential. The Renaissance saw a flourishing of human possibility and a belief that man could shape the world around him through the strength of his intellect and determination of will. Overall, this period marked the rise of a more humanist worldview that would endure for centuries.
