Psychology, the scientific study of the human mind and human behavior, is contributing important insights to the debate about the role of humans in changing and damaging the planet. Humans have contributed to a variety of problems facing the planet today, including climate change, pollution, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity.  As these issues intensify, there is an ongoing debate around what, if anything, humanity should do to mitigate and adapt to these changes to the environment. Psychology research is helping to clarify how humans think about and perceive their relationship with the environment, how this influences their behaviors that impact the planet, and which types of interventions and policies might be most effective in promoting more sustainable practices.

 Several areas of psychology are particularly relevant to this debate. Environmental psychology examines how humans interact with and are influenced by environments, including their surrounding natural environments. Research in this field shows that exposure to nature has benefits for both physical and psychological well-being. It also shows how living in built environments with less exposure to nature can negatively impact behaviors, health, and a sense of connection to the natural world. This suggests that efforts to provide more green spaces and access to nature could promote more pro-environmental ways of thinking and sustainable behaviors. 

Another key contribution comes from research on human cognition and decision making. This work shows how people tend to discount the importance of future and distant events, have biases that favor the status quo, and make judgments that conform to social norms. These tendencies mean that humanity is collectively not predisposed to adequately consider and act on long-term environmental threats like climate change. Understanding these cognitive barriers can help in crafting effective interventions, communication strategies, and policy solutions that counteract them. Research on moral reasoning and values is also relevant, as people's values and ideological beliefs strongly influence their views on environmental issues. Understanding how values interact with views on the environment can help in appealing to people's moral motivations for protecting the planet.

Overall, psychology is providing important insights into the human dimensions of environmental harms and solutions. By illuminating how people think about and interact with the natural world, the cognitive and social barriers that limit pro-environmental behaviors, and the values and motivations that influence views on sustainability, psychology can help guide interventions and policies to promote changes needed to ensure a healthy planet for future generations. With increased focus on environmental sustainability, the field of environmental psychology and the study of human cognition as it applies to understanding our relationship with nature will likely expand in coming years. Their contributions will be crucial to overcoming humanity's shortsightedness and reshaping how we think about and act towards the environment that sustains us.
