John Locke's theory of consent as articulated in his Second Treatise of Government lays out the idea that governments are legitimate only through the consent of the governed, either through an express agreement or tacitly, through accepting the benefits and protections of society without objection. However, Locke's theory of consent has several significant flaws and omissions that weaken its persuasiveness.  

First, Locke's notion of express consent is unrealistic in practice for most societies. Except in very small communities, it is not feasible to have every member of a society explicitly consent to being governed or consent to the specific form of government. For large, modern nation-states encompassing millions of citizens, there is no mechanism by which express consent could be achieved or demonstrated. Locke sidesteps this issue by focusing on the original establishment of society through express consent, but for any established state today, express consent of all citizens is implausible.

Second, tacit consent is too easily assumed and too passive a means of consent for it to be genuinely meaningful. By accepting the benefits of a society or government, Locke argues that one has tacitly consented to that government's authority. However, there are many reasons one might accept such benefits without genuinely consenting to the authority - one may have no reasonable alternative or choice, or one may disagree with the government but accept the benefits as a practical necessity of life. Tacit consent that is essentially passive acquiescence to authority is not a robust theory of consent or legitimacy. More active and explicit demonstration of consent is required.

Third, Locke fails to adequately consider circumstances where consent is coerced or misinformed. If one's choice is between consenting to a government's authority or facing severe penalties, then any consent given in such a situation is not truly voluntary. Similarly, if consent is gained through manipulation, deceit, or control of information, it cannot be said to genuinely reflect the will of the people. Locke does not grapple with these issues in depth, but they pose a serious challenge to any consent-based theory of legitimacy.

In conclusion, while Locke's theory of tacit and express consent represented an important step in articulating the ideal that governments should have the consent of the governed, it has several flaws that undermine its persuasiveness and completeness as a theory of political legitimacy based on consent. More robust conceptions of consent that address the issues of scale, meaningful consent, and circumstances of coerced or misinformed consent are needed to remedy the flaws and omissions in Locke's arguments.
