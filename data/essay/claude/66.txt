To a significant extent, current Western understandings of Asia remain informed by Orientalist assumptions. Orientalism refers to the tendency to depict and represent “the East” in essentialist terms as exotic, mystical, and uncivilized. This attitude was particularly prevalent in 18th and 19th century colonial Western scholarship but persists in subtler forms today.

One example of how Orientalist assumptions continue to shape Western views of Asia is the tendency to depict Asian cultures and societies as static and unchanging. There is an assumption that Asian countries have remained largely the same for centuries, tied to ancient traditions and resistant to modernization. In reality, Asia is a highly diverse region that has been subject to enormous political, cultural, and social changes, especially in the last century. Countries like Japan, China, and India are at the forefront of global innovation and progress. However, the West continues to perceive them through an outdated lens as tied to a mysterious, unchanging past.

Another problematic assumption is the tendency to depict Asian people as exotic “others.” There is a long history in Western culture of fetishizing and stereotyping Asian cultures and bodies. Contemporary examples include the oversexualization of Asian women in Western media or the appropriation of aspects of Asian culture like yoga or traditional dress. While meant to celebrate diversity, these acts continue the historical pattern of objectifying and othering Asian people to satisfy Western curiosity. They deny the humanity, subjectivity and lived realities of individuals in favor of superficial stereotypes.

A third Orientalist trope is the tendency to depict Asia as a zone of political and moral backwardness in need of Western guidance and intervention. For centuries, the West has seen itself as a beacon of democracy, human rights, and ethical values - in contrast with a primitive, oppressive East. While human rights abuses and undemocratic governments are present in some Asian countries, the perception of Asia as lawless, tyrannical and in need of Western leadership is a convenient fiction to justify interventionism. It also ignores the diversity of political systems and values across Asia.  

In conclusion, while some progress has been made, Western understandings of Asia remain limited by the historical legacy of Orientalism. Depicting Asia as unchanging, exotic and backward continues to undermine appreciation of the diversity, modernity, and humanity of Asian cultures and societies. Challenging ingrained Orientalist assumptions is an ongoing process that requires openness, humility, and a willingness to listen rather than make superficial judgments. With enhanced cultural exchange and education, the West's perceptions of Asia can become more complex, nuanced and empathetic. But escaping the shadow of Orientalism will require continuous self-reflection and effort.
