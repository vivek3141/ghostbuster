During the Tudor era in England, London faced numerous challenges that threatened to destabilize the city, including overpopulation, disease outbreaks, social inequality, and the presence of "strangers" or foreigners. While the government instituted some measures to maintain order, smaller organisations such as guilds, companies, and parishes also played an important role in controlling problems and ensuring stability in London. 

One of the biggest issues facing Tudor London was overpopulation, as the city's population grew rapidly from around 50,000 in 1500 to over 200,000 by 1600. The overcrowding led to poor living conditions, the spread of disease, and increased poverty. The guilds helped mitigate some of the negative impacts of overpopulation by regulating trade and commerce in the city. They controlled the number of people in different trades and restricted competition, helping their members earn a living wage and maintain certain standards of living. The companies, on the other hand, were associations of merchants from the same trade or place of origin, and they provided support networks for poorer migrants coming to London from other areas.

Outbreaks of disease, especially the plague, were another persistent problem in Tudor London. The government's attempts to control disease were limited, so parish organizations took on the responsibility for regulating public health. They organized cleaning of streets, closed down infected houses, and restricted movement into and out of infected parishes. While the measures were not always effective, the parishes at least provided some local response to health crises. They also offered medical care and financial assistance to the sick, helping contain disease outbreaks and support those afflicted.

Vast inequality was a concern in Tudor London, with a large, impoverished population living in constant hardship. Charitable institutions, including hospitals, orphanages, and almshouses, provided relief for the poor, sick, disabled and elderly. These institutions were funded by private donations from wealthier groups, showing how Londoners came together voluntarily to aid the most marginalized groups in society. The hospitals and almshouses, in particular, helped house vulnerable groups, giving them shelter and sustenance and reducing vagrancy and homelessness in the city.

Finally, the presence of strangers or foreigners, especially religious refugees and migrants from abroad, threatened stability in Tudor London. While government policy towards strangers fluctuated, companies provided them support and helped integrate them into city life. The French Protestant and Dutch churches, for instance, offered immigrants religious services and community. The companies also gave strangers a means to continue practicing their trades, gain citizenship, and establish themselves economically and socially. By facilitating the assimilation of immigrant groups, the companies promoted tolerance and diversity in London.

In conclusion, while Tudor London grappled with various issues that could have undermined order, smaller organizations including guilds, companies, parishes, charities, and religious associations all worked to control specific problems and maintain stability. They complemented and at times supplemented the government's efforts through localized, grassroots initiatives aimed at managing overpopulation, disease, poverty, and immigration in the city. Overall, these smaller organizations were largely effective in promoting regulation, welfare, and cohesion in Tudor London.
