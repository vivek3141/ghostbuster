The Stacy family faced immense stress and uncertainty when their 12-year-old daughter, Jenny, was hospitalized for a ruptured appendix and post-surgical complications. According to the Neuman systems model, humans are made up of a core structure surrounded by flexible lines of defense and resistance that help maintain stability in response to stressors (Neuman & Fawcett, 2011). When Jenny first experienced abdominal pain from a ruptured appendix, her normal flexible line of defense was breached, creating instability in her system. The stress on Jenny's body from the infection and surgery also reverberated outward to her family system, challenging their flexible lines of defense and resistance as they worked to support her.  

The time leading up to Jenny's hospitalization was stressful for the Stacy family as they tried to determine the cause of her worsening abdominal pain. By the time she was admitted to the emergency room, the infection from her ruptured appendix had spread, and her vital signs were unstable. The immediate medical crisis breached both Jenny's and her family's usual flexible lines of defense, threatening their stability and sense of normalcy. The stress on a family from a child's medical emergency and hospitalization can be overwhelming and even traumatic ( Franck et al., 2004). For the Stacys, their daughter's rupture appendix created a crisis that penetrated their flexible lines of defense and threatened the stability of their family unit.

Jenny's parents, in particular, devoted all of their energy to caring for their daughter in her time of need to promote her healing and return her system to stability. They spent long days and nights at the hospital to comfort Jenny as much as possible through her pain, tests, and treatments. This constant presence and advocacy came at the cost of their own basic needs and self-care, which depleted their resources and ability to resist and adapt to the ongoing stress. Their flexible lines of defense were weakened by persistent anxiety over their daughter's condition, physical exhaustion, lack of sleep and nutrition, and time away from their normal routines and responsibilities. They channeled most of their emotional, mental, and physical resources into aiding their daughter's recovery, leaving little to strengthen their own lines of resistance.  

The Neuman systems model considers the effects of stressors not just on the individual but on the family unit (Neuman & Fawcett, 2011). The Stacy family's usual stability and daily rhythms were upended by the crisis of Jenny's hospitalization, creating disruption and instability for the entire system. With their lives revolving around Jenny for nearly 2 weeks in the hospital, the family's flexible lines of defense were altered in a way that caused distress for all members. Jenny's 15-year-old brother, Andrew, stayed with his grandparents during much of the hospitalization, missing school and his normal activities. His level of distress over his sister's illness manifested in acting out at school, as his own lines of defense were breached by the crisis.  

The Neuman systems model focuses on interventions to strengthen a client's flexible lines of defense and resistance to facilitate optimal stability and health (Neuman & Fawcett, 2011). For the Stacy family, interventions included social support from extended family and friends, trusting relationships with compassionate healthcare providers, breaks for basic self-care needs, and counseling to process their experiences. As Jenny's condition improved and her health was restored, the stability of the family system as a whole began to strengthen and return to a state of normalcy with more resilience against future stressors. Their flexible lines of defense were reinforced, and they developed stronger lines of resistance having weathered and overcome such a difficult experience together.

In summary, Jenny Stacy's hospitalization for a ruptured appendix and post-surgical infection created immense instability and stress within her system and reverberated outward to her family. According to the Neuman systems model, the crisis breached their usual flexible lines of defense and taxed their ability to resist the associated effects. The interventions and support provided helped strengthen their lines of defense and resistance to facilitate Jenny's health and stability, as well as the wellbeing and functioning of the family system as a whole. With Jenny's recovery and discharge from the hospital, the Stacy family developed an increased resilience and capacity to adapt in the face of future stressors.
