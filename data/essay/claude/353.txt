Deliberate and emergent strategies represent two approaches to developing and implementing strategies in organizations. A deliberate strategy is one that is consciously determined in advance through a formal planning process. In contrast, an emergent strategy emerges over time as patterns develop in the organization's decisions and actions. There are advantages and disadvantages to both deliberate and emergent strategy making.

A key advantage of a deliberate strategy is that it provides direction and guidance. The formal planning process allows an organization to establish specific goals and objectives, determine how to allocate resources, and outline a course of action to achieve the desired results. For example, in the 1960s, Honda deliberately pursued a strategy to enter and succeed in the U.S. motorcycle market. They studied the market for over a decade, developed products they felt would appeal to American consumers, and built a marketing and distribution strategy to support their objectives. This deliberate planning paid off as Honda successfully captured much of the U.S. motorcycle market in the 1970s. 

However, deliberate strategies also have some disadvantages. For one, they require a significant investment in time and resources which may be wasted if the plans prove incorrect. The strategies are also less flexible and adaptable. They can discourage discovery and experimentation, and risks missing opportunities that emerge unexpectedly. If Honda had stuck rigidly to their initial plans, they may have missed the opportunity to expand into the automobile market, where they gained significant success in the 1970s and beyond. 

In contrast, emergent strategies arise from small, incremental steps over time that reflect learning and adaptation. The primary advantage of emergent strategies is that they are flexible and open to new opportunities as they emerge. For example, Coca-Cola did not have a deliberate strategy to develop the market for bottled beverages but rather developed a bottled Coke product in response to customer demand, which emerged into a highly successful strategy. Emergent strategies also have lower costs and risks because small actions are taken over time based on learning and adjustments.

However, emergent strategies also have some disadvantages, such as lack of direction or progress monitored against specific goals. Without any deliberate planning, an organization may drift or stall in decision making. Not every opportunity that emerges leads to an optimal strategy. And organizations that are primarily reactive may miss the chance to shape the environment or meet future challenges proactively. 

In conclusion, I believe successful organizations use a combination of both deliberate and emergent strategies. They develop broad plans and visions through deliberate strategic thinking but remain open and flexible to emergent opportunities. The deliberate plans guide the overall direction while emergent strategies allow for learning, adaptation, and new discoveries. Using both approaches helps organizations minimize the disadvantages of each while maximizing the benefits. Overall, while deliberate strategy making remains important to establish goals and gain commitment, emergent strategy making is the most crucial to keep organizations agile and able to thrive in a fast-changing environment.
