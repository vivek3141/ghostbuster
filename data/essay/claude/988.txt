There is considerable evidence for the emergence of craft specialization and exchange networks within the Aegean Neolithic. As permanent agricultural settlements developed, populations grew and became more sedentary. This allowed for certain individuals to develop crafting skills and specialize in particular trades rather than sustain themselves solely through subsistence farming. These specialists produced goods that were distributed through networks of exchange, sometimes over relatively long distances. 

Obsidian, a volcanic glass used to produce cutting tools, provides some of the earliest evidence for specialized production and exchange. Obsidian sources in the Aegean, like the islands of Melos and Giali, have been found at Neolithic sites across the region, indicating the material was quarried at the sources, crafted into tools, and exchanged over hundreds of kilometers. For example, obsidian from Melos has been found at Franchthi Cave in the Argolid, over 200km away, and at Knossos on Crete, over 100km distant. The distribution of distinctive types of obsidian shows that exchange networks were in place by the mid-7th millennium BCE to move the material from the sources to sites where it was crafted into tools for consumption.

Ceramics also provide evidence for specialization and exchange. During the Middle Neolithic, from c.5000-4500 BCE, a distinctive ceramic style known as the "ceramic Knossos painted style" emerged on Crete. These vessels feature bold geometric designs painted in red, white, and black on a buff background. Examples of this style have been found not just across Crete but also at sites in the Cyclades and mainland Greece, indicating specialized potters on Crete were producing pottery for distribution through exchange networks. Meanwhile, in the Northern Aegean, "Grey Minyan Ware" pottery was produced from the mid-4th millennium BCE. This high-quality pottery featured burnished grey surfaces and was widely traded, with examples found from Bulgaria to Cyprus. The distribution of these distinctive pottery styles points to specialized production at "origin centers" followed by exchange through coastal trade and over land.

However, there are limitations and ambiguities in the evidence. Not all pottery and tools found at Aegean sites came through specialized exchange networks - locally produced goods have also been found. For obsidian, the exact mechanisms of exchange and whether it was raw material or finished tools that were traded remain unclear. For ceramics, it can be difficult to determine exactly where a style originated from and how much movement of people, rather than exchange, spread the style. The scale of production at the origin sites is also hard to ascertain. While distinctive styles of pottery and obsidian tools have a wide distribution, this alone does not prove they were produced on a large, specialized scale. 

In conclusion, while keeping in mind the limitations of the archaeological evidence, there are signs craft specialization and exchange networks were emerging in the Aegean Neolithic. The distribution of obsidian, ceramics, and other artifacts shows goods produced at certain sites or regions were exchanged over substantial distances. Individuals at these sites likely specialized in production of these goods, at varying scales, for distribution through trade networks across the Aegean and beyond. Overall, exchange and specialization played an important role in the rise of complexity in the Aegean Neolithic.
