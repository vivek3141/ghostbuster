The traditional stance of the courts on consideration in contracts is that consideration must be present for a contract to be legally enforceable. Consideration refers to something of value that is exchanged between the parties to a contract. According to the classic definition, consideration must be sufficient but need not be adequate - it must have some value in the eyes of the law, but does not need to match exactly the value of what is being exchanged. The courts have traditionally taken a strict stance on the need for consideration - if there is no consideration, then there is no enforceable contract.

This strict stance was challenged in the case of Williams v. Roffey Brothers in 1991. In this case, Williams had contracted with Roffey Brothers, a building contractor, to provide carpentry services on a construction project for £20,000. However, costs increased unexpectedly, and Roffey Brothers struggled to pay Williams. They agreed to pay him an additional £10,000 to finish the work. Williams finished the work, but Roffey Brothers refused to pay the additional £10,000. Williams sued. The question for the court was whether there was consideration for the additional £10,000. The additional payment was made to complete work that Williams was already obligated to perform under the original contract.

The court held that the practical benefit to Roffey Brothers of having the work completed so the project could be finished was sufficient consideration to enforce the additional promise of payment. The court took a more flexible approach to the concept of consideration here, focusing on the commercial benefits and detriments to the parties rather than strict doctrinal tests. This more flexible "practical benefit" approach to consideration has been affirmed in subsequent cases and marks a departure from the traditionally strict stance.

However, the traditional definition of consideration is still applied in many cases. The approach in Williams v. Roffey has not replaced the traditional definition but rather supplemented it, giving courts more discretion in finding consideration where there are practical commercial benefits at stake. The decision has been both praised and criticized. Critics argue it introduces uncertainty into contract law. Supporters counter that it reflects the realities of commercial contracting and allows courts to uphold reasonable agreements the parties themselves see as mutually beneficial.

In conclusion, the traditional stance of the courts has been that enforceable contracts require consideration. However, the case of Williams v. Roffey challenged this strict stance, adopting a more flexible approach to consideration where there are practical commercial benefits. The traditional definition still applies in many cases, but the law on consideration now recognizes room for discretion in the interests of business efficacy. The debate around the wisdom of this more flexible approach is ongoing.
