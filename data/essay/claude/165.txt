The Conservative government that came to power in 1979 under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher pursued radical social and economic policies that were grounded in a set of core principles that fundamentally reshaped Britain. The key principles that drove Conservative policymaking during this era included reducing the role of government, promoting private markets and competition, reducing inflation, encouraging home ownership, and empowering individuals over the state.

A central goal of Thatcher's government was to reduce the size and role of government in the economy and society. Thatcher believed that government had become too large and intrusive, crowding out private enterprise and initiative. Policies such as privatizing state-owned industries, deregulating various sectors of the economy, and reducing direct government intervention in the economy were aimed at "rolling back the frontiers of the state." This principle also drove cuts to direct taxes, social benefits, public housing, and other forms of state support in a deliberate effort to reduce government spending and encourage self-reliance.

Promoting free market competition and private enterprise was another key pillar of Conservative policy. Thatcher believed that market competition and private ownership were the best mechanisms to improve economic performance and efficiency. This belief led to the privatization of government monopolies in industries like telecoms, gas, and air travel which introduced competition and private incentives. It also drove deregulation of the financial sector and labor markets. The ultimate goal was to release the creative power of capitalism by freeing markets and businesses from the dead hand of government control. 

Controlling inflation was a key priority and helped shape economic policy. High inflation during the 1970s weakened the economy, reduced living standards and was seen as evidence of government failure. Tackling inflation through controlling the money supply and reducing government deficits was a central focus of Thatcher's economic strategy. High interest rates and public spending cuts were tools used to help bring down inflation, even at the cost of rising unemployment and recession. Low inflation was seen as essential for long-term economic stability and growth.

Promoting private home ownership was both an economic and social priority. Conservatives believed that owning property gave individuals a stake in the economy and society, as well as providing economic security and autonomy. Policies such as the "Right to Buy" scheme which allowed tenants to purchase their council homes at discounted rates, and tax benefits for mortgage interest payments were aimed at creating a "property-owning democracy." Home ownership levels did increase substantially during this period.

In summary, the Conservative government pursued radical changes aimed at reducing government's role, unleashing free market competition and private enterprise, controlling inflation, increasing home ownership and empowering individuals over the state. This policy revolution, grounded in a coherent set of principles, fundamentally reshaped Britain's economy and society in ways that still endure today. While controversial, the changes spearheaded by Margaret Thatcher have had a profound and lasting impact.
