E-businesses today have a wide range of options for how much to integrate their online and offline operations, ranging from fully separate "brick" and "click" businesses to fully integrated "clicks-and-mortar" operations. The correct balance of bricks and clicks depends on a company's products, customers, and competitive environment. Theories like the Clicks-And-Mortar Spectrum and E-strategic Grid provide frameworks for analyzing these options and trade-offs. 

A successful example that has found the right bricks and clicks mix is Apple's iTunes Music Store. Launched in 2003, iTunes leveraged Apple's existing expertise in music software, industrial design, and branding to offer a seamless online music purchasing and management experience supported by appealing physical iPod products. According to the Clicks-And-Mortar Spectrum, iTunes has achieved high "convergence" of its online and offline activities. However, Apple also gains benefits of "separation" by maintaining dedicated Apple.com and physical Apple Store divisions. 

Managers determining their e-business model face trade-offs between integration and separation. Highly integrated models can provide a seamless brand experience, leverage economies of scope, and encourage cross-selling between channels. However, they may also face challenges coordinating different organizational cultures and business models. Separate bricks and clicks models have more independence but may miss opportunities for synergy and brand coherence.

Retailers have employed various clicks and bricks strategies. On the integrated end of the spectrum, Sears has gradually integrated its physical stores and Sears.com, offering services like buy online, pick-up in store and allowing returns across channels. Conversely, Macy's originally launched Macy's.com as a separate division before subsequently integrating it to gain synergies. Traditional retailers faced with "showrooming" customers who view products in-store before buying online have especially benefitted from integration.   

For technology and e-commerce startups, the choice of model depends on product offerings and target customers. integrating a single strong brand vision like Apple did with its stores may appeal to premium brands in which the total customer experience is critical. For basic commodities, keeping low-touch models separate may make sense unless able to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage through integration.

In conclusion, the ideal "bricks and clicks" strategy depends on a company's unique situation and vision. Moving along the Clicks-And-Mortar Spectrum through separation, coordination or convergence, and adjusting as needed, allows nimble e-businesses to find the model that suits them best. Overall, e-business success still comes down to offering a great customer experience, however that may be achieved. With time, more companies are recognizing and capturing cross-channel synergies, but the option to keep models separate remains important as well. A balanced and adaptable approach is key.
