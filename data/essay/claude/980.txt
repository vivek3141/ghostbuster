Jaeger's method for determining the surface tension of a liquid involves measuring the maximum force required to pull a wire ring , vertically oriented and partially immersed in the liquid, through the surface of the liquid. The surface tension pulls on the ring as it is removed, reaching a maximum value just before the ring breaks free of the surface. By measuring this maximum force and knowing the perimeter of the ring, the surface tension can be calculated using the formula:  

Surface Tension = Maximum Force / Perimeter of Ring

This method was used in an experiment to determine the surface tension of distilled water. A platinum wire ring with a perimeter of 9.42 cm was pulled through the surface of distilled water. The maximum force required was 0.697 N. Using the formula, the surface tension of distilled water was calculated to be 73.9 mN/m. This value compares well with the literature value of 72.8 mN/m at 20°C.

The Cambridge tension balance works by supporting a frame with a wire ring upon which masses are suspended from either side. The balanced ring is then drawn through the interface of two liquids. The forces of surface tension pull the ring to one side, upsetting the balance. Known masses are then added to the opposite side to restore equilibrium.  The masses required to balance the force of the surface tension yields the surface tension. Using this method, the surface tension of distilled water at 20°C was found to be 75.6 mN/m, which is in close agreement with the literature value.   

Surface tension arises from intermolecular forces between molecules at the surface of a liquid. Surface-active components, such as detergents, disrupt these intermolecular forces and lower surface tension. The addition of ionic solutes like sodium chloride was found to slightly decrease the surface tension of water from 72.8 mN/m to 71 mN/m. Adding sugar, a nonionic solute, did not significantly affect surface tension. Adding detergent, however, substantially lowered surface tension from 72.8 mN/m to 32 mN/m for distilled water as detergent molecules concentrated at the air-liquid interface.

In summary, Jaeger's method and the Cambridge tension balance were used to experimentally determine the surface tension of distilled water and compare results to literature values. Surface tension arises from intermolecular forces at the liquid surface and can be decreased by the addition of surface-active components that disrupt these forces.
