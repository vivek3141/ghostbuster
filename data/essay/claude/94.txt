The addition of new items to an existing list has a significant influence on the frequency of false memories for those items. As more items are added to a list, the familiarity threshold—that is, the amount of activation required for an item to seem familiar—decreases. This means that new items have a lower threshold to seem familiar, which increases the likelihood of false memories for those new items. 

An experiment by M.K. Johnson and colleagues in 2013 illustrated this effect. Participants were shown a list of associated words (e.g. bed, rest, awake, tired, dream, etc.) and were later tested on their memory for the items. Some participants were only shown the original list, while others were shown the original list plus some new associated words added (e.g. pillow, blanket, sleep, etc.). Participants who saw the longer lists with new words added were significantly more likely to falsely recall seeing words like "pillow" or "blanket" that were not actually on the original list.

The reason for this effect is that when more associated items are added to the list, the overall familiarity or activation for that associative network increases in the brain. When activation increases, each item requires less additional activation to reach the familiarity threshold. So new items that are strongly associated to the original list can more easily reach that threshold, leading participants to mistakenly believe those new items were on the original list. 

These findings have implications for how false memories can be created in other contexts. Any time activation for a network of associated items, events or concepts increases in the brain, the familiarity threshold will decrease and the likelihood of false memories will increase. For example, repeatedly imagining an event that did not actually happen could lower the threshold for seeming familiar enough to be mistaken for a real memory. Discussing an event with others, or consuming media representations of an event, could have similar effects due to spreading activation in memory.

In summary, adding new items to an existing list lowers the familiarity threshold in the brain, making false memories more likely for those new items. This occurs because increased activation for an associative network as a whole makes each element require less additional activation to reach the threshold of seeming familiar. The implications are that any mechanism that increases activation and lowers familiarity thresholds could increase false memories in the real world. Overall, this experiment provides insight into how false memories can emerge from the fundamental mechanisms by which our brains encode and retrieve information.
