Both Charles Dickens' Great Expectations and Alan Warner's Morvern Callar construct social identities through the politics of space and place in imaginative ways. By depicting protagonists navigating fraught social spaces and places in search of self-identity, these novels meditate upon the contemporary dilemma of self-identity in literature and society. 

In Great Expectations, Pip's imagination is powerfully shaped by his experience of place and space. The novel opens in a churchyard, where Pip encounters the terrifying convict Magwitch. This gothic space fills Pip with dread and establishes a prevailing sense of danger and uncertainty. As Pip is "brought up by hand" by his sister in their home, the claustrophobic and humorless domestic space compounds Pip's discomfort. His imaginative escape is found in his notion of becoming a "gentleman" in London.

Pip's expectations of London as a space of opportunity and status are soon dashed. In London, strict rules of etiquette and class boundaries rigidly define social identities in spatial terms. Pip struggles to navigate these spaces, uncomfortably lodging with the eccentric character Herbert Pocket. However, through encounters with the upper-class Estella and Miss Havisham, Pip begins constructing a fantasy of belonging to a higher social class.

Morvern Callar similarly portrays its eponymous protagonist navigating the politics of space and place. In her small port town in Scotland, Morvern finds little opportunity to explore her identity. However, after her boyfriend commits suicide, Morvern conceals his death to claim the proceeds from his unpublished novel. She uses this money to escape on holiday to Spain with her friend Lanna. 

In Spain, Morvern experiments with new identities that would be impossible in her hometown. She pursues romance on her own terms, presenting herself as worldly and enigmatic. She observes, "Nobody knew me. I could be whatever I wanted to be." However, Morvern struggles to integrate these ephemeral holiday identities into a coherent sense of self. 

Upon returning home, Morvern struggles to reconcile her transformational experiences in Spain with the mundane familiarity of place in Scotland. However, she starts to re-imagine the possibilities afforded by her own locality. The novel ends with Morvern dispersing her boyfriend's ashes in the sea, signalling her reconciliation with place and growing self-assurance.

In conclusion, Great Expectations and Morvern Callar are novels profoundly concerned with self-identity, which they explore through the imaginative politics of space and place. By following their protagonists' journeys through fraught spaces and places, both novels suggest how localities can be both confining and liberating. They show how one's sense of identity emerges through the dialectical and transformative relationship between the familiar and unfamiliar in space and place. Overall, these novels present a compelling vision of how self-identity develops through navigating the spaces and places that shape our lives.
