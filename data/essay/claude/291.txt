The Oriental Star buffet restaurant offers an extensive Asian buffet dining experience, with a wide array of dishes from Chinese, Japanese, and Thai cuisine. However, based on multiple visits to the restaurant, the service quality is inconsistent and could be improved in several areas.  

One of the most significant issues with the service quality at The Oriental Star is the long wait times, especially on weekends and holidays when the restaurant is very busy. On a recent Saturday evening visit, our party of four had to wait over an hour for a table, even with an advance reservation. The restaurant was clearly overloaded well beyond its capacity for the available staffing. Once seated, it took another 20 minutes before a server greeted our table, took our drink orders, and explained how the buffet stations were laid out. The excessively long waits left customers frustrated, hungry, and with an overall negative first impression. To improve, the restaurant should consider limiting the number of reservations and walk-in customers accepted based on their normal staffing levels and seating capacity. They should also consider hiring additional servers to improve response times, especially during their busiest periods.  

Another issue observed is the lack of attention from servers. After greeting our table and taking the initial drink order, the server disappeared and was not seen again until dropping off the check at the end of the meal. Empty plates were left on the table and needed to be cleared, and drink refills were non-existent. The expectation at a buffet with a fixed price is that servers will regularly check on tables to remove used dishes, offer drink refills, and see if any other items are needed. The lack of attention made the experience feel self-serve and as if the restaurant was understaffed. To improve, management should reiterate service standards to check on each table at least once every 5-10 minutes, clear used dishes regularly, and refill beverages. More staff may again need to be scheduled to ensure adequate levels of service.

On the positive side, the buffet selections at The Oriental Star are abundant, fresh, and high quality. The buffet features many authentic Chinese, Japanese, and Thai dishes, a teppanyaki station, a sushi bar, seafood bar, and Asian fusion selections. The food is constantly being replenished to ensure freshness and availability. The buffet is competitively priced, especially given the broad range of options. Overall, the extensive buffet selections and quality of the food make The Oriental Star a worthwhile experience, if long wait times and limited service attention can be addressed. 

In summary, The Oriental Star restaurant suffers from inconsistent and at times poor  service quality, especially related to long wait times, understaffing during busy periods impacting server response times, a lack of regular server attention at tables, and the failure to perform basic service steps like removing used dishes and providing drink refills. To improve, the restaurant should limit bookings to match staffing levels, increase server staffing during peak periods, retrain staff on service standards and responsibilities, and consistently monitor service quality. If service issues can be addressed, the abundant high-quality buffet at The Oriental Star would make the restaurant an highly enjoyable experience and maintain its popularity and customer base. With improved service quality and consistent experience, The Oriental Star has the potential to become a true stand-out among Asian buffets.
