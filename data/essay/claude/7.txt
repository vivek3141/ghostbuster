Haemagglutination and haemagglutination inhibition assays are laboratory techniques used to study viruses and viral antibodies. They utilize the ability of certain viruses to agglutinate red blood cells. In haemagglutination assays, serial dilutions of a virus stock are prepared and each dilution is mixed with a suspension of red blood cells. The highest dilution that still causes agglutination of the red blood cells is considered the end point, and the reciprocal of that dilution is recorded as the haemagglutination titre or HA titre. This provides a measure of the concentration of infectious virus particles in the stock. 

In haemagglutination inhibition assays, a fixed amount of virus that causes agglutination is mixed with serial dilutions of antisera or other inhibitors. The highest dilution of inhibitor that still prevents agglutination is the end point, and its reciprocal is recorded as the HI titre. This provides a measure of the amount of inhibitor, like viral antibodies, in the serum. Comparing the HI titres of different antisera to a particular virus can help identify the virus by determining which antisera have the highest HI titres. The specificity of the assay is enhanced by using red blood cells that are sensitive to agglutination by the suspected virus but not other viruses.

The aims of performing these assays with an unknown virus stock would be: 1) To determine the HA and HI titres of the stock which indicate the concentration of virus and inhibitory antibodies, respectively; 2) To identify the unknown virus by testing its reactivity with known antisera to different viruses. The antisera that shows the highest HI titre is likely to correspond to the unknown virus; 3) To calculate the concentration of virus particles or antibody in the original stock based on the titres obtained. The titres provide a relative measure that can be used to mathematically determine absolute concentrations.

Several factors contribute to the specificity and precision of the haemagglutination and haemagglutination inhibition assays. The choice of red blood cells is important, as cells that are reactive to a wide range of viruses will give less specific results. The use of known antisera that are specific to particular viruses also improves specificity. The dilution series must be performed carefully in a uniform manner to generate precise end point titres. Conditions like temperature, pH, and the concentrations of reagents should also be well controlled between tests to ensure precision and reproducibility.

In summary, the haemagglutination and haemagglutination inhibition assays are very useful for identifying unknown viruses, measuring viral antibody responses, and determining viral concentrations. With well-chosen reagents and properly controlled conditions, these techniques can provide precise and specific results to help characterize viruses and the immune responses against them.
