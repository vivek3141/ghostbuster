Esteban Trueba is one of the central characters in Isabel Allende's novel 'The House of the Spirits.' As the patriarch of the Del Valle family, Esteban plays an important role in driving much of the plot and exploring the major themes of the novel. However, while Esteban is a pivotal character, he is not completely indispensable to the story, as the narrative persists and deepens even in his absence. 

Esteban's role as the head of the Trueba family establishes him as a key character from the start. His domineering and stubborn personality shapes the dynamics within the family and leads to much of the conflict and drama in the plot. For instance, Esteban's brutal treatment of his wife Clara and his rejection of his daughter Blanca's suitors catalyze important turning points in the story. His volatile temper and conservative values also contrast starkly with the mystical and liberal outlooks of Clara and Blanca, allowing their differences to highlight many of the novel's central themes around tradition versus progress.

Esteban's involvement in politics and business also connects the personal story of the Trueba family to the wider social and political upheavals in their country. Esteban's rise from poverty to become a wealthy landowner shows his ambition and determination, as well as his ruthlessness. His abusive treatment of his tenants and workers further emphasizes his hunger for power and control. Esteban's political allegiances and alliances also shift with the times, demonstrating his opportunism and the corrupting influence of power - key themes that Allende explores through the dramatic changes in the country.   

However, while Esteban drives much of the action in the first half of the book, he begins to fade into the background in the later parts of the story. After Clara's death, Esteban's health and mental state start declining, diminishing his active role as the tyrannical patriarch. Yet, even in his absence, his oppressive legacy continues to haunt his family and tenants. Blanca and her granddaughter Alba still struggle to emerge from under his sinister shadow and build independent lives. 

 ultimate defeat comes not from any direct action against him but from the gradual process of societal change. The values of tradition, order and control that Esteban so fiercely clings to become increasingly untenable. By the end of the book, his family has fractured and scattered, his workers have unionized and rebelled, and radical political forces have risen. The world that allowed Esteban to flourish no longer exists. He is made redundant not by any heroism but by the slow wheel of progress that he for so long tried to impede.

In conclusion, while Esteban Trueba plays a pivotal role in driving the plot and shaping the themes of 'The House of the Spirits,' he is not completely indispensable. Although much of the first half of the story is seen through his domineering perspective and centers around his actions, the narrative persists beyond him. Allende suggests that ultimately, the forces of change and renewal cannot be stifled by any one character, no matter how powerful or determined. Esteban's defeat comes not from confrontation but from irrelevance, as the world moves on without him. Thus, despite his enormous and terrible influence over events, in the greater march of history and humanity, even Esteban Trueba is but one man.
