There are several factors that affect the extent of monopoly economic inefficiency in resource allocation. Price discrimination, close substitutes, government regulation, innovation and productivity growth, economies of scale, externality, and market contestability can all influence the efficiency gains from monopolies. 

Price discrimination refers to a monopolist charging different prices for the same good or service to different consumers. This allows the monopolist to extract more consumer surplus and increase profits. However, price discrimination also leads to a more efficient allocation of resources as the monopolist is able to serve more consumers according to their willingness and ability to pay. More consumers can access the good or service, increasing total welfare.

The availability of close substitutes limits the market power of a monopolist. If there are goods or services that can serve as close substitutes, consumers can easily switch to them in response to a price increase by the monopolist. This forces the monopolist to maintain lower prices to prevent losing customers. The competitive pressure from close substitutes pushes the monopolist toward a more efficient price and output level.

Government regulation such as price ceilings or controlling barriers to entry can directly influence the efficiency of monopolies. Price ceilings prevent the monopolist from charging very high prices that generate large deadweight losses. Easier entry allows potential competitors to enter the market, threatening the monopolist's position and encouraging lower prices. However, overregulation may reduce the incentive for innovation and investments.

Technological innovation and productivity growth can make monopolies more efficient over time. With improved production processes and innovation, the monopolist's costs decrease. This cost saving can then be passed onto consumers through lower prices. Expanding productivity and innovation are key drivers of economic growth and prosperity. 

Economies of scale refer to the cost advantages of large scale production. For monopolies, large scale production realized through economies of scale can lower average costs significantly. Lower costs mean lower prices can still be profitable. This helps align the monopoly's interests with greater efficiency and social welfare.

Externalities like pollution emissions create market inefficiencies when unregulated. Private monopolies do not fully account for the external social costs of production in their pricing and output decisions. Government intervention is needed to incorporate externalities into the monopolist's decision making framework and direct them toward more socially optimal and efficient outcomes through mechanisms like taxes, subsidies or property rights.

Finally, the threat of potential competition or market contestability also encourages monopolies to behave more efficiently. If it is easy for new entrants to enter the market, the incumbent monopolist will likely maintain lower prices and produce at a larger scale to deter new competition. This contestability effect mimics the efficiency that would result from actual competition.

In conclusion, there are several major factors--price discrimination, availability of substitutes, government regulation, innovation, economies of scale, externalities, and market contestabilityâ€”that significantly affect the extent of monopoly inefficiencies. Policymakers should consider the complex interplay between these factors when designing regulations and policies aimed at promoting efficiency gains from monopolies. Striking a balance can be challenging but vital for maximizing social welfare.
