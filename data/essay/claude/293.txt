The article "Driven to Distraction: Extraneous Events and Underreactions to Earnings News" by Strayer and Johnston aims to examine how external events occurring during earning announcements influence the stock market reactions. The authors examine a large sample of firms over  multiple quarters and find that firms which announce earnings during high-profile external events demonstrate a weaker stock market reaction. 

While the research question is interesting and the methodological approach of analyzing a large dataset to investigate this hypothesis is useful, there are some potential issues with the validity and reliability  of the study's findings. External validity refers to the generalizability of the results to other populations and settings. The authors focus on a specific set of firms that announced earnings around four types of high-profile eventsâ€”Supreme Court decisions, presidential elections, the O.J. Simpson car chase, and basketball's March Madness tournament. However, these events may differ from other newsworthy events in their scale and scope, as well as the audience they capture. The findings may not generalize to external events with lower or higher media presence and public attention.

Additional research should analyze a wider range of external events to determine if the effects hold and to identify potential mediators and moderators. The authors could examine worldwide events such as royal weddings or the Olympics to analyze if cross-national events also demonstrate effects. They could include a more expansive set of events within the U.S. context, such as popular award shows, major sports championships, or natural disasters and terrorist attacks. Comparing across this wider range of events would provide greater external validity to the conclusions.

There are also some issues with construct validity, which refers to how well a study establishes the existence of the construct or phenomenon it claims to measure. The key construct in this research is the "underreaction" to earnings news based on stock market responses. However, there are other metrics that could be used to measure earnings announcement reactions that may provide different results. For example, the study only examines two-day abnormal returns around the earnings announcement date. A longer event window could be analyzed to account for potential delay  effects or drift. Other metrics like trading volume, volatility, or changes in analyst ratings and estimates may demonstrate different impacts of the external events.  

To improve construct validity, the authors could incorporate additional and alternative metrics to measure market reactions to earnings announcements. Comparing the results across multiple measures would help validate that the findings are not tied to a specific single metric. They could also survey or interview investors and analysts to gauge their subjective reactions and the factors that impacted them, in addition to the objective market measures. Qualitative data from experts in the field would help determine if the market response metrics adequately reflect and correspond to the hypothesized underreactions.

Finally, internal validity refers to factors within a study that could affect the results, suggesting alternative explanations for the findings. One internal validity concern is that the authors base their analyses on a limited two-year time period in the 1990s. The reactions they find may be reflective of peculiarities in the markets and environment at that particular time. Additional time periods should be tested to determine if the results remain consistent over longer periods and across different macroeconomic or market conditions. 

In summary, while this research provides an interesting examination into how external events can influence investor attention and distraction, there are opportunities to strengthen the validity and reliability of the conclusions through additional research and analysis. Expanding the range of events examined, incorporating alternative metrics and measures to capture reactions, surveying expert opinions, and testing over longer time horizons would help address concerns with external validity, construct validity and internal validity. Implementation of these recommendations could reinforce the authors' hypotheses and increase the usefulness of the findings for researchers, businesses, investors and policymakers.
