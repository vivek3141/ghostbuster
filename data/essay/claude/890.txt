During my placement in an Accident and Emergency (A&E) department, I experienced a challenging situation while assessing a young patient who was brought in after a suspected drug overdose. Using Holm and Stephenson’s (1994) model of reflection, I have reflected on why this situation was challenging, how I managed it, and what I learned.

The first stage of Holm and Stephenson’s model is ‘association’, where one recalls the situation and one’s feelings. When the patient, a 17-year-old male, was brought in by ambulance accompanied by his visibly distressed parents, I felt a sense of anxiety. I knew a drug overdose could be life-threatening, and as a student nurse I felt under-prepared to properly assess and manage such a situation.  

The next stage is ‘attribution’, where one considers the reasons why something happened. In this case, the most likely explanation for the patient’s condition was a recreational drug overdose, though at this point the specific substance was unknown. His parents mentioned he had recently started spending time with a new group of friends and had been acting differently. However, without a clear history from the patient himself, I could not determine definitively if drugs were involved or attribute his symptoms to any particular substance.

The ‘consequences’ stage refers to evaluating the impact and implications. The patient was barely conscious and unresponsive to questions, with a rapid heart rate and respiratory depression. These serious symptoms indicated a need for close monitoring and possibly life support systems in case his condition deteriorated further. The ‘imagining’ stage refers to how one might do things differently if faced with a similar situation again. If presented with another suspected overdose patient, I would strive to obtain a more detailed medical history from any available witnesses. I would also have a lower threshold for recommending life support interventions while waiting for the drug screen and other tests to determine the appropriate course of treatment.

At the ‘doing’ stage, one considers how the situation was actually managed and what actions were taken. Upon assessment, I advocated for admitting the patient for close observation and monitoring his vital signs. He was given supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and pulse oximetry was used to monitor his oxygen saturation levels continuously. IV access was obtained in case emergency medication or fluids were needed. Blood and urine samples were sent for full drug toxicology screening. 

Finally, the ‘reviewing’ stage involves evaluating the effectiveness of the actions taken and what could be improved for future practice. In this case, the patient made a full recovery with IV fluids, oxygen and time. However, there were delays in determining the specific substance involved until the drug screen results were available. A witness report from one of the paramedics indicated traces of a specific psychedelic drug were found at the scene, but this information was not communicated fully during the initial handover. For future overdoses, I will aim to obtain as much information as possible from all witnesses to expedite diagnosis and treatment.

In conclusion, this experience highlighted for me the importance of prompt assessment, close monitoring and an evidence-based approach in managing suspected overdoses when the substance involved is unknown. While initially feeling out of my depth, reflecting on this challenging experience and following the model proposed by Holm and Stephenson (1994) has enabled me to develop strategies for improved practice and confidence if encountering a similar situation again. Overall, the personal and professional growth from such challenging experiences can be invaluable during nursing education.
