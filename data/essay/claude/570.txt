Art and literature played a significant role in shaping the Victorian middle class view of street children and reinforcing social hierarchy and class values during the 19th century. The depiction of impoverished children in Victorian art and literature highlighted the differences between the lives of the middle class and the destitute lower classes, emphasizing the moral superiority of the former. 

Paintings of street children, known as “urchins” or “guttersnipes,” often portrayed them as dirty and disheveled youth begging or engaging in petty crime to survive. Notable examples include ‘The Crossing Sweeper’ by William Powell Frith and ‘Homeless’ by Sir Hubert von Herkomer, both of which depicted poor children in tattered, unclean clothes struggling to earn a meager living. These paintings elicited both pity and disdain in middle class audiences, who saw them as symbols of the immorality and laziness of the poor. There was a popular perception that the children’s poverty was a result of bad morals and personal faults, rather than societal inequities.

This view also emerged strongly in Victorian literature, where street children were commonly depicted as uncivilized youth lacking strong moral values or work ethic. Charles Dickens’ Oliver Twist portrayed the title character as a “naïve and morally untainted” orphan who is taken in by criminal youth engaged in petty crime. Similarly, in A Christmas Carol, the character of Ignorance is depicted as a ragged street urchin to represent society’s poorest and least educated members. Thomas Hughes’ Tom Brown's School Days also negatively depicts a street urchin character named "Billy," describing him as a "young Arab” and troublemaker.

These unflattering depictions served to highlight and exaggerate the differences between the civilized, hardworking middle class and the poorer street children who struggled to survive. By portraying the children as somehow deserving of their fate due to moral faults, these works also reinforced the idea that one’s social class was a reflection of one’s character. The street children were seen as broadly representative of the lower classes, justifying the middle class’ separation from and lack of concern for the poor.

In conclusion, art and literature frequently reflected and spread the belief that street children were somehow less moral and civilized than the middle class. By portraying impoverished youth in a negative and dehumanizing light, these works helped cement social hierarchy and justified class values that looked down upon the poor. They shaped perceptions of street children as symbolic of broader social ills, rather than as victims of societal problems beyond their control. This likely contributed to lack of concern for their welfare, allowing their continued hardship and struggles.
