The electrical resistance and conductivity of metals and semiconductors depends on several factors, including the chemistry and atomic structure of the material, the presence of impurities or defects, and temperature. Resistance is a measure of how much a material opposes the flow of electric current, while conductivity indicates how well a material can conduct electricity. 

At the atomic level, a metal's conductivity arises from the presence of mobile conduction electrons that are shared among metal ions. In a pure metal, the orderly arrangement of metal ions allows electrons to flow freely throughout the material. Anything that disrupts this orderly structure can increase resistance. For example, impurities, defects like missing or misplaced atoms, and crystal grain boundaries can scatter electrons and reduce conductivity. Resistance often increases with temperature in metals as atomic vibrations interfere with electron flow.

In semiconductors like silicon, conductivity is controlled by the concentration and mobility of charge carriers--electrons and electron vacancies called "holes." At absolute zero, a pure intrinsic semiconductor has no charge carriers and acts as an insulator. As temperature increases, electrons are promoted to the conduction band, increasing conductivity. Doping a semiconductor with atoms that readily donate electrons (n-type) or readily accept electrons (p-type) also increases conductivity by creating excess charge carriers. Resistance in semiconductors typically decreases with temperature as more charge carriers become available.

The conductivity of a material depends on the number of charge carriers (electrons or holes) and how fast they move through the material, which is known as carrier mobility. Carrier mobility itself depends on factors like carrier effective mass, lattice scattering, and carrier concentration. In general, lighter, less tightly bound carriers with fewer scattering events will have higher mobility, leading to higher conductivity.

The electrical resistance of a material is measured using the resistivity, which has units of ohm-meters (Î©m). Resistivity depends on a material's conductivity and geometry. More conductive materials with shorter, wider shapes will have lower resistivity. The conductivity of a material is measured in siemens per meter (S/m), which is the inverse of resistivity. Measurements of a material's resistivity, conductivity, carrier concentration, and mobility can reveal how its electrical properties depend on chemistry, structure, temperature, and impurities or defects.

In summary, the electrical resistance and conductivity of metals and semiconductors depends on a variety of chemical and physical factors, especially the availability and mobility of conduction electrons or charge carriers. By understanding how these factors influence electron flow in materials, we can design metals, semiconductors and devices with useful conductivity properties.
