John Bowlby's attachment theory revolutionized the field of developmental psychology and influenced decades of research on healthy infant-caregiver relationships and stable childhood development. Bowlby postulated that infants form attachments to their primary caregivers as a means of basic survival. Those attachments then go through a series of phases as the infant develops, and the type of attachment formed in infancy predicts characteristics later in development.  

According to Bowlby, infants form initial attachments to their primary caregivers as a means of basic survival.  Their helpless state requires a strong bond to caregivers who can provide safety, feeding, and protection. During the first phase, from birth to about 3 months, infants naturally bond to caregivers who are present, attentive, and respond to their cues. This indiscriminate bonding allows for primary attachment formation.

From about 3 to 6 months, infants enter the second phase of attachment and preferentially bond to familiar caregivers, showing a preference for primary caregivers and distress at separation from them. This selective attachment supports more stable relationships. In the third phase, from about 6 months to 2-3 years, clear separation anxiety emerges as infants fear unfamiliar people and have strong preferences for primary caregivers. The anxiety peaks around age 1, demonstrating that the infant has formed a strong and stable attachment.

From ages 2 to 4, the forth phase involves partnerships between the infant and caregiver. The infant still views the caregiver as a secure base but gains more independence in exploring and playing. The attachment is still very strong but allows for more autonomy. Finally, Bowlby  proposed that from ages 4 through adulthood, individuals internalize their attachment representations and either form secure attachments to others or insecure attachments based on their early experiences.

Bowlby's theory has been robustly supported, and subsequent research found three main patterns of attachment in infancy: secure, avoidant, and ambivalent attachment. Securely attached infants explore freely, use the caregiver as a secure base, and are distressed by separation. Avoidantly attached infants do not seek contact with caregivers and are not noticeably distressed when separated - they have learned that the caregiver is unresponsive. Ambivalently attached infants are fretful, even in the presence of the caregiver, and are very distressed by separation - they have an inconsistent caregiver. 

Attachment types strongly predict social and emotional outcomes in children and adults. Securely attached children tend to have stronger social skills, more stable relationships, and higher self-esteem. Insecurely attached children are more prone to behavioral problems, difficulties in relationships, and higher anxiety and depression. While attachment is not the sole determinant of development, it provides the foundation for healthy growth.

Some criticisms of Bowlby's theory argue that he underestimated the role of culture in attachment. Attachment patterns are also influenced by cultural values and practices regarding child-rearing and independence. Additionally, some critics argue that Bowlby relied too heavily on studies with flawed or unethical methodologies. For example, he frequently cited a study in which infants were subjected to long separations from caregivers in institutional settings, potentially causing lasting trauma. 

In conclusion, while attachment theory has some reasonable criticisms, Bowlby's seminal theory of attachment and its five phases of development made profound and lasting impacts on developmental and clinical psychology. His insights into the significance of early infant-caregiver relationships laid the groundwork for decades of research on attachment patterns, parenting, and healthy development across the lifespan.
