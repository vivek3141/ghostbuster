Introduction:
Punishment for criminal offenses is a complex matter that requires careful consideration of various factors to ensure justice is served. This essay aims to discuss the author's opinion on whether punishment for the felony of attempted kidnapping should be equivalent to that of the underlying substantive offense of kidnapping. By examining relevant examples and highlighting the crucial elements in determining verdicts in cases involving kidnapping and attempted kidnapping, this essay aims to shed light on the matter.
Body:
1. Definition of Kidnapping and Attempted Kidnapping:
The crime of kidnapping refers to the unauthorized abduction or restraint of an individual against their will, often involving a movement to another location. Attempted kidnapping, on the other hand, involves an unsuccessful or incomplete attempt to commit the same act. Both criminal acts exhibit a clear disregard for the personal liberties and safety of individuals.
2. Equivalence Debate:
When it comes to punishing attempted kidnapping to the same extent as kidnapping itself, there are varying opinions. Some argue that the mere intention and effort to commit such a heinous crime warrant the same punishment, as the psychological distress and fear inflicted upon the victim during the attempt can be comparable to a successful kidnapping. Others contend that a successful kidnapping carries additional harm and trauma, justifying a more severe punishment.
3. Reflecting on Examples:
Examining the case of a thwarted kidnapping attempt, such as when an alert bystander intervenes before the offender can abduct the victim, it becomes evident that the potential trauma experienced by the intended victim is substantial. The psychological and emotional distress caused by such incidents may be comparable to successful kidnappings. Considering this, one could argue in favor of punishing attempted kidnapping on par with the substantive offense as the gravity of the intention and the harm caused could be similar.
4. Elements for Verdict Determination:
Determining the punishment for both kidnapping and attempted kidnapping should consider the following elements:
a) Level of planning and preparation: Assessing the degree of premeditation involved indicates the offender's intent, which can aid the court in determining the severity of the crime.
b) Actual harm inflicted: While successful kidnappings result in direct victimization, attempted kidnappings may still leave lasting scars on the mental and emotional well-being of the intended victim. The court should consider the extent of harm caused, regardless of the completion of the act.
c) Potential for harm: Evaluating the potential consequences of the crime is crucial. The court should examine how close the offender was to carrying out the crime and the likelihood that serious harm would have been inflicted if not intercepted.
d) Deterrence value: Aligning punishment with the severity of the crime promotes deterrence. Ensuring perpetrators face significant consequences for attempted kidnapping can discourage potential offenders from committing such acts.
Conclusion:
Determining whether attempted kidnapping should carry comparable punishment to the underlying substantive offense of kidnapping involves weighing various factors. The trauma caused to victims during an attempted kidnapping, combined with the intentions of the offender, should be taken into account. Considering examples, such as thwarted kidnapping attempts, highlights the potential psychological and emotional harm encountered by victims. Ultimately, determining verdicts for cases involving kidnapping and attempted kidnapping must involve a careful consideration of the elements involved to ensure a just and fair outcome.
