Introduction (approx. 100 words):
In recent years, a pressing topic that has garnered attention is the portrayal of whiteness as the default in film, television, and media. This essay will critically examine the impact of this portrayal on perceptions of race and identity, using Jordan Peele's groundbreaking film, Get Out, as well as other notable examples in the industry. By analyzing the representation of whiteness as the baseline against which other races are compared, we can better understand the influence it has on societal beliefs and the ways in which it perpetuates racial biases and stereotypes.
Body Paragraph 1 (approx. 200 words):
One prominent issue regarding the portrayal of whiteness as the default is the erasure or marginalization of other racial groups. Get Out masterfully explores this theme, where Chris, the protagonist, finds himself in a predominantly white neighborhood, surrounded by individuals who overlook his individuality in favor of reducing him to his skin color. Similarly, other films such as Hidden Figures, Moonlight, and Crazy Rich Asians confront the limits placed on non-white characters depicted in mainstream media, particularly in terms of limited representation of their experiences, struggles, and triumphs. This underrepresentation leads to the narrow perception that whiteness is the norm, leaving non-white individuals with a subliminal message that their stories are less significant or less worthy of representation.
Body Paragraph 2 (approx. 200 words):
Furthermore, the portrayal of whiteness as the default perpetuates racial biases and stereotypes. Historically, media has often portrayed non-white characters through a distorted lens that reinforces stereotypes or reduces them to one-dimensional caricatures. By doing so, these media portrayals perpetuate harmful stereotypes among audiences, contributing to the reinforcement of racial biases. Get Out subverts these stereotypes by depicting the villainous actions of seemingly benevolent white characters, exposing the hidden racism that may lie beneath the surface, challenging preconceived notions of whiteness, and debunking the myth that white individuals are inherently good or superior.
Body Paragraph 3 (approx. 200 words):
Ultimately, the influence of portraying whiteness as the default in film, television, and media extends beyond entertainment. These depictions shape societal perceptions of race and identity. By consistently portraying the white experience as the norm, media reinforces the notions of superiority, entitlement, and privilege attributed to whiteness. This can lead to the internalization of these beliefs among white viewers, perpetuating racial inequalities and disparities. Conversely, non-white individuals are often subjected to feelings of otherness, reinforcing their marginalization and the false narrative that their identities are somehow less valuable or less relatable. 
Conclusion (approx. 100 words):
Films like Get Out challenge the portrayal of whiteness as the default and set a new precedent by reexamining the hegemony in mainstream media. By creating stories that depict the experiences of marginalized communities, these works promote inclusivity, diversity, and dialogue surrounding race and identity. It is crucial for future films, television shows, and media platforms to offer accurate and multifaceted representations of all races to counteract the harmful impact of whiteness as the default and contribute to a more equitable and inclusive society.
