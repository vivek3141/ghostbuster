Body Paragraph 1 - World War II Policies (approx. 100 words):
The United States adopted several policies during World War II to contain the spread of communism in Europe and Asia. The most notable was the Marshall Plan, which provided economic assistance to war-ravaged nations to rebuild their economies. By stabilizing these countries, the United States aimed to create prosperous, non-communist nations less susceptible to communist ideologies.

During the Cold War era, the United States developed the policy of containment to prevent the further spread of communism in Europe.

In Asia, US policies faced varying levels of effectiveness in containing communism. The Korean War marked one of the early confrontations between the United States and the Soviet Union, resulting in the maintenance of a capitalist South Korea, preventing further communist expansion. However, the Vietnam War saw the limitations of US policies, as communist forces successfully reunified Vietnam under a communist regime. Despite the United States' efforts, the influence of communism expanded in Asia.
