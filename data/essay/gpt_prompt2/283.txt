Introduction:
Advancements in genetic and genomic research have substantially shaped healthcare and medicine. The fields of genetics and genomics coexist, yet possess distinct characteristics that contribute uniquely to the development of healthcare systems. Moreover, nursing plays a crucial role in translating genetic and genomic discoveries into clinical practice. However, alongside the significant contributions, ethical considerations arise from this field of research. This essay aims to compare and contrast genetics and genomics, elucidate their impact on healthcare and medicine, discuss the role of nursing, and address the ethical considerations that accompany research in these domains.
