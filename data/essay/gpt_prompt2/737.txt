Introduction (approx. 50 words):
Wealth distribution patterns in the United States have become increasingly unequal, prompting a need for analysis and corrective actions. By examining the underpayment of registered nurses (RNs) and the overpayment of National Football League (NFL) players, utilitarian ethics provides a relevant framework to justify these examples. This essay will argue for compensation alignment with the degree of social importance, evaluating strategies such as wage limitations for NFL players, profit use rules for sports entities, and increasing minimum wages for RNs.

I. Current Wealth Distribution Patterns (approx. 100 words):
The current wealth distribution in the U.S. displays significant disparities, with a disproportionate accumulation of wealth among the few. This disparity has led to immense gaps in compensation levels, affecting various professions in contrasting ways. Two prominent examples that highlight this issue are the underpayment of RNs, essential healthcare providers, and the overpayment of NFL players.
II. Underpayment of Registered Nurses (approx. 100 words):
RNs play a crucial role in society, providing critical care to individuals and communities. Yet, despite their invaluable contributions, they often face underpayment and inadequate working conditions. Utilitarian ethics suggest that compensation should align with social importance, and placing a higher value on the healthcare sector would be a justifiable decision.
III. Overpayment of NFL Players (approx. 100 words):
Although football is - without doubt - an integral part of American culture, the enormous salaries NFL players receive may exceed the degree of social importance attached to their profession. Utilitarian ethics can help guide the evaluation of compensating athletes relative to other essential workers, ultimately leading to a more equitable distribution of wealth.
IV. Strategies for Correcting Injustice (approx. 100 words):
Several strategies can be considered to address the wealth distribution imbalance between RNs and NFL players. Firstly, implementing wage limitations for NFL players, while ensuring a reasonable compensation, can help redirect excesses to address societal needs. Additionally, imposing profit use rules on sports entities would ensure that a portion of revenues generated from sports activities is funneled towards essential sectors like healthcare. Finally, advocating for legislative action to increase minimum wages for RNs would recognize their invaluable contributions to society.
Conclusion (approx. 50 words):
To achieve a fairer wealth distribution system, compensation levels must align with the degree of social importance associated with a profession. Utilitarian ethics provide a lens through which the underpayment of RNs and overpayment of NFL players can be analyzed and justified. Implementing strategies, such as wage limitations, profit use rules, and legislative action, can correct the current injustice and promote a more equitable society.
