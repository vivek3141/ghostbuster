Analysis of Pricing Strategy:
The initial pricing for the mid-range leather tote bag was influenced by various factors. Firstly, the cost incurred during the product development stages, including raw materials, labor, and overhead expenses, played a significant role in setting the initial price. Additionally, competitor pricing and market demand were considered to ensure competitiveness and attractiveness to potential customers.

Furthermore, shifts in customer preferences, the introduction of new competitors, and changes in market demand should be considered. Periodic market research and analysis are key to remain adaptive and responsive, enabling timely adjustments to ensure sustained profitability.

By collaborating with online platforms, customers can be targeted through tailored advertisements offering electronic coupons for exclusive discounts on the mid-range leather tote bag. This approach creates anticipation among potential customers while fostering brand loyalty. Additionally, special promotions, such as limited-time discounts during festive seasons or customized discounts for repeat customers, can further incentivize customer retention and generate positive word-of-mouth.
