Introduction (approx. 40 words):
The enactment of the CALM (Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation) Act in 2012 aimed to alleviate the long-standing issue of excessively loud television commercials. This essay examines the extent to which the CALM Act has been effective in regulating commercial volume, explores its limitations, and discusses alternative methods advertisers have employed to circumvent its restrictions, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Body Paragraph 1 (approx. 80 words):
The CALM Act exhibited some success in reducing the volume disparities between television programs and commercials. The legislation required the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to develop and enforce specific rules to ensure consistent volume levels. By mandating that commercials not exceed the average volume of the accompanying programming, the Act tackled the problem directly. Consequently, many networks and advertisers made necessary adjustments to comply with the regulations.
Body Paragraph 2 (approx. 70 words):
Despite its achievements, the CALM Act has certain limitations that hinder its effectiveness. The regulations offer no guidance on how to determine average program volume, resulting in variations across networks. Inconsistencies in compliance testing and enforcement also raise concerns. Moreover, during the COVID-19 pandemic, advertisers resorted to exploiting the Act's loopholes more frequently to capture viewers' attention, exacerbating the irksome increase in complaints regarding excessively loud commercials.
Body Paragraph 3 (approx. 80 words):
Advertisers have developed alternative methods to circumvent the CALM Act's restrictions. Subtle, yet effective, tactics include utilizing different audio mixing techniques such as compressing the dynamic range of commercials to maintain a consistent volume level throughout. Additionally, prominent use of background music or catchy jingles can create a diversion, distracting viewers from perceiving loudness disparities. These alternative techniques have allowed advertisers to maintain their impact while potentially skirting the regulatory boundaries established by the CALM Act.
Conclusion (approx. 30 words):
While the CALM Act has made notable progress in reducing commercial volume disparities, its limitations and the exploitation of its restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the need for ongoing evaluation to ensure effecive regulation in the face of advancing advertising practices.
