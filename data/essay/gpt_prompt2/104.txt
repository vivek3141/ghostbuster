Introduction:
Bias and discrimination are pervasive issues in society that significantly affect social inclusion. This essay examines the TED Talks presented by Smith (2015) and Abdel-Magied (2014), as well as the article published by The New York Times (2016) to analyze the manifestations of bias and discrimination and their impact on individuals' self-esteem and confidence. Specifically, this essay focuses on racial biases and their effects on structural levels within society.
Body:
In the TED Talk by Smith (2015), she sheds light on the unconscious bias that often resonates within individuals, perpetuating patterns of discrimination. Smith highlights how these biases influence decision-making processes, leading to exclusion and marginalization. By reinforcing stereotypes and preconceived notions about race, these biases hamper social inclusion and hinder individuals from reaching their full potential. The impact of such biases can undermine an individual's self-esteem and confidence, especially when they face rejection or discrimination based on their race.
In Abdel-Magied's TED Talk (2014), she investigates the intersectionality between racial and gender biases, bringing attention to the detrimental impact on social inclusion. Abdel-Magied emphasizes the insidious nature of biases, which can both overtly and covertly restrict opportunities and reinforce negative stereotypes. These biases infiltrate various structural levels of society, such as education, employment, and public services, further marginalizing individuals from minority groups. The consequence is that individuals from racially biased societies often struggle to have their voices heard, hindering their access to equal opportunities and reducing their confidence and self-esteem.
The article published by The New York Times (2016) offers an in-depth examination of the structural manifestations of racial bias within society. This piece explores how biases contribute to systemic inequalities that perpetuate social exclusion, resulting in a cycle of racial discrimination. Examples include racially biased law enforcement practices, educational disparities, and discriminatory hiring practices. These structural biases inflict profound damage on self-esteem and confidence levels, as individuals face constant reminders of their marginalized status within society.
Conclusion:
Bias and discrimination have far-reaching influences on social inclusion, particularly regarding racial biases within society. The TED Talks by Smith and Abdel-Magied, along with The New York Times article, highlight how biases manifest at individual and structural levels, impeding social progress and hindering individuals' self-esteem and confidence. The analysis of these resources underscores the urgent need for recognition and thoughtful intervention to eliminate biases, foster inclusivity, and create an equitable society that values and respects all its members.
