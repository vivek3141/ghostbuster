Introduction (approx. 80 words):
The Spanish-American War marked a pivotal moment in American history, as the United States entered the global stage as an imperial power. This essay examines the extent to which the U.S. was justified in its military intervention in Cuba during the war, analyzing the underlying reasons for the conflict, the American government's portrayal of its involvement as defending Cuban interests, and the profound consequences of the U.S. gaining control of the island.
Body (approx. 220 words):
The roots of the Spanish-American War can be traced back to the Cuban struggle for independence against Spanish colonialism. Cuba had endured years of oppression, as the Spanish Empire implemented policies that exploited its resources and suppressed political dissent. The United States had significant economic interests in Cuba, particularly in industries such as sugar and tobacco, which further escalated tensions.
Moreover, the sinking of the USS Maine in Havana Harbor in 1898 heightened hostilities. While the true cause remains disputed, the incident fueled a wave of jingoistic sentiment in the United States and intensified calls for military intervention to protect American lives and interests. The American public, swayed by sensationalized media reports, was rallied behind their government's efforts to "liberate" Cuba from Spanish rule, adding to the perceived justification for intervention.
The United States government portrayed its involvement in Cuba as a noble mission to bring democracy and stability to the island. President William McKinley emphasized the duty of the U.S. to protect the oppressed and portrayed the war as a battle for Cuban interests. This rhetoric served to justify American intervention to both the domestic audience and the international community.
However, the consequences of the U.S. gaining control of Cuba were far-reaching. While American intervention technically granted Cuba independence, the subsequent Platt Amendment effectively transformed the island into a U.S. protectorate, compromising its sovereignty and self-governance. Additionally, American influence penetrated Cuba's economy, politics, and society, stunting the nation's development and contributing to future tensions.
Conclusion (approx. 40 words):
In conclusion, the United States' military intervention in Cuba during the Spanish-American War was partially justified due to its economic interests and the perceived need to protect its citizens. However, the long-lasting consequences of the U.S. gaining control of the island undermined its supposed mission of liberating Cuba.
