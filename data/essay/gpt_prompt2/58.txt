Body:
I. Immortal Love:
The poem introduces an eternal love through the statement, "It was many and many a year ago, in a kingdom by the sea," signifying the timelessness of the speaker's affection for Annabel Lee. This love is portrayed as innocent, pure, and unaffected by the passing of time. The speaker's profound longing for his lost love is depicted through haunting imagery, emphasizing the depth of his emotions.
II. Imagery of the Kingdom by the Sea:
The poem's vivid imagery of the "kingdom by the sea" creates a dreamlike atmosphere that enhances the sense of otherworldliness. It suggests a magical realm where the love between the speaker and Annabel Lee can thrive even after death. The sea, representing eternity, symbolizes the everlasting nature of their bond.
III. Symbolism of Angels:
Poe employs the symbolism of angels to reinforce the idea of undying love. He describes the seraphs as "not half so happy in Heaven," implying that their love surpasses even the joy of celestial beings. The imagery of angels serves to elevate the speaker's love to a divine status, suggesting that it is beyond mortal comprehension.
IV. The Intertextuality of Death:
Death plays a pivotal role in Poe's poem, heightening the speaker's devotion to Annabel Lee. The repetition of the phrase "the angels, not half so happy in Heaven" echoes the Gothic tradition by fusing beauty with morbidity. This intertextual reference to angels and heaven underscores the speaker's belief that their love defies mortality and remains eternal.
V. Symbolism of Sepulcher:
The "sepulcher by the sea," and the speaker's insistence on dwelling there with his beloved, epitomize the symbolic power of Annabel Lee's burial ground. The image of the sepulcher conveys both the speaker's desire to remain close to his beloved and the symbolic merging of life and death. It portrays the speaker's unyielding love, even in the face of mortality.
VI. Repetition as a Tool:
Poe skillfully employs repetition to reinforce the theme of undying love. The repetition of Annabel Lee's name strengthens the emotional impact of her loss on the speaker. By emphasizing her name, Poe portrays the prominence of her memory in the speaker's mind, underscoring the persistence of their love.
Conclusion:
Edgar Allan Poe's "Annabel Lee" delves into the depths of undying love, showcasing the speaker's unwavering devotion beyond the confines of death. Through vivid imagery and symbolism, Poe captures the essence of a love that transcends the temporal existence. The poem's evocative portrayal of the speaker's emotions and the symbolic elements of the kingdom by the sea, angels, and the sepulcher contribute to the notion that true love transcends even the barrier of death. "Annabel Lee" serves as an enduring testament to the power and immortality of love.
