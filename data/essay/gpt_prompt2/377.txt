She assigns these nicknames in an attempt to dismantle the anthropocentric view that animals are mere objects, assigning them unique identities similar to those given to humans. Janina's actions reveal her respect for animal life and echo her underlying belief that all living beings deserve equal consideration.

For instance, she contemptuously refers to her fellow villagers as “Bigfoot,” “Feckless,” and “Bambi.” By doing so, she dehumanizes them, stripping away individuality and exposing the flaws she perceives within society. This reflects Janina's perspective on the flawed nature of humanity and her disappointment with the human capacity for apathy and cruelty.
