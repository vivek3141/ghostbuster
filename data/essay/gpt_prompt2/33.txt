Introduction: 
Immigration policies vary significantly between states in the United States, with Alabama and California representing opposite ends of the spectrum. This essay aims to analyze the factors that contribute to the differences in immigration policies between these two states, particularly with regard to the educational access provided to undocumented immigrants. By examining theories of power, such as state autonomy and pluralism, along with demographic factors, we can better understand Alabama's strict education policy and California's more inclusive approach, shedding light on the underlying dynamics shaping these policies.

Conclusion:
The differences in immigration policies and education access for undocumented immigrants can be attributed to various factors, including state autonomy, pluralism, and demographic conditions. Alabama's strict policy reflects its historical emphasis on state control, conservative climate, and limited exposure to immigrants. In contrast, California's more inclusive approach is influenced by its multiculturalism, progressive political and social climate, and more significant immigrant population. Recognizing education as a fundamental right for all children, regardless of legal status, California's policy promotes integration, while Alabama's approach perpetuates exclusion. By understanding these factors, policymakers can strive towards more inclusive and equitable immigration policies nationwide.
