Introduction:
Education is a powerful tool that can shape people's lives, instilling knowledge and providing opportunities for growth. In both "Everyday Use" by Alice Walker and "Sonny's Blues" by James Baldwin, the treatment of education plays a significant role in the lives of the characters, influencing their self-identities, relationships, and aspirations. This essay aims to compare and contrast the treatment of education in these two literary works and explore how it impacts the characters' lives.
Body:
1. Education as a Means of Empowerment:
Both stories portray characters who view education as a transformative element that empowers individuals. In "Everyday Use," Maggie yearns for an education that will uplift her from her impoverished lifestyle. She believes that gaining knowledge will enable her to escape the limitations of her environment. Similarly, "Sonny's Blues" portrays education as a means of escape for Sonny from the dangers of street life. Receiving a formal education allows Sonny to fulfill his dream of becoming a musician and escape the cycle of poverty and addiction.
2. Education as a Factor in Identity Formation:
While both stories emphasize education's role in identity development, the characters' experiences and attitudes toward education differ. In "Everyday Use," Dee has adopted an academic identity, embracing her African roots and attempting to distance herself from her rural upbringing. She sees education as a way to separate herself from her family's cultural heritage. In contrast, Sonny's pursuit of education does not lead him to reject his roots but rather to explore his artistic identity further. Through music, he discovers his true purpose and finds solace amidst life's struggles.
3. The Impact of Education on Relationships:
In "Everyday Use," education becomes a source of conflict between Dee and her family. Her new identity aligns her with the educated world, causing a rift between her and her mother and sister. Dee's rejection of her family's traditional values exacerbates the tension. Contrastingly, in "Sonny's Blues," though initially distant due to their diverse paths, education becomes a bridge connecting Sonny and his older brother. As the narrator delves into Sonny's musical talent, he gains a deeper understanding of his brother, forging a stronger bond.
4. Education's Influence on Aspirations:
In both stories, education has a profound impact on the characters' aspirations. In "Everyday Use," Dee's education distances her from her family's humble existence and fuels her ambition to collect material artifacts that represent her African heritage. On the other hand, Sonny's education nurtures his desire to pursue music as a career, offering him a sense of purpose and fulfillment that extends beyond traditional notions of success.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, the treatment of education in "Everyday Use" by Alice Walker and "Sonny's Blues" by James Baldwin underscores its transformative power in the lives of the characters. Through education, characters pursue empowerment, form their identities, navigate relationships, and aspire to a better life. While the characters' experiences of education may differ in each story, both emphasize the crucial role education plays in shaping individuals and impacting their lives.
