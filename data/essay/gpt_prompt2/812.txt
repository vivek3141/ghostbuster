1. Creative Use of Visual Cues:
"The Irishman" employs a wide range of visual cues that contribute to the cinematic experience and convey the underlying meaning. Starting with color, the film emphasizes certain hues to reflect character emotions and their motivations. For instance, the usage of warm, subdued colors during calm moments contrasts sharply with intense red lighting during pivotal scenes, symbolizing danger, violence, or impending doom.
2. Symbolism as Storytelling Devices:
Symbolism plays a crucial role in "The Irishman" as it helps to enhance the narrative and add depth to character arcs. One of the most prominent symbols in the film is the pocket watch, which resurfaces throughout different moments, representing the passing of time, missed opportunities, and the inescapable consequences of one's actions. Additionally, the recurring visual motif of shattered glass reflects the fractured relationships and overall decay of trust in the underworld.
3. The Power of Gestures and Body Language:
Beyond verbal dialogue, "The Irishman" employs nonverbal communication through gestures, postures, and body language to convey character motives and desires.

Moreover, the use of military uniforms brings forth themes of duty, honor, and the consequences of war on the psyche.
