Introduction:
In an increasingly interconnected world, intellectual property (IP) globalization is a powerful force that drives innovation and economic growth. However, the traditional systems for protection and management of intellectual property lack efficiency, transparency, and security. Enter blockchain technology, a decentralized system that has the potential to revolutionize the landscape of intellectual property globalization. This essay seeks to investigate how blockchain's decentralized framework can contribute to the protection and management of intellectual property. Moreover, it will explore the benefits and limitations of blockchain in this context.
