Introduction:
Euthanasia, the intentional act of ending one's life to escape suffering, raises important ethical and religious questions surrounding human values, the doctor-patient relationship, and the equality of individuals before the law. Through the case study of George, a middle-aged man diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), this essay aims to explore the consequences of euthanasia on these crucial aspects of society while also examining the religious perspective on intentional death.
