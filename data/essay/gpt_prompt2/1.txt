Body:
I. Collectivism and Individualism in 12 Years a Slave:
Throughout the film, the themes of collectivism and individualism are portrayed as opposing forces that shape the experiences of those affected by slavery. Collectivism is depicted through the oppressive system of slavery, where enslaved individuals are treated as property and stripped of their individuality. Meanwhile, individualism is represented by Solomon Northup, the central character, who fights to retain his own identity and assert his autonomy.
II. Collectivism's Contribution to the Worldwide Issue of Slavery:
The film illustrates how the system of collectivism perpetuates and sustains slavery as a global issue. Enslaved individuals are commonly subjected to prejudice, generalizations, and discriminatory treatment due to their race. Their identity is erased, as they are reduced to mere property to be controlled and exploited. The film exposes the dehumanization and inhuman conditions that slaves endure, suggesting that the tyranny of collectivism extends beyond geographical boundaries.
III. Individualism's Role in Exposing Prejudice and Discrimination:
In contrast to the dehumanizing aspects of collectivism, individualism serves as a powerful tool that sheds light on the gravity of prejudice and discrimination endured by black individuals. Solomon Northup's struggles showcase the significance of retaining one's individual identity in the face of oppression. His story demonstrates how the denial of individualism can perpetuate a global cycle of prejudice and discrimination.
IV. Instances of Prejudice, Generalizations, Stereotyping, and Discrimination:
The film presents numerous instances where prejudice, generalizations, stereotyping, and discrimination against black people are portrayed. From the moment Solomon is kidnapped and sold into slavery, he is subjected to racially motivated mistreatment. Slaves are dehumanized, given derogatory names, and considered intellectually inferior. The deeply rooted stereotypes and biases held by slave owners and society at large contribute to the widespread perpetuation of systemic discrimination against black individuals.
V. Impact on the Characters' Experiences:
The prejudice, generalizations, stereotyping, and discrimination showcased in the film have a profound impact on the characters' experiences. Enslaved individuals face physical abuse, emotional trauma, and the anguish of being separated from their families. Their identities are erased, and many are forced to adopt the role assigned to them by their oppressors. The characters' experiences exemplify the severe consequences of prejudice and discrimination on an individual level, emphasizing the global nature of these issues.
Conclusion:
By analyzing the themes of collectivism and individualism in 12 Years a Slave, we gain a deeper understanding of the worldwide issue of slavery. The film effectively portrays how collectivism perpetuates the dehumanization of enslaved individuals, while simultaneously highlighting the importance of individualism in exposing and combating prejudice and discrimination. Through depicting instances of prejudice, generalizations, stereotyping, and discrimination, the movie serves as a poignant reminder of the impact of these practices on the characters' experiences. Ultimately, 12 Years a Slave underscores the importance of collective effort in eradicating the pervasive issue of slavery worldwide.
