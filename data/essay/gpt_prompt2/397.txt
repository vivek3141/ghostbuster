Introduction: 
The Victorian era and modern America are two distinct periods that have shaped the moral values and societal norms prevailing in their respective societies. This essay will delve into the comparison and contrast between these epochs, examining their impact on literature and crime rates. Despite inevitable differences, both eras reflect the influence of prevailing ideologies on the formation of social expectations.
Moral Values: 
The Victorian era was marked by a strict code of morality and religious values, where individuals were expected to adhere to a rigid set of principles. Virtue, chastity, and piety were highly valued in Victorian society, aiming to establish high moral standards. Contrastingly, in modern America, moral values have become increasingly subjective and fragmented, reflecting a more liberal and individualistic viewpoint. Personal freedom and self-expression have become central, leading to a decline in traditional moral values.
Societal Norms: 
Victorian society was characterized by inflexible societal norms, including strict gender roles and class distinctions. Women were expected to conform to ideals of domesticity, while men were expected to provide for their families. In modern America, societal norms have undergone significant transformations. Gender roles have become more fluid, with women assuming positions of power and men taking on domestic responsibilities. Class distinctions, although still present, have become more malleable due to advancements in education and the increasing emphasis on upward mobility.
Literature: 
Victorian literature often mirrored the moral values and social norms of the time. Authors such as Jane Austen and Charles Dickens portrayed the struggles of individuals within societal constraints, showcasing the clash between individual desire and societal expectations. Conversely, modern American literature tends to reflect the diversity and complexities of contemporary society. Authors like Toni Morrison and F. Scott Fitzgerald explore themes of social inequality, individualism, and identity, highlighting the effects of an ever-evolving society.
Crime Rates: 
The Victorian era was characterized by relatively low crime rates, which can be attributed to the strict societal norms and the fear of social ostracism. The maintenance of moral and religious values provided a strong deterrent against criminal behavior. In contrast, modern America experiences higher crime rates, reflecting the complexities of a heterogeneous society. Factors such as societal inequalities, economic disparity, and changing demographics contribute to a more diverse range of criminal activity in present-day America.
Conclusion:
The Victorian era and modern America differ significantly in terms of moral values, societal norms, and their impact on literature and crime rates. While the Victorian era was marked by a rigid moral code and inflexible societal expectations, modern America embraces individualism and self-expression, leading to a more diverse and fragmented moral landscape. Literary works from each era reflect the prevailing societal norms and portray the struggles faced by individuals within their respective societies. Similarly, crime rates vary greatly between these periods, reflecting the influence of economic and social factors on criminal activities. Understanding the contrasts between these two eras allows us to acknowledge the continuous evolution of societal norms and values throughout history.
