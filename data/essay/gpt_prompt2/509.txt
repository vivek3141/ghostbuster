Introduction:
In the award-winning movie "Crash," director Paul Haggis masterfully explores the complexities of post-9/11 America, emphasizing the role of verbal and nonverbal communication as catalysts for misunderstandings and conflicts. Through a diverse ensemble cast and their biases, co-culture interactions, and use of language, particularly African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), the film depicts a vivid portrayal of societal tensions. This essay will delve into the ways in which verbal and nonverbal communication in "Crash" exemplify the racial divisions that emerged after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
Body:
1. Verbal and Nonverbal Communication as Portrayal of Racial Tensions:
In "Crash," both verbal and nonverbal forms of communication serve as tools to capture the racial tensions prevalent in post-9/11 America. The characters' interactions highlight the mistrust, stereotypes, and prejudices deeply embedded within society. Through verbal exchanges filled with racial slurs, derogatory comments, and verbal aggression, the film exposes the underlying biases and hate that influence interpersonal dynamics.
2. Biases and Co-Culture Interactions:
The biases held by the characters in "Crash" contribute significantly to the misunderstandings and conflicts portrayed throughout the film. The movie showcases individuals from various racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds, all grappling with their preconceived notions about others. These biases hinder genuine communication and reverberate through the narratives. For instance, the tension between Officer John Ryan, a white police officer, and Cameron, an African-American film director, unfolds due to Ryan's racial bias, leading to a climactic confrontation and a painful misunderstanding.
3. Language â€“ AAVE and Its Role in Group Belonging and Distancing:
Language, specifically African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), plays a crucial role in highlighting the characters' sense of belonging or distancing from their racial or ethnic group. The use of AAVE by certain characters underscores their cultural identity and acts as a marker of their solidarity. For instance, the character Anthony, an African-American man, primarily speaks in AAVE to assert his group identity and distinguish himself from the dominant culture.
4. Lingual Barriers and their Contribution to Misunderstandings:
The film underscores the impact of lingual barriers on societal relations, deepening misunderstandings and perpetuating racial tensions. The portrayal of linguistic diversity within the film reveals how communication breakdowns can occur due to language differences. For example, the character Daniel, a locksmith originally from Iran, faces discrimination and mistrust due to the language barrier and cultural misconceptions surrounding the Middle East after 9/11.
Conclusion:
"Crash" effectively utilizes verbal and nonverbal communication to illustrate the racial tensions that emerged in post-9/11 America. Through the characters' biases and co-culture interactions, the film skillfully depicts the misunderstandings and conflicts that arise from such tensions. Furthermore, the use of AAVE as a means of showing belonging or distancing from a group highlights the complex relationship between language and cultural identity. The movie serves as a powerful commentary on the impact of communication on societal divisions, urging viewers to recognize the importance of empathy, understanding, and open dialogue when grappling with racial tensions.
