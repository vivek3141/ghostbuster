Introduction:
Ethical concerns surrounding biomedical research have been a topic of intense discussion, and one case that has brought these issues to the forefront is Henrietta Lacks' story. In Rebecca Skloot's narrative, "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks," we gain insight into the ethical implications of biomedical research, particularly in relation to women's rights and racial inequality. This essay will delve into the ethical ramifications of Lacks' case and examine how Skloot's narrative sheds light on these concerns while promoting the principles of fair and unbiased medical research.
