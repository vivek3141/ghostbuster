Body:
1. Establishing a personal connection:
DiCaprio begins his speech by sharing his personal connection to the subject matter, invoking a sense of empathy in the audience. He highlights his experiences working with environmental organizations and witnessing the devastating consequences of climate change. By presenting himself as emotionally invested, DiCaprio successfully grabs the audience's attention and establishes credibility.
Example: "As an actor, I pretend for a living, but this is not fiction. This is a true story; the future of our planet."
2. Employing vivid imagery:
To bring the reality of climate change to life, DiCaprio utilizes vivid imagery that appeals to the audience's emotions. By describing the destructive force of extreme weather events and their impact on vulnerable communities, he paints a somber picture meant to evoke concern and empathy.
