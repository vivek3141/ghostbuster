1. Enhanced Employee Engagement and Performance:
Ethical leaders act as role models, setting a benchmark for ethical behavior and inspiring their followers. Through their actions, they earn the trust and respect of their team members, resulting in higher levels of engagement and commitment.

Sports leaders also bear the responsibility of upholding ethical principles.
