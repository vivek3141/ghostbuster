Introduction:
Film has long been a powerful medium through which societal norms and expectations are reflected and reinforced. In this essay, we will explore the portrayal of women in film by focusing on the male gaze theory and psychoanalysis, with a specific focus on the limitations imposed by the family in the melodrama genre. Analyzing examples from the films "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and "The Dark Knight Rises," we will unravel the dominant-submissive patterns between men and women and examine how they perpetuate gender roles and inequalities.
Body:
1. The Male Gaze Theory:
The concept of the male gaze, introduced by feminist film critic Laura Mulvey, suggests that the camera lens in film often objectifies women and positions them as passive objects of desire for heterosexual male viewers. This gaze perpetuates the notion that women exist solely for the pleasure and consumption of men. In both "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and "The Dark Knight Rises," the male gaze is evident through the visual and narrative treatment of female characters.
2. Psychoanalysis and Gender Roles:
Psychoanalytic theory, developed by Sigmund Freud, delves into the unconscious mind and its influence on individual behavior. It suggests that society enforces specific gender roles, resulting in repressed desires and conflicts within individuals. In "The Postman Always Rings Twice," Cora (portrayed by Lana Turner) struggles with her desires for independence and empowerment but is ultimately limited by societal expectations.
3. Limitations Imposed by the Family in Melodrama:
The melodrama genre often revolves around family dynamics and the notion of moral rectitude. In both films, the family sets rigid boundaries for women, maintaining the status quo and perpetuating the dominance-submission patterns prevalent in patriarchal societies. For example, in "The Dark Knight Rises," Talia al Ghul (played by Marion Cotillard) is held captive by her father's legacy, bound by familial loyalty, and unable to overcome the limits placed upon her.
4. Reinforcing Dominance-Submission Patterns:
Through the characterization of women in these films, the dominance-submission pattern between men and women is reinforced. Female characters often find themselves bounded by societal expectations, trapped within the confines of their gender roles. Whether it is Cora's compliance to her husband in "The Postman Always Rings Twice" or Talia al Ghul's entrapment within her father's ideology in "The Dark Knight Rises," the films underscore the systematic repression and subordination of women.
Conclusion:
The portrayal of women in film can reflect and perpetuate societal norms and gender inequalities. By examining the male gaze theory, psychoanalysis, and the limitations placed upon women in the melodrama genre, it becomes apparent how these films reinforce dominance-submission patterns. Through films such as "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and "The Dark Knight Rises," we gain insight into the ways in which societal expectations limit women's agency and their ability to challenge gender roles. It is crucial for film discourse and representation to evolve, celebrating the multifaceted and empowering experiences of women.
