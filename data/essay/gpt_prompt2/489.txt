Introduction:
In Duncan Kennedy's thought-provoking article, "Freedom and Constraint in Adjudication: A Critical Phenomenology," he explores the influence of judges' personal experiences and social context on their decision-making processes. This essay aims to discuss Kennedy's argument and delve into the tension between political neutrality and the subjective interpretation of the law. Furthermore, it will analyze the implications of these factors on the fairness and objectivity of adjudication processes.
Body Paragraph 1: Understanding the Influence of Personal Experience and Social Context
Kennedy argues that judges' personal experiences and social context play a significant role in shaping their understanding of the law. He asserts that no judge can be entirely detached, unaffected, or unbiased by their lived experiences. Personal experiences can shape a judge's perspective, making it difficult to entirely separate their subjective interpretation from the objective application of the law.
Body Paragraph 2: The Tension Between Political Neutrality and Subjective Interpretation
In pursuit of political neutrality, judges are expected to interpret and apply the law objectively, setting aside their personal beliefs and biases. However, Kennedy highlights that the objectivity of judicial decision-making can be compromised by subjective interpretations influenced by personal experiences. Judges' unique backgrounds may influence how they interpret and apply the law, thereby blurring the line between objectivity and subjectivity.
Body Paragraph 3: Implications for Fairness and Objectivity in Adjudication Processes
The tension between political neutrality and subjective interpretation has significant implications for the fairness and objectivity of adjudication processes. While the law is ideally treated as an objective entity that should be applied uniformly to all cases, Kennedy argues that the interpretation of law cannot be entirely distanced from the socio-political context within which the judge operates. This raises concerns about the uniformity and consistency of adjudication outcomes, as they may be influenced by subjective factors beyond the explicit legal framework.
Body Paragraph 4: Balancing Subjectivity and Objectivity
Addressing this tension requires a delicate balance between acknowledging individual judges' subjectivity while striving for objectivity in the interpretation and application of the law. Kennedy suggests that an open acknowledgment of the subjective influences on judicial decision-making can lead to a more transparent and accountable process.  Additionally, initiatives focusing on diversity and inclusivity in the legal profession can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the societal impact of judicial decisions.
Conclusion:
Duncan Kennedy's analysis highlights the intricate relationship between personal experiences, social context, and judicial decision-making. The tension between political neutrality and subjective interpretation underscores the challenges in achieving complete fairness and objectivity in the adjudication process. While there may never be complete objectivity, a more transparent and inclusive system can lead to increased fairness and accountability in legal outcomes. Acknowledging the influence of personal experiences and social context is crucial for advancing the ongoing conversation on the role of judges in shaping the law, and ultimately, justice in society.
