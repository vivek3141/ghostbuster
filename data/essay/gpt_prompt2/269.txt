Introduction:
In Mary Shelley's gothic novel, Frankenstein, the theme of loneliness pervades the narrative, particularly in relation to the development of the Monster's character. The profound sense of isolation experienced by the Monster influences its thoughts, actions, and ultimately, its transformation from an innocent creation to a vengeful being. Through the exploration of the Monster's desolation, Shelley highlights the devastating consequences of social abandonment.
Loneliness as a Formative Influence:
From the moment the Monster is brought into existence, it is condemned to a life of solitude. Rejected by its creator, Victor Frankenstein, and vilified by society, the Monster is deprived of companionship and nurturing relationships. This profound sense of loneliness becomes the catalyst for the Monster's development.
The Need for Acceptance:
Denied love and companionship, the Monster yearns for acceptance and friendship, which it believes will alleviate its anguish. The Monster uses observation as a window to comprehend human relationships, particularly when it clandestinely observes the De Lacey family. This drives the Monster to develop a sincere desire to be part of society, an aspiration that ultimately remains unfulfilled. The rejection it faces because of its monstrous appearance reaffirms its position of isolation, reinforcing its deeply-rooted loneliness.
Seeking Human Connection:
As the Monster comprehends its existence as an outcast, it attempts to establish connection and meaning with people, primarily through its interaction with Victor. It implores Victor to create a companion, understanding that a companion could alleviate its isolation. The Monster underscores its yearning for companionship, stating, "I am friendless and alone; your companions will be my companions" (Shelley 116). However, when Victor reneges on his promise, the Monster is further entrenched in despair, amplifying its ever-growing sense of loneliness.
Loneliness as a Catalyst for Monstrosity:
The profound loneliness experienced by the Monster plays a critical role in its transformation into a vengeful being. Denied the love and connection it craves, the Monster turns to anger and violence to address its impenetrable solitude. The brutal murders it commits are driven by its immense suffering and its desperate desire to inflict pain upon Victor, as he is emblematic of the society that has rejected it. Loneliness becomes the driving force that propels the Monster toward its cruel acts, highlighting the dire consequences of societal abandonment.
Conclusion:
In Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, the theme of loneliness interweaves with the development of the Monster's character, shaping its actions, emotions, and ultimately, its transformation. Through its isolation and profound yearning for acceptance and companionship, the Monster's initially innocent demeanor is overshadowed by its descent into vengeance and monstrosity. Shelley's exploration of loneliness serves as a cautionary tale, reminding readers of the severe repercussions of societal rejection and the potential for an individual's transformation when deprived of love, friendship, and understanding.
