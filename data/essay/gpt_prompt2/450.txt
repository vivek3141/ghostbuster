In the realm of literature, irony and the exploration of societal tensions serve as powerful tools to convey profound messages and themes. Edgar Allan Poe's "The Tell-Tale Heart" and O.

Both stories offer profound messages on the human condition, reminding us of the complex interplay between appearances and reality, societal pressures, and the true essence of humanity.
