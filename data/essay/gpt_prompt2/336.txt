Introduction:
The Mexican-American War, spanning from 1846 to 1848, not only altered the geopolitical landscape of North America but also played a significant role in shaping the experiences of Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans. This essay will delve into the stigmatization and discrimination faced by Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans as a consequence of this war. It will further examine how negative portrayals of Mexican immigrants as lazy and criminal reinforced discriminatory attitudes towards Mexican Americans, while also exploring the impact of the annexation of Texas on the relationship between Mexico and the United States, leading to the desire of Mexican Americans to conceal their ancestral heritage.
Body:
1. Stigmatization and Discrimination 
The Mexican-American War heightened xenophobia towards Mexican immigrants, resulting in their stigmatization and discrimination. The political tensions between both nations laid the groundwork for negative narratives, portraying Mexicans as invaders, foreigners, and threats to American culture and society.
2. Portrayal of Mexican Immigrants as Lazy and Criminal
To justify the stigmatization and discrimination, Mexican immigrants were often depicted as lazy and criminal. This portrayal framed them as burdens to society, fueling the perception that they were responsible for social problems such as crime and unemployment. These negative stereotypes overshadowed the hard work and contributions of the Mexican immigrant community, perpetuating discrimination.
3. Influence on Attitudes towards Mexican Americans
The portrayal of Mexican immigrants as lazy and criminal had a lasting impact on attitudes towards Mexican Americans. They, too, were subjected to these stereotypes, facing marginalization and prejudice. The association of criminality and laziness with Mexican ancestry led to the perpetuation of discriminatory policies, such as segregated schools and restricted socio-economic opportunities.
4. Impact of Annexation of Texas
The annexation of Texas in 1845 played a pivotal role in exacerbating tensions between Mexico and the United States. The disputed borderlines and conflicting claims over territory escalated hostilities, fostering a climate of mistrust and animosity. This strained relationship further fueled discriminatory sentiments against Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans, as they became scapegoats for perceived territorial threats.
5. Desire of Mexican Americans to Hide Ancestry
The annexation of Texas, coupled with the stigmatization and discrimination faced by Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans, resulted in a desire among the latter to hide their ancestry. The fear of being associated with the negative stereotypes attached to Mexican heritage prompted many Mexican Americans to assimilate into American culture, distancing themselves from their roots in order to escape discrimination and access better opportunities.
Conclusion:
The Mexican-American War had far-reaching consequences for Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans, leading to their stigmatization and discrimination. The portrayal of Mexican immigrants as lazy and criminal perpetuated negative attitudes towards Mexican Americans, generating systemic inequalities. The annexation of Texas intensified the tension between Mexico and the United States, further exacerbating xenophobia and contributing to the desire of Mexican Americans to conceal their ancestral heritage. Recognizing and addressing these historical legacies is crucial in dismantling discriminatory practices and fostering a more inclusive society that values the contributions and diversity of all its people.
