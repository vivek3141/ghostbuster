Introduction:
Etihad Airways recently faced criticism for their unethical and irrelevant approach to layoffs, which could have been avoided through increased employee involvement in decision-making processes. This essay explores the impact of employee engagement on performance, job security, and motivation, while also analyzing the consequences of disregarding corporate social responsibility and discrimination in the change process.
Body:
1. Importance of Employee Engagement in Decision-Making:
Employee involvement in decision-making processes fosters a sense of ownership and commitment among staff members. Including employees in decision-making enables them to provide valuable insights, innovative ideas, and alternative perspectives for better decision outcomes. Therefore, had Etihad Airways embraced employee participation, they could have received inputs regarding layoffs, avoiding the unethical aspects that unfolded.
2. Impact of Employee Engagement on Performance:
Studies have shown that organizations with high employee engagement levels experience improved performance. Engaged employees tend to be more productive, innovative, and customer-oriented. By empowering employees in the decision-making process, Etihad Airways could have tapped into their diverse knowledge and expertise, leading to more informed decisions and overall enhanced performance.
3. Job Security, Motivation, and Retention:
Employee involvement in decision-making processes significantly affects job security, motivation, and retention rates. When employees believe that their opinions are valued and that their employment is secure, they are more likely to feel motivated and committed to their work. Conversely, Etihad Airways' failure to involve employees in decision-making led to job insecurity, significantly impacting employees' morale, motivation, and long-term commitment.
4. Consequences of Disregarding Corporate Social Responsibility:
Etihad Airways' unethical approach to layoffs not only violated their ethical obligations but also disregarded their corporate social responsibility (CSR) commitments. Companies that prioritize CSR build trust with their employees, customers, and stakeholders by demonstrating fairness, diversity, and inclusivity. Failure to adhere to CSR principles erodes trust, damages the brand reputation, and can lead to lasting negative consequences.
5. Discrimination in the Change Process:
Etihad Airways' approach to layoffs raises concerns about potential discrimination in the change process. Without employee involvement, it becomes easier for biases and discrimination to occur, leading to unfair treatment of individuals based on gender, age, ethnicity, or any other protected characteristics. By ensuring inclusive decision-making processes, such discriminatory practices can be minimized, fostering a fair and equitable work environment.
Conclusion:
Etihad Airways' unethical and irrelevant approach to layoffs serves as a reminder of the importance of employee involvement in decision-making processes. By selecting a more inclusive approach, the airline could have avoided ethical breaches, improved performance, enhanced job security and motivation, demonstrated corporate social responsibility, and minimized the potential for discrimination. Encouraging employee participation in decision-making not only strengthens the organization but also ensures a more ethical, fair, and sustainable work environment for all.
