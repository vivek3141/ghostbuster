Introduction:
Physical activity plays a crucial role in maintaining the overall well-being of individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Among various forms of exercise, bicycle exercise has gained attention due to its potential to alleviate motor symptoms and enhance stability in PD patients. This essay evaluates the effectiveness of bicycle exercise in improving stability and physical health in individuals with PD, while analyzing the study conducted by Tiihonen et al. (2021), which sheds light on the impact of bicycle exercise on PD symptoms and overall well-being.
