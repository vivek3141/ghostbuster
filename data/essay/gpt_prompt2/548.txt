Introduction:
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a prominent philosopher of the Enlightenment era, introduced the concept of self-love as a pivotal aspect of human nature. This essay aims to discuss Rousseau's philosophy of self-love, focusing on its two manifestations: amour de soi-même and amour-propre. By exploring the nature, effects on societal interactions, and role in perpetuating inequalities, we can apply these concepts to analyze the portrayal of a totalitarian society in George Orwell's novel, 1984.
Body:
I. Rousseau's Concept of Self-Love:
A. Amour de soi-même:

   1. Defined as the perverted form of self-love driven by comparison and status-seeking.
   2. It arises from societal influences rather than innate nature.

V. Application of Concepts to Orwell's 1984:
A. Totalitarian society:

   2. The Party's hunger for power and eradication of individuality stems from amour-propre.
B. Societal interactions:

Conclusion:
In Rousseau's concept of self-love, amour de soi-même and amour-propre represent two distinct forms with varying impacts on societal interactions and perpetuation of inequalities. In George Orwell's 1984, the portrayal of a totalitarian society aligns with Rousseau's framework, exemplifying the dangers of unchecked amour-propre. By understanding and critically analyzing these concepts, we gain insights into the complex dynamics of human nature and its implications for society.
