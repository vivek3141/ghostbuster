Introduction:
In the landmark employment discrimination case of Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, the Court of Appeals proposed several alternative solutions to the religious conflict between the employer and the employee. These alternatives, though well-intentioned, proved to be unviable in the long run. This essay will critically examine the alternatives put forth by the Court of Appeals and discuss why they were ultimately untenable. Furthermore, it will delve into the question of fairness, contemplating whether it would have been justifiable for TWA to grant special treatment to Hardison.
Body:
I. Discussion of the Court of Appeals' Suggested Alternatives:
   A. Flex Time and Temporary Shift Swaps:
      1. The suggestion to implement flexible working hours or temporary shift swaps between employees with similar seniority and skills aimed to accommodate Hardison's religious observance.
      2. This solution, though seemingly reasonable, posed significant practical challenges concerning staffing, scheduling conflicts, and potential employee discontent.
      3. Implementing this alternative would have disrupted the company's overall operations and detrimentally affected employee morale.
   B. Burden-sharing System:
      1. The Court proposed a system where employees who wished to take religious holidays off would find substitutes, redistributing the burden across the workforce.
      2. While perhaps seemingly equitable, this alternative would place undue pressure and liability on other employees, potentially infringing upon their rights to freely practice their own religion.
      3. Additionally, implementing such a system would create administrative complexities and logistics issues, rendering it impractical in the long run.
   C. Voluntary Shift Swapping and Bargaining:
      1. The suggestion to encourage voluntary shift swapping and bargaining among TWA employees aimed to create a harmonious environment accommodating various religious observances.
      2. Despite its voluntary nature, this method would require willing participants from both sides, which might be difficult to achieve in a diverse workforce.
      3. In practice, unequal bargaining power and differential treatment among employees might lead to internal conflicts and further discrimination claims, rendering it unsustainable over time.
II. Impracticality of the Suggested Alternatives in the Long Run:
   A. Administrative Complexity and Costs:
      1. The suggested alternatives proposed by the Court of Appeals would have compelled TWA to undertake extensive administrative efforts, monitoring and enforcing shift swaps, and managing potential conflicts.
      2. Allocating resources to accommodate individual religious needs continually would divert the company's focus away from its core operations and profitability.
   B. Inconsistency and Potential Favoritism:
      1. When accommodating the religious needs of one individual, especially in a diverse environment, the risk of appearing inconsistent or favoring specific employees arises.
      2. Granting Hardison special treatment would have opened the door for further demand, discrimination claims, and potential litigation, creating a legal and ethical quagmire.
   C. Organizational Disruption and Employee Morale:
      1. The alternatives proposed by the Court would have disrupted existing scheduling systems and potentially caused discontent among employees.
      2. Such disruptions in workforce management could lead to lowered employee morale, reduced productivity, and increased staff turnover rates, adversely affecting the company's overall performance.
III. The Question of Fairness:
   A. Equality in Treatment:
      1. From a fairness standpoint, treating all employees uniformly and impartially is crucial to avoid creating perceptions of disparity or preferential treatment.
      2. The employer must establish clear policies that accommodate religious practices for all employees, creating an inclusive environment that respects diversity.
   B. Balance of Religious Freedoms and Organizational Functionality:
      1. Fairness must be viewed in the context of maintaining the operational integrity of the organization.
      2. While respecting religious freedoms, the employer must consider reasonable accommodations that safeguard the rights of all employees and ensure the smooth functioning of the business.
Conclusion:
The alternatives presented by the Court of Appeals in the Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison case, though well-intentioned, were unviable in the long run. The practical complexities, costs, and potential for discrimination or perceptions of favoritism made these alternatives untenable. In striving for fairness, it is essential to strike a delicate balance between accommodating religious practices and preserving the operational efficiency and equality within an organization. Ultimately, the case highlights the need for employers to establish clear policies that encompass diverse religious practices while maintaining a consistent and inclusive work environment for all employees.
