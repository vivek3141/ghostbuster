Introduction:
Unhealthy beauty standards often plague modern society, influencing individuals to conform to unrealistic expectations. This essay will explore the interconnection between lookism and extreme body modification, while discussing their differences and underlying motivations. Specifically, this paper will analyze the societal pressures and expectations that contribute to extreme body modification, particularly for women, with evidence drawn from Goode's book, "Deviant Behavior."
Body:
1. Lookism and Unhealthy Beauty Standards:
Lookism refers to the tendency of society to judge individuals based on their physical appearance. This phenomenon fosters a culture that prioritizes beauty over other qualities and perpetuates unrealistic beauty standards. The pressure to conform to these standards can lead to low self-esteem, body dissatisfaction, and even mental health issues.
2. Extreme Body Modification and Unhealthy Beauty Standards:
Extreme body modification involves altering one's appearance to an extreme degree, often surpassing societal norms. Examples include extensive tattooing, piercings, scarification, or even plastic surgery. While lookism aims to achieve beauty through subtle modifications, extreme body modification pushes boundaries to an extreme level, often disregarding societal expectations.
3. Differences between Lookism and Extreme Body Modification:
Lookism tends to focus on subtle changes to enhance one's appearance, conforming to existing societal norms of beauty. On the other hand, extreme body modification seeks to defy these norms and create alternative beauty standards that challenge the conventional ideas of attractiveness. Extreme body modification is often regarded as a form of non-conformity and self-expression.
4. Underlying Motivations behind Lookism:
Lookism is primarily motivated by societal pressures and media influences, which constantly emphasize the importance of physical appearance. The desire to fit in, gain acceptance, and improve one's social and professional prospects is often the driving force behind individuals conforming to traditional beauty standards.
5. Underlying Motivations behind Extreme Body Modification:
Extreme body modification can stem from a desire for uniqueness, personal expression, or a need to reclaim autonomy over one's body. It can also serve as a means of escaping societal expectations and challenging beauty norms, rejecting the idea that appearance defines an individual's worth.
6. Societal Pressure and Expectations on Women:
Women often face heightened societal expectations to conform to narrow beauty ideals, heavily influenced by media portrayals and cultural norms. The pressure to embody an unattainable standard of beauty can push women towards extreme body modification as a means of gaining control over their appearance or attempting to fit into these prescribed ideals.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, lookism and extreme body modification are both connected to unhealthy beauty standards, although they differ in their approaches and motivations. Both phenomena reflect the immense societal pressure and expectations placed on individuals, particularly women, to conform to unrealistic beauty norms. By understanding these connections and underlying motivations, it becomes imperative to challenge and redefine beauty standards to promote healthier and more inclusive ideals.
