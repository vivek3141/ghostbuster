The media plays a crucial role in influencing the perception of social class and exacerbating the inherent inequality in society, as argued by Diana Kendall in her essay "Framing Class, Vicarious Living, and Conspicuous Consumption." By examining the portrayal of the upper and lower classes in media, the impact on human behavior, and the subsequent effects on the quality of life for lower-class individuals, one can understand the extent of media's influence on the perception of social classes.
In the world of media, the upper class is often depicted as glamorous, wealthy, and powerful. Television shows, movies, and advertisements frequently showcase luxurious lifestyles and extravagant possessions, creating a sense of aspiration and desire within the viewers. These portrayals, while entertaining, contribute to the perpetuation of class divides as they reinforce the notion that wealth and status are the markers of success. On the other hand, lower-class individuals are either depicted as lazy, criminal, or struggling. This sensationalized depiction further stigmatizes and marginalizes those who are already economically disadvantaged.
The media's representation of social classes has a profound impact on human behavior. Studies have shown that constant exposure to these portrayals can lead to feelings of inadequacy, lower self-esteem, and increased materialism among lower-class individuals. The desire to attain the material possessions displayed in the media pushes people into a cycle of conspicuous consumption, where the acquisition of status symbols becomes a priority over essential needs. This perpetuates the legitimacy of inequality in society, as the lower class strives to emulate and mimic the lifestyle of the upper class without having the means to do so.
Furthermore, the media's influence on the perception of social class significantly affects the quality of life for lower-class individuals. As they internalize the portrayal of their own class as lacking and undeserving, it creates a sense of hopelessness and resignation. Lower-class individuals may feel trapped in their circumstances, believing that they are solely responsible for their own plight, rather than recognizing structural factors that contribute to inequality. The constant exposure to media's depiction of an idealized life creates a sense of unattainability and dissatisfaction among the lower class, resulting in a cycle of discontent.
In conclusion, the media's influence on the perception of social class contributes to the legitimate inequality in society, as explained by Diana Kendall. Through its portrayal of the upper and lower classes, the media shapes human behavior and fosters a desire for conspicuous consumption, deepening the divide between social classes. This has detrimental effects on the quality of life for lower-class individuals, perpetuating feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness. It is essential to recognize and challenge these portrayals to strive for a more equitable society.
