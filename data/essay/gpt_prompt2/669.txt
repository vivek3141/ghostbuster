Introduction:
Scientific research is the backbone of progress in various fields of science. However, the manner in which research findings are presented and communicated differs across disciplines. Each scientific field possesses its own set of distinguishing features and unique organizational structures within their research articles. This essay aims to explore how content, language, and focus can provide clues to the field of science to which an article belongs. Furthermore, it will conduct a detailed analysis of a specific scientific article, evaluating the writing techniques employed by the authors.
