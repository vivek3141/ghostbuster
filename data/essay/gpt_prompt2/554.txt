Introduction:
The school-to-prison pipeline refers to the systematic process that pushes students, particularly students with learning disabilities and people of color, into the criminal justice system through punitive school policies, zero-tolerance discipline practices, and the criminalization of minor infractions. This essay aims to explore the impact and causes of the school-to-prison pipeline, with a specific focus on its disproportionate effects on students with learning disabilities and people of color. Furthermore, we will examine strategies that can be implemented to prevent and mitigate this phenomenon in order to create a more equitable educational environment for all.
