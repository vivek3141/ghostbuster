Introduction:
The concept of rhetoric and oratory skills has long been a topic of discussion in philosophical debates. Plato's "Gorgias" offers insights into different views on rhetoric, primarily through the dialogue between Socrates and Gorgias. This essay will explore the contrasting perspectives presented by Plato regarding rhetoric and its ethical implications, while using examples from Christopher Buckley's novel, "Thank You for Smoking," to further illuminate these ideas.
Body:
Plato, through the character of Socrates, criticizes the pursuit of rhetoric for its inherent potential to manipulate others rather than genuinely persuade them. Socrates argues that rhetoric may lead to empty persuasion devoid of truth, often used as a tool for self-serving purposes. In "Gorgias," Plato highlights this view when Socrates engages Gorgias, a prominent rhetorician. Socrates believes that the goal of genuine oratory should be to seek truth and improve oneself ethically, rather than simply entertaining or manipulating audiences.
Similarly, Buckley's "Thank You for Smoking" demonstrates Plato's skepticism towards the ethical implications of rhetoric. The protagonist, Nick Naylor, serves as a lobbyist for the tobacco industry and employs his exceptional rhetorical skills to defend an inherently harmful product. Nick utilizes manipulative tactics and appeals to emotions rather than reason. This aligns with Plato's criticism of orators who prioritize persuasion over the ethical implications of their arguments.
On the other hand, Gorgias, as portrayed by Plato, advocates for the power of persuasion, enabling individuals to successfully communicate their views. Gorgias asserts that persuasion lies at the heart of any skillful orator. In the dialogue, Gorgias embodies the belief that oracular speech holds immense power and can be used either for personal gain or for the betterment of society. These opposing views of Socrates and Gorgias on the ethical aspects of rhetoric reveal a deeper philosophical debate surrounding the field.
Buckley's novel further explores Gorgias's perspective through the character of Senator Ortolan Finistirre, an anti-tobacco advocate. Finistirre expertly employs persuasive techniques and captivating oratory skills to sway public opinion against smoking. As Finistirre's speeches ultimately serve the greater good, his use of rhetoric aligns more with Gorgias's viewpoint. However, the novel also raises questions about the ethical nature of his rhetoric by portraying him as someone seeking personal gain and political advantage while seemingly defending a noble cause.
Conclusion:
Plato's "Gorgias" prompts philosophical inquiry into the nature of rhetoric and oratory skills, contrasting the viewpoints of Socrates and Gorgias. While Socrates criticizes rhetoric for its potential to deceive, manipulate, and neglect truth, Gorgias argues for the power of persuasion. Drawing parallels to Christopher Buckley's "Thank You for Smoking," the novel reinforces Plato's arguments by illustrating how rhetorical skills can be used both ethically and unethically, highlighting the complex nature of this art form. Ultimately, this exploration underscores the importance of critical examination when it comes to the ethical implications of persuasive communication and the responsibility inherent in wielding rhetorical power.
