Introduction:
Garnier, a renowned brand in the cosmetic industry, recently launched their new hair food shampoo, accompanied by a captivating advertisement. This essay aims to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the commercial and analyze how it effectively appeals to the audience while strengthening its main claim. Additionally, potential strategies for improving future versions of the advertisement will be proposed.
Strengths of Garnier's Hair Food Shampoo Advertisement:
1. Visual Appeal: The advertisement successfully utilizes vibrant and eye-catching colors, showcasing the appealing packaging design of the shampoo bottle. This element is highly effective in capturing the audience's attention and piquing their curiosity about the product.
2. Celebrity Endorsement: By featuring a popular and trusted celebrity hairstylist using and recommending the product, Garnier establishes credibility and authenticity. This enhances the advertisement's impact, as potential customers are more likely to consider purchasing a product recommended by someone they admire.
3. Emotionally Resonant Storytelling: Garnier's advertisement effectively tells a relatable story, depicting individuals experiencing various hair problems and how using the Hair Food Shampoo transformed their hair, rendering it healthy, lustrous, and manageable. This storytelling approach enables customers to emotionally connect with the advertisement, as it taps into their desire for hair solutions.
4. Demonstrating Product Benefits: The advertisement showcases the shampoo's key ingredients, highlighting their natural and nourishing properties. By emphasizing the product's positive attributes, the advertisement effectively strengthens its claim that using Garnier's Hair Food Shampoo will result in healthier and beautiful-looking hair.
Weaknesses of Garnier's Hair Food Shampoo Advertisement:
1. Lack of Diversity: While the advertisement intends to target a wide audience, it falls short in representing diversity in terms of hair types, textures, and ethnicity. By including a more diverse cast of individuals, Garnier could better connect with a broader range of potential customers.
2. Insufficient Explanation: Though the advertisement briefly mentions some benefits of the shampoo, it fails to provide more in-depth information about its unique selling points or scientific research supporting the claims made. This lack of detailed explanation may undermine the credibility of the product.
3. Inconsistent Brand Presence: Despite featuring a famous hairstylist, the commercial does not consistently reinforce Garnier's brand identity. Incorporating the brand's logo, jingle, or recognizable tagline throughout the advertisement would strengthen the connection between the product and the overall brand image.
Strategies to Improve the Future Commercial:
1. Diversify the Cast: By showcasing individuals from various ethnic backgrounds and with different hair types, Garnier can make the commercial more relatable and inclusive for a wider audience.
2. Educate Consumers: To establish greater trust and credibility, the advertisement could incorporate scientific research, testimonials, or expert explanations that provide consumers with more detailed information about the product's efficacy and unique features.
3. Consistent Branding: Enhancing brand recognition by consistently incorporating the Garnier logo, jingle, or tagline throughout the commercial would reinforce the connection between the product and the trusted Garnier brand.
Conclusion:
Garnier's advertisement for their new Hair Food Shampoo demonstrates several strengths but also has room for improvement. The visual appeal, celebrity endorsement, emotionally resonant storytelling, and demonstration of product benefits effectively engage the target audience and strengthen the main claim. By addressing the weaknesses such as lack of diversity, insufficient explanation, and inconsistent branding, Garnier can create an advertisement that is more relatable, informative, and aligned with the overall brand identity. These proposed strategies will help the advertisement reach its full potential and successfully convince and appeal to potential customers.
