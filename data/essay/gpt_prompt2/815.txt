Introduction:
Lorraine Hansberry's groundbreaking play, A Raisin in the Sun, explores the struggles of the Younger family as they grapple with conflicting desires and dreams. Set against a backdrop of racial discrimination and economic hardship, the play vividly portrays the complex dynamics within the family and the consequences of their conflicting aspirations. This essay will delve into the ways in which the characters in the play encounter and contend with these conflicting desires, and the subsequent impact on their family relationships.
Body:
1. Walter Lee Younger
Walter's dreams of entrepreneurship and financial success often clash with his responsibilities towards his family. His desire to invest in a liquor store project represents his yearning for economic freedom. However, this ambition is met with opposition from his mother, Lena, who believes the money should be invested in a safer and more stable option. The resulting conflict creates tension within the family as Walter struggles to balance his dream against the needs and wants of his loved ones.
2. Beneatha Younger
Beneatha, Walter's sister, dreams of becoming a doctor and embracing her African heritage. Her ambition and thirst for knowledge set her apart from the rest of the family. Beneatha's desire for self-fulfillment through education and exploration of her identity clash with the traditional values held by her mother and other family members. This conflict exacerbates the differences in opinion and causes strains in their relationships, particularly with Mama and her conservative view of pursuing dreams.
3. Lena "Mama" Younger
Mama's primary desire is to see her children happy and to secure a better life for them. Following the death of her husband, she gains his life insurance money and faces the conflicting desires of her children. Mama's determination to buy a house for the family in a predominantly white neighborhood reflects her dream for a brighter future. Her decision, however, clashes with Walter's aspirations, as he seeks to use the money for his business venture. This conflict causes emotional turmoil within the family dynamic as Mama's decision stands against Walter's desires, leading to strained relationships and emotional distress.
4. Ruth Younger
Central to the play, Ruth desires stability and a cohesive family unit. She finds it challenging to balance her dream to unify the Younger family with her husband's conflicting aspirations. Ruth supports Walter but worries about the negative impacts his actions may have on the family. This conflict between compromise and ambition within her relationship with Walter creates tension between them, contributing to the overall strain in family dynamics.
5. Travis Younger
Travis, Walter and Ruth's son, also experiences his own conflicting desires. His longing for a better life is evident when he watches others enjoy new bicycles and toys. Travis represents the hope and dreams of future generations. His limited exposure to the struggles within the family yet yearning for a brighter future reveals the generational impact of these conflicting desires.
Conclusion:
A Raisin in the Sun illustrates how conflicting desires and dreams can impact family dynamics and relationships. Walter's aspirations for financial success, Beneatha's desire to explore her identity, Mama's dream for a better home, Ruth's pursuit of stability, and Travis' longing for a brighter future all intersect and create tension within the family. These conflicting desires often strain relationships, cause emotional distress, and highlight the ongoing struggles faced by marginalized communities. Despite these conflicts, the play also emphasizes the importance of unity and determination as the characters navigate challenges together, ultimately finding strength in their shared dreams and aspirations.
