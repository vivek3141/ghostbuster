II. Factors contributing to the Dissemination of Roman names and the Adoption of a Common Onomastic Culture:
A. Political influence: Roman dominance encouraged the adoption of Roman names by local elites, symbolizing loyalty to the Roman Empire and facilitating assimilation.

C. Administrative convenience: The use of Roman names simplified bureaucratic processes, uniting diverse regions under a common naming system.
III. Role of Civic Elites in Mediating Cultural Transfers:

B. Elite aspirations: Ambitious individuals sought to enhance their prestige by adopting Roman names, thereby aligning themselves with the ruling class and gaining political and social advantages.

Conclusion:
The cultural effects of Roman dominance over the Greek-speaking regions were multifaceted, with the transmission of Roman names reflecting both assimilation and adapted syncretism. This complex interaction varied across time and space, influenced by political, social, and administrative factors. Roman names served as powerful expressions of identity, power, and prestige, with civic elites playing a critical role in mediating cultural transfers. However, as late antiquity unfolded, the progress of Christianity and the decline of the Roman Empire led to a shift in naming traditions where regional identities began to assert themselves. Through the study of this cultural interplay, we gain insights into the dynamic nature of civilizations and the enduring impact of cultural exchanges.
