Introduction:
Antibiotics have revolutionized modern healthcare, providing effective treatment options against bacterial infections for decades. However, the emergence of antibiotic resistance has become a critical global health concern. This essay aims to discuss the problem of antibiotic resistance and its profound impact on global healthcare, with a specific emphasis on the identification and treatment of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. By understanding the causes, consequences, and potential solutions to this issue, we can work towards preserving the efficacy of antibiotics and safeguarding public health.
