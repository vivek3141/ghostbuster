Introduction (approx. 150 words):
Fatigue is frequently reported among patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD), significantly influencing their overall well-being and quality of life. While fatigue is a common symptom experienced by patients with various chronic conditions, understanding its specific impact on individuals with stable CHD is crucial for providing effective management strategies and improving patient outcomes. This essay aims to explore how fatigue affects individuals with stable CHD and identify the factors correlated with fatigue within this population.
