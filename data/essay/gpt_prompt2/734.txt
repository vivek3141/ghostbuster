Body:
1. The Flaws of Moral Isolationism:
Mary Midgley fundamentally rejects moral isolationism, the belief that it is inappropriate to judge other cultures' moral values. She asserts that moral isolationism can lead to the acceptance of practices that infringe upon human rights and perpetuate suffering. By refraining from critically evaluating cultural practices, isolationism inhibits progress and hinders societal improvement.
2. Universality of Morality:
Midgley asserts that morality possesses a universal element, which should guide our evaluation of other cultures. With this perspective, she advocates for a balanced approach that recognizes both the uniqueness of cultures and their adherence to global ethical principles. Considering the universality of morality ensures that oppressive practices are not overlooked and promotes a dialogic exploration of cultural differences.
3. Appreciating Cultural Differences:
While Midgley emphasizes the importance of evaluating other cultures, she recognizes the need to understand and appreciate cultural diversity. By adopting a respectful and open-minded attitude, individuals can explore and learn from different cultures without imposing their own moral judgments. Midgley suggests that assessing cultural practices within a broader moral framework allows for informed discussions surrounding the reasons behind certain practices.
4. Challenging Harmful Practices:
Midgley illustrates her perspective on evaluating other cultures through the example of samurai ethics in feudal Japan, as discussed in "Trying Out One's New Sword." She highlights the importance of understanding the historical context in which certain practices developed, while also acknowledging that not all cultural practices are morally justifiable. This necessary evaluation enables individuals to challenge harmful practices within a culture while still respecting its unique values.
5. Cultivating a Global Moral Consciousness:
Midgley encourages the development of a global moral consciousness that emphasizes empathy and understanding across cultures. By engaging in open dialogue and ethical reflection, individuals can contribute to a more inclusive and just society, free from ethnocentrism and moral isolation. This approach fosters cross-cultural knowledge and appreciation, while concurrently addressing and challenging harmful cultural practices.
Conclusion:
Mary Midgley's critique of moral isolationism provides a thought-provoking perspective on the evaluation of other cultures. Rejecting the notion of moral relativism, she advocates for a balanced approach that incorporates universal ethical principles while appreciating cultural diversity. By evaluating cultural practices critically and engaging in meaningful dialogue, individuals can contribute to a global moral consciousness that respects diverse perspectives while also challenging harmful practices. Ultimately, Midgley's insights remind us of the importance of forging connections through understanding rather than reinforcing moral isolation.
