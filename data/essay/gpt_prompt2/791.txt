The company distributes its products through various channels, including company-owned stores, e-commerce platforms, and third-party retailers. Additionally, Adidas adopts a multi-category approach by offering athletic footwear, apparel, and accessories to cater to diverse customer needs. This business model helps Adidas maximize its reach and revenue streams.
