It should be noted that the Undercover Boss episode of Rita’s Ice showcases the interaction of the company CEO, Linda L. Chadwick, with several of her franchisees. The selected job positions for the analysis are franchisee owner and treat team member. The first job position is franchisee owner based on the example of Hezrron, and the second one is a treat team member position based on the example of Pastiche.
The analysis shows that the first job position requires a wide range of entrepreneurial skills and abilities since the franchise owner is practically a business owner who needs to adhere to the corporate standards. The second position is solely focused on cashier responsibilities, which puts an emphasis on human interactions as well as the ability to conduct financial transactions. The similarity of the two positions is manifested in the fact that financial competence and communication skills are critical in both cases. However, the first position also requires additional operational and organizational management capabilities. The data collection for each job position analysis utilizes one-on-one interviews on-site, which means that both practical observations and additional questioning can be done. The key challenges and issues can also be derived on site since the interview is being conducted while the job positions are being performed.
