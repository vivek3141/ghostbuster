This week focused on the second chapter of the textbook that discusses the nature of people and culture. The first key point is the understanding that culture is the framework of life and influences the aspects of life for every individual (De Melendez & Beck, 2018). Therefore, everything a person does, how they perceive things, their dress code, likes and dislikes, approach to social and political issues, and interaction with others is influenced by one’s culture. This understanding will improve how I view and relate to people at work and in social spaces because different cultures will create different life approaches and styles.
It is crucial to find an explanation for classroom behavior among learners. The second point from the text states that students’ manners, conduct, and reactions can be attributed to their culture (De Melendez & Beck, 2018). As such, acceptable acts by one learner may become unacceptable to another or to the teacher. Since children begin to learn their culture from birth, most of them will have the behaviors adopted from parents, older siblings, and other close relatives. This knowledge will help me to understand my students and plan the best experiences for every learner in the classroom.
Lastly, although culture belongs to society, there are differences between individuals in the same cultural groups. Such distinctions are seen in a classroom where each learner has a unique way of expressing themselves and reacting to various topics. Therefore, even people within the same family or community may exhibit varying behaviors and manners (De Melendez & Beck, 2018). Such differences originate from socialization and individual distinctions. After reading this chapter, while in the classroom, I will treat each student as unique and culturally different guarantee each of them receives the best attention and directions during the learning process.
