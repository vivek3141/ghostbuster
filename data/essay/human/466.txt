On the right hand, contemporary data analysis presents chances that can be leveraged to improve current organization practices by growing the business, making life efficient, and helping in worthwhile causes. Through big data, contemporary data analysis plays a significant part in how the firm will stay ahead of business practices by anticipating potential needs and problems (Khine, 2019). To date, contemporary data analysis dominates the health care sector by minimizing operation costs and identifying efficiencies. However, to improve current organizational practices, data analysis will enable the firm to eliminate diseases, minimize, if not avoid, unnecessary harms, control infections, and extract the most valuable information from the existing dataset.
To ensure continuous improvement in the firm, the following three processes might be implemented. The PDCA, or the Deming cycle, presents a systematic procedure to enhance products or services by identifying, analyzing, and developing tests and thinking of viable solutions to the problem (Hamm, 2016). The Kaizen process will allow the firm to utilize standardized continuous improvement approaches by becoming the second nature for every employee. The Six Sigma process will enhance the business by error elimination (Hamm, 2016). Data analysis trends can improve current practices by identifying decision areas where clinicians perform better and duplicate the level of success. Moreover, through data analysis trends, the organization can also identify areas where clinicians are underperforming and provide evidence in helping the business inform its decision-making process (Hamm, 2016). In other words, data analysis trends can help the business track successful metrics in clinical decisions via predictive analytics to minimize potential risks.
The relevant and best practices to target proposal messaging to stakeholders constitute developing a plan that outlines the need to engage them. A plan becomes possible to engage the stakeholders, and an outlook of what the outcome might be is anticipated. Moreover, a plan becomes an important guiding principle that defines every engagement step from defining the content to potential achievable outcomes (Winter, 2019). However, persuading buy-in from all stakeholders might not be easy. Some familiar challenges constitute differences in decision-makers, competing priorities, resource limitations, and disparate opinions and data.
Overcoming the challenges requires careful consideration of the best strategies to persuade all stakeholdersâ€™ buy-in. The strategies to employ would be identifying the stakeholders and monitoring their activities, listening to what they have to offer, arranging a meeting with each stakeholder, and determining what motivates them. Once the strategies have been put in place, the stakeholder can be persuaded by identifying and aligning their needs with those of the organization (Bakken, 2018). Moreover, through engagement and support from senior management, it becomes possible to track and measure progress by sharing feedback with the group and addressing potential issues.
