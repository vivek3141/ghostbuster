Various forms of harassment are a widespread problem in schools. The behavioral patterns and perspectives during adolescence often have a considerable influence on the worldview in adulthood. Adolescents who are predisposed to verbal and physical brutality have an increased chance to maintain destructive tendencies in the future (Bondestam & Lundqvist, 2020). The teaching staff and school administration should monitor all manifestations of bullying, including sexual ones, to further investigate and eliminate the negative consequences for both sides of the conflict.
An article by Neil Duncan describes the experiences of sexual bullying of girls by boys. Research shows that this is a common concern that often tends to go unresolved. The negative consequences of such an unwholesome environment between students include distraction from the educational process, the development of insecurity, and the denial of sexuality. The author states the difference in the mental and physical maturation of girls and boys as one of the core roots of the issue. Girls in both matters grow much faster, which introduces the other side of the conflict to dissonance (Duncan, 1988). Boys with a lack of social and emotional development can show this interest in inadequate manifestations, not recognizing the damaging impact.
Many students do not understand the essence and consequences of the problem due to their juvenile and inexperience. However, all negative experiences and unresolved traumas have a significant risk of development in adulthood. Such researches are essential to study the behavioral patterns of children to avoid any kind of abuse and bullying. The surveys revealed that the affected party had little faith in the administrative strength of the school and felt that they had to deal with everything on their own (Aguilar & Baek, 2020). It points to the current inefficiency of the school system and the urgent need for change.
