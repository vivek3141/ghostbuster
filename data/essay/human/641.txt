Daniel R. Spanjer discusses what tools are the most valuable to use in the initial consideration of the world around. Spanjer notes that humans “are neither merely products of the natural world nor entirely limited by it” (3). Thus, moral lows were created by God to guide the free will of man. In this regard, Christians need to study the religious worldview in order to understand how the world around them works. In turn, the study of Christianity is the basis for considering Liberal Arts (2). The study of God and his interaction with humans is necessary both for understanding the existing world and for its development in the future.
The universe consists of three essential spheres, which through interaction with each other, form the complex world. They include the physical, rational, and human spheres, each of which has its own elements (Spanjer 10-13). Additionally, each of the mentioned areas of the functioning of the universe is governed by its own laws. As part of the study of Liberal Arts, students need to take a comprehensive look at aspects of each of these areas and understand how they work together.
The main idea of ​​this chapter, therefore, is the need to understand the laws of the subject of study. Spanjer emphasizes that it is impossible to understand the principle of operation of a particular sphere, ignoring its natural laws. This view, within the framework of the study of Christianity, seems to be the most effective since it allows us to integrate the consideration of the human essence and morality into a broader context. In this case, it is important to understand that human beings are also part of a larger system. Studying Liberal Arts allows you to structure knowledge about the world, depending on their levels and relationships.
