In order to better understand the higher prevalence of diabetes within the county, it is essential to observe both national and local trends of the illness. According to the CDC (2022), while new cases of diabetes have steadily decreased over the decades, the prevalence of the disease among people aged below twenty has not. Similarly, the prevention and management of diabetes among older adults is largely unsatisfactory and could be vastly improved. A number of socio-cultural factors also influence the prevalence of diabetes. For instance, individuals with Hispanic backgrounds are more prone to have the condition. Other factors such as age, smoking, physical inactivity, and obesity among residents could also be impacting the prominence of diabetes.
Within the setting of the county, it is likely that age, elevated hypertension, and Hispanic backgrounds are the main risk factors for residents. While age and increased blood pressure are more common risks for type 2 diabetes, the Hispanic background component may be a more recent development that is influenced by a number of social factors (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, n.d.).
While Hispanic individuals have a mild genetic predisposition to diabetes that may be affected by traditional foods that are rich in carbohydrates, lack of access to healthcare is the most prominent risk factor. A study has found that health insurance disparities, low income, and lacking awareness of the condition among Hispanic individuals have played a role in an increase in cases of diabetes (Bauer, 2017). As such, the collected information suggests that many individuals currently lack education and knowledge concerning preventive measures for diabetes. This would require the formation of appropriate information regarding diabetes prevention and management.
