American slavery arose as a way of exploiting labor within capitalism but gradually took shape in an autonomous socio-economic and political structure. Over time, a liberation movement began, which implied the illegality and unethical “ownership” of people. However, even after official emancipation, the slaves were dependent on the state and slave owners in the past, with a lack of resources for subsistence. Without documents, financial resources, and moral support, it was difficult for new members of society to integrate into a standard life. Additionally, discrimination and lack of inclusion as a phenomenon continued to exist.
Slavery was abolished as a result of the Civil War between the northern and southern states. The passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution in January 1865 brought a permanent end to slavery in the US, making it illegal and anti-constitutional. Currently, this phenomenon in the United States is considered one of the most shameful episodes in the history of the country. At the same time, an urgent question arises whether the state should have compensated the slaves for the material and spiritual damage that was caused to them in the process.
Even if slave labor is not officially permitted and the slaves are freed, without the provision of basic resources for life, survival is unlikely. The concept and attitude of society also affect the acceptance rate of new members. In the case of unequal chances of receiving the same benefits, the slaves in the past have more difficulties, challenges, and complexities on the path of integration. In this regard, the new slaves were not truly emancipated, as they were still dependent on a source of resources for subsistence.
