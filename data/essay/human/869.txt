Atlantic City is a famous coastal city in New Jersey characterized by its beaches and developed entertainment industry. The city is relatively small in both size and population. There are several local casinos, many hotels, recreation centers, and shops. The prevalent part of the population of Atlantic City consists of African-Americans and Caucasians. Local shops are tourist-oriented and provide a wide variety of souvenirs and vintage goods such as books and wine. Since Atlantic City is a city located near the ocean, many local restaurants specialize in seafood. The average income for an individual who resides in Atlantic City, per the 2021 was only 29,232 USD for a household.
The culture and ambiance may be categorized as a “party” or “fun” city. Because of this, alcohol and drugs are very popular among residents, which may pose a community health issue and is applicable for all ages entering or residing within the city. Additionally, this issue may only amplify, as a new law was passed in 2020 allowing for the public consumption of alcohol within the city’s tourism district. Unfortunately, alcohol is a part of the city’s culture and is embraced, even with the potential long term effects drinking can cause to a person’s health. Luckily, there is an Alcoholics Anonymous outreach facility for those who find themselves in need of such assistance and several medical emergency facilities, including psychiatric and behavorial health facilities.
