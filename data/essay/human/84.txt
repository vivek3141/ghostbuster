Beowulf is an Anglo-Saxon epic poem set in Jutland before the Angles migrated to Britain. The title of this literary work is the name of the main character (Hall 2). Beowulf became one of the revered heroes in Old English literature, and the poem itself had a strong influence on pop culture. This epic character, who accepts his fate without hesitation, attracts attention in modern times full of doubts and contradictions with his almost archetypal clarity and wholeness.
Indeed, for example, it can be assumed that modern superhero comics are particularly popular, partly because people still need the image of a fair, superpowered being. One of the most popular heroes of the Marvel Universe is Superman. Their similarities with Beowulf are obvious – both have incredible strength and are role models for the people of their time (Burn 107). These heroes have to overcome obstacles to help those who need support. In both universes, strength and extreme physical abilities become objects of praise and reverence. In addition, a key factor contributing to the plot of the heroes’ destinies is the presence of an enemy, on whose destruction depends the survival of the world. However, the fundamental difference is that a hero’s physical strength is not enough to admire him for modern people. This characteristic must be complemented by the purity of thought and good intentions. The hero becomes much more complex as the modern world gets more sophisticated.
The fact that people still draw inspiration from old stories correlates with the tenets of postmodernist theory. According to the latter, it is necessary to constantly reproduce what has passed, make sense of it, and experiment with its content. It can be seen that stories about legendary superheroes remain relevant to contemporary viewers, readers, and audiences in general. As in Saxon times, bravery and loyalty are revered, and having these characteristics is what makes an individual a role model.
