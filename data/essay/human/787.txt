The initial stage in the development of nursing research is considered to be the study conducted by Florence Nightingale. Methodically applying her deep and comprehensive knowledge of human nature in nursing, she improved the traditional female housework of caring for sick family members and elevated it to the rank of professional activities. Recently, in the United States, research in nursing has been increasingly recognized at the national level. The National Institute for Nursing Research has been established, and financial support for nursing research is being strengthened. In medical institutions, permanent positions of nurses have been introduced – scientific workers are involved in the conducting of clinical nursing research.
In countries such as Great Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland, there are tendencies for recognizing nursing as an independent profession, the practical activity of which has a developed theoretical basis. There are three principal differences between research-based and evidence-based practices. The first is that the first one is more practically-oriented. The second is that the result is gained through the testing in various settings. The last differentiating feature is that the methods’ and results’ effectiveness is higher than in research-based practices.
Bharat Aggarwal, former professor emeritus of cancer research, resigned after discovering the fraud in many publications he published on curcumin for cancer treatment. As of 2020, Aggarwal has had many of his research papers withdrawn ( Prominent Indian-American researcher under probe , 2018). Such misconduct should be avoided in scientific research, especially in healthcare field. To do so, the researchers should ensure the reliability and validity of the study by getting approval from the institutional review board. If I were to conduct the research, I would use the participants’ rights protection principle and seek the governmental healthcare association’s approval of chosen methods.
