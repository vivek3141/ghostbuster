Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have become a part of all humans’ lives, but they remain a debatable issue thus far. Some people argue that it is not ethical to change any genetic information and play God (MacKinnon & Fiala, 2017). However, I believe that GMOs are only another advancement in people’s lives as the creation of machines, cars, or spaceships. GMOs (be it a plant or animal) are a part of my life as well, as I have consumed GMO-based products. I am not concerned about long-term effects as much as some of my peers since I find GMOs to be a product of selection that has been in place for centuries. People have noticed some properties they considered to be appropriate for them and tried to grow as many plants and animals that have certain qualities as possible.
I would use the principles of utilitarianism to support my claim. This theory is based on the view that everything is ethical if it contributes to as much good for as many people as possible. GMOs can help people overcome one of the major problems that is famine. GMOs are resistant to harsh environmental conditions, so people may grow more crops and other important plants. Millions of people still starve and are in need of food, so the production of more food is beneficial for all. Of course, some use the deontological approach and state that it is simply wrong to interfere with genetic codes as it is the divine domain. GMOs are seen as people’s attempts to play God, which is morally wrong. However, I would stress that even according to the Bible, humans were given the planet to take care of it, so using innovative tools is another way to follow the Christian postulates and take care of all creatures.
