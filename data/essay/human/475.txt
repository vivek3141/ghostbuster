Jesus began His sermon with an exposition of the Beatitudes, each of which begins with the word blessed, that is, happy. At first glance, it seems that the main purpose of the Beatitudes is to give various comforts to the oppressed. But beyond that, Jesus instructs in this chapter on how those who are privileged should behave (English Standard Version Bible, 2001). The verses address the issue of where to seek comfort for those who suffer (Matuszewski, 2020). This question was in many ways the basis for my project. Patients may find the answer for themselves in the gospel lines – let every praying and believing person be assured that they will be heard.
Health care workers will do all they can to help everyone in need. They work in accordance with God’s will and help establish a healthy relationship between patients and God. As a health care professional, I am convinced that my work often responds to the needs of those I serve. I believe the principal benefit of these verses is that they provide relief to those who have given up hope. They also provide some guidance for those who long for justice (Hoezee, 2020). The problem these verses present for the world of health care, however, is that they do not tell how soon relief will come and illness will go.
Matthew Chapter Five is not all about the same thing. In line eleven, it says to remain blessed when persecuted for the faith (English Standard Version Bible, 2001). This is the most difficult verse for me, because when faced with condemnation, I often get lost and begin to doubt. Lately, however, I have become convinced that people’s negative reactions only strengthen my faith. Overall, Scripture itself is a guide for me in my career in health care administration. The truths it contains allow me to stay on track and give hope to others, including patients. In addition, these verses play an important role in making me aware of my spiritual poverty and desire for God.
