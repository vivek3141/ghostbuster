Summary
The analyzed research was dedicated to discussing the essential role of nurses in diagnostic error prevention. The researcher estimated nurses’ engagement in the diagnosis process based on the empirical literature review. Then, they proposed the conceptual framework of how the medical organization can reduce diagnosis errors. The conceptual framework was oriented toward designing and offering the model to expand the nurses’ engagement in the diagnostic process. The last step was to present the results of the framework appliance. Based on the theoretical literature review, the research authors provided an extensive model of full nursing engagement called the tripartite framework (Baker et al., 2017). The model included three essential components: interprofessional teamwork, patient empowerment, and the nurses’ engagement in identifying the diagnostic signs (Baker et al., 2017). According to the practical model appliance, the outcomes showed a decrease in diagnostic errors and misses, increased diagnosis time, and total growth in patient safety rates (Baker et al., 2017). The model also emphasized the role of the patient experience and engagement in the diagnosis process through the nurses.
The structured literature data presented in the form of the framework was applied within the particular organization. The empirical results contributed to the formulation of the four potential barriers to nursing engagement, including culture, education, regulation, and operations (Baker et al., 2017). Scientists also provided the solutions to mentioned challenges as an additional part of the conceptual framework. Concerning the cultural barrier, the psychology of the nurses’ self-identification was a vital problem. A vast percentage of nurses and clinicians supposed that nurses should not participate in the diagnosis process (Baker et al., 2017). However, the research highlighted that nurses could not be separated from the diagnosis because they have a role in establishing patient-physician relationships.
Including nurses in the diagnosis, the process was implemented by various medical institutions. Researchers provided examples of such implementation and analyzed the results showing an increased patient satisfaction level and a lower rate of medication errors (Baker et al., 2017). In an attempt to overcome this barrier, the researcher suggested implementing the engaging policy by the medical administrative bodies. In order to overcome the education barrier, medical providers should offer nurse education programs focused on specific diagnosis principles (Baker et al., 2017). Moreover, licensed educational organizations should implement interprofessional training classes in the regular students’ curricula. The operational barrier can be overcome by the proper nurse staffing regulations and by eliminating turnovers (Baker et al., 2017). The regulation barrier is connected with the lack of governmental or administrative acts of nursing practices. Researchers depicted the correlation between the practical examples of the nurse practice acts passed in some states and the increased patient satisfaction level (Baker et al., 2017). Even though some barriers are hard to overcome, the subsequent framework appliance is supposed to reduce diagnosis errors.
Variables and Theory
During their investigation, researchers provided the practical scientific experiments results which were conducted earlier to prove that the solutions are reasonable and relevant to the topic. Such theoretical variables showed that the medical providers managed to reduce the diagnosis risks by applying some of the frameworks’ concepts. Therefore, the researchers combined the results of the developed framework research and the comparative analysis of other scientific experiments to design and structure the barriers for their model appliance. The conceptual model included specific guidance to increase the nurses’ engagement in the diagnosis. Due to the extensive literature review, the model was detailed and easy to use in practice. As a result, its implementation within a separate medical organization was a comprehensible task. However, the question of whether it will be working on a broader range of variables arises.
