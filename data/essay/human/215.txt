The topic of the project in question addresses the implications evidence-based practice (EBP) training among nurses can have on the scope of patient satisfaction with health care services. Essentially, the project seeks to meet five major objectives that tackle both the nurses’ and patients’ well-being in the hospital setting:
  * The first objective of the project is to explore how nurses’ level of EBP knowledge and implementation affects the quality of services they provide to the patients. Since studies demonstrate that EBP implementation in the workplace contributes positively to the nurses’ sense of personal achievement, it is reasonable to assume that such an improvement will affect their motivation to perform work due diligence (Rodríguez-Nogueira et al., 2021). Hence, this project will help clinical specialists to explore the peculiarities of this connection.
  * The second objective of the project is to improve the overall level of EBP knowledge and implementation among nurses in general hospitals. Even if the intervention of the project does not present the expected results in terms of correlation between patient satisfaction and EBP training, the latter is still an asset for the clinical setting. Indeed, the EBP implementation remains one of the objectives for many general hospitals.
  * The third objective is to explore the connection between the EBP training programs and nurses’ job satisfaction. Job satisfaction and motivation are some of the pillars of meaningful and efficient nursing practice and community outreach. For this reason, this project seeks to identify the extent to which improving nurses’ level of expertise and self-awareness contributes to their mental well-being and dedication to the job.
  * The fourth objective of the project is to develop and practice a comprehensive and time-efficient EBP introductory training for the nurses in general hospitals. One of the many reasons behind the lack of EBP implementation in the workplace is the nurses’ inability to find enough time for research and analysis. Thus, by presenting a three-day training program that takes nearly six hours to complete, the project may present insight into the patterns of meaningful EBP training in a busy hospital setting.
  * The final objective of the project is to collect exhaustive feedback on the matter of patients’ satisfaction with the services provided by the nurses. Quality health care is one of the primary objectives of any clinical setting, so conducting a patient satisfaction survey is a beneficial way to gain insights into the existing strengths and weaknesses of the nursing staff. Thus, even if the hypothesis of the project is not justified, the facility will still obtain data on the areas for service improvement.
All the aforementioned objectives for the project are focused on the integrity of services provided to the patients. The right to receive quality health care is one of the fundamental aspects of social justice, as it presupposes equal access to high-quality nursing care regardless of the individuals’ personal beliefs and qualities and the nurses’ subjective attitude. Although many nurses realize the importance of pursuing social justice, excessive workload and lack of personal accomplishment sometimes let them extrapolate their fatigue and job dissatisfaction to the attitude towards the patients (Sultana et al., 2020). Moreover, burnout and lack of expertise among nurses affect patient autonomy or the patients’ right to participate in the decision-making process and treatment. In order to ensure autonomy, nurses are to pay attention to the patients’ concerns and non-medical factors. Since lack of EBP expertise and the prevalence of burnout contribute to poor interaction with patients, this project will help reinstate patient autonomy in the workplace. Hence, the present project seeks to explore the options to minimize the level of personal concerns and their potential effect on the socially equal and respectful treatment of the patients.
