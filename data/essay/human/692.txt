I have a photo in front of me, which depicts many people, but the emphasis is only on one person, who is located in the center. He is surrounded by people who can be mentally divided into civil servants (the presence of business suits distinguishes them) and ordinary citizens. On the faces of everyone who can be seen, one can see bewilderment, a sense of injustice and lawlessness.
Turning to a more in-depth analysis of this photo, I would like to note that this work attracted me by the person’s personality. It is difficult not to recognize Nelson Mandela in this work; therefore, after reading the photo’s description, you begin to remember the circumstances under which this photo was released. Looking at the picture, you can feel the emotions of the central figure; he appears as a person confident in his innocence. This fact is especially emphasized by the visual effect when the main character of the photo seems to be above all the other participants (MacDonald, 1). Separately, it is striking that Mandela confronts people in suits when ordinary people are standing behind him, ready to support him. It is like revealing the theme of the confrontation between the state and ordinary citizens. Nelson Mandela feels like a hero who is confident in himself and his victory overpower. The photo’s author shows that he is on the defendant’s side, emphasizing this with various visual effects.
This work gets into the soul well; I want to analyze and visualize the photo, imagine what Mandela is saying at this moment and what people are shouting behind his back, a pleasant feeling. This work is what we call “touched to the depths of the soul”, the photo reflects a landmark historical event and conveys the right atmosphere, thanks to which we experience genuine emotions.
