The source of information for this blog post was Google Arts and Cultures’ explore page. An original search led to the discovery of the subject, and some of the keywords used were “modern art” and “modern European paintings.” The most important element of the explored exhibition is a representation of modern European art from Croatia by Gruž Harbour. In particular, there is a painting depicting a harbor and two people, a man, and a woman, displayed in Picture 1. This painting was created in 1965 in Croatia, which is consistent with the modernist art movement. This movement originates in the early decades of the 20th century, reflecting the new culture created by artists globally (Tate, n.d.).
I decided to explore modern art and this work in particular because this movement is the reflection of the artists’ views of modern times; hence this art is easier to understand for people of my age. This topic is important for the understanding of the arts and cultures in the global environment because, in many cases, regional arts, synch as the one from small European states, for example, Croatia, is not studied by students. Still, it reflects some of the tendencies and trends of the years and allows one to see the diversity of modern art. The original search led to this topic as I was exploring modern art from different states and found it interesting to look at paintings of lesser-known artists.
My blog relates to the intercultural thinking and creativity issues because it explores the art that the majority of people are not familiar with, and the information provided by Google enhances this. Google allows access to artworks and museums all over the world; for example, the painting in Picture 1 is from the Croatian museum of modern art. Hence, Google Art and Culture influences understanding about art by allowing us to see the varied examples of artworks. I was feeling excited and overwhelmed when I explored Google Arts and Cultures because many of the paintings and artworks I had never heard of or seen before. My subject search integrates the knowledge of the interconnections between culture, art, politics, the economy, and the social environment because it reflects the pattern of the artists’ thinking and the issues that the society was concerned with at that time. Picture 1 represents the social relationships and Croatia’s economy that is linked to the sea and ships.
