One of the pillars of efficient and meaningful clinical practice is ensuring that every professional is engaged in continuous education and growth. The implementation of evidence-based practice is a direct way to provide such an opportunity to nurses, allowing them to use relevant research to implement better, modernized, and patient-oriented interventions. According to Koota et al. (2021), “the EBP educational intervention implemented in this study had a positive effect on emergency nurses’ EBP attitudes, knowledge, self-efficacy, skills, and behavior” (p. 23). Hence, the introduction of EBP, by all means, is a positive change for the clinical setting.
However, it has been established in terms of the practicum that the implementation of EBP is currently limited in eh Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida. The issue is mostly related to the heavy workload of the staff and limited costs allocated to the educational interventions. Currently, the administration of the hospital is oriented towards financing actions and interventions efficient in the short term. Meanwhile, EBP, meaning an innovative approach to practice, can potentially save money on replacing old time-consuming, and less effective interventions.
The two major implications of this issue for nursing include the inability to access quality education and increased chances of emotional and physical burnout. Indeed, when nurses have no access to relevant scholarly research, they are less likely to secure positive patient outcomes and acquire knowledge. With the inability to implement more time-efficient and innovative practices, nurses are also at risk of struggling with a heavy workload. Moreover, according to Sultana et al. (2020), EBP can present evidence-based approaches to reduce burnout rates among nurses. For this reason, this issue needs more attention in clinical settings nationwide.
