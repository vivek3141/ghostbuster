Ohio.gov is a multifunctional platform designed to help job seekers and employers. The site provides information that can help different groups of people with their work and career needs. It uses job search and online learning tools to find the perfect job and improve one’s skills. On the site, a person can post a resume and indicate the preferred areas of work, which will be taken into account in the future and will help to contact the most suitable employers. Ohio.gov also provides information and skills to help one’s take a career to the next level. Each employer’s proposal normally contains brief information about the company that provides the job. In addition, it describes the requirements for the candidate, his or her duties, and the possibility of career growth.
The site provided all sorts of choice features to find information on the desired vacancy. If known, it is possible to filter the job search either by a specific job title or keywords. It helps those who would like to specialize in a certain area based on, for example, the main skills and abilities. Having sorted the information on the site by filters, namely: employment and job type, education level, and workdays, I thereby reduced the final result that the site would provide me. I also entered the keywords cybersecurity, computer science , and problem-solving , and I got a job link for Cybersecurity Manager (Job ID: 237544968). Thanks to Ohio.gov , I can immediately send my resume to an employer for consideration or bookmark the job to continue my search. If I do not find anything better than offer ID 237544968, I can come back and send my CV later. Crowe company, as an employer, posted all the necessary information and even indicated advantages over other companies.
