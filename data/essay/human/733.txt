The messages sent through verbal, nonverbal, and paraverbal means of communication informed the listeners about the speaker’s issues. Firstly, verbal statements informed about the problems at work and personal life, which were important to the speaker. The speaker expressed minor concern with the issues with colleagues at work using words to share his feelings. The paraverbal messages sent through the pitch and tone of the voice and the speed of speaking demonstrated more information about the emotional aspects of the discussed situations. When answering the additional questions about the speaker’s personal life, he spoke faster and in a higher pitch in comparison to the paraverbal characteristics of speaking about work. As for nonverbal messages, the speaker’s facial expressions throughout the communication process delivered the information about positive emotions through smiles and open gestures. Also, once asked uncomfortable or too personal questions, the speaker crossed legs and arms as well as touched his face, and looked away.
The messages transmitted through verbal, nonverbal, and paraverbal communication were partially consistent with several cases indicating differences between the ideas delivered by words and accompanying nonverbal and paraverbal signs. Indeed, when speaking about the unpleasant occurrences at work, the speaker tried to remain calm and analyze the situations rationally. However, as he spoke, his speech was abrupt, arms crossed, and he continuously changed the direction of his sight. These nonverbal and paraverbal messages indicated that the speaker was uncomfortable or deceitful about the discussed issues. However, in most cases, the three types of communication channels were used consistently. For example, when asked about personal life, the speaker used more descriptive words, expressed positive emotions with words and facial expressions, and higher pitch and a faster pace of speaking.
Probably, not all of the messages have been read correctly and clearly because the process of reading others is complex and multifaceted. It takes much practice to identify clear patterns and understand the meaning of nonverbal and paraverbal communication messages. Particular facial expressions, body language, and paraverbal indicators might have different meanings depending on a situation or a context. Therefore, it is essential to analyze all the attributes and multiple factors when ‘reading’ others for consistent and clear communication.
