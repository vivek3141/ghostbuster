Bjurström, Erling and Hylland, Ole M. (Eds.). (2018). Aesthetics and Politics: A Nordic Perspective on How Cultural Policy Negotiates the Agency of Music and Arts . Springer International Publishing.
This scientific work tries to find the primary sources of rock as a culture. The authors refer to the ancient Nordic society, analyzing their way of life, moods and character. Musical instruments and the role of music as a sphere of art in the life of the layman are considered separately. As a result, the researchers come to the conclusion that it is impossible to identify the only source of the genre, but it is worth considering the whole society as a whole. This, in turn, suggests that rock can be regarded as a worldwide condition, since different parts of the world in one way or another invented rock motifs and melodies. Thus, the writers emphasize that the genre should be considered as a separate stage in the evolution of art, and not only in the field of music.

The authors of this book conduct a worldwide and large-scale study of the role of rock motifs and certain musical instruments in the life of primitive societies. Further, the writers notice the cultural characteristics of the natives and Indians, as well as African tribes, emphasizing rock music as a tool for connecting with God. This allows us to conclude that the religious meaning in rock culture is present as one of the root causes of the formation of a whole movement. Finally, it is worth highlighting the ubiquity of the analyzed genre, which explains not only the popularity of rock, but also the whole lifestyle associated with it. An important addition is the selection by researchers of the most popular and first melodies by sounds and notes, and the identification of a close relationship with ancient cultures. The conclusion of the study is that rock has its own clear laws and rules for implementation, which originate more than 1000 years ago.

This book is not a study of the genre itself, but a guide to the methodology of studying rock. The authors compare and contrast the instruments used to explore this area of ​​music. It is noted that this genre does not need to be analyzed as a separate sphere of art, but, on the contrary, it can look for conjugations and relationships. In addition, an important note of the authors is the integrity and unity of all art. This is expressed primarily in the fact that the mood broadcast by rock can be observed in other subsystems. This in turn means that only an objective, exploratory and multifaceted approach can bring the right results.

This article explores the phenomenon of the popularity of rock music among everything on earth. The authors are sure that the relationship of the genre with moods and people comes from the distant past of civilization. One of the researches included in the article was the analysis of wooden and later electric musical instruments. The authors came to the conclusion that the choice of both the material and the tonality of the sound of such instruments is not accidental, but is intended to communicate to God, nature and the public about the most disturbing problems. It is this approach that is taken as the basis of the study, in which rock music is considered as a separate language of self-expression and cultural context.

This book explores the relationship between culture and rock as a genre of music. It is remarkable that the authors take the basic sounds of English culture as a basis for studying and consider their introduction into the genre. Thus, the authors come to the conclusion that rock is not so much a relatively modern trend in art and culture as a collective image of different eras. Finally, the book provides theory and analysis of the origins of rock music and its development. This allows to understand the causes and key aspects of the whole process, as well as to reveal the relationship of the analyzed genre with world culture.
