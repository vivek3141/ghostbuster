Human trafficking is a significant problem in the United States and abroad, which is considered to be modern-day slavery. Human trafficking involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act (Zhang et al., 2012). In Latin America, the problem is crucial, as many gangs and criminal organizations use human trafficking as one of the sources of funding their illegal activities (Zhang et al., 2012). Thus, it is crucial to partner with organizations in Mexico and other Latin countries to address the problem. It is also crucial to focus on women and children, as they are the most frequent victims of human trafficking (Zhang et al., 2012). Therefore, I would partner with Justicia Para Nuestras Hijas, as it provides legal and psychological help for women and girls in Chihuahua, Mexico.
Justicia Para Nuestras Hijas is a civil organization that was created in 2002 in the city of Chihuahua (Mexico) with the purpose of promoting access justice in the cases of missing or murdered women (HHRI, 2017). This phenomenon is particularly serious in the state of Chihuahua, where the organization was created, as the murder and kidnapping rates of women were very high in the 2000s (HHRI, 2017). I would allocate the funding to the expansion of the program and building direct relationships with the US to maximize the efficiency of preventing human trafficking. Moreover, I would focus on advertising the organization in the country so that women in danger could contact it using the most convenient way. Increased awareness about the organization could also encourage people to report any known cases of women and children abuse.
