The impact of pesticide utilization can be devastating for nature and the environment because they influence health, animals, plants, and living conditions. Their hazard on bees’ behavior reveals that bioaccumulation is severe for pollination, critical for plants and seeds growth, and food production. Recent studies and organizations such as The Environmental Protection Agency encourage the government and manufacturers to act against pesticides to avoid disappearing entire incepts’ populations (Lawler, 2017). The artificial changes in the ecosystem can lead to catastrophic consequences, natural disasters, poor harvests, and water pollution (Matyjaszczyk, 2018). Consequently, actionable steps must be made to address the problem, and vectors control or integrative pest management (IPM) are the profound approaches to start from.
Pesticides utilization is becoming a global problem, therefore United Nations, World Health Organization, and World Wide Fund for Nature need to address the situation. For instance, encouraging businesses and households to exercise IPM for sustainable improvement in decreasing the use of pests. The idea of evaluating if certain biological products are necessary for agriculture is profound for the optimization and selection of ecology-friendly alternatives (Matyjaszczyk, 2018). Vectors’ control influences the environmental situation, and encouragement to implement proper practices can be reached through research and social programs devoted to the importance of particular incept species. Lawler (2017) states that “Health agencies, the public, and environmental groups have especially debated the use of methoprene because some studies have shown toxic effects on non-target organisms” (p. 337). The hazardous side effects need to be revealed to the public to force industries to decrease the pesticide use in vectors control.
