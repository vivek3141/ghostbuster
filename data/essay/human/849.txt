The differential association theory was developed in 1939 by the veteran sociologist Edwin Sutherland. The study explains how prohibited manners master’s in social establishments can lead to criminology. Multiple people grasp the mindsets, methods, and justifications for illegal techniques by interacting with different persons. According to Lokanan (2018), people can minimize fraud-related cases by understanding the theory to maneuver positive results in the organizations such as schools. Students in high school interact with distinct people who possess offensive habits, and misconducts occur during this period.
During my high school period, my classmates and other senior students abused drugs that caused a severe threat to their health. The use of alcohol and cocaine was considered a crucial practice by most cliques since they could access the drugs from the drug vendors in the nearest town. The drug dealers used to visit the school frequently to sell drugs to the addicted students within the school environment. Throughout my school experience, addictive students would rush to bathrooms to smoke, inject cocaine, and consume alcohol repeatedly. The actions arose since the learners’ parents could offer finances to the students hence, they could access the drugs.
Drug abuse can lead to negative consequences such as low educational attainment, well-being problems such as brain disorders, and crime in society. The substance-induced in the body changes the brain functions through repeated use which determines the person’s genetic constituents (Fernàndez-Castillo et al., 2021). Drugs such as cocaine have enormous influences on individuals’ life and, and if overdosed, death can occur. Some individuals are better genetically sensitive to developing cocaine addiction compared to others.
Cliques in high school who used drugs committed crimes and served imprisonment in various correctional facilities. Misconduct is one of the outcomes of drug violation whereby both educators and parents should maneuver new methodologies to remedy the problem. The provision of school-based education to the youth is one of the proposed techniques to minimize the use and abuse of drugs in schools (Montgomery et al., 2022). Educational interventions in schools can boost cognitive-behavioral skills and decrease exposure to social forces that raise drug misuse. The study shows that multiple youths do not possess felony patterns in their adult life.
The theory illustrates that forty percent of people below 21 years old execute offenses in society. In addition, another feature such as growing up in a poor environment can lead to criminal behavior because of poverty or lack of necessities. Sutherlands argues that factors such as moral reasoning and freedom can control the intention of the people indulging in crimes (Brookes, 2021). Parents should ensure their children have the basic needs by engaging them in school-based education and non-curriculum activities such as games to avoid misconduct.
The approach explains how people should understand the purpose of declining fraud in the social domains. The utilization of the material is a crucial source to curb the behavior and improve the student’s performance by offering health education. Parents and tutors should play their roles effectively by taking actions such as punishing the learners who bully others or commit offenses during their high school life. Culture has also influenced young people to join organized syndicates where many young individuals have lost their lives. It is critical to educate the youths about the consequences of the breach and drug misuse to minimize the demeanor in society. Education can support youthful people to gain motivation by acquiring proper skills during school life and making reasonable decisions.
