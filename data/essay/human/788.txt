In Mesopotamia and Egypt, the first kings similarly worked alongside priests and depended on their support. However, Egyptian kings, specifically called pharaohs, were considered kings of the whole region and clearly stood above priests, while Mesopotamian kings worked closely with them (Brooks, 2019). Another important difference is the origin of the state’s rulers, as Mesopotamian kings were also warriors who led their people in battles with their neighbors, while Egyptian pharaohs were thought to be god-kings (Brooks, 2019). Egypt was a centralized unit, unlike Mesopotamia, which presented itself as several separate states.
Furthermore, differences in religious outlooks arose from alternate views on why the gods created humans. Mesopotamians considered gods to be cruel and believed that humans were not to enjoy life and could risk offending the gods (Brooks, 2019). Unlike the Egyptians, they did not believe in the afterlife, possibly because of the god’s attitude towards people. In Egypt, a religious, ethical code approved by gods guided each citizen (Kreis, 2006). This is why the afterlife was such an essential part of their beliefs – it was a process that evaluated their goodness throughout life.
The religious and agricultural development inevitably led to the intellectual and cultural progress of the countries. The Middle Kingdom of Egypt is famous for its papyrus use, along with ink and cosmetics (Brooks, 2019). Mummification was an essential process related to their general religious beliefs. On the contrary, the warfare and trade typical for Mesopotamia explain their creation of the wheel and significant improvement of architecture and the sciences (Brooks, 2019). It can be suggested that religion played a major role in the groundbreaking inventions of Egypt (Kreis, 2006). Generally, the key differences between the regions arose from contrasting religious and political systems.
