Counseling patients with HIV/AIDS is associated with significant psychological issues. One of the primary concerns is the reaction to the diagnosis. According to Chippindale and French (2001), there is a wide range of reactions to diagnosis considered normal, as some clients may take the matter very calmly, while others will react to the diagnosis with a prolonged period of distress, anger, and anxiety. Thus, the central recommendation for human service professionals counseling clients with HIV/AIDS is to allow time for the shock of the news to sink (Chippindale & French, 2001). The period of shock may be followed by a period of emotional ventilation, which may include overt stress (Chippindale & French, 2001). Thus, the central recommendation for counselors that inform clients about their diagnosis is to stay calm and allow time for the client instead of taking immediate action.
The second recommendation is to put increased emphasis on acquiring coping strategies. In particular, the counselor should encourage the client to participate in the planning of care and in seeking appropriate social support (Chippindale & French, 2001). Additionally, it is crucial to work in alliance with the clientâ€™s partner, friends, and family to ensure that the best outcomes (Chippindale & French, 2001). The therapist needs to understand that it is impossible to be around the client all the time; however, the friends and family may be there just in time with the client needs psychological help the most. This will help the client to maintain an active lifestyle with minimal effect on everyday activities. It is crucial to help the client acknowledge all the stereotypes associated with the disease and understand that life goes on even after the diagnosis (Chippindale & French, 2001). Such strategies will allow stabilization of the emotional state of the client.
