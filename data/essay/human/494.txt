It should be noted that drivers should not be allowed to use handheld devices when their vehicle is stopped at a red light. The driving process is highly demanding of one’s attention, which means that any form of distraction is a risk factor. Handheld devices are distractive, and thus, drivers lose sight and focus of the road and signals of movement. Therefore, handheld devices should be banned for drivers at all times because stopping at red lights also requires drivers’ attention.
The red light signal is a critical element of road safety and efficient movement, especially at intersections. The State of Georgia implemented an act, which “makes it illegal for drivers to “physically hold or support, with any part of his or her body,” a wireless telecommunications device” (Dyke and Smith, para. 2). Only exceptions to the rule include making “calls to report a traffic accident, criminal activity, medical emergency, or hazardous condition” (Dyke and Smith, para 3). However, the red light signal is an essential part of road safety, which does not remove the need for a driver’s attention. A study suggests that “phone use during driving causes decrease in situation awareness and delays response to the events happening in driving environment which may lead to accidents” (Choudhary and Velaga 351). In other words, drivers will be slow to react to light changes from red signal to green one. This will cause unnecessary delays in the movement of traffic.
In conclusion, on the basis of evidence provided above, drivers should not be allowed to use their handheld devices during the red light signal since attention on the road is required even during the stop. The delayed response time might cause unnecessary traffic and congestion. These factors increase the risk of accidents because not all drivers will be responding to changes in light signals at the same time.
