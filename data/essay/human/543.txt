Global climate change, as has now been proven by the latest research, is caused by human activity. Awareness of the seriousness of the situation is gradually penetrating into world public opinion. There is still an opportunity to mitigate the consequences to avoid the worst. People can all unite in order to change the situation, even though this process may be gradual and take some time.
The main difficulty is connected with the extremely uneven distribution of greenhouse gas emissions between developed and developing countries, large and small. However, it is possible to change the situation by taking small steps. For instance, the population should use public transportation instead of cars. When using cars, there is an enormous amount of exhaustive fumes released in the atmosphere. This initiative can contribute to lower gas emissions, further reducing the consequences of global warming.
Additionally, people can start saving energy by drying laundry on a rope, not in an electric dryer. One may also set a lower switch-on temperature on the heating system thermostat ( What Are the Solutions ). What is more, meat production entails significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions than chicken production, growing vegetables, fruits and cereals. Therefore, people should start eating more of those to live healthier and more aware.
In conclusion, global warming is a severe threat to modern society and is likely to affect the entire planet. Consequently, people should unite to solve this problem together in order to prevent the spread of emissions and litter, and promote a healthy lifestyle. By saving energy, eating proper food, and leading healthy lifestyles, individuals can contribute to the change of climate. These easy solutions can significantly boost the planetâ€™s immunity to global problems.
