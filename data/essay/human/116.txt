It is necessary to fully understand the fundamental difference between the concepts of a leader and a regular employee in any field. While the head of the company is most often focused on the internal financial processes, a good leader understands the paramount importance of employees in any enterprise. The ideal leader sees the potential in every person and helps them develop to the maximum while working with them in the same direction instead of putting pressure. The policy of actions of flawed leaders can lead to more than unpleasant consequences for all sides of any business.
Unfortunately, imperfect leaders in our time can be found a lot in any field. Bad experiences can happen on any level, from personal to global. It is particularly difficult to single out a specific person without personal experience and hard evidence, but statistics show an extremely high proportion of unscrupulous people in high positions. According to available data, the owner of Ali Express online retailer, Jack Ma, can be cited as an example. Plenty of evidence suggests that most of the items available to order are made by underage children from the poorest parts of the world. With the tacit consent of Jack Ma, many thousands of people are being exploited for minimal pay and terrible living conditions. It is an example of a person who is not only a bad leader but intentionally contributes to the violation of human rights. One of the biggest problems, in this case, is the lack of empathy and humanism. A bad leader always looks at people through the prism of a solid resource and cheap labor. It is difficult for an imperfect leader to hear and understand a person’s intentions through the prism of ignorance and selfishness. It is the absolute wrong approach, leading to nothing but a dead end. However, it should be noted that any statement in this vein is a serious accusation and requires additional thorough collection and analysis of data.
The exploitation of people in any level of relationship, from business to politics, cannot lead to a successful and fulfilled conclusion. The best people and professionals will not tolerate such an attitude and quickly find a replacement with better conditions. The main mistake of many leaders in any business is an overly egocentric picture of the world and a tendency to immoral exploitation of people’s resources.
