Research question: What are the risk factors for developing cancer due to Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection?
This research question will look at the risk factors that lead to the development of cancer due to HPV infection. This is necessary to develop the most effective measures to prevent comorbidities and complications for already infected patients. For the investigation of the question, the observational design will be used, which is widely used in epidemiology to collect data (Paneth & Joyner, 2021). As part of this study, the researcher monitors “the exposure and disease status of each study participant” ( Section 7: Analytic epidemiology , n.d). To answer a research question, a cohort study is most suitable, which will identify exposure to the disease. Based on the data obtained as part of the study, it will be possible to analyze existing risk factors that take into account the possibility of developing cancer.
The advantage of this method in the framework of this study is the ability to collect relevant information. When conducting observations, the researcher can collect the necessary statistical data on the incidence of cancer due to HPV infection and consider risk factors that potentially increase the possibility of developing the disease. Most importantly, observational design as part of a research question will collect data for future statistical analysis. Follow-ups of patients who already have cancer due to HPV and a study of their lifestyle will help identify contributing factors. On their basis, later, it will be possible to make an analysis to identify patterns of cancer development as a consequence of HPV. The information obtained in the framework of an observational study may be sufficient to consider the question posed.
