With exponential growth in smart device users, there is an increase in the volume of data generated from various smart devices, which differs according to all the fundamental V’s used to classify it as big data. In general, most service providers, such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Yahoo, have established a significant number of geographically scattered data centers to process the massive quantity of data generated by various smart devices to give consumers speedy response times. These service providers commonly employ Hadoop and SPARK for processing massive datasets for this reason (Chaudhary et al., 2018). However, there has been less attention placed on the underlying infrastructure, which is one of the most crucial aspects for the effective completion of any specified solution in this context.
I believe that cloud technology optimizes and simplifies many of the issues presented in the business applications of big data. It largely solves the problem of insufficient data storage size and ensures the infrastructure’s greater flexibility. Similarly, the information is easier to back up through cloud solutions, increasing the overall resilience of big data-related processes. The value of big data in business cannot be overstated. It aids in identifying the target audience, doing market research, and obtaining more precise findings. Companies will be able to simplify corporate processes by incorporating big data into their operations. Companies will be able to make decisions based on precise information, such as whether to invest in a product. Consequently, they will be able to avoid making inefficient investments. Since the subject of Big Data and the cloud solutions for it becomes unavoidable, it is essential for the firms to adapt their existing infrastructures to the market demands sooner rather than later.
