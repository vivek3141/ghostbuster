While the situation with the COVID-19 pandemic is critical, the case with mandatory vaccination at work is controversial. I think it is justified because it helps stop the pandemic; those unwilling to vaccinate should be ensured that they will not facilitate the contamination by the coronavirus. However, such a decision requires additional measures to ensure that the vaccine is safe and beneficial for the human organism. Despite a lack of time, as the pandemic must be conquered as soon as possible, the laws which require massive mandatory vaccination, under a threat of high fines, are the radical measure. They should be implemented carefully, as they may limit human rights and even be undemocratic, despite sometimes they are necessary to cope with challenging situations. In my opinion, the pandemic is such a situation, and it should be overcome.
I think that mandatory vaccination does not violate the bill of rights only when everyone vaccinated knows clearly what they will obtain during the vaccination. In that way, the vaccine should be tested, and all test results should be available for check by each citizen. In my opinion, it would be even better if they could see all the processes of vaccine preparation. I personally would be much more confident in the decision to receive a vaccine, despite I think that vaccination is beneficial in any case.
Thus, by myself, I am a supporter of the case about vaccine mandates. Still, when we are talking about nationwide vaccination, it is essential to remember that people are often fear to vaccinate: I think, in most cases, they fear to damage themselves. If they will not fear that, they will be much more inclined to vaccination, as everyone wants to be healthy. To conclude, I think that while mandatory vaccination is a radical measure, it is necessary to overcome the pandemic; still, the government should ensure that the vaccination process is transparent and safe for all citizens.
