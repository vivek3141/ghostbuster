The percentage of uninsured people in my state, Washington, is among the lowest. Particularly, it was 6.6% as of 2019, which is considerably lower than in Oklahoma (14.9%) or Texas (18.4%) (Kaiser Family Foundation, n.d.). In my opinion, the connection between the socioeconomic status and access to care is evident. The fewer opportunities a person has in terms of financial provision, the less possible it is for them to afford high-quality health care. Individuals with low income are highly likely to be uninsured or eligible for Medicaid. As a result, such citizens do not seek health care as often as it is needed. Frequently, they only address specialists in emergency cases, neglecting many other issues that require prevention or treatment.
I think that the main reason why the percentage is low in my state is because of its geographic location. There are many job opportunities in the state of Washington, which means people can afford to pay for health insurance. Also, individuals living in this state are well-informed about their options regarding health needs. Apart from that, the number of healthcare facilities is much higher than, say, in rural areas. All of these factors contribute to the high level of insured people.
Speaking about the gap in quality of care and access to health care, I should also note such factors as ethnic disparities, access to education, and community context. In my state, it is easier for people from diverse backgrounds to accommodate and find support. However, there are parts of the country where some ethnic groups might be accepted with prejudice, which makes it difficult for them to pursue high-quality education and find well-paid jobs.
