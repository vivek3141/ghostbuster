In the modern world, terrorism is one of the pressing threats to human health and life. Considering the events of the past century, including the first and 9/11 bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 and 2001, United States Embassy in Beirut and Kuwait bombing, and many other attacks, the terror threat to the United States is high (Corbett et al., 2017). Therefore, it is important to apply comprehensive measures to combat terrorism.
To counter terrorism, the preventive activities of state authorities and local self-government bodies must be in place. The measures should include practices to identify and subsequently avoid the causes and conditions conducive to the commission of terrorist acts (Freilich et al., 2019). Moreover, identification, disclosure, and investigation of the causes of such acts with the participation of the military forces and police should be in place. Additionally, the tools to minimize and eliminate the consequences of manifestations of terrorism should be applied. However, at the same time, there is no single strategy to stop global terrorism.
The lack of universal measures is explained by the constant emergence of new ways of causing harm. In addition, the threat does not arise from the nationals of one specific country. The countries of the Middle East are known for their extensive supplies of oil and flammables, therefore, the unstable situation in the Middle East may affect the US economy (Mercure et al., 2018). Entering transportation constraints and better checks can bring a more efficient result.
In conclusion, the state structures of the United States have a great influence on stability and peace in the country and abroad. Blocking communications with the Middle East will partly reduce the threat to the United States, but at the same time may affect economic and political relations between the countries. In the absence of universal counter-terrorism measures, it is still of high importance to apply comprehensive measures of prevention, studying the events that happened, and involving the police and military forces to combat the threats.
