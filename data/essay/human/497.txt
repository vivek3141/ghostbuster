I will examine the symptoms and potential causes for the lung cancer disease further in this assignment.
Lung cancer is one of the most frequent types of the condition, and with the low recovery rates. Due to the structure and function of lungs, most tumors very quickly become inoperable. Every year, around 40,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with the illness. In the early stages of lung cancer, there are generally no signs or symptoms, although many people with the disease eventually acquire a mix of them. A chronic cough, coughing up blood, dyspnea, inexplicable exhaustion, weight loss, and an ache or pain when inhaling or coughing are all common symptoms of lung cancer.
Although those who have never smoked can get lung cancer, smoking is the leading cause. This is due to the fact that smoking includes breathing a variety of hazardous compounds on a regular basis, and thus leads to almost 72% of cases (Oâ€™Keeffe et al., 2018). Treatment is determined by the type of mutation in the tumor, the extent of its dissemination, and a general condition of the patient. If the problem is detected early and the malignant cells are contained to a small region, surgery to remove the afflicted lung area may be advised. If surgery is not an option owing to the overall health, radiation to remove malignant cells may be suggested instead. Chemotherapy is frequently used when the cancer has developed too much for surgery or radiation to be helpful.
