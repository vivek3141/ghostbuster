The global pandemic has severely influenced the typical style of living people were used to before the strike of the harmful virus. The research paper focuses on the mental repercussions of the infection on students in Saudi Arabia. To be more precise, the authors aimed to investigate whether the transition to a new lifestyle due to the pandemic has impacted the anxiety levels of university youth.
Naturally, the researchers needed to convey practical analysis to obtain data to form conclusions regarding the alterations in anxiety levels among students. That is why Khoshaim et al. (2020) surveyed 400 students from different universities on an online platform, asking the participants about their mental state and whether they noticed any changes in their behavior or perception because of COVID-19. It seems significant to mention that questionnaires were sent to the youth from March to June in 2020, which is the pandemicâ€™s peak around the globe (Khoshaim et al., 2020). Still, Khoshaim et al. (2020) concluded that 35% of the surveyed students were suffering from moderate or extreme anxiety, which severely complicated the course of their studies. By and large, this research is focused on an important topic, considering that students are still affected by the changes to global education as a result of COVID-19.
Unfortunately, the results of this research cannot be claimed to be reliable as the students could experience anxiety due to different reasons that could not be omitted in their answers to the online questionnaire. Still, this work is a solid foundation for further studies with more narrowed scopes that could investigate the mental issues among the youth as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the following restrictions. In addition, the government can use the obtained data to assist students in overcoming their anxiety to enhance their academic performance and well-being.
