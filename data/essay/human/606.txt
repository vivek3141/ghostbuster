The project is devoted to analyzing the painting Madonna Adoring the Child , painted in 1480 by Francesco Botticini. It is one of the masterpieces of the Renaissance embodying the typical lines and techniques of that period.
The artwork depicts Madonna staying close to Jesus’ Child. She looks with passion and love at him, while the baby looks at the Virgin Mary. The composition of the paper is balanced. First, the eye looks at Madonna and her head, but then it moves to a child and his image. The activity of the painting remains within the image borders, as only background scenery is seen. The work is not monumental; however, its size helps to create a specific composition with full-size figures on it. However, the baby might seem too big, which can be symbolic to emphasize his importance.
The colors used are neutral as the painter avoids using bright spots. The overall gamma is neutral, with the closes and figures’ heads being the most notable elements. All colors are naturalistic as the painter tried to create an accurate image of these two outstanding figures. Thus, the use of oil and tempera adds some specific roughness to brushstrokes and makes the painting look unique.
The image also managed to create a clear illusion of depth as the background depicts a particular landscape that also looks realistic. The main figures are in the center and at the bottom of the composition, which helps to find them, seeing the background at the same time. All lines are clear and well-defined, and many details are given to clothes, faces, and other objects depicted in the image. At the same time, the figures look soft and tender. In general, the picture fits with the stylistic period when it was created, as such motifs, colors, and shapes were typical for artists of that period. The artist wanted to show the human nature of Jesus and, at the same time, emphasize the purity of the whole family.
Altogether, Madonna Adoring the Child is a picture perfectly demonstrating the style and ideas of that period. Its central theme, which is depicting the Virgin Mary and Jesus, is one of the frequently used motifs of that period. The choice of shapes, colors and the whole composition is similar to other works painted by artists who worked during Renaissance.
