The process of commercialization of media, such as radio and television, as well as national broadcasting in general, began with the template derived from the United States. It should be noted that American influence around the globe is massive when it comes to communications and media. Therefore, the emergent states’ eagerness to seek separateness needs to be supported, which is not being done at the moment.
In Chapter 7, Schiller on how the international commercialization of broadcasting unfolded and impacted a wide range of international communities. For example, the author states, “in Western Europe, the most stable non-commercial broadcasting structures of sovereign states are unable to resist the forces that are arrayed against them” (Schiller 145). In other words, the force of such commercialization cannot be overlooked. For instance, Schiller also states that “the quest in the emergent nations for separateness is not, as some may believe, a reflection of immaturity” (Schiller 163). The primary reason is the fact that they need such isolation in order to achieve global solidarity, where global equalization is beneficial for everyone. Therefore, one can agree that the author describes a modern version of imperialism, where one powerful nation imposes its ideals, values, and interests on other ones. In the past, it was done by the brute force of superior military, but modern technology enabled a more intricate form of imperialism through media.
In conclusion, the process of commercialization of international broadcasting began with America, and the latter was the prime beneficiary of such change.
