The phrase that caught me most from the video is from Isaiah, stating that Samuel has taught him that one person can play t-ball and hit it hard when sitting down. This is a powerful statement indicating that people can be prejudiced despite having good intentions. Samuel’s family did not realize the struggles disabled people go through before he was born (PinehurstPictures, 2010). The child’s image hitting the t-ball also showcased a powerful issue, that disabled individuals should be treated similarly to other people and given equal opportunities to give them the chance to perform optimally.
I was intrigued to see children like Nathanial Orellana learning in a normal classroom. His mother determined they sought school actively to ensure he received the best care considering his autism (PinehurstPictures, 2010). Parents face a myriad of extra challenges raising disabled children to give them advantages that would help them compete with their peers in society. The video illustrates that communities and the government should provide parents with a variety of schools to determine the best for their child’s disability.
Children with disabilities require special care but should be allowed to interact with others if their illness would not worsen based on these connections. Engagement is a crucial tool for child development as it requires them to be attentive and active, propagating greater achievement due to increased enthusiasm. Nathanial raises his hand to answer a question because each student is engaged in the classroom. His enthusiasm to answer the question shows interest and a desire to learn, traits associated with high achievement.
The video is helpful because it provides a glimpse of the life individuals with disabilities pass through. Many of these parents face issues with education as they would like their children to receive the best education while also avoiding the pitfalls that other children do not face. Emily, a mental health advocate, has schizophrenia and discerns that people without the illness cannot fully understand their plight (PinehurstPictures, 2010). In this aspect, people without developmental problems may not see the issues they face and should work hard to help them optimally function in society. Keith Jones also showcases an important faction of society. He claims that individuals should not expect children to develop good social skills if they stay for eight hours in a classroom without adequate interaction (PinehurstPictures, 2010). It is crucial to recognize that inclusion would work well if children were given a chance to interact frequently despite their differences.
