One way in which sociology can make a valuable contribution to the understanding of the interrelation between race and health disparities is by coining a working definition of race that emphasizes its relevant aspects. Even today, when the idea of the social construction of race has long gained traction, the concept of race is often affected by the notions of physical anthropology and genetic inheritance. A proper sociological approach to the issue of race as related to health disparities may alleviate it by focusing on the stratifying principles of race, such as socioeconomic disadvantages and discrimination (Hummer, 1996). This approach will allow concentrating on the socioeconomic factors most relevant as social determinants of health and, by doing so, enable a better understanding of causal relations.
Another and more specific way in which sociology may help explain the connection between race and health disparities is by focusing on the environmental context of health. For instance, sociology may be of great help when explaining the access to opportunities for a healthier lifestyle and, in particular, diet. Kwate (2008) offers an example of what can be done in this regard in the study of the interrelation between residential segregation and fast food density. His approach involves analyzing the population, economic, physical, and social characteristics of a neighborhood to identify why fast food outlets are built at a proportionally larger scale in segregated black neighborhoods (Kwate, 2008). By doing so, Kwate (2008) shift attention from the simplistic explanations and assumptions that can steer the discussion of the problem in a wrong direction â€“ such as the presumption that blacks like fast foods more. Thus, as in the case above, the sociological approach allows focusing on the actual structural factors behind the interrelation between race and health disparities.
