Body Paragraphs
  * The plot structure of Back to the Future keeps the viewer interested in the film through logical cause-and-effect relationships.
      + Each moment in the film is connected to the last moment and the next, weaving them into a unified structure.
      + The scene begins with a ticking clock, then shifts to the theft of the plutonium and a focus on Marty, who is unaware of what was stolen under his bed.
      + Marty ignores the safety of the clock tower, but later it turns out that he was around when the tower stopped.
  * Character development in the story is built on the opposites of Marty and Doc, who elusively turn out to be people with similar histories.
      + Marty is relatively quick and restless, though Doc seems judicious and prone to over-analyzing the situation: together, their work is coherent and efficient.
      + Marty uses teenage slang while Doc uses proper speech: their different characters allow them to see the best in each other and develop as individuals.
  * The film’s setting is new and unusual for the time of its creation, so the viewer’s eye is drawn to the screenwriter’s love of detail and desire to fill the film with characters from different eras.
      + The differences in road construction quickly determine the time difference: in the ’50s, some were dirt roads.
      + The film revisits the clock tower, which was in operation in the ’50s and stopped in the ’80s.
Conclusion
Back to the Future reveals to the viewer a new reality in which everything is interconnected: logical connections, people, and places. Zemeckis has created a unique story that amazes audiences with its details, developments, and shifting eras.
