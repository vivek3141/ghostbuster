Theodore Roosevelt was one of the youngest American presidents known for his progressive ideas and the desire to change society, addressing the existing distrust and helplessness. The decision to promote progressive ideas was not spontaneous, and he saw the movement as the possibility to protect the real rule of humans (Roosevelt, 1912). The characteristics of a progressive are the intention to stand for social justice, achieve good for all people, and improve the environment in which individuals should grow and develop. Being a progressive means being optimistic about every initiative and participating in problem-solving processes. There is no need to hide behind or keep silent but to act and become passionate about changes and transformations.
Despite the desire to support progressive thoughts, there are also some examples of anti-progressives. Roosevelt (1912) called them the people with narrow vision and little sympathy. Anti-progressives are never stirred by the mistakes or failures made by other people (Roosevelt, 1912). Individuals who are consumed by their selfishness are not able to appeal to conscience. Everything they can do is to support oppression and use reforms that work for the leaders’ success, not the public one. The activities varied from employees’ exploitation to the promotion of capitalism that bounded society and imposed limitations on creativity and progress.
Roosevelt wanted to make people believe in his ideas and goals. Thus, he described progressivism as the movement that aimed at underling the real rules and freedoms of society. It was high time to deliver justice and equality by explaining the worth of power and development. Following his rules, multiple achievements can be revealed, including the ability to select leaders through open and free voting. Addressing the areas of politics, social welfare, and decision-making relevance, progressives can succeed as the movement and Roosevelt as the leader. As soon as people analyze their options, they can make policies and laws to improve different aspects of their life.
