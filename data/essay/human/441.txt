It is important to note that psychopharmacology is a critical field of knowledge and expertise for any independent mental health practitioner. The main reason is the fact that psychopharmacology is a science-based study of medications and drugs on human psychology. It is becoming increasingly necessary for a mental health practitioner to be familiar and knowledgeable about pharmacological aspects of the treatment of mental issues.
As a future independent mental health practitioner, one must be fully equipped with skills and competencies in treating clients’ mental health problems, which is impossible without pharmacological interventions. It is stated that “even though psychiatrists represent the branch of medicine that specializes in psychopharmacology, they are directly responsible for providing only a fraction of professional services to the mentally ill” (Preston et al., 2021, p. 13). In other words, no treatment can be effective if the dedicated specialists are outsourcing the prescription of drugs to non-psychiatric professionals. In order to help clients to overcome stigma about mental disorders and medication, it is important “to bring up the topic in a preemptive way, at the time when the prescription is first written” (Preston et al., 2021, p. 66). In other words, a mental health practitioner needs to help patients weigh the pros and cons in an informed manner. Since non-adherence is a major problem when it comes to medications, one can help clients to comply with the prescriptions by giving “patients (and parents) time to really explore any concerns or worries that they might have about the psychiatric medication being recommended” (Preston et al., 2021, p. 67). Therefore, it is likely that patients will be cautious of drugs, which is why their concerns need to be heard, voiced and evaluated.
In conclusion, psychopharmacology is becoming critically important for an independent mental health practitioner. Medications play a major role in ensuring proper treatment measures. Thus, clients require assistance and informed education about their options.
