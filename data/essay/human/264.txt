The Roman Empire was largely polytheistic, suggesting that people acknowledged and honored several different gods. They thought that these entities had a part in the formation of Roman civilization and shaped the events of people’s everyday lives (Bartsch, 2020). Because of Rome’s geographical location, its population had regular interaction with Greek peoples who had expanded their territory into the Italian peninsula and Sicily (Beard, 2015). Many features of Greek culture were borrowed by Rome, with minor modifications to fit their requirements.
According to Polybius ‘ interpretation of the Roman government, the monarchy was solidified in the office of the Consul. The tales of Manilus Hippomanes, Olivier de Noyen, and Julien Barneuve are connected through history in The Dream of Scipio by a philosophical musing claiming that man is accountable for his action’s own redemption, but only by understanding, not by works or faith (Ruden, 2013). Rome had two chancellors, each in control of divisions of the Roman army and had the authority to convene conferences and present different initiatives before the Senate; they were acclaimed yearly.
Citizenship in Rome was a complicated notion that differed depending on one’s gender, family, and status in society. Males were the only ones who could acquire full citizenship. A kid born of a legal union between a citizen father and a citizen mother would be granted citizenship by descent (Beard, 2015). Citizenship in the United States can be obtained by birth or registration. People are generally born U.S. citizens if they are born in America or are born overseas to U.S. citizens. They may also obtain U.S. nationality as a youngster as a result of the marriage of one or both adults.
