It is important to note that the decision-making process is a complex and highly intricate activity, which involves the accuracy of the information, a clear vision of objectives, and an understanding of the underlying issues. Errors in the decision-making process are common and can be done by any manager. However, there is a clear distinction between a bad decision and a wrong decision. In the case of the latter, the decision is the result of reliance on false or inaccurate information with the best intentions to make a correct choice. When it comes to a bad decision, a manager is aware of and has accurate information and a proper understanding of key factors but intentionally chooses the incorrect path. A bad decision might occur due to a wide range of factors, which can involve a conflict between a manager’s self-interests and organizational objectives or merely emotional influence on the decision-making. However, wrong decisions require changes in the acquisition of accurate and reliable information on which the correct decision can be made.
In both cases, it is highly relevant to improve one’s decision-making skills both now and in the future. Such an improvement requires an increase in the integrity of processes of data acquisition and collection. It is stated that decisions can be “impaired by various inconsistencies and errors, which negatively affect the value of these data for any decision-making processes” (Schuh et al., 2017, p. 425). Therefore, proper automation of data collection methods on the basis of accuracy and integrity can greatly improve the overall knowledge available to a manager. By being able to see a wider and clearer picture of a situation, a manager will be capable of making correct decisions.
