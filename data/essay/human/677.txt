The spirit bear, also known as aka Kermode bear, is a unique creature that resides in British Columbia. According to Groc (2020), this is the unique species of all bears not only because of its ice-cream-colored fur but also because of its location and rareness. A single bear can weigh up to 200; knowing that bears generally possess from 80 to 600 kilograms, a maximum of two hundred seems to be low (Service, 2017). The Kermode bear is the American black bear’s subspecies, but what makes this animal so unusual is its recessive gene that colors the bears’ fur white or creamy (National Geographic, 2017).
The rareness of this species attracts additional interest in these bears – only 400 spirit bears currently live in British Columbia (Groc, 2020). According to National Geographic (2017), their population locates in the Great Brain Rainforest, which represents a 6.4-million-hectare temperate rainforest and is a great environment for this species of animals. In addition, this living area provides spirit bears with appropriate sustenance, such as salmon and a variety of berries, insects, plants, fruits, and nuts (Service, 2017). Although the animal is massive, huge, and sometimes considered dangerous, it is shy and mysterious in nature; therefore, if not disturbed, the representative of this species poses no threat (Service, 2017). However, the animal is considered dangerous only by tourists; according to Service (2017), indigenous populations see the spirit bear as sacred or holy mainly because of its unusual creamy color. Based on the described characteristics, it can be concluded that spirit bears are some of the most unique and rare species on the planet; hence, they need to be protected and their environment preserved.
