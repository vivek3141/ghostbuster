The modern world economy is so diverse and deep that it is very difficult to predict for sure when a crisis will break. Recession is danger, and danger is stress – in such a situation, the brain begins to rely on basic instincts of protection – to run, hide, survive. Crisis intervention is a relatively new discipline, the main task of which is to provide temporary emergency emotional assistance to victims of mental and physical violence (Colford & Cavaiola, 2017). Nowadays, there is a risk of economic decline which can seriously affect the entire population; hence, I would not like to experience recession since it would significantly affect my life.
The crisis is a phenomenon that takes a toll primarily on the individuals who work for non-profit organizations. There is an increase in layoffs, which means many people will have live on the state allowance. The inability to find a job is the next cause of the crisis. What is more, the level of poverty will raise making people abandon their homes. Individuals will not be able to afford necessary items as well as paying rent. Hence, I consider a recession as an undesirable event for myself due to its damaging nature.
When considering the crisis from a professional point of view, the crisis affects the national economy as a whole, affecting not individual enterprises, but the entire sector of the economy. There is an increase in the cost of credit resources and the difficulty of attracting them. In addition, there is a threat of deterioration of relations with international partner organizations. In general, the crisis is an undesirable phenomenon due to its devastating effects and unpredictable consequences.
