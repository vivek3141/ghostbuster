Executive Summary
Bottega Veneta is a worldwide famous brand, but its performance might need a boost owing to the company’s recent growth needs. Bottega’s options include product diversification and the production of a new line of items. The company’s brand must be reinvented by emphasizing the significance of quality in daily things and minimizing the level of luxury associated with its products. Bottega will be capable to establish a novel production line by developing the brand impression in a way that relates it to the firm’s principal identity.
Introduction
Transitioning from a premium company to one that sells things for daily usage is practically impossible. Bottega Veneta, on the other hand, will identify whether all aspects of the corporate communications process are in harmony (Weingerl and Javoršek, 2018). Assuring customers that their daily routines are comfortable while adding a touch of luxury, Bottega will be able to develop an entirely new and extraordinarily profitable brand.
Audit of the Brand
Pen Portrait and Analysis of Competitors
Bottega Veneta brands are primarily focused on attracting feminine as well as macho women, as seen by the photographs. The women here are smart and stylish, live in the contemporary world, are self-assured, and sophisticated. Given that Bottega’s women’s fashion trends are mostly irrelevant, the photographs depict ladies who have their own perspective and discern what is best and more importantly, what garments fit them best. Indeed, these women appreciate comfort above everything else and are willing to spend their money on high-end Bottega brand items. Bottega’s consumers prioritize comfort above innovation, but not rejecting the latter. Additionally, the target population is likely to live in the fast lane because of their proclivity for digital technologies.

Analysis of Digital Competitors (POPs and PODs)
PODs will include user comfort, since Gucci, Burberry, and Loewe all market luxury in a similar manner as Bottega, but do not focus on daily things and their use (Achim, 2019). In other words, the items are distinguished by superior materials and timeless designs, which sets them apart from the competitors. Bottega’s majority of items are premium priced because to their exquisite brands and high-quality textiles (Zhang and Zhao, 2019). High quality and efficacy are the primary POPs, which Bottega will need to thoroughly examine to guarantee that the standards established satisfy those used by other firms in the industry.
Brand Inventory
Heritage and History of the Brand
Since 1966, Bottega Veneta has been recognized as a luxury goods and designer clothing company. The firm, based in Italy, has amassed considerable influence in the premium design sector. By concentrating on establishing the brand that will serve as the foundation for a fresh and distinctive brand identity, one may successfully capture the luxury daily items market.
Brand DNA
The brand DNA will enable the business to portray itself as innovative while concentrating on quality and consumer comfort. As a result, the DNA will be designed with the goal of fostering a pleasant existence. The brand’s objective will be to ease everyday routines while also adding excitement and satisfaction. Integrity, customer attention, accountability, and excellent quality will serve as the cornerstone for the brand DNA’s growth (see Fig. 2). The proposed technique, based on the Onion Model, will aid in tracing the transition from the existing brand to the one set to emerge.
Brand Personality
To explain the personality of the brand that will be developed, the Aaker Model will be required. By using Aaker’s five personality characteristics, one may determine that the brand to be established is truthful, highly competent, and fairly sophisticated (Kakitek, 2018). Additionally, the presence of luxurious components may provide a touch of excitement. The harshness of the items will be kept to a minimum in order to preserve their sophistication (see Fig. 3).

Brand Identification
The brand’s identity will be developed utilizing Kapferer’s method. As seen in Figure 4, it is critical to establish an intercultural relationship between the sender and receiver (Cuofano, n.d.). In the instance of Bottega, a feedback system will be used to build a relationship between the consumer and the firm. The data collected via surveys and questionnaires will be used to include culturally relevant components into brand goods and to adjust them to the unique demands of individual customers.

Equity in a brand
To boost Bottega’s brand equity, especially with its new range of items, one must examine Keller’s Brand Equity Model (see Fig. 5). According to the approach, brand identity should be built around how consumers and the business interact; beginning with the organization’s basic values and the viewpoint, it brings to company-customer communication. Thus, Bottega’s new range of goods’ brand equity should be organized on the use of high quality, inventive design to infuse moments of luxury into their customers’ daily lives.

Architecture of the Brand
Bottega’s contemporary architecture may be regarded as a branded home, in whom all goods are housed under the Bottega primary brand. However, when a new brand is created that incorporates daily; the need to rethink the present branding strategy may arise. In order to reach their target audience, the firm will need to develop a house of brands.
Brand Leveraging
Bottega will heavily on the strength of its present brand in the early phases of advertising its new items. As a result, the new brand must contain features of the existing one, including the title and potentially the typeface. However, the company’s corporate philosophy, which values individualism and confidence, may be included into the design of the innovative product. Because of their high quality and end outcome, Bottega will strive to promote their emerging brand as dependable.
Brand Positioning
While the current Bottega brand in the desired corporate environment is largely rooted in luxury, the successor one must be grounded on practicality and presented as useful in everyday life. Luxury elements, such as unique architecture and materials used in the new products, will be offered as bonus items, helping to raise brand recognition (Brunetti, Confente, and Kaufmann, 2019). Like Bottega Veneta, the new brand should focus on artisanship and everyday convenience, if not luxury.
Strategy for Branding
AIDA. To generate public attention in the brand, the AIDA model will be required (Prathapan, et al., 2018). Bottega will seek to enlighten the community about its new venture, generate curiosity in the new everyday product brand, and encourage target shoppers to acquire them. Advertising and a webpage will be created, where advertisements will emphasize luxury and comfort to entice buyers with the help of a customer loyalty program to encourage the exercise.
RACE . Additionally, the RACE (Reach, Act, Convert, Engage) Model must be used to advertise the items and pique the audience’s interest. To be more precise, a new communication channel comprised of ICT and contemporary media will be developed in order to reach out to consumers. To promote action (“Act”), the website will have interactive components that allow buyers to tailor their experience. The conversion process will begin after Bottega has amassed a following of committed fans via discounts, gift certificates, and similar methods. Finally, the engagement step will include listening to customer input and tailoring items to their specific requirements.
Licensing/IP
Bottega will retain ownership of the intellectual property and goods, since the new brand will be released under its name. Thus, Bottega will be given intellectual property rights not for the items themselves, but for the idea underlying them, namely the incorporation of comfort and a touch of elegance into everyday routines. Due to the incorporation of the company’s present logo into the mark to be produced for the aforementioned items; it will be important to acknowledge Bottega’s property rights as the owner of the aforementioned intellectual property.
Elements of a Brand
Bottega’s current brand identity is composed of various themes, incorporating opulence and beautiful austerity. To sum up what luxury is and how it can be expressed via accessories and garments, Bottega Veneta’s slogan is “When your initials are sufficient.” (‘Bottega Veneta’ 2019). The logo, printing, symbols, packaging, and colors are all presented as brand aspects.
Logotype for Brand Identity
The present brand identification logo is fairly simple and, as a result, one-of-a-kind. As a consequence, the enterprise’s redesigned trade logo must be beautiful and stylized. The logo must keep the shape of the company’s letters printed in a sans serif typeface for this reason. The defined method will emphasize the company’s integrity while maintaining a strong commitment to its principles and philosophy.
Color of the Logo
Customers will immediately distinguish Bottega’s items due to the usage of color-coding. It will be prudent to utilize colors that enable instant differentiation of items; hence, a brand’s category will be distinguished by divergent colors like red, blue, yellow, green, or any other shade that helps the product stand out.
Icons and Photographs
To be immediately distinct from the logo, the brand icons will need to be far less detailed than the logo. However, simplifying the current brand is more challenging given that it is reflected by the company’s name. Although the purposeful choice of sans serif fonts simplifies the effort, there are still significant barriers to overcome. To do this, the logo must be reduced to the first two letters (BV) in a classic sans serif typeface and the allotted color.
Packaging
Packaging shall be biodegradable, recyclable, reusable, non-toxic, and skin – friendly. Bottega must position itself as an eco-friendly company, which includes sensitive packaging. Each produced item will be delivered in three, six, or twelve-packs to conserve resources.

The New Brand Strategy’s Five Objectives
To Increase Brand Awareness
This increases market share and establishes Bottega as an industry leader.
To enlarge our social communities

To convert social media followers into qualified leads and new business
Brand content generates social media followers and dialogues that result in new clients. The amount of leads generated through social media platforms is a key performance indicator in this case.
Recommendations
To acclimatize Bottega to the internet age, social media should be utilized to market new products to clients. Additionally, an application must be built to assist prospective purchasers in navigating the corporation’s manufacturing process more effectively (Dwivedi et al., 2021). The investigation revealed that Bottega’s internet ads and visibility are still lacking, despite the fact that the digital revolution has taken over. To remain current and preserve its leadership position, the business should use other social media channels in conjunction with its website possibilities.
Customer Engagement in the Digital Age
Bottega’s digital consumer profile is highly sophisticated. Now, it includes a regard for workmanship, brand loyalty, and customization choices. The emphasis on personalization is anticipated to rise in the digital environment (Shukla and Nigam, 2018). As a result, the potential to enjoy items designed exclusively for them must be leveraged to entice consumers. The corporation will need to explore many variations of each item, such as tote bags and umbrellas with distinctive designs.
