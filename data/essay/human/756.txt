Leaders choose an appropriate organizational structure depending on various factors characterizing a company. However, the most prominent ones include the environment in which the company operates, its size, the technologies available to it, business strategy, as well as the stage in the organizational life cycle. Thus, Bombas has implemented a unique employee-oriented structure and culture because the company is relatively young and focused on innovation as a core of its strategy. The company has taken the route of giving back as an essential principle of its culture and mission, engaging in charity work and encouraging employees to be proactive in helping and supporting needy people. Through fostering a welcoming environment, a “Hive” in which workers feel safe and confident to be creative and innovative, Bombas has enabled high levels of performance and satisfaction among employees. Thus, a favorable and person-oriented organizational structure and culture provide benefits to the ways in which employees behave.
Bombas has shown to be highly results-driven, and the ways in which the goals are met are often experimental and boundary-pushing, which has shown to bring significant success to the performance of the team. Intrinsically, workers at Bombas are motivated to do well because their accomplishments allow them to develop as professionals and become valuable team players (Fischer, Malycha, & Schafmann, 2019). For instance, the “Surprise and Delight” program is instrumental for making employees feel that they help others, making them feel better internally. The extrinsic motivation of Bombas employees is illustrated by the array of benefits they receive, such as total health coverage, company-sponsored professional development programs, unlimited time off, or a flexible working-from-home policy.
