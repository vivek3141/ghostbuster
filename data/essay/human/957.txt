“Above all it is thus that we can acquire the virtue of humility, and that is by far more precious treasure than all academic progress. From this point of view, it is perhaps even more useful to contemplate our stupidity than our sin.” These words of wisdom imply that the success of learning is not to elevate a person’s ego, but rather teach them humility through enhancing their understanding of the world. This appears to be the ultimate outcome of thorough academic engagement that reflects a person’s ability to acquire a certain degree of critical thinking and reflexivity. I am inclined to agree with the main idea expressed by the quotation. In my opinion, humility is a virtue that helps an individual become motivated and complete. Through this key quality, one can understand how their grow further in terms of personality. A humble individual will never overestimate their own skills and performance, meaning that they will remain in a constant pursuit of improvement. Furthermore, humility is a virtue that directly counteracts pride as the deadliest of sins. By exercising humility, a person acts by God’s design.
When it comes to this quality, it is often opposed to success in both academics and career. More specifically, one may assume that humility negates confidence, preventing an individual from fulfilling their potential. For example, promising opportunities may be declined by a humble person simply because they do not consider themselves fit for this position. As far I am concerned, this point of view does not reflect the truth. Humility and success are not notion that are mutually exclusive. One the contrary, they complement each other, creating a strong unity, in which humility enables success and does not impede it in any way. In other words, this virtue should be opposed not to confidence but to arrogance. Humility creates room for self-analysis and critical thinking, keeping an individual engaged in the enhancement of their skills. It enables a realistic understanding of the strengths, as well as the points of growth, which ultimately contributes to the natural development of the academic success and career.
In James 4:6, it is said: “But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says: “God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.” This message reflects the aforementioned vision of humility as the primary tool against the pride. The latter feeling is detrimental, it poisons the soul and pushes a person toward rash, unreasonable decisions. A proud person is often disrespectful of others, showing no love or compassion because of their clouded judgment. This characteristic does not align with an image of a successful and educated person that is evoked by Weil. An individual who truly excels in academics, learning the subject in all its depth and complexity will be humble and methodical in their development. This way, they truly fulfill their purpose as the conduits of God’s will favored by the Lord.
