The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) is created to address the issue of food safety that concerns many American residents – consumers and manufacturers. My colleague’s work represents the position that FSMA is not coping with its ability to make food safer. The peer discusses the content of the law, the danger of foodborne illness, food pollution, and presents arguments supporting the position on the inefficiency of FSMA. The work focuses significantly on the fact that there is no evidence that the provisions of the law can make food healthier even though it was adopted.
I do not believe that FSMA is ineffective, and although the law has several shortcomings, I do not support a colleague’s position. The influence of the law is already confirmed by the fact that it strengthens the responsibility of manufacturers for the quality of products. The proof of FSMA’s effectiveness is that thanks to it, manufacturers, packers, and importers are taking specific steps for the safety of the population (Yiannas, 2021). Moreover, drawing attention to the issue of food safety through FSMA is also important and influential for future improvements. Thus, it is possible to find evidence of the effectiveness of the law under consideration.
Having considered the positions of the opposite sides of the debate, I am inclined to argue about the positive impact of FSMA on food quality and public health. Food can be contaminated at various stages of the supply chain. FSMA focuses on the initial point – manufacturers and sets specific requirements for them. Although the danger is still present at other locations, the law is an essential step for future security. It drew attention to the problem, and in the future, society should expect other measures to improve food safety.
