The book, “Coaching habit: Say less, ask more & change the way you lead forever”, is by Stanier M. Bungay. The publication was released in 2016 through Box of Crayons Press. The author and publishers claim that they give “managers practical tools so they can coach in ten minutes or less” (Bungay, 2016, p. 1). One major argument that comes up is that silence does not mean lack of knowledge or disrespect. This element has been stresses in some chapters of the book due to the fact that a significant majority of managers often associate silence to some level of disrespect. According to the scholar, many times, silence might also suggest a critical and keen thought process. Notably, the scholar explains that proper coaching would help managers and leaders realize such situations and help in the growth of both the junior staff and his or her supervisor.
It can be argued that the author holds a general assumption that coaching only involves the manager. This is due to the fact that significant amount of advice given is directed to the supervisors. The role of the junior staff should also have been explored due to the nature of coaching. He explains that several elements, referred to as question masterclasses are critical for good coaching. The first question, also called the kick start question is critical. The author explains that it is a question “in which you discover the power of an opening question that gets the conversation happening fast and deep” (Bungay, 2016, p. 36). It can be argued that listening is a key element of any type of coaching. This can be linked to various studies that have been done on the same topic. Bungay (2016) uses this as his conclusion and it can be debated that it sums up the topic well.
