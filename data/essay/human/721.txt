A tort refers to omission or act that gives rise to harm/injury to another person and amounts to a wrong where a person who was wronged may recover damages (US Legal Inc., n.d.). In this case, the tort that Tom incurred was being hit by a baseball that knocked him out. He was then taken to the hospital as a result of the hit. Another tort was the fact that he lost his possessions when another fan stole his mobile phone and wallet. Finally, the last tort is food poising, but only if Tom can prove that it is because of the food poisoning that he had to stay home for two weeks without working.
For the first injury the stadium is liable because we are not told that they have a disclaimer on the tickets that relieve the management from such injuries caused by flying balls (All Law, 2015). Secondly, the theft of his handset and wallet cannot be associated with the stadium, therefore, the stadium is not reliable for the theft of his property, and the person that stole is responsible. Lastly, if Tom can prove that he stayed home for two weeks because of food poisoning, then, the stadium is liable. However, in the case of the concussion liability will not be on the stadium.
Finally, with respect to Tomâ€™s case with food poisoning, it does not matter if he bought a ticket or not. By him buying a beer and a hot dog directly from the seller, he legitimately bought it from the stadium and the purchase was isolated from the ticket. However, any other thing that happens such as an accident or sickness as a result of purchases should be legally valid and the stadium still responsible.
