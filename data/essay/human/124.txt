In his writing, Daniel Spanjer claims that the Christian worldview has influenced the study of Liberal Arts. He discusses science and how humans are the products of the world – they are endowed with feeling and thought, which are beyond natural (Spanjer 3). The author differentiates the reasons for learning everything surrounding people and claims that thinkers can answer many questions, either logical or surreal. These people have developed a term worldview “to describe this holistic concept of learning, scholarship, experience and knowledge” (Spanjer 15). Even though sometimes they cannot agree on the solution to the problems, time helps them dissipate false beliefs.
The other reading by Brad Green suggests the interconnection of words and faith. In the chapter. When transcendent realities and goals surround a language, it is magnificent, but when transcendence is taken away from it, it falls apart and loses its glory (Green). The word was sent by God to save humanity; He portrayed people through the words (Green). Hence, humans should follow God’s guidelines in the Bible because His sayings are truthful. In case the words are devoid of meaning, the speech is useless.
The last reading by Dockery narrates about the Christian faith’s influence on learning. People are encouraged to think in Christian categories in order to sanctify thoughts and beliefs (Dockery 4). It is vital to seek God’s guidance and His calls that help humans contribute to the societal good (Dockery 8). Thoughtful believers are needed to revive faith-centered higher educational institutions because only such people will be able to promote gracious deeds. Hence, Christian worldview is again viewed as foundation of successful education and learning.
