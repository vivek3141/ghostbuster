A society, or human society, is a group of individuals linked by long-term relationships or a large society that shares the same geographical or social territory and is often dominated by the same political authority and cultural norms. Human society is defined by the pattern of relationships (social relationships) between individuals who share a common culture or institution (Lazer et al., 2021). Members of the society can be considered the sum of these relationships.
In the social sciences, subgroup stratification or dominance patterns are often observed in larger societies. Society can enable its members to benefit in unthinkable ways without personal cooperation. Therefore, personal and social outcomes can be identified or duplicated in many situations (Lazer et al., 2021). Within a dominant and larger society, societies can also be composed of like-minded people dominated by their own customs and values. This is sometimes referred to as a subculture, a term widely used in criminology.
Society can also be thought of as an economic, social, or industrial infrastructure made up of diverse groups of people. Members of the society can come from several ethnic groups. Society can be a specific ethnic group like the Saxons, a nation-state like Bhutan, or a broader cultural community like Western culture. An association is a voluntary group of people organized for religious, philanthropic, cultural, scientific, political, patriotic, or other purposes.
I have walked to Miami beach and started to observe the environment around me in order to see the society. I saw people doing morning jogging, families having time together, and many different people who were walking to work. All of these people were of various ethnicities, genders, and probably with many other individual characteristics. Despite that, all of them are living in the same geographical area and are bound by certain social relationships. That is what made me recognize and explore the society around me.
