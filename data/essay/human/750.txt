Love is not simply a feeling but a complex physiological process that occurs in the human body and involves different mechanisms. The chapter “Biochemistry of love” by Carter & Porges provides an insight into the biological basis of love and relationship. The key concepts explored in the chapter include the role of oxytocin and vasopressin in the creation of emotional bonds.
Social behavior is part of the process of evolution, and it can be found among the most primitive species. At the same time, the social behaviors of humans are more diverse, and love is only one of the possible forms. Nevertheless, the feeling of love experienced by people still begins in the core part of the human brain, which encounters certain sensations transmitted by the vagus nerve. On the biochemical level, neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin play major roles. For instance, oxytocin is a hormone responsible for strengthening a lasting bond between a mother and her child (Carter & Porges, 2022). Still, other adults also can experience an increase in oxytocin when they see a newborn, and this situation can contribute to their desire to engage in caretaking. Moreover, oxytocin facilitates eye contact and social cognition, which are essential elements of love.
Research shows that oxytocin is not the only hormone contributing to a loving relationship since it usually works together with vasopressin. The latter is a neuropeptide that coordinates aggression and protective conduct; therefore, by working with oxytocin, they create a balance. For instance, oxytocin, which can decrease stress, helps children to undergo distress related to the separation from their mothers, thus supporting their health.
The other two notable concepts described in the chapter are the impact of love on the child’s development and the differences related to early-life experiences. Males are particularly sensitive to early traumatic experiences, which can lead to higher levels of vasopressin in the body which can make them more aggressive. Essentially, negative experiences, including the absence of love, can undermine the health of people on the level of genes. Moreover, men generally often tend to experience higher levels of vasopressin in situations involving a threat.
At the same time, oxytocin exposure during early life stages promotes the ability of a person to love others and form social bonds. Additionally, social engagement is crucial for maintaining oxytocin on an appropriate level since isolation leads to an increase in vasopressin. Finally, the stress-reducing capacity of oxytocin enables it to control people’s health, for instance, by facilitating tissue repair. Recent studies also highlight the fact that oxytocin also can increase the resilience of people to traumatic events (Sharma et al., 2020). After reading the chapter, I now understand the basic mechanisms involved in social bonding on the hormonal level. I believe it is essential that people continue studying the effects of oxytocin and vasopressin on the human body. Specifically, additional research on the impact of hormones on mental health would be beneficial for the creation of new medication for people subject to traumatic experiences.
Carter & Porges, in the chapter “Biochemistry of love,” demonstrate how human interactions and love are intertwined with the oxytocin and vasopressin hormones. The former actively participates in the creation of social bonds and reduces the impact of stress, and contributes to the ability of people to experience love. The latter is responsible for protective aggression and is higher among men, which causes them to be more likely to be traumatized and have disruptions on the genetic level.
