Primarily, one should note that the country that I chose to perform the assignment is France. Undoubtedly, there are many consulates of France in the United States. However, to take the remains to the “homeland,” it is required to contact a special consulate general located in California, Los Angeles. In this context, a “mourner” should arrange a meeting in the office with a specialist two days in advance to discuss all the details and points regarding the dispatch of human remains and sealing an urn ( Shipment of cremated remains , 2019). Thus, the Consulate General of France in Los Angeles is one of the most relevant places to ask for help to remove “remnants.”
Accordingly, I have to provide the following merchandise to the family in the future. First of all, it is necessary to prepare a package of particular documents. For instance, they include a death certificate of a loved one in the US, a medical report, and a certificate of cremation and sealing. Moreover, an attestation of the absence of extraneous attachments and closed sealing of the urn, a certificate of the lack of infectious diseases from the deceased, and a permit to import remains will be required. It is also essential to have a person’s permission to request repatriation and a certified French translation of the death and cremation certificate. Secondly, this family needs an urn with the ashes of the dead, located in a special airtight container.
Moreover, there are not too complicated requirements regarding the transportation of the urn in France. A person must apply directly to the French consulate in the US and prepare a package of documents set out above. There are several airlines engaged in the transportation of ashes, one of the most reliable and well-known is Air France-KLM. In most cases, the tame frames are based on an agreement between funeral companies in America and the destination country.
The consulate member I have had to communicate with is Julie Duhaut-Bedos. In addition, the flight booking service would be accompanied by the consulate’s help. Depending on the distance, it is necessary to book a direct flight or with a transfer. Furthermore, each airline offers individual conditions for the transportation of special cargo. The urn with the ashes of a loved one would be carefully sealed and placed in a special lockable box with dense walls. Transporting the loved one by plane is possible only in the luggage compartment.
