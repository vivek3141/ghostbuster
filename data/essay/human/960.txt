It should be noted that climate change is one of the most important challenges of modernity, and properly addressing the problem is of paramount relevance for the future of humanity’s development and civilization. NASA’s interactive time machine clearly shows how the Arctic sea has shrunk since 1979 by a significant margin, whereas CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased drastically in less than two last decades (“Carbon dioxide”). In other words, major indicators of climate change are all pointing towards the fact that some measures need to be taken in order to stop further catastrophes ahead. Similar observations can be made in regard to temperature, which also shows significant heating of the planet. In addition, a simulation of sea-level increase by six meters, major cities, such as Miami and New Orleans, can go completely underwater.
One of the most dangerous and immediate dangers of such a quick climate change is food production. It is stated that “the soil microbiome governs biogeochemical cycling of macronutrients, micronutrients and other elements vital for the growth of plants and animal life” (Jansson and Hofmockel 35). In other words, the microbiome of soil is a key determining factor for food production since both animal and plant lives depend on it. However, drastic changes in the climate not only hinder the growth of crops through increased rates of natural disasters and droughts but also soil depletion and scarcity of essential nutrients. Therefore, it is a highly probable possibility that the most significant threat of climate change is global hunger and famine. With an ever-increasing world population, demand for food is growing as well, which means that food shortage might become the most impactful effect of climate change.
