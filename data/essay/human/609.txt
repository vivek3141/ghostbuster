The global firm is PwC India, a company located in India. The company focuses on vital areas, including the government and public sector, digital services, and technology consulting. PwC India is on its optimization level as per the global project management maturity model (Naim et al., 2021). Such is attributed to its maturity stage, which is also considered the highest regarding capability maturity model integration. By implementing a global project management framework, PwC India has benefited highly from a series of events. Firstly, the firm has evolved and continues to improve its operational processes radically. Secondly, the implementation has resulted in a noticeable improvement in the innovation sector. According to Naim, Alahmari & Rahim (2021), innovation has resulted in key development, which has contributed greatly to the performance. Finally, the framework has enhanced the building of people’s capabilities, which have instituted effective delivery of high-quality complex information and technology programs on a timely basis—actions that have improved Indians returns on IT investments.
Being on the final and topmost level of global project management, I would recommend PwC India firm actively engage its staff on managerial aspects. The move will aim to maximize the relatable instance that could jeopardize the operations and operation systems (Naim et al., 2021). Furthermore, since the firm is in its last stage, absolute improvement and consistent observation will be instrumental in retaining the company for the next 2-5years.
