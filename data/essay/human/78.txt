The concept of nursing is closely associated with the idea of continuous improvement, as the trends of health care need to mirror the existing social trends to provide the best care possible. One way to secure such care is to refer to the latest scholarly findings to modify the approaches to care provision in the workplace. This process of implementing research-based findings in daily patient care is known as evidence-based practice (EBP) (Wilson & Austria, 2021). Currently, EBP is not used actively by nurses for several reasons.
First, the workload of most nurses discourages their desire to learn and embrace EBP. According to McArthur et al. (2021), a physical opportunity is a construct that contributes to the nurses’ ability to resort to EBM. Physical opportunity includes such barriers as “cost and lack of resources, compromised communication, staff turnover, and limited physical guidelines” (McArthur et al., 2021, p. 20). As a result, management promotes behavioral patterns that react to the environment rather than examine it in advance. The second massive barrier to EBP in the workplace is the lack of social opportunity embodied in the lack of organizational support and teamwork (McArthur et al., 2021). Since the aforementioned examples tackle only a minor part of the existing challenged, the need to intervene and facilitate EBP is evident.
The first commonly mentioned approach to facilitate the use of EBP is to establish a leadership that would encourage the practice by both setting an example and conducting training and workshops. Another crucial facilitator is to secure nurses’ access to relevant sources in the workplace, including relevant databases, steady Internet connection, and subscription to peer-reviewed publications. In such a way, the use of scholarly research will become more time-efficient and less stressful for nurses.
