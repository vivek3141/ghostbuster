Performance is not just the production of musical sounds, but the interaction of the musician and the audience through all channels, including visual ones. It is not for nothing that at the concert the musician is on a dais in front of everyone. At the concert, not only the musician’s ability to produce musical sounds is tested, but also the musicians’ ability to carry out complex action between them and the audience.
The way musicians dress for a concert speaks volumes about their attitude towards the audience. Listeners express respect for the musician by keeping their attention and silence while the music is playing, and after that, they applaud or thank them with words. Musicians express respect for the listener by diligently and faithfully performing music and create a sense of the exclusivity of the event at the concert with their appearance and stage style.
The musician’s wardrobe also influences the perception of performance, and it is important for performers not only of popular music, but also of classical music. Although, according to Epstein, instrumental music is an art form that is completely dedicated to what hear, the appearance of the musician is extremely significant. Thus, those who play in a symphony orchestra always observe a strict dress code. Appearance for performance is an important detail that requires special attention and approach. An artist’s concert attire should not only be elegant and appropriate for the performance situation, but it should also be comfortable that nothing distracts from the performance. However, among classical music performers, there are also lovers of informal appearance, for example, violinist Vanessa Mae and cellist Nigel Kennedy. Different listeners perceive the original appearance of a musician differently: some see it as nothing more than a commercial trick, others see it as a desire for innovation.
