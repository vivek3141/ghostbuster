An aboriginal person is an individual characterized as a descendant of indigenous inhabitants of Australia. Before the arrival of Europeans, the indigenous people of Australia occupied most of the land, which they protected and fertilized to support cultivation. The aboriginal people mainly practiced hunting and gathering as their source of livelihood before adopting agricultural practices. The aboriginal people arrived in Australia from Asia via Southeast Asia and have inhabited the land between 45000 and 50000 years ago. After the arrival of European colonialists, the indigenous people faced many challenges such as economic, political, and disruption of their tradition. The aboriginal people lost their culture, land, and family without considering the extermination of European imperialism policies; they became enslaved by the Europeans. During the colonial period, the indigenous people faced a high rate of discrimination, resulting in displacement since the colonial powers occupied a large part of the fertile lands, resulting in many deaths of indigenous communities. For instance, over 200 languages the aboriginal people spoke lost value since the European colonialist did not recognize their culture. Many families were forced out of their land, thus dispersing to other parts of Australia.
The descendant of the aboriginal people should be recognized as one person since they share the bloodline, customs, and beliefs with their ancestors, who lived over 50000 years ago in the land. Besides sharing cultural norms, the descendants can be classified as one people because they have a similar palace of origin: the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, East Timor, Singapore, and Indonesia located in the Southeast of Asia. Therefore, they deserve equal rights like any other community, enabling them to protect their culture and heritage as one person.
