In the present competitive environment especially affected by the pandemic, the majority of automobile brands undertake all efforts to attract new clients and improve customer loyalty. Toyota is a company known worldwide for its continuous focus on exceeding consumers’ expectations through its product’s quality and sustainability. For instance, it is strongly committed to the achievement of zero CO2 emissions in the future, offering hybrid electric and nitrogen options. During the pandemic, it is attracting partners, dealers, and customers by emphasizing its adherence to careful infection prevention measures (Cenizo, 2020). In addition, Toyota pays particular attention to the quality of its customer support, ensuring that service center employees have all necessary problem-solving skills. The company offers an immediate and free examination of a vehicle in the case of its dysfunction. However, one of the most peculiar strategies of the brand that contribute to consumers’ delight is the MyToyota app (Toyota Sustainability Report, 2020). It provides multiple benefits for its clients, including exclusive offers, online service booking, and discounts for hotels or sporting tickets, therefore, influencing their perception of performance.
As a matter of fact, it is genuinely challenging to choose an automobile company that simply reflects positive satisfaction and is not flexible enough to work with negative feedback. However, according to the 24/7 Wall Street review, Volvo has 33% of customer loyalty (Suneson, 2019). A considerable number of Volvo drivers do not plan to purchase this brand’s products again, and auto reviewers suggest better options. However, the company does not implement any efficient strategy to improve consumer satisfaction and influence the opinion of experts. In general, not only the price and quality form customer loyalty, but the brand’s responsiveness to any complaints or suggestions contributes to people’s delight and brand awareness as well.
