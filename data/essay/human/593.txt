As the Mongols expanded their territory, not only did they become powerful, but they also left behind a trail of pain to those that resisted their rule. In the account of the Abbasid Empire and Section 7: The Rise of the Mongols, one trait associated with the Mongols is that in their approach and stopped at nothing to achieve power. For example, in the account of the Abbasid Empire, the Mongols used negotiations and instructions to compel the Muslims to submit to their rule.
However, when the Muslims neglected the call for military reinforcement against the Persians, Hulagu murdered the people in Baghdad and depopulated the city only to recover decades later. In their rise, Genghis Khan realized the Muslim states were powerful, like his grandson, Hulagu, who tried to negotiate with Afghanistan and Turkestan instead of hitting them head-on. However, on declining the request, Genghis Khan attacked the Turkestan, killing every living thing in his wake.
One contrast between the two reads us that in section 7 when Chinson Bayan invaded Southern China, Kublai Khan led the Mongols to allow the Southern China Empress to live pleasurably inside an opulent palace. When her husband, the Song Emperor, heard how they treated his wife, he returned to China only to be seized and beheaded. On the contrary, the invasion of the Abbasid Empire saw Hulagu lead his horse riders in singling outhouse of learning for destruction. The people were massacred by the bushel, Abbasid Caliph included. Contrary to Genghis Khan, who poured molten gold down the throat of the sultan, Hulagu ordered his men to roll the caliph up in a carpet and rode their horses over him.
