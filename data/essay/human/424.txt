Unfortunately, I have not been able to attend any event or concert with a cultural dance performance. However, I remember well the TV program, part of which was dedicated to New Zealandâ€™s indigenous peoples and their unique culture. The event was filmed in New Zealand and was called the traditional Poi dance; the date of the event is unknown to me, but I watched the program in December 2021. It was not the first time I saw cultural dance performances, but it was one of the most impressive.
Poi dance is performed by large groups of Maori men and women who perform synchronized dance moves. The movements are quite simple and include mainly stepping from one foot to the other and active movements of the arms and hands. Additionally, women often spin around their axis and also walk one after another in lines. Specific actions also include interaction with special balls, bars, and sticks by each woman as additional objects, as well as singing. The theme of this dance is the traditional culture of the Maori people, in particular the expression of joy and gratitude.
The most important movement theme in this dance is the interaction with various objects such as balls, bars, and sticks. Each of the women starts the dance with small fluffy balls, then moves to short white bars, and then they are replaced by sticks. The rhythm is set throughout the dance by clapping and singing, and the interaction with these objects is the center of the action and determines the movement. For example, women actively moved by stepping from foot to foot and moving their arms with balls in their hands, while with bars, they mostly sat in a circle. Additionally, bars and sticks were used to set the rhythm when they were banged on the floor or against each other.
The cultural significance of this dance lies in the preservation and demonstration of the traditions of the Maori people. In particular, through such mass dances, they show the identity of their people and interact with each other. I think it was the collectivity and mass character that impressed me the most. When I watched this dance, I was surprised by how well a group of people consisting of 30-40 people dances, sings, and interacts with objects at the same time. I felt joy and surprise, along with a sense of respect for this fun and spectacular tradition.
The Maori used traditional costumes, makeup, and continuous rhythmic singing to enhance the movements of the dance. It is noteworthy that the music was performed exclusively by the singing of the dancers, which created an amazing effect of authenticity and immersion. In addition, all participants in the dance used extremely speaking facial expressions, which in particular could be used to understand the plot of the song and the dance as a whole. Thus, it was more like a performance of songs, dances, and the use of various objects that the Maori presented. In addition to the described dance before the start of the event itself, men and women in the same traditional costumes performed a traditional war dance, which consisted of shouting and clapping. Earlier, various rituals traditional for the local culture and having spiritual significance were held. The event was followed by a dinner with traditional Maori food. Mostly fish dishes and local fruits were provided, the names of which were not presented.
When I watched this performance, I was overwhelmed with awe and a sense of community. I wanted to repeat the movements and hum the tunes that the Maori sang. I do not think I have ever been so touched by dance before because the energy of this performance literally gave me goosebumps. This mass character and coherence of the dance amazed me, and the artistry of the performers made me immerse myself in the atmosphere of Maori culture. This experience was much more enjoyable for me than I expected because I have never been a fan of traditional dances. However, this dance is a real performance that captivates and amazes.
