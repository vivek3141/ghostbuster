Assessments of Curriculum
Assessment of curriculum is a natural and critical element of instruction, as it allows to evaluate the progress that has been in education. It can be defined as a method that is used to understand the current knowledge that a student possesses (Dikli, 2003). Assessment has always been a contentious issue due to various factors of objectivity, diversity of learning styles, and bureaucratic issues, among others. However, traditional assessments are generally tests and tools that are commonly utilized in academic settings. Some of the most popular tests are multiple-choice tests, true/false, short-answer, and sometimes even essays. These fall under what is commonly known as standardized testing, aimed at objectively test whether a student possesses knowledge of the curriculum. With the same or similar tests given to everyone in a population (classroom, grade, school), the traditional assessments of curriculum provide an insight at the broad effectiveness of instructional strategies. There are certain benefits to traditional assessments, they are easy to construct, implement, and score (often via machines), they are scored objectively providing an appearance of ‘fairness’ and they are most often associated with assessment in public perception (Dikli, 2003). This approach to evaluation is influenced by the scientific, modernist approach, with clearly stated objectives and precise indicators that students have achieved the intended objectives (Ornstein & Hunkins, 2018).
Alternative assessments are also known as performance tests or authentic assesmsnts. They are commonly aimed at determining what a student can do rather what they know, measuring proficiency rather than blunt knowledge, known as action strategies (Petre, 2017). Some examples of this can include projects, portfolios, and other methods that allow the student individually or as a group to demonstrate their skills, and most often their knowledge at the same time. The benefits of alternative assessments include being able to assess valuable skills, realistic and applicable skill application, can always be aligned with learning outcomes, and typically provide more individual approaches to assessing students (BYU Center for Teaching and Learning, n.d.). The humanistic, post-modernist approach is best applicable to alternative assessments, as these seek to identify whether the student has been enabled to understand and improve self-concepts. To this perception, achievements matter less, but rather the search for knowledge and truth, as the student gains the skills necessary to study the world, engage, analyze, and communicate (Ornstein & Hunkins, 2018).
Roles in Evaluation
In my setting, teachers play the role of educators who provide knowledge of the curriculum to the students, and then the facilitators of the evaluation tests (most often standardized) based on the program learning outcomes. Teachers generally have little to no input on what is encompassed in the main curriculum, and then, for the big tests, educator performance as professionals is virtually evaluated by the results of these tests. Therefore, to maintain good standing as educators and employees, many teachers are forced to resort to preparing students on taking the standardized test and memorizing facts rather than acquiring and applying the knowledge (Robelen, 2018). I would argue that teachers should be involved in all steps of the evaluation process from start to finish. It is specifically important for educators to create assessments that are most fitting for their subject, students, and age group, among other factors. By creating fitting assessments, educators can then test students comprehensively and determine holistically the weak and strong sides of their education strategies and what changes can be made for most effectiveness.
