Nursing associations are quite common in many countries in the world, facilitating nurse practitioners’ professional development. The American Association of Critical Care Nurses (AACN) is one such organization. The association was founded in 1969 as a response to nurses’ need to share knowledge and obtain more educational opportunities (American Association of Critical Care Nurses [AACN], n.d.). This paper includes a brief overview of the options the organization offers to its members.
Nurses find membership in nursing associations a valuable experience and a platform for further development. Notably, this progress involves each nurse’s professional development, as well as all members’ contributions to the evolvement of the nursing practice (Rowley et al., 2020). This engagement in the network of committed professionals can be specifically beneficial for nurses working at progressive care units in the neuro/cardio units. The practitioners operating in this area need to be advanced multitaskers who have to make myriads of complex decisions during their workdays. They also need to remain updated on novel techniques and practices, which can be difficult without communicating with other professionals. The ACCN is a valuable channel for such communication as well as education as the organization (like many other similar institutions) offers numerous programs for its members. Practitioners can also receive the necessary certification regarding their advanced credentials.
AACN is a nonprofit organization that serves as a platform for nurse practitioners’ growth and professional growth. The association’s mission is to provide nurses with the necessary ground for “expert knowledge and the influence to fulfill their promise to patients and their families” (AACN, n.d.). Excellence in practice is the primary value of the association, which shapes the opportunities it offers to its members. The AACN helps nurse practitioners to achieve excellence by providing education and certification support, networking, and recognition.
As for recognition, the association’s excellence programs aim at recognizing the professionals who advance nursing practice and research. Circle of Excellence award and Beacon award are illustrations of such effort (AACN, n.d.). Peers choose the most outstanding nominee, which shows the relevance and significance of these individuals’ work. Notably, only association members can be nominated for the circle of excellence award, while the Beacon award can be awarded to non-members (AACN, n.d.). This flexibility facilitates the exchange of ideas and practitioners’ willingness to self-develop and grows professionally. It is also important to note that this recognition also aims at advocating for nurses’ needs and popularizing nursing practice (Huang et al., 2020). Nurses must feel their input is valued, which translates into enhanced performance and job satisfaction.
As far as the networking opportunities of this association are concerned, the organization offers educational programs, certification options, research grants, as well as participation in various events and conferences. Nurses (especially new practitioners) benefit from membership in such organizations as they develop social links with other professionals. They meet different people committed to research and excellence in particular fields during conferences and diverse events. These ties are typically maintained for a prolonged period, enabling professionals to share their knowledge and experience, as well as concerns and ideas. Nursing associations are also instrumental in empowering nurses and helping them perform more advanced roles in the clinical setting (Villeneuve & Betker, 2020). Educational programs are equally valuable as practitioners learn about the specifics of their practice and ways other people use to cope with the challenges of the profession.
One of the valuable benefits of AACN membership is that the association keeps its members informed of the most recent changes in nursing, as well as diverse specialty fields. The AACN notifies its members in various ways, including direct emails and notifications, as well as press releases and diverse sources regarding the most meaningful events and advances. In addition, the association holds various conferences and other professional gatherings where the most recent advancements in all using areas are discussed. Nurses can share ideas and utilize the knowledge they gain in their practice and research.
As far as educational opportunities available from the AACN, the association offers a wealth of programs and projects facilitating nurses’ continuing education and professional growth. The organization provides online courses and webinars, as well as scholarships to its members. AACN members can also obtain a considerable amount of information from the most renowned nursing scholarly journals. Hence, one of the remarkable peculiarities of AACN membership is an opportunity to implement research and continue education in the sphere of interest. The AACN continuing education activities can be a valuable platform for professional development. AACN members can learn about and use other practitioners’ ideas to improve their practice.
In conclusion, it is necessary to note that the AACN is one of the most influential nursing associations that contributes to the advancement of nursing practice. AACN members have various opportunities to continue their formal or on-the-job training, develop social links and networks, as well as implement research. AACN recognition programs are instrumental in helping nurses feel motivated and committed to the highest standards of nursing practice.
