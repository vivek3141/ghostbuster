Out of the various forms of resistance used by slaves, the one which exacted the best revenge is armed and organized rebellion. The main reason is the fact that despite their failures in colonial America, the Haitian Revolution was a signal about slavery always being challenged. One of the most common forms of resistance was sabotage of production by breaking tools, feigning illnesses, and slowing the work process. However, these were mostly ineffective measures because they led to negotiations where masters benefited the highest. In addition to sabotage, theft was also a form of resistance, where slaves stole certain goods for their own personal use. It was done mainly due to poor living conditions, such as nutrition, among slaves, which is why food was the main target of theft. It should also be noted that theft was justified from the slaves’ perspective since they are their masters’ property, and thus, how can a property steal the same owner’s property?
Unlike the previously daily forms of resistance, the flight was an overt resistance. However, it was not effective because it led to harsher oversight and severe punishments. Escaping was a risky endeavor with rather low chances of success with no widespread impact. In addition, it was mostly men who had acceptable chances of successful flight. Therefore, the most effective form of resistance with the best revenge was armed rebellion, such as the Haitian Revolution. Although it was the only successful rebellion among many suppressed ones, the victory was not the main point. The key message was the fact that slavery will never be tolerated and it always is challenged by slaves, and the Haitian Revolution’s success was a reminder to masters that they will not be able to own slaves forever.
