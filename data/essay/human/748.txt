I think that I could become an ally of the LGBT population. This group requires assistance because heterosexual couples have unearned entitlements and conferred dominance (Edwards, 2006). In particular, heterosexual individuals did not do anything specific to earn this dominance, while representatives of sexual minorities are deprived of this privilege because of their sexual orientation. From my point of view, this state of affairs is not appropriate and should be addressed, meaning that I could act as an ally for social justice. Edwards (2006) stipulates that members of dominant groups are also hurt, denoting that the efforts to impede, amend, redefine, and dismantle the existing systems are necessary to address the situation. This information reveals that allying with the LGBT population can be productive for the group and me.
My ally-ship would establish a connection with the oppressed group and focus on providing such people with the required assistance. An appropriate and effective motto should be created to reveal my intent. It seems that the following statement is suitable: “Sexual orientation is not as significant as it seems.” These words denote that judging a person according to their sexual orientation is not reasonable.
A few essential obstacles can affect my ally-ship, and they include social opposition and the reluctance of the target population to change the situation. On the one hand, many conservative social groups and structures can argue against my allyship because homosexuality is not appropriate for them. Thus, it is necessary to address this fact by educating people. In particular, the focus can be placed on the fact that social oppression often results in adverse health consequences for LGBT individuals. On the other hand, the representatives of the selected population can be afraid of advocating for positive changes, meaning that specific counseling should be organized for them to make them engaged in the allyship.
