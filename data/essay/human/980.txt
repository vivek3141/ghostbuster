Over the past years, the idea behind the treatment process has shifted its focus towards the holistic approach to care that encompasses both primary care, treatment intervention, management, and post-discharge follow-up. Moreover, the number of specialists simultaneously involved in the treatment process has increased drastically. A prime example of such an innovative healthcare model is the introduction of the perioperative surgical home (PSH) system. The model itself is introduced by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ACA), and it stands for “patient-centric, team-based model of care created … to help meet the demands of a rapidly approaching health care paradigm that will emphasize value, patient satisfaction, and reduced costs” (Elhassan et al., 2019). Essentially, the model was outlined by the professional medical community as a means of reducing costs for operative interventions.
According to the American Hospital Association (2019), the PSH model accounts for the process of close reconsideration of the patient’s pre-operational assessment, surgery preparation, and post-operational follow-up of the patient. The interdisciplinary team of professionals involved in the model includes surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, preoperative staff, pharmacists, information technology specialists, laboratory staff, and social services (Elhassan et al., 2019). Such an extensive collaboration of professionals accounts for quality patient outcomes for a number of reasons. These benefits include better pain management, a significantly lower risk of readmission, and a shorter length of stay (Bergman, 2019). On the other hand, such a model is beneficial for the providers, as timely and efficient collaboration accounts for saving treatment costs, providing better care, and securing more hospital beds due to reduced length of patient stay. For this reason, it may be concluded that the introduction of PSH is a promising approach to the renovation of health care and presenting more quality services to the community.
