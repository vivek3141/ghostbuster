In the modern world, diverse communities exist that support families in situations of emergency or need. Such support should be granted as sometimes families cannot manage their problems alone. Many communities provide families with support in diverse areas such as foster care, early childhood care, education, and homeless services (Fuss et al., 2021). For example, during the pandemics of COVID-19 many families experienced financial problems due to the ubiquitous job loss. Many such families could not cover their medical costs or even afford to buy normal food. Several organizations help families by caring about their young children or teenagers, providing them with psychological and economic help (Liebenberg et al., 2020). In such situations, to heighten or support the living standard and living conditions, communities can help families by providing them with food, accommodation, financial help, or help them find jobs.
In addition, online communities can be supportive and useful for many families. For example, in situations of grief, people can support each other online or offline; however, grief support will need new approaches due to COVID-19 (Moore et al., 2020). Communities living in one district can help families with fires in their flats by sharing blankets, food, and water or by finding a place to live. Moreover, diverse populations or communities supporting families in their health issues are also valuable.
Although it may seem that such support does not make much difference, it is entirely wrong to look at the situation from such a perspective. Firstly, such communities support individuals or families in cases of emergency or necessity, and in this way, they can provide help to many people. By supporting families, such organizations help not only separate individuals or families, but they maintain an adequate level of life which helps the country on the governmental living by keeping economic showings on an appropriate level.
