Farcargo relies on its information system for a significant number of its operations. Thus, the structure of the company’s information system is a crucial element of consideration. Farcargo uses a dynamic infrastructure for its operations so that it is in a position to address the growing demand of its clients. The company prefers to use a dynamic infrastructure for its ability to be highly responsive to the end-users and to meet its needs to use cloud computing to enhance speed and agility. This infrastructure ensures it delivers essential services such as the provision of traffic information and tracking of its assets with ease (Beynon-Davies, 2019). Farcargo’s information system is comprised of hardware, software, networking, and storage components in its infrastructure.
Farcargo ensures that it uses updated hardware components to avoid inconveniences such as malfunctioning devices or system freezes. The company uses hardware components which include computer machinery and equipment, in its offices and headquarters, where the employees monitor the progress of the operation. The computer machinery uses a power supply, memory, cabling, and circuit boards for proper functioning. Moreover, computers use peripheral devices such as mice, keyboards, speakers, printers, and cameras to enable the input and output of information in the system. These offices also have switches, routers, servers, and data centers which enhances their operations. In the company’s vehicles, the company uses cameras and microphones to ensure easy communication with the staff. Finally, our clients are required to use their personal computers, mobile phones, or tablets to access the company’s information system.
The company’s software consists of the application and operating system. Farcargo uses the Linux operating system to manage its system resources. The info system also has a strong storage system backed up by cloud storage. Cloud storage enables companies to respond to changes in hardware, software, or other resources confidently (Beynon-Davies, 2019). The software also consists of web servers and systems to manage content.
Farcargo’s information system should have a simple interface where clients with minimal information technology expertise can operate. The company also emphasizes on speed and agility of the system to serve its high number of clients. The information system is designed to be highly confidential and utilizes quality system security systems for its protection. Other design considerations include reliability, accessibility, and flexibility. Having based most of its operations on the online platform, Farcargo considers the highest quality information system infrastructure for effective operations.
