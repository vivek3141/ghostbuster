There are many different species of marine microbes that exist in the water in massive amounts. Among the Nitrite oxidizing bacteria, there are six main types: Nitrotoga, Nitrospira, Nitrolancetus, Nitrospina, Nitrobacter, and Nitrococcus (Han 2). One of the fascinating species of bacteria is Nitrobacter which plays a crucial role in the nutrition of plants. Since this is a nitrifying bacterium, it serves as a simple way to release nitrogen that comes out of plants. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze the essence of the Nitrobacter, its specific characteristics its position in the ecosystem.
Nitrobacter is the most interesting among the other species because it participates in converting nitrite to nitrates. Nitrification happens due to the receiving of nitrates from ammonia by oxidation, and the process goes with the help of the pair of bacteria, which are Nitrobacter and Nitrosomonas (Han 3). First of all, it is crucial to mention the concept of nitrification and the operations that are included there in order. Since the process is happening in the soil, it is a remarkable biological phenomenon that may also influence the other factors connected with nature. The nitrogen cycle is a significant part of the biological processes, and bacteria that exist in the soil take part in the majority of chemical phases that produce atmospheric nitrogen into the new condition.
Overall, Nitrobacter is an integral part of maintaining the diversity of the microorganism in the soil that is provided by its oxidation activity. It plays a critical role in the plantsâ€™ nutrition and, as a nitrifying bacterium, makes it possible for the soil to preserve the auspicious condition and maintain its fertility. Thus, due to those reasons, Nitrobacter is an exceptionally fascinating species of Nitrite oxidizing bacteria.
