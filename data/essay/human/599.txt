The constitution of each state enshrined provision for the protection of individual rights of citizens, which also applies to New Jersey. In particular, the state constitution contains 21 provisions in Article I, which describe the rights and freedoms of individuals ( 1947 State Constitution , n.d). In particular, people are defined as free and independent by nature, and the freedom and security of the individual are paramount values. Additionally, every person has the right to participate in political life and has innate political power. At the same time, it is clarified that state institutions can restrict freedoms if the public good requires it.
An important point in the protection of individual rights is freedom of speech and expression. However, it is also emphasized that a citizen “may freely speak, write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right” ( 1947 State Constitution , n.d, para. 8). Thus, a citizen can be held liable for defamation if it is proven, which identifies a restriction in favor of the freedoms of another individual. The remaining paragraphs of Article I provide individuals with the protection of rights in the context of criminal prosecution legal proceedings, as well as in relation to fines and bills. Additionally, the constitution provides protection for public gatherings and deliberations if they are for the common good.
Thus, the New Jersey Constitution provides for the protection of the basic individual rights of citizens. At the same time, in many aspects, it is specified that these rights are a priority if they are consistent with the goals of the good for society. In this case, every citizen needs to keep in mind the restrictions that the freedoms of other members of society impose on their actions.
