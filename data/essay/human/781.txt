Influence on Jazz History
Charles Bolden was born in New Orleans and is recognized as the first person to perform and play what could thereafter be considered jazz music. Many early jazz musicians credited Charles as the founder of jazz. Louis Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton attested that Bolden was among the most influential musicians who played jazz. Many aspects of Bolden traditions, such as syncopation, polyrhythm, and improvision, linger today and are considered significant to jazz music (Nmaam, 2019). Since Buddy Bolden’s band did not know how to read music, most of their compositions were either copied or generated on the spot. That is how the art of improvising became the hallmark of jazz. This style had an impact on young jazz musicians. Musicians today draw inspiration from the first king of jazz, and his influence on music culture and ingenuity touches them fundamentally.
Bolden was known for his loud sound. People who sang about the prowess of his music career emphasized his loudness. He cemented his reputation by using the knowledge of his cornet to put fans into a trance and get them dancing into a frenzy (Micucci, 2019). Bolden had the ability to sink himself into a trance where nothing mattered but music. He played blues at medium tempos sprinkled with racy lyrics. By mixing gospel and blues inflections, he made a rhythmic feel that resulted in a unique sound that spread throughout New Orleans. His talent for altering rhythm, performance, and melody elements appealed to his fans and forever changed the music course.
Events and People That Shaped His Life and Career
Bolden began playing the cornet in his teenage years. Manuel Hall, a neighbor, taught him how to play the cornet. He also took lessons on the cornet and played at parades in parks, picnics, and union halls that dotted the neighborhood. Bolden later joined a New Orleans band led by Charles Galloway, where he displayed his musical talent and skills. Later, the young musician created his band that consisted of five members – the guitar, cornet, two clarinets, bass, trombone, and drums. They played a wide range of genres, including ragtime, blues, and waltzes. Although the band was musically untrained and short on techniques, he improvised embellishments.
Bolden was also motivated by the music that was performed in his hometown. Some of the sounds he heard comprised jubilant singing, spirituals, and shouts from his neighborhood. Creole and African American musicians who played a waltz, schottische, and quadrille influenced his views on music styles (Sandmel, 2019). He played and associated with other early jazz musicians like George Baquet, Sidney Bechet, and Peter Bocage, who contributed immensely to his career. Bolden absorbed the African American and Afro-Caribbean folk music styles back in the day. Brass bands that performed various secular and religious functions also helped shape Bolden’s life in music.
In 1902, he was shortlisted as a music artist in the city directory (Sandmel, 2019). By the end of 1890, Bolden had the most powerful band in New Orleans. Due to the expanded band following, the demand for his music grew, and he constantly performed while playing dances and parades all across town. Unfortunately, the pressures of performing constantly and alcohol consumption ended his career in 1906. His relationship with the band deteriorated as he became unreliable and eventually quit playing. Bolden made his last public performance during a parade on Labor Day 1906.
