I have reviewed the videos Tips for job seekers: How to negotiate your salary pt. 1 and Tips for job seekers: Advice on personal branding pt. 2 , which were helpful for planning job interviews. From the first video, I learned that it is necessary to present value and uniqueness when asking for a raise in salary, which is also applicable to the topic of personal branding (CareerBuilder, 2012). Namely, one can use a similar approach when applying for a job, emphasizing that they have the skills and ideas that the company might appreciate. The other skill is flexibility; it is essential to consider several options when negotiating something so that to be able to turn situations into win-win events.
The second video’s focus was closer to the topic of personal branding. Namely, its vital information was that one should be honest when presenting oneself to a company since it demonstrates whether the employee would be further satisfied with one’s work (CarrierBuilding, 2013). The openness signals the employer that an individual is genuinely suitable for a job position and can complete their tasks effectively in the future.
So, the skills to focus on are value creation, negotiation, flexibility, and openness. They are significant because they make one a particularly presentable individual for an employer. Moreover, these skills are essential for a management career since they are components of a personal brand; in turn, a manager’s knowledge of branding is obligatory. This information comprises a part of the skillset for a person that plans to promote and work with people professionally. Thus, the mentioned skills are required for people who themselves are to cooperate with employees and understand their value.
