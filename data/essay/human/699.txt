Work
What I Will Do
The sphere of financial well-being directly impacts my physical and psychological health. Visiting a clinic and a psychologist always costs a lot of money, which you need to earn somewhere. My current job does not allow me to take complete care of my health because some services cost as much as half of my salary. Even though I work in a place that allows me to realize myself in the field, I study thoroughly. I want to work where I will have to give no more than a third of my income for various services.
What I Need
To find a better-paying job, I need to do a thorough search for vacancies on various Internet resources. I am not sure that going to the unemployment bureau would be a good idea, but it’s worth considering as an option. It should help me to get to know better the areas in which I can work by taking preparatory courses. It is necessary to approach the preparation of a resume very carefully ( Creating a healthier life , 2016). It is necessary to update it and remove unnecessary things. The resume is my reflection, so it should look appropriate.
Savings
What I Will Do
An essential part of a happy life has a financial cushion to help me cope with difficult times or acquire something significant. Every month, I manage to save a small amount, which helps me travel and not save anywhere. I have a budget for the month, which helps determine how much I should spend this month. Thanks to my new job, I want to increase my expenses for a month to take better care of myself now and in the future.
What I Need
To save money correctly, I should contact the bank to familiarize myself with all the necessary services. Probably, I should open a deposit at a certain percentage so that my amount will grow in any case. Banking applications will allow me to track the movement of my funds better and see where it is worth cutting costs. The new job will have a decisive role in accumulating new funds and their competent expenditure.
Debt
What I Will Do
I would like to have a clear understanding of my total debt and how quickly I can repay it without going beyond my budget. I think that I will be able to figure out this issue myself, without outside help, by carefully studying the information on the Internet. It will help me avoid risks and fraud from the outside, which is my big fear to deal with this issue independently.
What I Need
Many organizations in the world issue microloans that repay debts, but this has a downside. These organizations are taking inhumane measures that it’s time to return the money. A good option is to contact your bank to obtain a credit card with a specific limit. This feature will allow you to pay off most of the debts and, in the future, repay the debt to the bank without haste.
Retirement
What I Will Do
I managed to open a deposit on good terms, and I will constantly try to replenish it with a sufficient amount of funds. Every month I will receive a small percentage of these contributions, which will improve my emotional state. I hope that I will be able to save more and not have to borrow money or take out a loan for another purchase with a new job.
What I Need
To improve my financial well-being even more, I should spend more time studying financial literacy. There are an incalculable number of free resources for training and planning in the modern world. Together, this will give me a happy life where I stop worrying that there is not enough money or I owe someone when everything is under control. Financial control is a very responsible thing you need to start teaching at school.
