Mary Midgley’s philosophical legacy is very diverse and essential in the corpus of English-language philosophy of the second half of the twentieth century. This period was marked by an intense revival of interest in relativism and ethics, accompanied by a simultaneous disillusionment with modern autonomous reason and morality ideals. Trying Out One’s New Sword is a story about refuting the theory of moral isolationism and barriers that divide the world into independent units with their values and traditions.
The article’s central idea revolves around a ritual in feudal Japan, the purpose of which is to test the effectiveness of an untried sword or another weapon. For this objective, the samurai chop up a random passerby encountered at a crossroads. Abnormal traditions exist not only in Japan but also in other countries because societies have distinct ideas about proper behavior. The author points out that one’s own culture affects one’s relations with others: it determines what people criticize in other societies (Midgley, 1981). Sometimes they are insensitive to other communities, and occasionally they condemn their own culture by corresponding it to others.
Judgments are always based on one’s values, yet sometimes individuals are not ready to recognize moral relativism. It is impossible to comprehend the complexity of religion by reducing it to a single local model and then declaring it universal. Midgley (1981) emphasizes that it is not prohibited to judge other customs. However, one should not set up barriers and must understand one’s own culture before assessing another. Furthermore, one of the leading points of the article is that there are no separate isolated societies; they are all constantly integrating, especially in the modern world.
Therefore, Mary Midgley refutes the concept of moral isolationism and gives her interpretation of the ability to evaluate other civilizations. The capacity to form one’s own beliefs and make judgments about other cultures is crucial; however, one must never forget to be respectful and avoid crude opinions. All cultures are diverse, but the world was created as a whole, and that is why no barriers can exist.
