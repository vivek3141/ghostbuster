The article by Clarke (1997) focuses on the role of people of color in Canadian life and history. This well-grounded work attracts attention not only due to the author’s style and exciting data provided by him. The article is impressive because Clarke describes the country’s history from the inside, comparing the outward veneer of a liberal and tolerant Canada with a less pleasant inward reality.
This work contains several facts that seem to be surprising but compelling. Firstly, Canada pretends to be racially tolerant, in fact, it accused people of color of promoting a culture of violence. Secondly, it is strange that “83 percent of Canadian adults did not know” or perhaps did not want to know “that slavery was practiced in pre-Confederation Canada until 1834” (Clarke, 1997, p.103). Finally, Clarke’s (1997) opinion that Canadian whiteness can be explained due to the weather conditions is unexpected. In addition, although the unwillingness of African American people to admit their origin and unite can be understood, racial solidarity would help them more. However, it would be wrong to argue against the author’s idea that the lack of racial solidarity is one of the main reasons for the onset of Canadian “ideal whiteness” (Clarke, 1997, p. 100). It is one of the most compelling facts in the reading since challenges with the self-perception of people of color explain the existence of Canadian whiteness as “an ethereal force” (Clarke, 1997, p. 100). Thus, this work, full of not boring historical data but exciting ideas, is worthy of reading.
This article is a significant contribution to the exploration of Canadian history since it shows the inner mechanisms of the state. The author focuses on various facts of Canadian history that emphasize the depreciation of the role of people of color. Clark chooses an unexpected manner of narrating, describing historical events, and diluting them with elements of imagery. Therefore, this work is as surprising as it is compelling.
