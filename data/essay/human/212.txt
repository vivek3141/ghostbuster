Marketing is one of the most critical aspects of every business, which makes organizations look for effective ways to attract new customers. However, not all marketing activities are fair or ethical, and targeting uninformed consumers is among them. One should explain that uninformed consumers are individuals who lack the psychological or mental maturity to make reasonable decisions and purchases. Examples of these people are children, the elderly, and individuals with psychological conditions. Consequently, it is unethical to target such consumers because this practice can provide these people with adverse outcomes.
Many factors explain why it is unethical to target uninformed consumers. The first robust argument comes from the definition presented above. Since these people do not have psychological or mental maturity, target marketing can force them to purchase unneeded items. Consequently, this marketing approach is a form of manipulation of unprotected populations. The second reason refers to the fact that it is challenging for uninformed consumers to locate sellersâ€™ lying. As a result, organizations can provide customers with false information to stimulate their buying behaviors.
Irrespective of this information, some people claim that there is nothing wrong with targeting uninformed consumers. This point of view relies on the belief that such customers represent new markets, and organizations are free to enter and benefit from them. However, it is challenging to deny that these consumers are vulnerable populations, meaning that they deserve a specific attitude. That is why it is unethical to target uninformed customers.
In conclusion, the essay has presented robust arguments of why organizations should refrain from targeting children, the elderly, and people with mental conditions. Even though some people and businesses stipulate that these populations are suitable for marketing, it is better to avoid them. The rationale behind this statement is that uninformed consumers do not have psychological maturity, meaning that target marketing can force them to make unreasonable decisions and purchases.
