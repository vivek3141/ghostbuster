Anorexia nervosa is a treatable eating disorder when people significantly limit the number of calories and types of foods they eat, which leads to excessive weight loss. Anyone may be affected by anorexia, and about 1-2% of the population suffers from the disorder (Cleveland Clinic Medical Staff, 2021). Key symptoms include:
Emotional and mental signs: fear of gaining weight, obsession with counting calories or diets, irritability, self-criticism, and other characteristics. Behavioral signs: changes in eating habits, excessive exercise, and other features. Physical signs: weight loss, fatigue, weakness, and similar symptoms. Pay attention: Anorexia is possible even if there are no underweight signs, and one needs to pay attention to other symptoms.
Genetics and family history: brain chemistry impacts appetite, mood, and self-control; therefore, people who have relatives suffering from eating disorders are at a higher risk. Trauma or life changes: through food control, a person copes with a traumatic event or significant life changes. Culture and environment: imposed media unrealistic ideals of beauty. Peer influence: bullying or ridicule due to the appearance of a teenager. Mental health: Personal qualities and features such as perfectionism, low self-esteem, and impulsivity are potential factors of anorexia. Career: the chance of anorexia is higher among those who have thinness is a requirement of the profession, like ballerinas, models, gymnasts, and other professionals. Diet: Being passionate about a particular diet can increase the risk of anorexia.
The objectives of anorexia treatment include weight recovery, psychological care, and healthy dietary and behavioral patterns. Treatment is selected individually and may include strategies such as nutritional counseling, psychotherapy, family therapy, medication, or hospitalization. The duration of treatment and its consequences are individual and depend on the time of the disorder, its severity, the chosen treatment, and adherence to it. With the proper treatment, recovery from anorexia is possible, but the risk of relapse remains high, highlighting the importance of compliance with medical recommendations.
