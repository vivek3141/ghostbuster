That is why the investigation and evaluation of its potential influence will be beneficial for the development of accurate strategies and preventative measures. The purpose of this paper is to examine the nature of cryptocurrency, its characteristics, and impact on the basis of literature review to answer the research question: Is cryptocurrency unstable? The answer will help to approve or reject a hypothesis that lies in the paper’s thesis statement – being a long-lasting uncontrolled bubble, cryptocurrency contributes to financial and monetary instability, a lack of investor protection, the global market’s downfall, and wealth inequity.
