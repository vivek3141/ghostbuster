Swimmer Lia Thomas attended the University of Pennsylvania as a student. In 2021, the media focused on her successes in sports as a trans woman. Lia Thomas, a first-time competitor in the women’s division, had a strong showing. Early in December, she had her greatest college results of the year in Ohio, when she competed in the two hundred and five hundred meter sprints. After Lia Thomas’ successes at university swimming pools, she was criticized following the fact that she was born a male, which gave him an advantage. Some people argued that because Thomas was taking testosterone therapy, he had an unfair advantage over other athletes. Describing her victory to be unfair was completely wrong following the fact that trans genders are always allowed to compete by themselves. Various suggestions have been put up, including the creation of a transsexual division in the NCAA if trans individuals have such an unfair edge. Men compete with men, women compete with women, and transsexuals compete against one another.
Thomas’s success in the past seasons is a testament to his hard work and dedication. He has shown that transgender athletes can also be as successful as anyone else and should be respected for their achievements. However, the fact is that Thomas has been subject to all the same testing and regulations as any other athlete. He was not allowed to take more testosterone than any other male athlete, and his testosterone levels are closely monitored by officials. A year-long course of testosterone-suppressing therapy was prescribed following NCAA guidelines for the swimmer’s recovery. These restrictions have been deemed inadequate by the Women’s Sports Policy Task Force, for example, in the case of athletes who begin their transitioning after puberty.
