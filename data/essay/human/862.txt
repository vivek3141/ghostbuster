America is a large continent, where today, a huge number of different nationalities and representatives of different races, genders, orientations, and ethnic groups live. Thus, diversity is an essential part of American society as it plays a vital role in the relationship between people and influences their interaction. I had plenty of encounters with individuals who reflect diversity in my everyday life. That has impacted me as a personality and contributed to the values and views towards discrimination that I have today.
I remember that when I started to go to school, my family and I moved to a district where the prevailing party of our neighbors was black people. A lot of my classmates also were Afro-Americans, which at the first time was surprising for me as a child that had never been in a group of people that at first glance are so different from me. However, already at that moment, I felt that it was the only difference in our appearance. After a while, I met so many interesting and kind people from different backgrounds. That experience taught me that an individual’s personality does not depend on the color of their skin, ethnic background, or nationality. I am grateful for the fact that I realized it in the early stages of my life.
As a person who is against discrimination, it is a pity to see how people might remove themselves from people from minority groups just because of their skin color, ethnicity, or other characteristics that are different from those people. I see such behavior as quite unfair, and I suppose that people who are imposing discrimination in today’s society should be more open-minded and educate themselves on the topic of diversity and equality.
