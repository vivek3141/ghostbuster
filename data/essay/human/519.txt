Keeping track of student transcripts can be a heavy bureaucratic job that needs to be done away with as technology advances. Among these technologies are database management systems that allow creating an ordered library of student transcripts, as well as the students themselves, faculties, departments, and other essential entities within the university. The unique enumeration of students can help avoid confusion when having the same first or last name and implement transitions to other courses, keeping the student’s primary key identified. What is no less important is the ability to search and obtain quantitative knowledge control statistics for given keys of both courses, faculties, groups, and students individually, just like their work. Now requests will be available to all involved employees who may need this information: they will no longer have to submit relevant applications to the archive wait for a physical search.
It is worth noting the security issues of this project, which consist of a possible data leak. This database should include only those data that are already in the public domain: no more than the name and surname of each student. Attackers can use any additional personal information in data leakage. While this database can be a handy tool for storing all student information, this should not be done for security reasons. This project is aimed primarily at more convenient accounting of student work, which is also protected by copyright and should not be available within the project. The papers themselves should be stored in other secure places of the university by the identification numbers used in the database for easy and quick retrieval. An explicit restriction of information in the project’s entities will provide a smaller amount of work and an adequate statement of the problem.
