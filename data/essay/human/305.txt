The issue of tribal sovereignty has been scrutinized over the years, the treatment of tribes ranging from supportive measures and attempts of integration into the broader community to outright persecution. In this connection, the law about tribal gaming can be seen as a positive step towards recognition of tribes’ unique way of life and self-determination. This essay discusses the question “how tribal gaming act can add to the sovereignty of tribes?”
Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes were given the right to determine what gaming activities they wanted to engage in, and in most cases, the permission was granted by the state. Gaming activities could embrace tribal rituals or games of chance, depending on the wishes of the tribes and had to be agreed to by the state (Light and Rand). Since often tribal games are unique and have a deep meaning for the tribe, it would be right to say that granting tribes the right to hold their own games is necessary. This measure helps to uphold their culture and establish sovereignty over a very important sphere of life, which is relaxation. Moreover, gaming helps to support traditions and customs through rituals that have been molded over the centuries.
As far as sovereignty is concerned, gaming serves to establish the spheres of life which are completely under the tribes’ jurisdiction. Thus, for example, some tribe members mix with the society at large, finding employment or integrating themselves in the life of big cities. However, gaming, and in particular traditional tribal gaming, serves as a reminder of one’s roots, promotes freedom of choice and sovereignty as it is the one thing that is almost completely under the tribes’ jurisdiction.
