The rate of patient mortality in intensive care is a growing concern for medical practitioners. Although the cause of patient motility may be attributed to many factors even before the individual reaches the CCU, it has been reported that an effective tube placement during resuscitation aids healthy circulation. It is not known if the nurse’s knowledge of capnography affects its use in critical care units. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the relationship between nurses’ knowledge of capnography and its use in coronary care units. The project will provide valuable insight into factors affecting the use of capnography, thus contributing to the field and filling the gap in the literature. The intervention protocol will train nurses on the benefit of capnography and test their implementation in critical care units. Based on the training and testing, the goal is to facilitate the implementation of capnography use in the selected CCU. The intervention will also enable accurate tube placement to stimulate normal chest circulation during resuscitation, improve quality care delivery, and patient recovery in critical care units. The project will recruit nurses working in the selected coronary care unit in Central Jersey. This setting was chosen because of the high incidence of nurse’s refusal to use capnography during resuscitation. The project timeline is twenty-four weeks. The selected participants will be based on the inclusion criteria, and their test results will be confidential and used solely for testing nursing knowledge of capnography. This project will facilitate positive health outcomes by providing evidence to support nursing practice in implementing capnography during resuscitation.
