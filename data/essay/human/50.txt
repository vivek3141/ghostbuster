Android Studio is developed for Android to accelerate one’s application development. This helps one to build the highest-quality applications for each Android gadget. The following are some of the significant characteristics found in Android Studio for building Android applications. Android Studio, as per the Intellij IDEA, offers the fastest turnaround on an app developer’s coding and operational workflow. Further, its Apply Changes characteristic allows an app developer to change resources and push code to a running app without restarting the app. This flexibility assists one to control how much of the application is restarted when one wants to install and test small, incremental modifications while preserving the gadget’s existing state. It also has a code editor feature that assists one to work faster, write better code, and be productive by providing improved code completion, code analysis, and refactoring (Horton, 2021). Android Studio will offer recommendations in the dropdown list as one type.
Furthermore, the Android Studio has an Android Emulator feature that installs and initiates one’s apps faster than the actual gadget. It also permits one to prototype and test an application on different Android gadgets configurations such as tablets, smartphones, Android wearable, and Android Television gadgets. One may also kindle a range of hardware characteristics like network latency, GPS location, and multi-touch input and motion sensors. At each stage, Android Studio assists Android app developers in ensuring they create the best code through sample apps and code templates. Android Studio also offers a robust static analysis structure and comprises more than 365 different lintelligence checks across one’s entire app. It also has many quick fixes that assist one to resolve issues in different categories like security, performance, and accuracy. Android Studio offers a range of testing tools and frameworks to help one in testing the app (Horton, 2021). Android Studio also creates a unified environment where an app developer may build apps for Android tablets, wearable devices, Android Auto, and Android Televisions.
The Android Studio project building is separated into two files, Java and XML, because these enable one to develop apps using both the two files. The Android app development framework supports one to develop applications using XML and Java. Java and XML files each perform a different role in Android App development. Any app developed, typically has the following behavior, layout, and resources. Java file in Android Studio is employed because of App’s behavior when one wants the app to do something. Java file will provide an android app with an independent environment to do something. For example, Android Software Development Kit (SDK) has included several standard Java libraries (Boduch & Derks, 2020). Java libraries offer functionalities for mathematic functions, data structure, networking functions, and graphics implantation.
Further, an XML file in the Android Studio enables one to create a layout and resources. When one wants an app to appear in a certain way then XML file becomes of great use in Android Studio project building. When resources such as files and libraries are sometimes required then, XML becomes helpful. XML offers a permanent, robust, verifiable, and non-proprietary file format for both off and on the website to distribute and store data and text (Boduch & Derks, 2020). The use of XML in Android Studio is to create layout files as it permits each tag to be closed and preserves white space as opposed to using HTML.
