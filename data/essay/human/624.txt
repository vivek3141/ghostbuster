The Spirit bear of the British Colony is a unique species of bears that amaze with their appearance and are of particular importance to the population of British Columbia. This type of animal is a kind of Kermode bear and is a subspecies of black bears, which often have dark fur (Service, 2017). However, due to a genetic mutation, some of the representatives of spirit bears have a white coat color, which is why they have such an interesting name (Langlois, 2017). Like many representatives of this species, they weigh an average of two hundred kilograms (Service, 2017). Many sources note the extreme rarity of this type of bear and only estimated about four hundred species in British Columbia, which determines the need to preserve them (Groc, n.d.).
Moreover, it is believed that they are closely related to the indigenous population of America, as they contribute to the development of the ecosystem in which they live, which makes them extremely important. The indigenous population also has a legend that spirit bears could swim deep underwater and bring people to a magical place. Spirit bears can often be found in the Great Bear Rainforest, with almost seven million hectares of rainforest (Langlois, 2017). Another feature of these animals is a particular love for salmon. In addition, bears eat berries, insects, plants, fruits, and nuts (Service, 2017). Kermodes are also very shy and mystical, which also causes the difficulty of finding them and the rarity of finding people. In conclusion, Spirit bears are rare representatives of bears who, because of their unique white color, are considered to be holy and sacred by the indigenous population of America.
