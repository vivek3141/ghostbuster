Health administration is challenging and requires excellent memory, high concentration, and stamina. Thanks to the development of information technology, a significant part of the administrator’s work can be transferred to spreadsheets (for example, Excel) or other programs. Computers and sophisticated technology can now be found in any hospital, and using them is one of the critical skills of an administrator. Excel does a great job with concepts such as probability and measures of central tendency, and it helps medical staff to have straightforward access to extensive databases. It is also easy for administrators to manage hospitals or departments within Lean and Six Sigma using information technology.
Probability in work can be calculated using a unique formula given in the table. This function is called PROB, and it divides the number of favorable events by the total number of possible events. These calculations are quick and easy; the specialist can vary the events and numbers. For example, people can calculate the probability of emergencies per shift in this way. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded how many specialists should be ready and what equipment should always be available. Sometimes people can use the OR and AND tools to calculate the probability.
In addition to probability, Excel allows people to calculate measures of the central tendency. Kros and Rosenthal (2016) postulate: “Time spent by physicians with patients what is called the central tendency of the data. There are three commonly employed measures of central tendency: the mean, the median, and the mode” (p. 184). These complex calculations are also based on processing a large number of data and estimating the arithmetic mean. The Lean and Six Sigma management concept allows people to minimize errors during production or operation. A recognized concept postulates that a business should always strive for success and increase its requirements. For managers, the predictability of future results should be necessary. People can predict them using Excel and formulas, thereby analyzing a large amount of data.
Despite the abundance of computers and sophisticated technologies in hospitals, doctors’ role remains crucial in terms of morality. Doctors can still be spiritual guides for people: they can see their vices, illnesses, sufferings. According to what they know, they choose the appropriate treatment. It is essential not to forget the biblical truth: “On hearing this, Jesus said, “It is not healthy who need a doctor, but the sick” ( English Standard Version Bible , 2001, Matt, 9:12). It is impossible to depersonalize the doctor or turn him into a cold machine, even though hospitals are increasingly dependent on machine work. The device only helps the doctor to carry out his plan.
Thus, Excel allows people to achieve quick results in work by processing large databases and calculating the necessary information using formulas. Formulas allow managers to easily and quickly calculate probabilities, which helps people predict the future in the short term. Knowing the likelihood of a particular event, the administrator can calculate the necessary medicines and medical equipment. Excel allows people to calculate complex central tendency measures, which helps to organize large layers of information. The Lean and Six Sigma management concept is based on constant development and striving for new successes. It is essential for administrators in this concept to predict further actions, possible risks, and successes. In addition, they need to see the mistakes made and quickly correct them. In the future, the studied material will help solve critical administrative tasks: the purchase of medicines in the right quantities, equipment, training of doctors and nurses.
