Lawsuit Tendencies
Civil lawsuits are constantly evolving and are driving new trends to emerge. For decades, filing criminal charges against police officers for excessive use of force has been extremely rare. Even if the defendants were convicted, the jury did not want to find them guilty. However, nowadays, there is a growing trend in the number of lawsuits against the police, and the percentage of successful settlements is also increasing. There are many lawsuits out of court, which causes anxiety to enforcement officials who are afraid of potential cases. Moreover, is a tendency to protect the rights of citizens and to punish any person who subjects to the deprivation of any rights, secured by the Constitution (The United States Code, 1980). Such individual shall be liable notwithstanding his job, but the requirements of a declaratory decree shall be considered.
Tendencies concerning corrections lawsuits and equality among people have also been modified. Analysis of the case law enables one to conclude that although correctional facilities have broad powers, they have the primary duty to ensure equal conditions for people with disabilities. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (2010), physical or mental disabilities should not diminish a person’s right to participate in all aspects of society. Therefore, even in justiciability lawsuits, there is a need to provide exceptional facilities and necessary assistance for everyone who requires it.
Civil liability issues have a direct impact on the criminal justice system. As a result of tendencies toward equal opportunity and protection of the needy, the specifics of justice are reversing. According to the Civil Rights Act (1991), everyone must be responsible for the harm he or she has caused and make restitution. Therefore, justice is the central feature and value of the modern criminal justice system. Civil liability issues and their distinctive features guide modifications in the system, and each new trend necessitates a change in approach.
Civil Lawsuits Transformations
The modern world is constantly evolving, and its improvements impact civil litigation in the United States. The U.S. justice system continues to fulfill its primary mission by adjudicating cases on the merits of conflicts or resolving legal disputes through other established methods. While the primary mission of the court system has remained, some features of dispute resolution are different. Civil lawsuits have transformed over time, and these changes directly affect criminal justice professionals.
It is noteworthy that the period between the 1970s and 1980s was a crisis in the U.S. judicial system. It manifested itself in a multiplication of the number of court appeals, the duration of cases, and the parties’ litigation costs (Horner et al., 2018). Therefore, the need to reform the system, which was not coping with many lawsuits, emerges. Most of the transformations concerned civil cases’ subject matter and complexity, but decision terms were prolonged.
The extensive caseload was the reason for judges to take up civil cases. The concept of geographic uniformity was no longer actively used, and Congress authorized the judiciary to amend and have exclusive authority over the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This reform has led to duplication of cases, increasing costs, and delays. The sweeping changes impacted all elements of civil litigation and gave criminal justice professionals a stimulus to be more assertive in their cases. Criminal justice professionals came under pressure for the enormous growth of issues and overhead (Horner et al., 2018). Employees became highly frustrated, making civil litigation even more frustrating and time-consuming.
Civil litigation has been plagued by the many changes that have been necessary because of the crisis of the judicial system. The subjects of lawsuits, the length of the litigation process, its peculiarities, and its size have altered. Despite this, costs and delays are still high, and the system is not functioning completely. Moreover, all of the reforms directly affected criminal justice professionals. Still, they have not been favorable or effective because they have provided little encouragement to undertake meaningful activities.
