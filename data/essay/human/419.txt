Coronavirus has significantly impacted the general health status of the planet’s population for two main reasons. One of them is the virus itself, as it negatively influences people’s organisms, and the other is the difficulties related to maintaining favorable health condition in the pandemic situation. Thus, it is imperative to stay physically active and perform various exercises to keep one’s body in proper shape, improve organism’s immunity and reduce the chances of being diseased.
COVID-19 causes particular challenges associated with maintaining a physically active lifestyle. According to Shariat et al. (2020), the leading risk factor of virus transmission is people’s proximity to one another in groups, meaning that public gatherings are dangerous. Thus, public gyms and training grounds may not be a proper place to exercise as they do not always have enough space to keep the necessary social distance. However, it is even more crucial nowadays to remain physically active as the coronavirus keeps developing new variants, which means regular training can prevent potential issues and assist in keeping people fit and healthy. The corresponding exercises could include push-ups against the wall, single-leg step-ups on stairs, shoulder lateral raises, jumping rope, or simple walking (Shariat et al., 2020). Doing those can help people keep active and healthy during the quarantine.
Overall, staying physically active is an essential part of people’s lives, and its significance has grown due to COVID-19. It has brought many challenges to physical training and made it even more important to pay attention to body shape and health condition. Doing aerobic exercises and strength training can help people stay physically active, improve their health, and reduce the chances of getting some disease.
