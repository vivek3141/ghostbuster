The three main benefits offered by Grammarly and Turnitin used for text editing purposes are significant amounts of time saved on proofreading, simplified writing process through recommendations and help in maintaining tone through the paper. Moreover, as a form of text editing tool, Turnitin and Grammarly utilize elaborated AI and machine learning processes that offer more text editing opportunities. For example, once the app detects that the text features listing elements, it will automatically provide the user with an option to make a list of these items for more comfortable reading. According to Wang (2020), AI presents a vital part in Turnitin, and its work within the app focuses on improving the quality of studentsâ€™ writing.
On the other hand, mistakes can always occur with text editing applications, as speech recognition algorithms can fail to detect specific sentence structures. While proofreading papers using Grammarly and Turnitin saves a significant amount of time, one should carefully approach the task without overly relying on the apps. In writing responses to assignments and personal correspondence, the apps will help by automatically detecting any grammar or punctuation mistakes and ensuring the use of tone suitable for conversation purposes. When the user confuses different words for formal and informal tones, the app will correct the text and help choose the right sentence structure. Moreover, the use of such applications could become essential for non-native English speakers and their career progression. Many companies are now starting to implement remote job principles in their work, which means more room for misunderstandings in communication. Using applications like Grammarly and Turnitin for academic or business teamwork will help to maintain productive collaboration through effective communication that leaves no misunderstandings.
