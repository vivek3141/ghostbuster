A disaster preparedness plan starts with an emergency preparedness kit that must necessarily include drinking water for each person, a supply of food for several days, a radio receiver for listening to information. Moreover, it is important to have a flashlight and extra batteries in case of a long stay in an emergency. Additionally, the kit should include a dust mask and a whistle that can be used as an alert or help signal. If it is not possible to turn off utilities, it is essential to put pliers and a can opener in order to open the food.
When preparing for an emergency, there are many other factors that influence action. There is a paralyzed person in the family, so it is critical to have a stretcher in case you have to leave the house. If circumstances do not allow the use of a stretcher, special bandages are needed in order to carry a person on their back. Moreover, the package should include all first aid supplies such as bandages, painkillers, and wound dressings. In this case, help can be provided in the event of injuries of varying degrees. One family member has asthma, so several inhalers are prepared in the kit. If they break, then it is necessary to use baking soda during an attack of illness. 1 tablespoon of soda is added to 1 liter of water; the vapors need to be inhaled for 5-7 minutes. Such alkaline inhalations help clear the bronchi, remove phlegm and relieve inflammation when coughing.
Additionally, it is necessary not to panic, as calmness is the boundary between life and death. With the loss of calmness and peace of mind, a person begins to commit rash acts that can lead to death (Aruru et al., 2021). The implementation of the plan should begin by checking the supply of water and food. Moreover, I need to make sure that all members of the family are intact. After that, I will turn on the radio and listen to messages from the rescue services. In the absence of communication, it is important to remain calm and give distress signals with a whistle. The success of the plan should be judged according to the level of calmness and readiness for different circumstances.
