Introduction
Culture is, in essence, a collection of common beliefs held by a group of individuals. Certain behaviors are deemed normal and correct by cultural standards, whereas others are deemed weird or incorrect (Tombleson et al. 16). In some traditions, personal relationships and unofficial arrangements are significantly more enforceable than any contractual obligation. Cultural interaction refers to the use of speech and other expressive tools by individuals and societies to carry out their operations and responsibilities through symbolic resources (Tombleson et al. 21). Regional diversity affects every area of global interaction. Even the medium of communication chosen may have cultural implications (Tombleson et al. 22). For instance, it has been observed that industrialized countries increasingly depend on computer technologies and place a premium on written text over spoken or face-to-face contact.
How Cultural Communications Affect Lockheed Martin’s Managers Globally Culture
In certain countries, conflict is seen positively, while others want to prevent it. Although confrontation is not generally encouraged in the United States, individuals are encouraged to resolve disputes immediately (Wilce et al. 243). In many Eastern countries, it is preferable to resolve disagreements privately. Furthermore, regional diversity would influence how Lockheed administrators approach activities. There are various reasons for this, including disparities in resource distribution, differing perceptions of time, and divergent views on how partnership and task-oriented labor should coexist. For instance, Asian and Hispanic civilizations focus on group processes at the beginning of the project and divert their attention to the ultimate goal as the program unfolds (Wilce et al. 243). In contrast, European-American cultures place a premium on the task at hand and leave connections to evolve naturally.
Decisions are commonly transferred to a junior in the United States. Self-determination is highly prized in several Southern European and Latin American cultures. In group situations, popular sovereignty works best in the United States, as in the case of Lockheed, whereas concurrence is preferred in Japan. Additionally, some cultures prohibit emotional engagement, the reasons for a quarrel, or private information (Ferraro 72). While specific inquiries may seem casual to a person, they may be inappropriate to someone from another culture. Thus, Lockheed managers would acknowledge this before they can gain a firm grasp on the perspectives and objectives of the individuals with whom they deal. Finally, diverse societies have varying perspectives on knowledge acquisition (Ferraro 72). Europeans value information obtained by numbering and quantifying more than data collected through other techniques (Ferraro 73). On the other hand, certain African cultures place a premium on information acquired through symbolism, while certain Asian cultures place a premium on knowledge acquired through transcendence.
Reason and passion both play a part in international commercial transactions. The one that prevails determines individuals’ effectiveness, their propensity for expressing feelings, or people’s emotional neutrality (Wilce et al. 241). Citizens of collectivistic cultures do not communicate their emotions openly but rather keep them strictly regulated and suppressed. In high-affect societies, individuals express their emotions openly by smiling and occasionally crying or yelling (Wilce et al. 241). Additionally, some civilizations regard time as a linear resource that may be saved or squandered. Other cultures perceive time synchronously, as a continuous influx to be perceived today, and as an uncontrollable force (Wilce et al. 243). Thus, the perspective of Lockheed’s directors in worldwide interactions with countries with a culture opposed to that of the USA may influence their economic dealings.
Norms
In the West, eye contact conveys assertiveness but can be interpreted as impolite or demanding in the Middle East and Asia. Additionally, there are gender-specific restrictions regarding facial expression, with many Eastern cultures prohibiting women from maintaining eye contact with men since it indicates power or physical intimacy (Lee et al. 112). Touch is commonly utilized in conversation, especially in business settings, as demonstrated by norms such as shaking hands. However, other civilizations regard physical contact with other individuals as impolite. Asians are more conservative when embracing, with a bow frequently substituting a handshake (Lee et al. 112). Lockheed’s culture is more conservative, such as avoiding pecking on the cheeks, as many regions of Europe do. Therefore, Lockheed’s global dealing in Asia may be affected by such norms as their managers may misinterpret their Asian counterparts.
Regardless of where an individual is in the globe, the general rule here is to offer people more room than they believe they require and only approach if requested. Physical distance is perceived differently by individuals from diverse civilizations. However, it is better to avoid entering anyone’s personal boundaries, around 2 feet (Odine 55). Certain parts of the United States are happy with completely calm appearances, while others take umbrage at the sight of a bare forearm or leg (Odine 55). The prudent course of action is to wear appropriate. Therefore, when moving to countries where the code of dressing disregards loosened attires, Lockheed’s personnel must dress appropriately; otherwise, no business dealing will transcend. Additionally, one can loosen up their attire if it becomes clear that doing so is okay.
