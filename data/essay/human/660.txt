This essay will explain the value and sexuality of women in the Islamic religion compared to Christianity. One central concern is the deflation of individuals or the suppression of people under the defense of religion. Religion has emerged to be a central tool of abuse in terms of treating different gender. Throughout Islamic holy books, women are subject to oppression, which Allah accepts. This is almost similar to Christianity since they devaluate the same women (The Holy Bible). However, there are incredible differences that I will be addressing in this essay. My argument is that women in the Islamic religion and Christianity have different values and treatments.
Firstly, I will analyze and elaborate on the motives of oppression directly from the holy books. I will analyze how some pages of Hadith and Quran justify oppression towards women as acceptable by Allah (Moore, 2017). I will analyze how this is different from the Bible since the cruelest view of females in the Bible is more gracious than that of women in Islam. Any discussion regarding the religious justification for the way men, children, or women are treated is mostly justified through texts from the holy books
I will address how women are treated in service in the church and what they can offer in the Mosques. The Islamic religion has a diverse understanding of the value of women since some view women as subservient while others view them as equals. Women in most Christian churches are viewed as equal, whereas in some churches, they are teachers of the word, nuns, and fully participate in the ministry (Ali, 2018). In the Islamic religion, women do not have a position in their church or their service and activities in the Mosque.
My essay will address the position of women in marriage in both religions. Men in the Islamic faith can be involved in a polygamous marriage which is most advisable. A man can marry several women but not more than four if they can provide and treat them equally. In Christianity, the Bible discusses polygamous marriages but does not advise men to polygamous families (Lassen, 2021). Most Christian churches advocate for monogamous families. I will address how a woman is expected to behave in the family and the role they are expected to play in their homes in both religions.
Finally, I will address the differences and similarities in womenâ€™s submission in Islamic religion and Christianity. In the Islamic religion, followers are made to believe that God was male, and hence they should submit to males since they have the power. The male gender is more respected in the Islamic religion, majorly because God is believed to be male, and hence as they submit to God, they should submit to any male (Moore, 2017). On the other hand, Christians believe that the Bible advocates men as the priest of the home and that Eve was commanded to submit to Adam, and hence women are required to submit to their husbands.
Religion is the power and the reason behind most abuse that happens to women. This essay will answer the question: is it true that women in Christianity and Islamic religions are devalued? I will conclude my essay by saying how things change through education and different forms of education. Feminists are emerging both in the Islamic religion and Christianity. They try to ensure that women are treated equally and valued just as men are valued both in religion and the community.
