There is an adverse effect of the opioid crisis on the United States. These substances typically result in an addiction, and a more significant aspect implies that they do not address the problem of the source of pain. Instead of it, opioids develop a feeling of euphoria that masks suffering. That is why it is evident that there is no need to legalize heroin, meaning that alternative pain relievers should be created.
Since heroin and other opioids adversely impact the entire nation, a reasonable step is to fund alternative treatments for pain. For example, some researchers consider using marijuana as a pain reliever, but this substance also has some health risks, meaning that this decision should be made with caution (Saloner et al., 2018). However, if medical scientists manage to find an alternative pain management medicine, numerous benefits will arise. In particular, this decision will lead to higher patient safety because opioid overuse is a leading cause of peopleâ€™s death (Saloner et al., 2018). For example, more than 60,000 people died from a drug overdose in 2016 (Saloner et al., 2018). Furthermore, a significant advantage will refer to expenditure savings because using an alternative pain reliever will not create people who will require additional services. That is why there is no doubt that it is necessary to invest in alternative pain management medicines.
In conclusion, it has been identified that the opioid crisis is a significant challenge for the United States. This problem results in thousands of injured and dead, denoting that alternative pain relievers should be found. Marijuana is a suitable option, but the possible harmful effects of this substance represent why the healthcare industry has not started using it. In any case, researchers should look for alternative pain relievers to protect patients and reduce healthcare expenditures.
