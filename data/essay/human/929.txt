Knowledge and theories produced by the representatives of different ethnicities in American society play a crucial role in learning the country’s history and current interpersonal relationships. Many critical events, personal stories, and intellectual traditions unite people across the United States. However, despite the intention to live in an equal and fair society, certain social struggles of ethnic groups cannot be ignored. Today, Americans continue living in a world where racial inequality determines the quality of life, and group affirmation turns out to be one of the possible solutions for minorities. City of Ghosts and other class readings create a solid background for identifying and understanding the uniqueness of community stories and realizing that ethnic differences still matter. It is hard for some people to live around reasoned and irrational biases and neglect their interests, beliefs, and attitudes toward social obligations. Sometimes, it is extremely important to consider cultural roots and respect differences. In some cases, people should learn to diminish the power of their emotions and cultures and assimilate with dignity to avoid unnecessary conflicts, following the rules of self-affirmation and historical trauma theories. The history of American society is long and complex, including the struggles of Latinx and Mexican communities against discrimination, unequal interpersonal relationships and educational restrictions, and the ways how to share feelings and intentions.
Common struggles and movements to support equal interpersonal relationships and reduce discrimination impact are probably the most significant events in the lives of ethnic minorities who live in the United States. People believe that their society offers equal conditions for developing work and life affairs and decision-making. However, the differences between black and white Americans exist and affect their choices in terms of interracial friendships. Ingraham indicates that about 75% of whites have only white social networks, with no minorities present. The quality of such relationships may be understood through the historical trauma theory when populations experience slavery outcomes and cannot eliminate certain associations and prejudices. Many individuals immigrate to the United States admiring the dream of having a better life, employment, and a safe future. They cannot realize that borders between countries are not just barbed-wire fences with multiple political and legal rules but the line that divides people physically and spiritually (Náñez). Discrimination is both abstract social and concrete brick-and-mortar walls that people create to keep everything in order. In the third episode of City of Ghosts , the old lady shared her memories of no fences in the park, and everybody contributed to the community’s heartbeat. Mexican and Latinx communities have to live in a world full of such walls and fences that divide people from being themselves.
Another serious lived experience that challenges many American Latinx, Mexicans, and other ethnic groups includes education restrictions that promote group affirmation. In addition to routine relationships and communication, ethnic groups prove their right to equal education and skill development. Colton is one of the characters in the second episode of City of Ghosts who represents a common image of a white boy in American society: parental support, high expectations, and multiple opportunities. Not all children from minority communities have the same chances. In Arizona, the decision to ban Mexican-American studies is discussed to improve state tests and remove controversies about ethnic studies (Planas). This course is associated with multiple benefits for young people to better understand their society. Students should know how to reflect on their cultural experiences, diversity, and history. It is wrong to believe that education in the United States would automatically give some priority in the country or abroad (Carcamo). Education is just another criterion according to which ethnic groups are divided, and the self-affirmation theory explains the essence of this challenge. People are motivated to maintain their integrity and predict outcomes. Self-affirmation shows if there are any threats to the self-using reflection and acknowledgment of personal responsibilities. Almost the same happens in the case of group affirmation for education – people unite their efforts to prove their rights in American society.
Finally, social struggles experienced by Latinx, Mexican, and other communities are related to the personalities and the ability to cope with feelings and emotions. Ethnic minorities continue facing social injustices, biases, and controversies regularly. Although the governments make policies and create laws where all citizens are equal regardless of their age, gender, or skin color, it is impossible to control people at the individual level. Thus, many recommendations are given to support people, motivate them properly, and demonstrate that some decisions and relationships depend not on the history of inequality but on personal achievements. In the first episode of City of Ghosts, one of the characters, Mariko, offers her friend to feel the energy of the environment because most buildings and land have a history that inspires. It is not the question of believing or accepting something that does not exist. This kind of support is obligatory for all ethnic groups who should find the strength to struggle and survive in an unknown place. Homesickness, pleasant memories and expectations for a better future fulfill many immigrants in the United States (Wessler). The stories of Native Americans, Mexicans, and Latinx prove that there is always some invisible power that stimulates and make it possible not to notice social inequalities and existing biases. Diversity is inevitable in the modern world, and it is an individual decision based on emotions and actual intentions to either enjoy differences or accept them as a challenge.
In conclusion, American history and the current situation prove that ethnic inequality is a serious burden for many people. Latinx, Mexicans, and other minority groups have to struggle for their independence dealing with the outcomes of racial discrimination, unequal interpersonal relationships, educational challenges, and the necessity to hide or control feelings and intentions. Inequalities include differences in races, ethnicities, skin colors, and languages, and many citizens of the United States have to communicate and cooperate concerning these aspects. Slavery, immigration, globalization, and international relationships have specific impacts on modern communities. On the one hand, people create conditions under which their affairs should be developed. On the other hand, few are satisfied with these conditions because some concerns, questions, and misunderstandings emerge over time. For example, many years ago, all citizens of the United States got the right to equal education. Today, some programs are re-evaluated, canceled, or added, relying on current trends and interests. Therefore, the only recommendation for all ethnic groups is to cope with feelings and emotions and learn how to build adequate relationships. Most inequalities and differences are predictable, and it is the responsibility of every individual to react properly, and with dignity.
