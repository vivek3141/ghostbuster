When many people have a chance to interact simultaneously, especially in learning settings, it may easily lead to the occurrence of conflicts and arguments. The talkative or negative members undoubtedly impact the atmosphere within the team (Jacobs et al., 2016). It seems that “the show-off” might negatively influence the moods of all the members, considering that it is easy to get irritated by such a type of behavior (Jacobs et al., 2016). In addition, show-offs’ aim is to impress people around them, especially a group leader, and to do so, they usually opt for talking without a stop or boasting, which distracts other members. It is a common issue in group settings as such members desire to attract attention to themselves as they might be insecure or not confident in themselves. That is why the show-offs tend to answer all the questions, even those that are not directed at them. Moreover, they can attract a leader’s attention by asking irrelevant or off-topic questions.
As a matter of fact, non-stop talking may be an obstacle for reaching a productive learning atmosphere as, eventually, people will be irritated and not have acquired any helpful knowledge during the lesson. The constant involvement of the show-offs in the educational process is likely to annoy other members so that they will develop hatred for such type of behavior (Forsyth, 2019). Furthermore, the show-offs can easily prevent the group from reaching the set aim by distracting them through their foolery and over-involvement in the whole process. Overall, such members can harm the group’s productivity and effectiveness in learning as they opt for attracting all the attention to themselves without giving other individuals opportunities to realize their potentials within the settings.
