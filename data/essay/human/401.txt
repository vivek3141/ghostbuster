Outreach Chicago is an organization providing help and services to homeless people and those underserved by already existing incorporations. The company’s main mission is to provide help and necessities to humans for their subsequent successful reintegration into society. To practice deductive reasoning, it is essential to start by formulating a general hypothesis or statement that Outreach Chicago provides help to people (Adler & Clark, 2015). The observation allows us to find evidence for the statement as Outreach Chicago serves meals and distributes hygiene kits, coats, blankets, socks, and undergarments to people in need. The company’s official site provides precise numbers of each aid type, so one can conclude that the company indeed provides help with various necessities since 2011 to people in need.
Outreach Chicago states the average poverty rate in its area of performance is 34% among adults and 51% among children (Outreach Chicago, 2022). To practice inductive reasoning, it might be useful to compare data stated by the company with the other statistical sources regarding poverty rates, checking the modernity of the information it proposes to the readers. The company works in several locations: Chicago Heights, Chicago, Cicero, Dolton, and Harvey (Outreach Chicago, 2022). The estimations, according to the site Welfare Info, relate to the following poverty rates among adults in 2017 26.4%, 20.6%, 19.8%, 26.6%, and 35.6% respectively (Poverty Illinois, 2022). The calculated average of these areas is 25.8% which means the company was either gathering data from previous years or referring to the numbers of the poorest city, Harvey.
