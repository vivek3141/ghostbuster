In the article “The influence of peers during adolescence: Does homophobic name-calling by peers change gender identity?” the authors claim that negative name-calling among peers can lead to a change in gender identity. Firstly, this is because negative experiences with peers of the same sex result in the need to identify with peers of the opposite sex. Secondly, during the period of growing up, the adolescents’ identity is not yet fully established. Therefore, they are constantly re-evaluating whether the identity formation is going in the right direction. DeLay et al. (2018) recognize that homophobia can be directed at homosexual and heterosexual adolescents. This is presumably because the purpose of victimization is to hurt someone’s feelings, not point out real flaws.
Gender identity development is a critical stage in developing a personality occurring during adolescence (DeLay et al., 2018). Since homophobic name-calling is a form of victimization, this practice should be frowned upon or banned in schools. Ioverno et al. (2021) note that “bullying GNCV may represent a defensive reaction to demonstrate bullies’ gender conformity” (p. 215). Therefore, work with bullies should be carried out competently and with the participation of a psychologist.
Interestingly, Ioverno et al. (2021) highlight how this statement is especially true for male bullies. That is because their “own gender conformity can affect the selection of victims based on their gender conformity” (p. 216). It is critical to understand this mirror interaction to resolve the issues of gender victimization. Equally important, victimization of adolescents, including LGB, trans, and heterosexual high school students may lead to “anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, especially among sexual and gender minority youth” (Valido et al., p. 602). This is another valuable observation that indicates the need for concomitant prevention practices of substance abuse among adolescents. No less important, substance abuse should be perceived as the consequence of psychological problems.
