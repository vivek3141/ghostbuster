Overpopulation in cities has become one of the most critical problems of our time. This is both an environmental and a social problem. The city cannot grow indefinitely and provide decent workplaces for every resident. The ecological burden is also increasing. Uncontrolled growth in the number of cities leads to the unchecked spread of pollution and the escalation of poverty. However, there are several preventive measures that the Government can implement to combat this problem.
First of all, overpopulation in cities is congestion and traffic jams, which lead to serious pollution problems. Atmospheric pollution is the most serious in cities, and its primary source is road transport, which emits sulfur dioxide and nitrogen into the air in huge quantities. The second main problem is poverty: disadvantaged groups in rural areas live in poverty (Innes et al., 2019). Some of them decide to settle in the city because they believe that they can easily find work. Their main goal is to provide for their family, but almost none have the necessary education for a good job. These people come to the city and become a service class. They suffer from the prejudice of indigenous people, poverty, and worse working conditions. Another inconvenience due to overcrowding is the garbage from residents, which is difficult to dispose of (Namberger et al., 2019). In many European countries, this problem is solved thanks to separate garbage collection (even in houses, there are separate garbage cans). Then some of the garbage is recycled, some are incinerated at incinerators.
In conclusion, to solve traffic and air pollution problems, people should use public transport as often as possible, rather than using their car. The government should build more roads and improve public transport to solve this problem. Poverty is now lower than at any time in human history, and all trends demonstrate that we will have consistent successes in the fight against poverty in the foreseeable future.
