The framers of the Constitution did not believe that citizens would take an active part in the political life of the country. While many freedoms were incorporated in the Constitution, its framers doubted whether people were interested enough in politics to follow its makings. It is true that in those times, information was limited; however, nowadays, mass media help people to be well-informed about political events. Moreover, the media act as a watchdog on the governmental powers (How Does the Media Affect Politics). Informational agencies report the events and let readers make their minds about them or share their views (How Does the Media Affect Politics). However, it always pays not to rely on the media too much and take pains to follow the political life of the country. They felt that everyday citizens were uninformed and did not care what was going on in our government.
I disagree that citizens are uninformed and do not care about political life. Nowadays, there are many organizations that promote civil rights and freedoms closely following the events on the political landscape of the country. People do not wait for a crisis to voice their opinions; on the contrary, citizens try to stay well-informed about what is going on (Jach & Trolian, 2022). The media, as a great source of information, facilitates this task, allowing people to have access to the latest events all over the world (Greenberg & Page, 2015). Crises as such make people more interested in politics, but there are many people who take pains to voice their opinions, notwithstanding the political or economic situation. These people deserve great respect as they act as watchdogs on the wide judicial, legislative, and executive powers vested in our politicians and judges by the laws we have adopted as a nation.
