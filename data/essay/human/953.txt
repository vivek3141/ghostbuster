Technological development is becoming the dominant factor influencing the transformation of modern society. It creates unique opportunities, opens horizons for personal growth, and contributes to the shift of the values of humanity and its social structures (Quinn, 2020). However, besides the noticeable positive transformations, technology poses a threat to civilization, and its containment, regulation, and implementation are challenging. An average person cannot stop the constant process of technological expansion, and it is impossible to conclude which way the result of specific means will go in advance (Quinn, 2020). However, it does not signify that it follows its path. People should not simply observe the industrial growth and produce everything they can or set in motion processes that lead to the destruction of natural living conditions. On the contrary, each person has a great deal of control over how to use machinery.
One of the most controversial modern technologies is artificial intelligence, the scope of which is vast. It makes it possible to track anyone offline and digitally and gain control over a considerable amount of personal data, which threatens privacy (Quinn, 2020). Furthermore, it simplifies hacking, financial fraud, and other illegal activities. On the other hand, artificial intelligence is also operated to combat these violations successfully. It can monitor and repel cyber-attacks, identify the perpetrators, and save time and resources. From this example, it can be deduced that technology has many harmful and promising applications. However, it is noteworthy that the chief property of any intellect is the ability to learn, which is not a self-governing process.
Technology cannot perform specific actions independently without prior human intervention; hence, its work and application are primarily peopleâ€™s responsibility. Therefore, individuals must be guided by values while realizing that the choice of exploitation has severe consequences (Quinn, 2020). Technology itself cannot create or destroy societal values; on the contrary, the environment in which it develops determines how it will continue to work. Significances such as the rule of law, democracy, individual liberty, and human rights are reasonable for overcoming the direct consequences of industrialization. These principles make the use of technology ethical and preserve all social benefits.
