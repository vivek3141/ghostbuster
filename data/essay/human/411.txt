Perspective is an important consideration in art, one that determines the way people look at a painting and what they see, how they see it, and how they interact with it. Additionally, it is responsible for the way people understand an image in its cultural context or intended meaning. While exploring the google arts and culture exhibit, I have been able to see a number of different religious paintings that use perspective in interesting ways. I think that the discussion of perspective is important for those both close and far from the art world, as it promotes engagement with paintings that can often be overlooked.
To narrow down my search, I have looked up “Religious painting”, and went with the results that seemed most interesting to discuss. First, I want to take a look at The Adoration of the Magi, painted by Sandro Botticelli. The image depicts people adoring a number of “wise men” who were considered to be especially important in Florence, where it was painted ( The adoration of the magi – sandro botticelli – google arts & culture ). The linear perspective allows the audience to see everything that is happening from a detached angle, taking in the scenery and understanding the importance of the event to the people depicted. While the magi are being revered by the people of Florence, the audience also understands that they are close to their followers, therefore placing them in close perspective proximity to each other.

The second image I want to discuss is Adoration of the Trinity (Landauer Altar), painted by Albrecht Dürer in 1511.

The figures made central in this painting is much more important than in the last, and the significance of the Trinity for Christian religion is enhanced with both the visual presentation and the perspective. The pose he makes is reminiscent of the crucifixion, and the father and the holy spirit are also included. We, the audience, are made to look at the Trinity from below, assuming a position of observation and awe. The difference in the way the gathered saints and the holy Trinity are framed make it clear what the central piece of the image is.
