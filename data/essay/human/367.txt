Globalization has indeed become a significant pattern in the development of geopolitical and cultural practices of recent decades. With the advent of the Internet, people have become connected, even across continents: such a powerful catalyst could not fail to have a necessary consequence. In particular, people from different countries and cultures have become more integrated into a common, emerging culture in which there is room for the traditions of all peoples. Meanwhile, the representation of different cultures in this common one is unequal, which means that stronger national cultures can absorb weaker ones.
A natural reaction to the unification of people was the growth of nationalistic sentiments among peoples whose cultures tend to be weaker. Thus, the spread of American sentiment (and especially the American dream) to the world often results in people from other regions becoming indifferent to their culture. In addition, globalization can lead to the destruction of the sovereignty of vulnerable communities: for example, if the big powers (the United States, China, Russia, Britain) suppress the development of small neighboring ones (Hawaii, Hong Kong, Abkhazia, or former British colonies). Healthy nationalism is not a problem because communities desire to protect themselves and preserve their cultural and political independence. However, radical, violent actions on the part of nationalists lead to international conflicts and inhibit globalization.
Thus, globalization should not be evaluated regarding whether it is good or bad. Instead, it should be seen as a natural milestone in the evolution of humanity. Globalization does have advantages and disadvantages, but it is a fact in and of itself. The world now finds itself incredibly integrated, as every individual can learn news from another continent, listen to foreign music, and read non-domestic literature in a matter of minutes. This results in a new, shared culture. In this state, radical nationalism is a serious problem that society and governments must confront.
