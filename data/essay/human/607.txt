The emergence of information society has sparked the further creation of multiple opportunities for revisiting the current sociocultural, socioeconomic, and sociopolitical issues. Specifically, the problem of inequities in the modern community has been established as one of the primary global concerns (Chakravartty 298). In turn, civil society organizations as the bodies that seek to address the presence of injustice have been applying additional effort to manage the observed injustice. According to the World Summit on Information Society (WSIS), the post-colonial context must be clearly understood in order to build policies based on the concept of equity.
A similar sentiment is expressed in Aginamâ€™s essay, where the author introduces an example of a situation that requires the force of WIS to address the problem of inequity. Specifically, according to Aginam, the focus on the transcultural economy and involvement of a greater range of global participants into the trade process will allow leveraging some of the existing inequalities (247). Specifically, by seeking partnerships and business expansion opportunities with foreign communities, one will be able to focus on building socioeconomic equality and raise the voices of the victims of colonialism.
The idea of supporting minority countries in the post-colonial economy with the help of WSIS and the related organizations appears to be quite promising. However, ensuring that the actions taken by the involved parties are based solely on the principles of ethics and diversity suggests introducing practical control tools. For this reason, creating a global communication channel for post-colonial communities will be necessary.
