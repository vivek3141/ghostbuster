A mutation is a change in the genome of an organism. Most commonly, mutations are defined as changes in DNA structure that occur due to disruption of the sequence of genes or the emergence of new genes. In this paper, I would like to talk about spontaneous mutations. Spontaneous mutations occur by chance â€“ for example if a sheep is suddenly born in a flock of sheep with shorter legs; such mutations can also occur in humans. The ADRB1 gene, for example, is responsible for regulating the amount of sleep a person needs each night to function properly. Most humans need eight hours of sleep or more, but about 5% of the population enjoys a slightly different mutant version. Tests done on a mother and daughter who had the mutation revealed the ability to sleep only 4 to 6 hours each night (Servick, 2019). This mutation refers to a type of genomic mutation. The protein encoded by the mutation is a receptor for norepinephrine.
This mutation is dominant, autosomal, and beneficial in its effect on the viability of individuals. Changes in the ADRB1 gene occur primarily in humans. However, they can also be in animals, although no studies have yet been conducted. Such a mutation does not affect the human population in the general world. This is mainly due to the fact that it is not dangerous and is not life-threatening to its carriers. Thus, such a mutation is only a positive addition to the life abilities of a human carrier. This mutation is sporadic and is not a dominant trend in population genome changes despite its dominance. I find this example interesting because natural changes in the human genome open up new possibilities for the population. Thus, studying such changes is essential for human development and a deeper study of human capabilities.
