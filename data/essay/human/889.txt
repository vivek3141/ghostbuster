In humanism and human rights, personal dignity implies respect and a sense of worth and value inherent in every human being. In medical care and clinical ethics, this concept is associated with respect for the patient’s health, physical and psychological, as well as their emotional state, privacy, and self-perception (Kadivar, Mardani-Hamooleh & Kouhnavard, 2018). In a clinical setting, patients may feel dependent and vulnerable (Crump, 2019). It is a vital part of the professional values ​​of nursing to ensure the preservation of patients’ dignity and develop a delicate and respectful approach to healthcare (Sæteren & Nåden, 2021). The challenge to advocating for dignity in the medical environment is that patients and caregivers do not always have a universal understanding of human dignity. Its concept changes depending on the person and the circumstances. The promotion of human dignity is essential in the care of palliative and end-of-life patients who require special treatment and an attentive approach. Thus, nurses play a critical role in providing the environment and protecting the personal dignity of their patients.
In nursing, the fundamental principles of healthcare include ensuring respectful, positive, and kind treatment of patients and dealing with their stress, nervousness, or fear with understanding and empathy. Handling the patient requires the nurse to have emotional intelligence, compassion, and commitment while performing all medical procedures in a timely and professional manner (Crump, 2019). Particular attention should be followed with aged patients. Sometimes, preserving the human dignity of retired patients is associated with providing them with a sense of greater autonomy and support. In many cases, elderly patients need intense listening and choice. A friendly and respectful conversation and a personal approach will help to establish such interaction.
