The introduction of project management standards is vital for any organization as it will improve collaboration between employees and goal achievement. Thus, the recommended strategy focuses on creating the roadmap for the project. It should imply working with interim goals and a final purpose (Kerzner, 2017). Thus, the standards should include improved teamwork, the discussion between team members, and the attainment of high standards and outcomes via collaborative effort. The first standard is critical for any organization as an aligned work of teams is vital for their evolution. The employees should be provided with the opportunity and tools to create high-performance groups and engage in interaction and decision-making. For instance, Basecamp can be employed as an application to create a platform for workers to discuss current tasks and share information (Biafore, 2020). Adding them to specific groups will help to distribute tasks and attain outlined standards.
Moreover, the collaborative effort can be managed by creating clear lists of deliverables and presenting them to teams. Providing them with information about current goals and tasks will result in higher awareness and better distribution of responsibilities, which is vital for meeting new standards and promoting positive outcomes. In such a way, the recommended strategy implies focusing on improving group work and introducing standards such as cooperation and collaboration by using available tools, such as Basecamp. It will allow individuals to discuss various aspects of their work, share information related to specific goals, and create smaller teams regarding the existing requirements (Kerzner, 2017). Following the given strategy, it is possible to achieve significant improvement in performance and ensure the company will move forward to achieving new goals.
