In the survey The Effect Of Work Relationships On Organizational Culture And Commitment, as many as 89% of respondents confirmed that communication with colleagues affects the quality of life (Suhardi, 2020). It also turned out that if a person has at least one friend at work, it connects him more strongly with the company and supports his desire to stay in this place. Feeling connected to other people supports employeesâ€™ interest and involvement in work. Talking to colleagues, a person gradually gets rid of the fear of expressing their ideas and comments.
Scientists from the University of Michigan conducted an interesting experiment, Friends (and Sometimes Enemies) With Cognitive Benefits: What Types of Social Interactions Boost Executive Functioning? The participants were divided into two groups: first, the first group subjects had to get to know each other for 10 minutes. And the second group was asked to participate in disputes among themselves on a certain topic. Then all the subjects were asked to solve several cognitive tasks. The experiment participants from the first group, who had previously just communicated in a relaxed atmosphere, showed the best results in solving problems. They had significant improvements in the executive functions of the brain. These processes are responsible for planning, concentration, prioritization, and organization. In other words, for the skills and qualities that we need to work.
