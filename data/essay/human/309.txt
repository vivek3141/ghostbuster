Elements
Diamonds by Rihanna was first heard on Elvis Duran Show on September 26, 2012, availed for online download an hour after being released to the public, and was released as the album’s lead single the following day. Sia wrote the song for Rihanna, who holds the song’s copyrights and worked on it a year prior; therefore, the song is owned by an independent contractor (Anggraini 12). Unapologetic is Barbadian artist Rihanna’s seventh studio album, and the song “Diamonds” appears on it (Anggraini 7). Using Sia’s demo vocals as a guide, Rihanna imitated her inflections to the precise tiniest detail. It was only after Benny Blanco heard the finished track to the Australian songwriter did, she realize the vocals belonged to her alone.
Inspiration
In Diamonds , Rihanna contemplated the existence of both love and diamonds: “Yellow diamonds in the light. To make things even more awkward, we’re standing next to each other. You cross my path as your shadow does.” The diamonds in the song symbolize a silver lining that illustrates the chance for a better future and happier days among dark and depressing days. The song made me think about all the possibilities available when things do not turn out to be as I expected.
I also chose the song because its presentation, which was both positive and hopeful, and I am always in a good mood when I listen to it. It is also quite inspirational because it encourages listeners to love themselves. Since its launch, the song has won multiple awards and has enjoyed massive success for years. For Rihanna’s career, the song gave a great boost because it was quite catchy and everyone could recognize it from the very first minutes of it playing.
