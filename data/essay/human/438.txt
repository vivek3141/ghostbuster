The definition of the HOPES (Homicide Outreach Project Empowering Survivors) as a necessary tool for individuals that experience this form of attack is accurate. Karmen indicates that victims have a profile and are likely to get attacked in the future if they do not develop a protection system (Karmen, 2020). Individuals in big cities and near them have a higher chance of experiencing one form of violence such as robbery or homicide when compared to people that live at a farther distance from these locales. Programs such as HOPES provide these individuals with answers to troubling questions involving why the cases are more rampant in their locale. It is also important to consider the potential for these programs to illustrate the safety level of a particular location based on activities such as drug trafficking and police presence. This information is critical in enabling possible victims to make logical decisions concerning their living conditions and predisposing them to various forms of violence.
The writer asserts that the criminal justice system does not protect victims against possible repeat attacks. It is important to discern that women are considered rape victims in most instances. One should note that studies such as those conducted by Kopel in 1987(Karmen, 2020) do not focus on male victims, illustrating the flawed nature of this system. While males encompass a section of this population, they are not listed in the statistics. It is also crucial to note that black individuals are more prone to experience any form of crime when compared to their white counterparts (Karmen, 2020). Discerning such information allows programs such as HOPES to target particular communities and neighborhoods while providing aid.
