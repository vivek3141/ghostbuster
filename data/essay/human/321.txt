The introduced Canadian perspective on the provisional agenda of the North Atlantic Council seems to cover key points that concern Canadian security. Increased presence in the world peace operations and maintenance of tight relationships with other NATO members, especially remarkable is the smart defense approach that considers the military and economic needs of Canada. Although, it is difficult to judge the extent of the Syrian threat to Canadian interest during the outbreak of coronavirus, which seems to continue even today. Therefore, it would be essential to review the proposed question for a more effective approach to the defense of Canadian interests. Nevertheless, this act protects the interest of both Israel and Canada and will positively impact their relationship. Furthermore, it is notable how the Canadian government is willing to cooperate with the withdrawal of troops from Iraq if the official request were to be made. This statement in itself is probably a contribution to the international image of Canadian humanitarianism, but the extent of such image improvement is questionable.
The focus on building trading relationships and close ties with other NATO countries could be seen as the most important aspect that Israel might acknowledge. Israelâ€™s national security has experienced decades of varying threats, which included terrorism, missiles, and existential nuclear dangers (Freilich, 2018). However, the former national security strategy (NSS) is non-existent in the country as the first document of NSS was developed in 1953 (Freilich, 2018). Nevertheless, the country is more secure than ever before due to the political and military bonds it forms active trade agreements with various powerful countries such as the USA, China, Russia, Germany, Canada, Poland, and India (Freilich, 2018). Currently, the country exhibits great regional power and is able to prosper due to the seven-decades-old strategy.
