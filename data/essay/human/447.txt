The article highlighted multiple reasons why women chose to be child-free. These include the desire to succeed from an academic and professional perspective, financial reasons, a lack of natural desires, and the understanding that a child would not enhance their life but rather make it more difficult (Sandler).
There were a couple of things that I canâ€™t entirely agree with. The choice of a woman to be in a serious relationship with a man with a 15-year-old daughter without taking even minimal parental responsibilities appears to be inconsiderate for the young girl both from the perspective of the childfree woman and the father who accepts such conditions. Moreover, the statement that women are not more pressured into having children due to the possibilities does not correlate with the previous standards in which women who did not get married and have children had almost no opportunities in society.
Based on the materials I have read, I would say that being child-free is a choice that everyone can make depending on the life goals and aspirations of the person. On the one hand, a woman may be happy building a solid career and not have any desire to make changes for a child, which makes it unreasonable to have one unless love and care can be provided. On the other hand, the majority of women are still opting to have children despite the possible difficulties that correlate with motherhood, including financial, professional, and social problems. However, since every woman is different and living in a modern world means being able to make a choice, having or not having children is an individual decision that every person is to make based on their own life experiences and overviews.
