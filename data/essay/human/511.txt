Studying the literature of various heads can not only bring new knowledge about the past times. Literary sources can also provide valuable information about what views people have on such aspects of life as love, human relationships, or faith. Therefore, Søren Kierkegaard’s in his work “Fear and Trembling” conveys his unique vision of religion, which in some way differs from conventional faith. Thus, this work examines the concept of faith and its connection with morality and reasoning in the work of the Danish philosopher.
In his work, Kierkegaard tries to answer the question about the nature and true meaning of faith in human life. With his works, the philosopher made a unique contribution to such disciplines as theology, philosophy, and literature (Noble, 2017). Moreover, in his writings, the author gave a new look at the biblical figures in order to highlight their relevance in modern times. According to the Danish philosopher, Christianity carries paradoxes that are offensive to the mind (“Søren Kierkegaard,” 2017). The most important contradiction is following the opinion that the eternal God can simultaneously become a time-limited human being. Søren Kierkegaard determined that morality is a duty to God only if the Almighty determines it. Unlike the generally accepted Christian faith, where it is a divine ethical duty to treat everyone.
In conclusion, this scientific paper considered Søren Kierkegaard’s work “Fear and Trembling.” Its peculiarity is that it represents an exceptional view of morality and reasoning. In addition, one of the differences from conventional faith is the opinion that according to the philosopher, if a person chooses faith, then they should not remove their mind. In fact, the author believed that individuals should believe in the absurd.
