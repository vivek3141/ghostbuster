The Grand Canyon is one of the most grandiose sightseeing spots in the world. It took quite some time to discover and explore this natural work of art due to the structure’s immense size. Over time, the Grand Canyon became one of the symbols of the United States and the State of Arizona in particular. It is crucial to investigate the past of the Grand Canyon in order to realize its potential and see how this natural wonder could affect human lives beyond traveling and sightseeing. The current paper will conduct a thorough study of three articles on the topic of the Grand Canyon to validate that idea.
First, it must be noted that the history and culture of Americans living in the area are directly connected to the Grand Canyon. For example, Sara Maverick suggested that the rich human history could not be left behind since Native American tribes and numerous miners and archaeologists visited and explored the Grand Canyon throughout the years (“The Grand Canyon,” 2022). Maverick talked about how the Anasazi became one of the biggest groups to populate the Grand Canyon in an attempt to protect themselves from nomads. Nevertheless, it is believed that a severe drought has forced the Anasazi to leave their houses carved inside the Grand Canyon (“The Grand Canyon,” 2022). The rich history of mining also haunts this natural wonder to this day, as some of the mines located in the Grand Canyon produced silver, copper, and uranium oxide.
Conversely, one should pay attention to the geological history of the Grand Canyon and appreciate its natural features. For instance, Marisol West dwelled on the presence of 2-billion-year-old rocks at the bottom of the Grand Canyon (“The Grand Canyon,” 2022). As a result of a powerful erosion, the Grand Canyon remains a gigantic reminder of the previous eras when natural calamities were much more severe and powerful. The fact that the Grand Canyon is still home to the Navajo Indians shows how the natural state of the structure was preserved. Every geologic event that occurred since the first settlements of the Anasazi shaped the Grand Canyon in a number of unique ways that are visible to today’s tourists (“The Grand Canyon,” 2022). Thus, numerous floods and erosions only made the Grand Canyon even more grandiose than before.
The Grand Canyon National Park supported the ultimate topic of discussion that has to be covered. Park team members described the South Rim of the Grand Canyon as one of the most important landscapes across the natural wonder (“Grand Canyon,” 2022). It can be noted that there are various flora and fauna species populating the canyon area, from the gray-green forests to gopher snakes. Even though precipitation on the South Rim is severely limited (approximately 15 inches per annum), some of the animals and plants easily survive the heat and the lack of water. In order to see all of the unique species, visitors have to use their receptors carefully.
Overall, it is safe to say that the Grand Canyon truly affects humans beyond being a sightseeing spot and a natural wonder. For many scientists and research enthusiasts, the Grand Canyon is going to remain an unremitting source of knowledge. Many visitors would be amazed by the history of the Anasazi and the Navajo Indians who lived and still live inside the Grand Canyon, respectively. Hence, the Grand Canyon is an impressive natural wonder that appeals to everyone.
