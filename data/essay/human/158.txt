Modification of personal computers required the development of more complex hardware and software. For example, buses, which are the communication channels between different internal components and peripheral devices, have become more advanced. Such three types of buses as address, control, and data are known (Farret et al., 2017). The latter is utilized for data exchange between the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and peripherals (Farret et al., 2017). The significance of the address bus is to assist the CPU in locating specific information in the memory, while the control bus regulates data processing. Data buses are represented as a multiple of two and currently include five types: 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 (Farret et al., 2017). These numbers indicate the bits of data that can be delivered simultaneously, and the larger ones allow for a more significant amount of information to be processed at a time.
The number of parallel lines in a processor defines how many electrical signals can be exchanged between peripherals and the CPU. The most common operating systems on modern computers are 32 and 64-bit microprocessors. A 32-bit data bus contains thirty-two parallel lines between different structures. In contrast, a 64-bit data bus consists of sixty-four lines, allowing it to run twice as many data exchange processes (Farret et al., 2017). Hence, the fundamental difference between these two types of data buses is the speed at which they can process information. Similarly, the pace at which older versions run data depends on the number of paralleled copper wires between the CPU and other internal parts. Indeed, all these buses have one common function of interchanging data, but they vary in the rate at which operations are transferred due to their structural differences.
