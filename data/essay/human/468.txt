The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka is a great story about a young man who transforms into a bug and is imprisoned in his own chamber as a result of apples thrown at him sticking in his casing. Georg Samka awakens in a surrealistic dream world, and he receives no sympathy from anyone, despite the fact that he has sacrificed his own aspirations for years so that his sister might study music at the Conservatory. His family members’ reactions to him and how they choose to deal with the situation betray their relationships with him, revealing what they actually feel about the young man.
While Gregor’s family has never shown affection for him, they did at least treat him as a human before his transformation; following his transformation, they have become progressively nasty and aloof. Gregor’s family tolerates him before his transformation since he takes over as the family’s breadwinner. They don’t have a particularly warm connection, but at least they show him some respect so that he may continue to support them. When they suspect he’ll be late for work, they double-check to make sure he arrives. When his father tries to wake his kid up, even if he doesn’t work, he has a warning in his voice.
His sister is the only one of his family that comes to his aid, inquiring if he is ill. She instantly tries to console and assist him in any way she can. Grete, the sister, begins collecting goods that she feels he will be interested in after his metamorphosis so that he can eat and feel comfortable, such as rotting vegetables, cheese, old leftovers, and hardened bones. Mrs. Samsa, his mother, is troubled by the transition, overcome with emotion and despair. She does her hardest to comfort and assist him, but she can’t stand looking at him. She tries her hardest to behave motherly in her sadness, but she has a hard time overcoming his appearance. Mr. Samsa, Gregor’s father, is unpleasant and rude to the point of becoming abusive. Mr. Samsa has grown accustomed to Gregor providing for his family by working for a living and paying for their survival. He is enraged at the shift, particularly since it means Gregor will no longer be able to assist them.
All the family members started to mistreat him after his transformation. With a newspaper, his father pursues him back into the room. Gregor’s father injures him later by throwing a piece of fruit at him, which causes an illness. Since Gregor can no longer work, his parents and sister have all taken up jobs to supplement his income. Grete, too, gradually loses sympathy for her brother. She was most likely his closest family member, yet caring for him is a strain for her. She eventually informs her parents that she wants Gregor gone. He determines that the best thing he can do for them is to die, and he does so.
To conclude, Gregor’s metamorphosis reflects a true approach of his family members to him. With the transformation, Gregor illustrates that he had a wish to be free of the duties that should be his father’s, his dislike for his profession and the drudgery that comes with it. His transformation shows Gregor’s anger towards family’s exploitation of him and their irresponsibility in not contributing to the family income.
