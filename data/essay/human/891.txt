Environmental protection has been at the forefront of people’s minds for a number of years recently, with a lot of effort going into protecting and conserving the planet we all live on. The reduction in personal waste, as well as systematic change both work towards the same goal of reducing carbon emissions and protecting the sanctity of natural resources. Many politicians and activists notice and understand the importance climate action has on securing a future for the entire human population. However, there are also significant problems that still have to be solved, many of which might uproot the entire foundation of modern economy. For the most prime example, it is interesting to explore the fossil fuel industry. The term used to describe a combination of oil and petroleum-related businesses, fossil fuel has been continuously cited as being dangerous for the planet.

The acquisition of oil, as shown by research, as well as its processing, emits gasses into the atmosphere, creating pollution. In addition, oil fuels cars and other types of vehicles, all of which contribute to the global pool of CO2 emissions. 2018 research has cited fossil fuels and the connected industries as 89% of the reason responsible for global CO2 output ( Fossil fuels and climate change: The Facts ). This means that a number of companies and organizations involved in this industry have an incredibly large influence over the wellbeing and prosperity of the planet. Furthermore, it has been noted that the oil firms knew and understood their own impact even in the past. As shown by investigations, the members of the fossil fuel industry with political power have been pushing against clean air legislation for years, all in an effort to protect their profits ( Oil firms knew decades ago fossil fuels posed grave health risks, files reveal 2021). The presently existing setting puts a small minority of people responsible for the problems the rest of humanity has to solve, which becomes a point of contention for many.
All people live on the same planet, and protecting the environment is important. To breathe clean air, have fresh water, and to be able to enjoy nature’s wonders, we have made progress in restoring and conserving different parts of the Earth. However, there are still many problems people have not managed to solve, many of which are extremely important. Fuels that cars, planes, rockets and many other modes of transportation run on are made from oil. Oil is drilled from the earth, processed and shipped all across the globe for sale. However, scientists and experts now say that this process is dangerous to the planet and its inhabitants. By working with oil, big companies create pollution, one which makes the air quality worse and has the potential to affect the quality of water as well. The dangers associated with fuel industries and their work might have to be overlooked if people want to protect their planet. Furthermore, experts have found out that many working in oil firms have lied about the potential harm their work does, and tried their best to prevent politicians from regulating it. It is more important than ever for people to talk about and consider the dangers fossil-based fuels present to the world. To move towards a better future, society might have to change their preferred methods of transport, and the way they lead their lives altogether.
