Summary of Services
Hand and Voice is one of the organizations in the world whose main agenda is to support and open opportunities to those who have auditory problems. The organization’s goals are anchored in that communication among vulnerable groups is vital, just like normal people. Therefore, through experts, the organization trains the deaf sign languages and extends the courtesy by finding them opportunities (Hands & Voices, 2022). A good example of a Hand and Voice organization is the American Society for Deaf Children, whose attention supports families living with deaf children. This is done through training and creating awareness in the community. The organization has taken and given hope to these families, takes responsibility for educating both the families and the deaf individuals, and provided researched information about handling the deaf. Moreover, the Hand and Voices, through partners, have opened several opportunities for this group and are providing vital resources that are basics for the existence of the deaf.
