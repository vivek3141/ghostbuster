Everyone has read detective stories at least once in their life or watched detective programs on TV. Sometimes it could be seen that the heroes of the works use so-called indented writings. These writings can be on the second, third, and so on pages, depending on the pressure on the writing subject, that is, a pen or pencil. Even though such records are difficult to see, the examiners still have the experience and specialized equipment to ensure that this concealment was revealed.
Indented writing is invisible indentations in the sheets of paper located under the page on which the information was initially written. Indented writing can help solve a case, as it often has the information necessary for the investigation (Girard, 2017). In order to see the inscriptions, one can use a pencil, but for forensic experts, it is an unprofessional tool that can only harm the evidence. Indented entries often do not match the information written on the surface of the original document.
To open the information, specialists use various professional equipment. It includes a device for a laboratory that works to restore documents with indents. In addition, a photographic method is used, which is based on sliding light, and an electrostatic detection device is also used (Girard, 2017). Naturally, specialists must have the necessary skills and knowledge to detect information written using indentation. Moreover, the use of a soft pencil or copy paper can spoil essential details, and therefore the use of these methods of amateur examination is prohibited.
In conclusion, indented writing is a common practice in the criminal world. When writing with indents, the necessary information remains hidden since it is invisible and is printed on the pages following the original. With this tool, one can hide many important and personal data. To detect the inscriptions, specialists are needed and equipment that will allow the records to be declassified and not damage the evidence.
