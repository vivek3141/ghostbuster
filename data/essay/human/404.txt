Childhood has the most direct impact on a person’s adult life since it is the first step in the socialization process. Unfortunately, not all parents understand effective methods of upbringing, do not realize the value of a favorable environment for the child’s independence, and neglect the appearance of the youth’s emotional anticipation. It is a severe issue that requires broadening the knowledge of the theoretical bases of the family relations structure. One alternative that can promote the growth of skills and erudition of parents is studying online resources. Parenthub is a quality option with a sufficient amount of theory and approaches of its practical application to promote children’s mental and physical health.
Parenthub is a resource that provides access to materials on interacting with children from their conception to adulthood. One can read about pregnancy, parenting, psychology, children’s education, family connections, eating habits, and householding. Complex relationships between kids and their parents are always psychological and mental trauma, which can provoke severe depression and destroy the most fundamental instinct – self-preservation (Idris & Ahmad, 2020). The online resource contributes to the solution of this concern at the early stages when contact is just being constructed, and approaches to family links can still be modified.
For a child, the household is the primary environment for living, developing, and becoming a whole person. Kids learn to recognize the world, grasping the basic mechanisms of cognition and interpersonal relationships from the family (Chen et al., 2022). Therefore, the relationship with parents determines the basic skills, abilities, and psychological qualities, since children are imitators, beginning to learn the basics of communication from infancy. However, not all parents understand the vital role of contact and often inadequately assess the child’s activities. They do not support the youngsters’ self-esteem, have hardship determining their emotional state, and cannot establish a partner connection.
Parenthub offers access to numerous resources on childrearing to construct a strong relationship. It provides articles from experts in diverse fields, from medicine and psychology to physical education and nutrition. Thus, this Internet resource supplies comprehensive parenting training and promotes an understanding of the child’s peculiarities in the different stages of growing up. In addition, there is the possibility of an open forum so that everyone can share their own experiences or ask for help from those who have already experienced upbringing hardships. The site is split into categories, and therefore the search is quick and efficient. One can search for the necessary materials by keyword or read all the available information, divided according to kids’ age. The functionality of the Internet resource is comprehensive, and the level of maneuverability is high, which contributes to the convenient use and activity of visitors.
Thus, the parent-child relationship is crucial for forming a complete personality. The website provides filtered and expertly approved information on topics of concern. It offers quality training in building competent communication with the child, from birth to adulthood. Moreover, this resource is vital for nurses, who need to understand that children’s health, growth, and development occur in the context of their connection with parents. Health is either maintained or put at risk through this association because it is a bonding and unifying element that affects later life directly (Walters, 2022). The family environment influences the interaction process, and the nurse must consider the uniqueness and history of each family. This will promote quality care and provide the respect and maintenance that meets the patient’s needs.
In conclusion, it is challenging to overemphasize the role of the family, which is among the most critical values for the individual in the formation of personality and health. It affects the child’s future success and condition strongly, so it is necessary to make efforts and increase knowledge to build competent parent-child communication. To get a qualified theoretical foundation, one can use the services of the Parenthub website, which combines opportunities for learning and live communication with experts and other parents.
