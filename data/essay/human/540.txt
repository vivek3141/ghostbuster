An initial reaction rate is an instant rate at the beginning of the response. The graph has the y and x-axis, y stands for the concentration of moles per liter, and x stands for time in seconds. In this case, the chemical reaction is going against time; at the beginning of the response, the chemical concentration is very high, hence considered a positive reaction. As time goes by, the slope decreases, giving a negative curve; therefore, the reactant concentration reduces within an interval of time.
Instantaneous rate is an instant rate in time with differential rate, the reactant against time. The instant calculation is by determining the negativity of the slope and the curve for the concentration of the moles per liter against time in seconds (Du et al., 2021 p 3154). Rate is equal to the negativity of the slope over time in seconds; this brings the instant rate and the difference between them, which gives the instantaneous rate.
The reaction rate calculates the average over a time interval by dividing the moles’ concentration change per liter overtime per seconds’ period by time interval. Getting average is by observing the difference in the reactant’s concentration using the equation where the brackets mean the attention of the reactant. A minus sign applies when the rate is of a positive number from the previous equation. Nevertheless, the minus sign is not needed to calculate the used products’ average rates. Getting the average from B to G is by adding all the concentration intervals and dividing them from B to G to get the standard. To conclude, at the beginning of the reaction at point A and time 0, the concentration of moles per liter was high, while at point G, the engagement was low.
