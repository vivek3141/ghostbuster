Robert Williams, the defendant had escaped out of a mental hospital and resided in Des Moines YMCA. A 10 years girl was reported missing in a wrestling match in YMCA. Williams became the main suspect of the young girls’ abduction after a young boy confessed to have seen him at the YMCA packing his car a large bundle of clothes with “skinny and white legs” on the same day the girl was missing. Williams turned himself in and was ready to confess only in the presence of his attorney in Des Moines. The investigating officer who drove him to Des Moines knew he was very religious and told Williams that the girl deserved a “Christian burial.” William responded with implicating assertions that led police to the young girls’ body. Williams was charged with first-degree murder and jailed.
Was the sixth amendment suppressed denying the defendant right to counsel?
Yes, the defendants’ right of counsel was suppressed during the jurisdiction process. The defendant was subject to an interrogative environment when the investigator was talking to Williams in absence of his lawyer (Brewer v. Williams, 1977). The defendant was mentally challenged and the police statement drew out incriminating statements leading to his induction. The evidence was wrongly collected and revealed at trial because the defendant’s right to counsel was violated.
The case was determined at the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision and majority opinion held that adversary proceedings had started in absence of the defendants’ counsel violating the Sixth Amendments’ rights (Brewer v. Williams, 1977). The Supreme Court also assumed that the officer who raised the “Christian burial” topic was deliberately violated Williams rights. This is because the officer had written a concordance statement not interrogate the suspect on his way to meet with his lawyer. Robert William was exonerated since the evidence used against him was wrongfully admitted in the court.
