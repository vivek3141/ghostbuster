With thrombosis of the lower extremities’ veins, blood clots or blood clots form cavities, which interfere with the normal movement of blood. Over time, they can clog the venous lumen and even come off, ending in the heart, lungs, and other organs (Dalen, 2016). Unfortunately, it is often impossible to timely determine the initial symptoms of thrombosis of the leg vessels. However, if the skin changes color and swelling occurs where the blood clot is located, these are signs of vascular disease.
When thrombosis progresses, its symptoms appear: acute pain and heaviness in the patient’s legs. These symptoms are provoked by the venous congestion below the site of thrombosis. The main causes of the disease’s development are blood clotting and damage to the vein wall (Thachil & Bagot, 2018). In addition, long journeys and old age exacerbate the risk of serious problems. It is also possible that the patient is taking medications that increase blood clotting, so it is necessary to ask him about this to be sure of the diagnosis.
Ways to make an accurate diagnosis include duplex scanning, radiopaque phlebography, MRI, or CT. The combination of these methods will most accurately determine the severity and nature of the disease. After that, a doctor can prescribe a suitable treatment. Of the drugs, it can be injections of heparin and capsules of anticoagulants. If these methods do not help, then thrombolysis is necessary, which promotes resorption of blood clots. With the most severe outcome, surgery will be required. Undoubtedly, this is the last thing to do since it is always important to use all the other methods before making it. It may also be dangerous in the age of the considered patient. Thus, it is vital to use other methods and try to avoid any harmful consequences. Not only this will help cure thrombosis, but also save patient’s life.
