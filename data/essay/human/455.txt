God is the highest judge who evaluates people according to their actions fairly; if people pray and believe in him, he heals and provides what he desires. At the same time, atheists maintain that God does not exist because there are still wars and acts of terrorism in which innocent victims are murdered (Krause & Ironson, 2019). This is not consistent with what can be found in the scriptures and the Bible. It can be argued that the Lord is the supervisor; once there is doubt about the existence of this guard, a man who is a potential malefactor is capable of anything.
Although, Godâ€™s tribunal is not the only tribunal before which a person can hold accountable. Hence, if God did not exist, people would still be restrained by other factors, but in combination, heavenly and earthly potential punishments act as restraining forces against omnipotent conduct. It is essential to mention Polytheism and the Christian religion, where the concepts of good and evil are different. For example, magic is forbidden by the Lord, but permitted in pagan rituals (Krause & Ironson, 2019). At the same time, Christianity creates the single fair rules for everyone, but Polytheism is the privilege of certain individuals and donned by the forces of the gods, which is not equitable.
