Thyroiditis is considered to be an illness that is connected to inflammation and affection of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland, formed on the front side of the neck and underneath the laryngeal prominence, produces hormones that regulate metabolism. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, postnatal thyroiditis, and subacute thyroiditis are the most prevalent types of thyroiditis discussed by practitioners and researchers (Quintero et al., 2021). Thyroid dysfunction manifests itself in a triphasic illness pattern in the majority of cases of thyroiditis (Quintero et al., 2021). Referring to the categorization of particular phases, subacute thyroiditis is a well-known clinical disease that generally develops several weeks following viral infection (Franquemont & Galvez, 2021). Hashimoto thyroiditis is an immune illness that can emerge as hypothyroidism with or without indications, including a painless thyroid problem, and is linked to increased thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (Quintero et al., 2021). Individuals with Hashimoto thyroiditis and observable hypothyroidism are usually prescribed thyroid hormone treatment for the rest of their lives (Quintero et al., 2021). When a woman’s thyroid part starts being irritated after giving birth, it is known as postpartum thyroiditis.
Treatment of thyroiditis should be concentrated on specific symptoms and manifestations. Screening, observation, and medical follow-up are suggested in all instances of thyroiditis to evaluate alterations in thyroid function (Quintero et al., 2021). Acute symptoms can be treated, and thyroid function will normally recover and remain stable over time (Franquemont & Galvez, 2021). A common technique for diagnosing thyroiditis is to palpate the thyroid gland throughout a medical assessment.
