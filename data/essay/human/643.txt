The action in the series took place in the Bronx in 1977. At first sight, it may seem just a story about a teen, Zeke, who tries to impress the girl he loves, Mylene, who does not respond to him since she is obsessed with singing. However, even the first episode may make the audience think about the problems in American society in the middle of the 20th century. It shows the difficulties that the citizens of poor districts faced, such as the lack of money and jobs and the high level of criminalization. Apart from that, the first series shows the difference in views young people and their parents have. It is shown in the conflict between Mylene, eager to become a famous pop singer, and her father, who acknowledges only religious songs (Luhrmann, 2016). The conflict escalates as Mylene goes to the club to show the record to the producer, ignoring her father’s prohibition.
Finally, the episode title, Where there is ruin, there is hope for a treasure , makes the audience reflect on the kind of treasure that may be guarded in ruins. The series’ main characters, Zeke, Mylene, Shaolin, and others, are extremely talented. Zeke writes touching lyrics, Mylene has a beautiful voice, and Shaolin has the spirit of a leader and can join people. However, it will be hard for them to pave their way in the music area because they come from a poor district and have no connections in the field.
