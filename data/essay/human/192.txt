The influence of social networks is increasing, pushing traditional media to second place. In particular, Twitter platform has become an influential tool for obtaining current information and even conducting debates on various topics. However, tweets can also be different and may or not impact society. This paper examines the Australian politician Bill Shorten’s tweet concerning the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Although the politician reports a joyful event in his message, he also expressed regrets about the current policy, limiting the NDIS activity.
This tweet is meant to be both informative and grievance. At the same time, the author reports that the girl received assistance thanks to NDIS funding but also regrets that this was possible only after public coverage of the situation. As a result, Shorten deplores the current policy of the Australian government because of which NDIS has limited capacity to help people. While his tweet simultaneously has both negative and positive messages, it can have a positive impact. Criticism from an influential politician can draw attention to the problem and call on society and government to solve it.
Several signs indicate the impact of the investigated tweet is. According to Casero-Ripollés (2020), activity, popularity, and authority are the main signs of influence. This post received 209 retweets, 50 comments, and 858 likes – such activity for a poorly discussed topic is quite a significant influence. However, the popularity of the issue is low, and in relation to the population of Australia, such indicators are small. Assessing authority, one can say that Shorten as a politician, is aware and concerned about the topic and has experience and knowledge to express an authoritative opinion. Thus, the tweet may be influential in discussing the activities of NDIS but not on the national scale.
