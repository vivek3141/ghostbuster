Hewlett Packard (HP) has a matrix organizational structure, which implies the distribution of responsibilities based on the different products that the company offers. In particular, in a matrix structure, there are usually two lines of command: one responsible for the functional line, and the other for the product or project line (Iyer, 2021). Within an organization, there are various divisions that interact with each other and are responsible to functional managers ( Working together , n.d). Within divisions, there is also a hierarchy of employees and managers. The image of the HP organizational structure, which was modified in 1975, is shown in Figure 1.
