Summary of Services
Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD) is an organization that is determined to handle individuals affected by ADHD. The organization was founded in 1987 following the rampant frustration and isolation that parents experienced due to ADHD-affected children. There were no agencies and groups to intervene for families with children affected by ADHD during this time. Therefore, CHADD came into existence with the primary aim of changing ADHD situations, which most people misunderstood as a ‘behavior problem.’ The organization acknowledges ADHD as a potentially serious disorder yet treatable.
CHADD is creating an overornament both for children and adults affected by ADHD (CHADD, 2022). This is a Maryland-based organization supporting people enduring the effects of the condition. One of the organization’s activities is enhancing children’s education services and accommodations in regular classrooms.
The organization holds that children affected by ADHD have the right to education just like other normal children. Moreover, through an awareness campaign, the organization has created a favorable environment in workplaces for people suffering from this condition. The history report of the organization reveals that one parent group in Florida grew dramatically and was ranked the leading non-profit national organization intervening for children and adults affected by ADHD.
