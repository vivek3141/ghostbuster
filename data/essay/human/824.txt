Any change in social life patterns has the potential to impact criminal patterns. With Covid-19, while shoplifting rates have declined by 75 percent in some places throughout America, the surge of the virus has resulted in Coronavirus-related scum (Deloitte, 2020). A significant number of criminal activities has shifted, and as technology advances, some of the potential future crimes will entail surveillance. Law enforcement agencies will have challenges with legal requirements and privacy issues in operating vehicles that demand law enforcement agency compliance (Fortenbery, 2016). Law enforcement agencies will be forced to regulate surveillance when conducting data collection and item transportation operations. Another potential criminal analysis issue will be DNA testing (Fortenbery, 2016). Technology advancements have combined several existing approaches in massively parallel sequencing (MPS). With the procedure, the capacity to sequence DNA has become more accurate and efficient, and criminals might use various evidence types and techniques to interfere with samples (Fortenbery, 2016). DNA processing advances combined with increased known sample databases will offer future criminal analysis challenges for law enforcement agencies.
One smartphone app that connects police departments with their constituents is SceneDoc, which enables police officers to gather notes, view constituentsâ€™ case files, issue citations, and complete FBR reports. The app provides a faster and more precise experience, richer information, and enhanced police safety while in the field (inTime, n.d.). The other law smartphone app that connect police to their constituents is USCop which provides law enforcement officers with over 1,400 content pages on training articles, case law resources, accident investigation formulas, law enforcement training modules, and pill identifiers, among others (inTime, n.d.). The other apps, by mention, comprise Miranda Warnings/Rights, PoliceOne App, First Aid App, Scanner 911, Notecam, InTime Scheduling App, Early Bird Alarm Clock, and Police Spanish Guide.
