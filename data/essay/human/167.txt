Diabetes of type 1 usually develops due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells in genetically predisposed individuals. The damage to beta cells occurs at a subclinical level for months or years in the form of insulitis. Patients with insulin deficiency cannot process glucose in peripheral muscle and fat tissues. This stimulates the secretion of antagonistic hormones such as glucagon, adrenaline, cortisol, and growth hormone (Lee et al., 2019). These antagonistic hormones, particularly glucagon, promote gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and ketogenesis in the liver. Consequently, patients experience hyperglycemia and an anionic metabolic acidosis gap. Type 2 diabetes is the most frequently encountered pathology of the endocrine system organs. The core mechanism of disease development is insulin resistance (Lee et al., 2019). It is a decrease in the biological response of cells to one or more effects of insulin at its average concentration in the blood. Insulin resistance produces the inability of insulin-dependent tissues to absorb blood plasma glucose and disrupts glycogen synthesis in the hepatic.
Persons with diabetes should eat according to a structured regimen and receive their medications with meals. For type 1 diabetes, a recommended diet includes carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and skim milk. Patients with type 2 diabetes, complex carbohydrates such as brown rice, whole wheat, fruits, vegetables, and beans should be included in the rations (Sinclair et al., 2019). At the same time, for both types of disease should be avoided, consumption of simple carbohydrates such as sugar, pasta, white bread, flour, cookies, pastries. During the first type of diabetes, insulin Degludec (Tresiba) is required together with the diet. It is suitable to confound hypoglycemia in patients over 18 years of age. In addition, Zynquista is an oral medication intended to be combined with insulin (Sinclair et al., 2019). Besides, individuals with type 2 diabetes may require insulin if their diet plan, weight loss, exercise, and anti-diabetic medications are not achieving their target blood glucose levels. In that case, Insulin Degludec may also be appropriate; the oral drug is Metformin.
