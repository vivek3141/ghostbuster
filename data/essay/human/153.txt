The concept of culture is a fundamental phenomenon influencing all spheres of human life. It influences people’s actions, methods, and approaches toward specific tasks and daily interactions. Thus, Roseberry determines culture as a socially constructed and socially constitutive part of the context where all activities take place. It means that all other fundamental institutions and phenomena, such as power, economy, and history, comprise the culture. At the same time, being the way of life, it influences the mentioned spheres and preconditions for the emergence of critical processes in these domains. In other words, peculiarities of culture influence decision-making in political processes and historical events which took place at different stages of society’s evolution. Furthermore, the approaches to business in particular, and economy in general, depend on the values and visions peculiar to a bearer of a particular culture. For this reason, by understanding history and politics, it is possible to understand this unique notion and its layers.
Rosebery also assumes that culture is socially constituted, meaning that many cultures share the same visions and values. For example, my own culture is similar to the culture of my friends and the people surrounding me as we live within the same context and share similar approaches. However, at the global level, my system of beliefs and visions differs from the same framework used by people from other regions to guide their decision-making and actions. It is explained by the social nature of culture and its unique character. It includes different perspectives and attitudes shared by people from similar communities and, at the same time, it influences their mentalities and visions. For this reason, it is possible to conclude that culture is a social construct influencing social interactions and fundamental institutions vital for everyday interactions.
