“Fences” by American playwright August Wilson was published in 1987. This play is about an elderly scavenger Troy, a basketball star in his youth. It is worth mentioning that “Fences” contains many essential topics for discussion which are relevant nowadays. For instance, the first scene reveals the duties and responsibilities of fathers and sons. There are many interpretations of “Fences,” including staged and filmed versions, and it is important to discuss both to understand their features.
The spectator sees James Earl Jones in the role of a strict father. His son, Lyons, is trying to figure out whether his father loves him, which constitutes one of this scene’s essences. It is vital to say that each of the three versions, movie, play, and text, is unique, and the spectator perceives it differently. For instance, Lyons, the son, asks his father about Troy’s affection for him. Indeed, he does not receive an expectable answer. Instead of confessing in love, Troy explains what it means to be a father. “It is my duty to take care of you” is a strong phrase that shows another variety of fatherly love (Niko Papastefanou, 2011). The excerpt from the play demonstrates Troy almost in anger; probably, he is unfamiliar with tender feelings, but he knows how to take responsibility for his family.
The 2016 movie “Fences” shows the same scene, but it is perceived differently. Here, the dialogue between Troy and Lyons is extended, and it allows for understanding the characters better. Moreover, the decorations are more realistic than the staged version, creating an atmosphere of presence. The importance of money is also raised here as a vital topic (H Moga, 2017). It shows their responsibility of Troy to care about his family.
Overall, the staged version seems to be more effective and moving. The absence of great decorations makes the spectator focus on the actors’ play, bringing attention to details. James Earl Jones performs Troy’s role amazingly with his intonation and facial expressions. Moreover, while reading the text version, it was possible to think about Troy as a careless father. However, after watching visualized performances, Troy is seen as an interpretation of a strict but responsible man. Overall, the message of this scene is the complexity of father-son relations; more generally, the play is about acceptance and the ability to adapt to circumstances.
