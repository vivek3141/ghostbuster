Technological advance has resulted in business transitioning online, which, in turn, requires efficient market placements online through media. Naturally, traditional sources people are used to are now outweighed by the numerous benefits of new media. To be more exact, legacy media targets a broad audience, which is, obviously, ineffective and leads to companies wasting their money on a few integrations. This type of promotion focuses on old news presentations, such as billboards, television commercials, or printed materials (Vara-Miguel, 2020). Therefore, the audience that sees the advertisements is not narrowed correctly, meaning that most viewers do not find the commercials exciting and do not buy the presented products.
In contrast, new media is adjusted to the modern view of society that is constantly engaged in interaction with various technological devices. In addition, Generation Z is more likely to be motivated to purchase the advertised goods when seeing the advertisements on social media (Vara-Miguel, 2020). That is why new media is mainly positioned on popular social networks, such as YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and especially Tik Tok (Vara-Miguel, 2020). The influencers partner with many companies, advertising their products or service online to their followers, which is apparently more efficient than the old methods of legacy media. By and large, people are more likely to buy the items that are recommended by their favorite bloggers, models, actors, and other celebrities or accomplished social-media influencers.
