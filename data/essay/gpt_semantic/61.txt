In the study "Anxiety level of university students during COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia" conducted by Khoshaim et al., the researchers aimed to investigate the anxiety levels experienced by university students in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of the impact of the pandemic on students' mental health in a specific context.
The researchers collected data from 423 university students in Saudi Arabia using an online questionnaire. They found that the students had significantly higher anxiety levels during the pandemic compared to before it started. This suggests that the pandemic has had a negative impact on the mental health of university students in Saudi Arabia.
Several factors were identified as predictors of higher anxiety levels among students. These included being female, having a lower socioeconomic status, and being directly affected or knowing someone affected by COVID-19. This highlights the importance of considering individual circumstances when addressing mental health issues during the pandemic.
The study also revealed that a lack of access to mental health services was a significant barrier for students seeking support. This finding emphasizes the need for universities and educational institutions to prioritize mental health services and make them readily available to students, especially during challenging times like the pandemic.
In conclusion, the study by Khoshaim et al. sheds light on the anxiety levels of university students in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights the specific factors that contribute to higher anxiety levels and the barriers students face in accessing mental health services. These findings are crucial for policymakers and educators to develop effective strategies and support systems to address the mental health needs of students in similar contexts.
