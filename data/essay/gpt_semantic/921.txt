Tragedy is an inevitable part of life, something that both the characters in Shakespeare's "Hamlet" and Flannery O'Connor's "A Good Man Is Hard to Find" unapologetically experience. Yet, their approaches to cope with these tragedies differ greatly, reflecting their perspectives on life and their ability to move forward.
In "Hamlet," the way characters confront tragedy reflects their belief in fate and their desire for revenge. Hamlet himself, upon learning of his father's murder, is consumed by grief and seeks justice by formulating a plan to avenge his father's death. He is fixated on fulfilling his duty, resulting in his relentless pursuit of the truth and his eventual madness. His coping mechanism involves philosophical soliloquies and elaborate theatrical schemes in order to confirm his suspicions. This reveals his introspective nature and his belief that vengeance is necessary to restore order in the world. Despite his profound loss, Hamlet strives to make sense of the chaos around him, immersing himself in contemplation rather than moving on.
Contrastingly, the characters in "A Good Man Is Hard to Find" deal with the random tragedies of their lives through denial and an unwavering belief in their own righteousness. The grandmother, for instance, stubbornly clings to her misguided sense of moral superiority, refusing to accept the reality of her imminent fate. Even when confronted with the Misfit, a dangerous and unpredictable criminal, she desperately appeals for her life by insisting, "You're a good man...I know you're a good man." This reveals her refusal to acknowledge the harsh realities of the world, clinging onto the remnants of her delusions until her tragic demise. By denying the true nature of her circumstances, the grandmother fails to comprehend the depth of her tragedy, ultimately leading to her inability to move beyond it.
Furthermore, both works explore the varying perspectives characters have on life, which inform their coping mechanisms. In "Hamlet," the character of Claudius is consumed by guilt following the murder of his brother, yet he copes by desperately trying to maintain his power and secure his position as king. His perspective on life is one in which he cannot afford to be overthrown, thus driving him to make decisions that exacerbate the tragedy within the play. His inability to genuinely repent for his actions reflects a moral ambiguity and an insatiable desire for control. Claudius' coping mechanism further demonstrates that his perspective on life is one of survival at all costs, showing a lack of empathy towards others affected by the tragedy.
On the other hand, O'Connor's characters in "A Good Man Is Hard to Find" are driven by their perspectives on religion and the concept of divine intervention. The Misfit, for example, is disenchanted with the idea of a loving and merciful God, leading him to commit heinous acts of violence. He believes that life is inherently unjust, which influences his coping mechanisms. Instead of seeking redemption or forgiveness, the Misfit embraces nihilism and embraces a life devoid of meaning. This reflects a perspective on life that rejects any notion of personal growth or change, resulting in an inability to move forward.
In conclusion, "Hamlet" and "A Good Man Is Hard to Find" offer contrasting perspectives on life and distinct approaches to coping with tragedy. The characters in both works exhibit coping mechanisms that reflect their perspectives on life and their ability to move forward. Whether it be through philosophical introspection, denial, survival instincts or nihilism, these coping mechanisms demonstrate the range of human responses to tragedy and the various ways individuals adapt to life-altering events.
