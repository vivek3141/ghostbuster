The United States' military intervention in Cuba during the Spanish-American War was partially justified. Although the reasons behind the conflict were complex, and the American government's portrayal of the war as a battle for Cuban interests was not entirely accurate, there were some valid justifications for the intervention. However, the consequences of the US gaining control of the island had both positive and negative impacts.
The conflict between the United States and Spain over control of Cuba stemmed from various factors. Cuba had been under Spanish colonial rule for centuries, and many Cubans were agitating for independence and self-determination. Additionally, American economic interests in Cuba, particularly in sugar plantations, were threatened by the deteriorating situation on the island. The sinking of the USS Maine in Havana harbor further escalated tensions between the two nations.
The American government justified military intervention by presenting the war as a fight for Cuban interests and liberation from Spanish oppression. However, it is evident that the larger aim of the United States was to expand its imperialistic ambitions and establish its dominance in the Western Hemisphere. Public sentiment in the United States was fueled by sensationalized media coverage and exaggerated reports of Spanish atrocities in Cuba, further manipulating public opinion in favor of intervention.
The consequences of the United States gaining control of Cuba were undoubtedly significant. On the positive side, Cuba gained independence from Spain and eventually transitioned into a democratic nation. The United States also brought various reforms and improvements in infrastructure, healthcare, and education to the island. However, the United States' control over Cuba led to economic dominance, with American businesses and companies exploiting Cuban resources for their benefit. This economic imperialism caused significant resentment among the Cuban population and led to a deterioration in relations between the two countries, which ultimately culminated in the Cuban Revolution.
In conclusion, while the United States' military intervention in Cuba during the Spanish-American War had justifications, it was not entirely justified. The American government's portrayal of the war as a battle for Cuban interests was a misrepresentation, as their larger aim was to assert imperialistic dominance. The consequences of US control over Cuba had both positive and negative impacts, with Cuba eventually gaining independence but also experiencing economic exploitation and tense relations with the United States.
