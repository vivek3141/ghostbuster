In the book Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead, Janina, the main character, uses nicknames as a way to relate to both humans and animals. Her use of nicknames highlights the contrast between names and nicknames and reveals Janina's unique perspective on the interconnectedness of humans and animals.
First and foremost, Janina's use of nicknames emphasizes her belief in the equality and value of both humans and animals. By giving everyone a nickname, she suggests that all individuals are worthy of recognition and respect. This stands in stark contrast to the societal norm of using proper names, which can sometimes imply hierarchy or superiority. For Janina, it is as if she sees beyond the superficial differences between people and animals, recognizing the intrinsic worth in each living being.
Moreover, Janina's nicknames reflect her refusal to conform to societal expectations. In a world that often emphasizes conformity and standardization, Janina goes against the grain by giving unique and whimsical nicknames to those around her. This rebellion against convention demonstrates Janina's rejection of rigid human-centered perspectives and her embrace of a more fluid and inclusive worldview. By giving both humans and animals playful nicknames, she suggests that all beings are deserving of consideration and should not be confined by societal constructs.
Additionally, Janina's use of nicknames reveals her deep connection to nature and animals. By naming animals in her own language, she establishes a personal and intimate bond with them. This bond showcases her recognition of the complexity and intelligence of animals, countering the prevailing belief that animals are mere objects for human use. Through her nicknames, Janina exhibits a genuine empathy and understanding for animals, viewing them as equals rather than as inferior beings.
In conclusion, Janina's use of nicknames in Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead serves as a commentary on societal hierarchy and human-animal relationships. Her nicknames reflect her belief in the equality and worth of all beings, her rejection of societal norms, and her empathetic connection to animals. Through her unique perspective, Janina challenges readers to reconsider their own values and perspectives on humans and animals and to recognize the interconnectedness of all living beings.
