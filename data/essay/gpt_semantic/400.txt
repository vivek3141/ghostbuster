One limitation of the CALM Act is that it primarily focuses on regulating the average volume of commercials, rather than specifically targeting individual ads. This allows advertisers to technically comply with the law by reducing the overall average, while still implementing loud commercials intermittently. Additionally, the Act does not extend to digital media or streaming platforms, enabling advertisers to leverage those platforms to circumvent the restrictions imposed by CALM.
Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, advertisers have increasingly resorted to alternative methods to bypass the CALM Act's limitations. With significant changes in consumer behavior and increased screen time, advertisers have shifted their tactics towards more invasive and repetitive advertisement techniques. For example, unskippable and longer commercials have become more prevalent, leading to a heightened sense of annoyance and complaint from viewers.
In conclusion, while the CALM Act of 2012 has made some progress in regulating the volume of commercials on television, there are notable limitations to its effectiveness. Advertisers have found ways to bypass the restrictions, particularly through digital media and streaming platforms. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the shortcomings of the Act, with advertisers resorting to alternative methods that have resulted in increased complaints from viewers. Further measures need to be taken to address these limitations and ensure a quieter and less intrusive advertising environment.
