The ethical problems posed by the adversarial criminal justice system and its perceived bias in favor of the accused are evident in the potential impact it has on racial disparities in the American judicial system. According to the United States Sentencing Commission report, racial disparities persist in sentencing outcomes, with African American male offenders receiving sentences that are 19.1 percent longer than those of white male offenders. This raises concerns about systemic discrimination and the need for reform.
One ethical problem with the adversarial criminal justice system is the unequal distribution of resources between the accused and the prosecution. Defendants who cannot afford a private attorney are often assigned a public defender, who may be overworked and have limited resources to defend their client effectively. This creates an imbalance in the courtroom, where the prosecution, backed by the resources of the state, has an advantage over the defendant. As a result, the accused may not receive a fair trial, compromising the ethical principles of justice and equality.
Another ethical issue lies in the procedural safeguards that, while designed to protect the accused's rights, can also contribute to bias. For instance, plea bargaining, a common practice in the American criminal justice system, allows defendants to plead guilty in exchange for a reduced sentence. However, research indicates that plea bargains disproportionately affect minority defendants, who, faced with the prospect of harsher sentences and limited access to resources, may be more likely to accept a plea deal even if they are innocent. This highlights the potential for procedural safeguards to perpetuate racial disparities.
The United States Sentencing Commission report further supports the existence of racial disparities in the American judicial system. The report found that African American male offenders receive sentences that are on average 19.1 percent longer than those of white male offenders, even when controlling for relevant variables such as criminal history and offense severity. This disparity raises serious concerns about the fairness and impartiality of the criminal justice system and its potential impact on communities of color.
The racial disparities in sentencing outcomes can have far-reaching consequences. They contribute to the overrepresentation of African Americans and other minority groups in the criminal justice system, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and marginalization. Moreover, they erode trust in the justice system, especially within minority communities, and reinforce perceptions of systemic discrimination.
In conclusion, the ethical problems posed by the adversarial criminal justice system and its perceived bias in favor of the accused have a significant impact on racial disparities in the American judicial system. The unequal distribution of resources, procedural safeguards, and sentencing disparities highlighted in the United States Sentencing Commission report all contribute to the systemic discrimination faced by minority defendants. The findings of the report underscore the urgent need for reform to uphold the ethical principles of justice, equality, and impartiality in the American criminal justice system.
