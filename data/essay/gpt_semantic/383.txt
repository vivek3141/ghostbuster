Kantian ethics is a philosophical theory created by Immanuel Kant, which focuses on the idea of moral duty and universal principles. According to Kant, all moral actions should be guided by reason and the concept of a categorical imperative. The categorical imperative is an unconditional moral law that applies to all rational beings. It is a way of determining what is morally right or wrong, regardless of individual desires or subjective circumstances.
Kant argues that moral decisions should be made based on the principle of universalizability. This means that one should act in a way that they would want everyone else to act in the same situation. For example, lying is considered morally wrong according to Kant because if lying were universalized, trust and communication would break down in society. Therefore, Kant believes that truthfulness is a categorical imperative.
However, there is a conflict between universal morality and subjective circumstances in Kant's ethical position. Kant claims that moral actions should be determined solely by reason and not through consequences or emotions. This means that even if a particular action leads to negative consequences or causes harm, it is still considered morally right as long as it is guided by reason and the categorical imperative.
This conflict arises because real-life situations often involve complex circumstances that cannot be universally applied. For example, stealing is generally considered morally wrong. However, in certain extreme situations like stealing medicine to save a loved one's life, Kantian ethics would still deem stealing as morally wrong. This rigid adherence to moral principles can be seen as impractical and insensitive to individual needs and circumstances.
Furthermore, Kantian ethics does not address the issue of conflicting duties. Sometimes, people may face conflicting moral obligations, and it becomes challenging to determine which duty should take precedence. For instance, if a doctor is treating two patients, and both require urgent medical attention, whose life should be saved first? Kantian ethics does not provide a clear answer to such dilemmas.
In conclusion, Kantian ethics and the concept of the categorical imperative emphasize the importance of universal moral principles and the use of reason. However, there is a conflict between universal morality and subjective circumstances in Kant's ethical position. The non-consequential nature of his ethics fails to consider the complexity of real-life situations, the consequences of actions, and conflicting duties.
