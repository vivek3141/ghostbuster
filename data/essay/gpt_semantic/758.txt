In Joyce Carol Oates' short story, "Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?", the ending leaves readers questioning the fate of the main character, Connie. The story is filled with symbolism and literary devices that contribute to different interpretations of her destiny. Moreover, it forces us to reflect on the connections between the events in the story and real-life instances of sexual assault and abduction.
At the end of the story, Connie is confronted by Arnold Friend, a stranger who has been stalking her. He appears at her house and insists that she joins him for a ride in his car. Connie, frightened, tries to resist, but Arnold's manipulative tactics eventually overpower her, leaving her fate uncertain. As readers, we are left to interpret whether Connie escapes, or if she is harmed by Arnold.
One possible interpretation of Connie's fate is that she does not survive. Throughout the story, there are hints and foreshadowing that suggest a dark outcome awaits Connie. For example, Arnold Friend's appearance and behavior resemble that of a predator, making her abduction seem more likely. Furthermore, the music playing in the background of Arnold's car, which Connie describes as "a dust storm", represents chaos and danger, suggesting that her fate might be grave.
On the other hand, some readers argue that Connie's fate remains ambiguous, leaving room for interpretation. As Arnold approaches her, Connie sees herself as "two separate people", one wanting to escape, and the other considering staying. This duality in Connie's mindset suggests that she may have the agency to make choices and survive. Therefore, her ultimate fate is left to the reader's imagination.
The story is filled with symbolism and literary devices that enhance its message and add depth to the characters and events. For instance, Arnold Friend's car, which is described as "painted so bright it almost hurt her eyes just to look at it", represents temptation and danger. This car serves as a metaphor for the deceitful allure of predators, drawing their victims towards their doom. Additionally, the strained relationship between Connie and her mother symbolizes society's lack of understanding and support for young girls in instances of sexual assault and abduction.
The story also explores the potential connection between the fictional events it depicts and real-life instances of sexual assault and abduction. Oates intended to shed light on the vulnerability of young women to predatory individuals, highlighting the importance of awareness and caution. In the 1960s, when the story was written, cases of sexual assault and abduction were prevalent in society. By delving into Connie's experience, Oates prompts readers to reflect on the realities faced by many women in their daily lives.
In conclusion, the ending of Joyce Carol Oates' short story, "Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?", leaves Connie's fate uncertain and open to interpretation. The story's use of symbolism and literary devices adds depth to the characters and events, leaving readers with multiple possible interpretations. Moreover, the narrative prompts readers to contemplate the connection between the events in the story and real-life instances of sexual assault and abduction, elevating its themes and messages to resonate on a larger scale.
