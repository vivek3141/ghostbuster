The Closing Ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing marked the end of a thrilling sporting event that captivated millions of people around the world. As a high-school student, I was curious to compare how three renowned news sources, Sports Illustrated, ESPN, and CNN, reported on this significant global event. In exploring their different approaches to reporting and their varying political and social positions, it becomes apparent that these outlets offer unique perspectives on the event.
Sports Illustrated, a widely recognized sports magazine, took a predominantly sports-focused approach in reporting the closing ceremony. Their coverage highlighted the performances of the athletes, the grandeur of the event, and the emotional farewells of the participating countries. The emphasis was on celebrating the accomplishments of the athletes, showcasing their dedicated training and their outstanding performances during the Winter Games. Sports Illustrated conveyed a sense of excitement and celebration, with articles filled with vibrant descriptions and captivating images capturing the essence of the Closing Ceremony. Their coverage was more about the human stories behind the sporting achievements rather than delving into political or social aspects. This approach resonates with the magazine's target audience â€“ sports enthusiasts who primarily seek detailed analysis of events, athlete profiles, and behind-the-scenes accounts.
ESPN, a leading sports network, provided a broader perspective with its coverage of the Closing Ceremony. While ESPN also highlighted the sporting achievements of the athletes and the spectacle of the event, they incorporated more analysis and commentary on the political and social implications of the Olympics being held in Beijing. ESPN explored the controversies surrounding China's human rights record, its treatment of minority groups, and the concerns of activists who opposed the event. Their coverage incorporated interviews with athletes who shared their views on participating in a country with perceived ethical challenges. ESPN's approach acknowledged the intersection of sports, politics, and social issues, reflecting the increasing acknowledgment of the impact of such events on society as a whole. By embracing a wider range of topics and viewpoints, ESPN aimed to engage a broader audience interested in more than just sports statistics.
In contrast, CNN, a multinational news network, emphasized the political and social aspects of the Closing Ceremony in their reporting. CNN's coverage focused heavily on geopolitical matters, China's global influence, and the diplomatic implications of hosting the Winter Games. They analyzed the significance of the event for China's soft power strategy, the country's relations with other nations, and the reactions of world leaders to the ceremony. CNN also dedicated significant coverage to protests and criticism of China's human rights history, providing a platform for activists and dissenting voices. Their approach showcased the network's commitment to investigative journalism, aiming to hold powerful entities accountable and provide a comprehensive understanding of the event's wider impact.
While all three outlets reported on the Closing Ceremony, it is clear that their differing approaches were shaped by their target audiences, their respective brand identities, and their larger political and social positions. Sports Illustrated catered to sports enthusiasts who sought a celebration of athletic accomplishments, with minimal engagement in political and social commentary. ESPN aimed to strike a balance between sports coverage and addressing the ethical implications of the Olympics, appealing to a more socially conscious audience. CNN, on the other hand, prioritized the political and social implications of the event, emphasizing its geopolitical significance beyond sports.
In conclusion, Sports Illustrated, ESPN, and CNN each had distinct approaches to reporting on the Closing Ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Sports Illustrated focused primarily on the achievements of the athletes, providing detailed analysis and captivating imagery. ESPN took a broader perspective, incorporating analysis of political and social issues related to the event, while still maintaining a sports-centric approach. CNN placed a strong emphasis on the political and social aspects, highlighting global implications, diplomatic relations, and human rights concerns. By understanding the unique perspectives offered by these news outlets, readers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the closing ceremony while also recognizing the influence of media on shaping public opinion.
