In Emily Dickinson's poem "A narrow Fellow in the Grass," the themes of fear and deceit are prevalent throughout the poem. Through her use of vivid imagery and symbolism, Dickinson effectively explores these themes, creating a sense of uneasiness and mystery for the reader.
The poem begins with the line, "A narrow Fellow in the Grass." This mysterious and creepy description immediately establishes a sense of fear. The use of the word "Fellow" suggests that the creature is human-like, but the adjective "narrow" raises suspicion. As the poem progresses, the narrator reveals their fear of this creature, saying, "And Zero at the Bone." This powerful use of imagery evokes a chilling sensation, as if the creature is freezing the narrator with its gaze. The fear that the narrator feels towards this narrow fellow is further emphasized by the repetition of the word "never" in the lines, "Yet when a Boy, and Barefoot/I more than once, at Noon/Have passed, I thought, a Whip Lash/Unbraiding in the Sun."
The symbolism in this poem is also important in exploring the theme of fear and deceit. The narrow fellow is often interpreted as a snake, which is a commonly used symbol of deception. The line, "But never met this Fellow" suggests that the narrator has encountered deceit before, but never in this specific form. The imagery of the narrow fellow's movement, "riding in the grass," adds to this sense of deceitfulness as it moves secretly and without warning. This symbolizes how deceit can hide in plain sight, easily blending into our surroundings and catching us off guard.
The imagery in the poem serves to intensify the feeling of fear. The narrator describes the narrow fellow as having "a tighter Breathing" and being "Zero at the Bone." These vivid descriptions of the creature's physical presence create a sense of uneasiness and discomfort. Additionally, the line "And Zero at the Bone" suggests that the narrator is so afraid that they feel frozen and numb. This imagery contributes to the exploration of fear by highlighting the physical and emotional impact it has on the narrator.
Through the use of imagery and symbolism, Dickinson also explores the theme of deceit. The narrow fellow is described as having a "whip-lash" appearance when the narrator passes by. This imagery of the whip-lash suggests that the creature is ready to strike or attack at any moment, portraying a sense of danger and deception. The poem also describes the narrow fellow as "a Spotted Shaft" and "A Split Second too soon." Both of these phrases suggest that the fellow is deceptive in its movements, striking before the narrator even has a chance to react. This illustrates how deceit can be unexpected and catch us off guard.
In conclusion, Emily Dickinson's poem "A narrow Fellow in the Grass" explores the themes of fear and deceit through the use of vivid imagery and symbolism. The poem creates a sense of uneasiness and mystery through its descriptions of the narrow fellow and its movements. The symbolism of the fellow being interpreted as a snake further enhances the theme of deceit, while the imagery intensifies the feeling of fear. Overall, Dickinson effectively uses these literary devices to explore these themes and create a poem that leaves the reader with a lingering sense of unease.
