As someone who has been both a student and a dual-language learner (DLL) in the classroom, I believe there are several ways that teachers can encourage active participation and language use among DLLs. Firstly, teachers should create a supportive and inclusive classroom environment where DLLs feel comfortable expressing themselves and taking risks with their language skills.
One effective way to facilitate active participation is through group discussions and conversations. Teachers can assign group projects and activities where DLLs are encouraged to engage in conversation with their peers. For example, during an English class, DLLs could work on a group presentation about a topic of their choice. This will provide them with opportunities to practice their language skills in a collaborative setting and build confidence in expressing their ideas.
Another way to encourage language use in the classroom is through games and interactive activities. For instance, teachers can organize a language scavenger hunt where DLLs have to find and identify objects in the classroom using English or another target language. This activity not only helps DLLs practice their language skills but also makes learning fun and engaging.
To minimize the teacher's talking and facilitate oral language development among DLLs, teachers can implement strategies such as language buddies and role plays. Pairing DLLs with fluent English speakers can create a supportive learning environment where DLLs can practice their language skills with a more advanced peer. Additionally, role plays allow DLLs to use language in real-life situations, promoting active participation and language development. For example, students can role play a customer and a cashier at a pretend grocery store, practicing vocabulary and dialogue commonly used in such scenarios.
In conclusion, teachers can encourage active participation and language use among DLLs by creating an inclusive classroom environment, promoting group discussions and conversations, incorporating games and interactive activities, and implementing strategies such as language buddies and role plays. These activities not only provide opportunities for DLLs to practice their language skills but also foster collaboration, confidence, and engagement in the classroom. By minimizing the teacher's talking and maximizing student interaction, teachers can ensure that DLLs are actively participating and developing their language skills.
