In today's society, bias and discrimination continue to play a significant role in determining social inclusion. These negative influences can be seen through the powerful messages conveyed in the TED Talks presented by Smith (2015) and Abdel-Magied (2014), as well as the eye-opening article published by The New York Times (2016). By examining these sources, we can gain insight into how bias manifests and its impact on individuals' self-esteem and confidence, particularly when it comes to racial bias and its effects on structural levels within society.
Throughout Smith's TED Talk, she emphasizes the idea that bias acts as a barrier to social inclusion. She examines the broader concept of bias, highlighting how it can manifest in everyday situations and hinder individuals from fully participating in society. Smith shares personal experiences of discrimination, underscoring the detrimental impact it has on one's self-esteem and confidence. By shedding light on these issues, she encourages viewers to become more aware of their biases and work towards creating a more inclusive society.
Similarly, Abdel-Magied's TED Talk delves into the effects of bias and discrimination regarding race. She exposes the reality of racial bias by sharing her own experiences as an African-Australian woman. Abdel-Magied advocates for breaking down stereotypes and promoting inclusivity across all aspects of society. Her talk demonstrates how racial bias can affect an individual's confidence, limiting their opportunities and perpetuating social exclusion.
The New York Times article provides further evidence of the pervasive nature of racial bias. It explores the structural levels within society, illustrating how racial discrimination is deeply ingrained in institutions and systems. The article exposes how biased policies and practices can perpetuate inequality, resulting in significant disparities amongst different racial groups. The effects are far-reaching, impacting not only individuals' self-esteem but also their access to education, employment, and healthcare.
In conclusion, bias and discrimination continue to negatively influence social inclusion, particularly concerning racial bias and its effects on structural levels within society. Smith, Abdel-Magied, and The New York Times shed light on the various ways bias manifests and the impacts it has on individuals' self-esteem and confidence. By dissecting these sources, we learn the importance of acknowledging and challenging our biases to create a more inclusive and equitable society.
