The article by Lufkin on the impact of presenteeism in the era of pandemic and social transformations sheds light on a crucial aspect of workplace dynamics that often goes unnoticed. Presenteeism, which refers to the act of employees coming to work even when they are sick or not feeling well, has been a common practice for many years. However, the ongoing pandemic has brought about a shift in this behavior and made us question its true motives.
Recognizing the true motives behind presenteeism is vital for both employers and employees. While some individuals may genuinely feel obliged to come to work due to their strong work ethic, others may be driven by fear of negative consequences such as job loss, loss of promotions, and even alienation. By understanding these underlying motivations, employers can create a healthier work environment that encourages employees to prioritize their well-being without fear of repercussions.
Subconscious biases play a significant role in employee relationships, making it necessary to dissect these biases and their impact on career growth. The halo effect occurs when a person's overall perception of someone is influenced by a single positive trait. In the workplace, this can lead to a situation where an employee who is consistently present but may not necessarily perform better is favored over others who may work from home or take time off when unwell. This bias can hinder career growth based on actual performance rather than mere presence.
Furthermore, the mere exposure effect, which suggests that people tend to prefer things they are familiar with, can also influence promotions. Employees who are physically present in the office may be more exposed to decision-makers and have more opportunities to showcase their abilities, leading to a higher likelihood of advancement. This bias disregards the fact that remote employees or those who prioritize their well-being may still possess valuable skills and contribute effectively to the organization's success.
Basing career growth solely on physical presence rather than performance can have several drawbacks. Firstly, it creates an unfair advantage for those who have personal circumstances that allow them to be physically present more often. This can lead to employee dissatisfaction and a decline in morale among those who feel their efforts go unnoticed. Secondly, it undermines the importance of a healthy work-life balance, discouraging individuals from taking necessary breaks or prioritizing their well-being. Lastly, it limits the potential for diverse perspectives and contributions from individuals who may prefer flexible arrangements but possess valuable skills and expertise.
In conclusion, recognizing the true motivations behind presenteeism and understanding the impact of subconscious biases is crucial in creating fair and inclusive workplaces. The halo and mere exposure effects can unintentionally favor physical presence over performance, undermining career growth based on merit. It is essential for employers to value and reward performance rather than solely prioritize physical presence, fostering a healthier work environment that ultimately benefits both employees and organizations as a whole.
