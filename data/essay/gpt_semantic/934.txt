In the short story "Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?" by Joyce Carol Oates, the main character, Connie, experiences vulnerability due to her fragmented family background. Connie's family structure, lack of proper parental guidance, and her desire for attention all contribute to her susceptibility to manipulation by Arnold Friend.
First and foremost, Connie's fragmented family background plays a significant role in making her vulnerable to Arnold's manipulation. Connie's family is divided into two distinct units: her mother, her sister, and herself on one side, and her father on the other. This separation creates an environment where Connie is left feeling disconnected from her parents. She seems to have a fairly distant relationship with her father, who often criticizes her and claims that she gets her looks from her mother, suggesting that appearance is the only aspect that matters in their relationship. Connie's father is rarely present, both physically and emotionally, further contributing to her vulnerability. This lack of a stable and nurturing parental figure leaves Connie longing for attention and affirmation, making her an easy target for manipulation.
Additionally, Connie's familial environment lacks the necessary guidance and consistency to build her resilience. Connie's mother is portrayed as a passive figure, always concerned about appearances and dismissive of her daughter's need for emotional support. When Connie's behavior is questioned, her mother describes her rejecting attitude as "just a phase" (Oates). The lack of parental involvement in Connie's life saddens her but also leads her to seek validation elsewhere. This desire for attention becomes a vulnerability exploited by Arnold, as he promises to fulfill her cravings by giving her the affection Connie longs for. Connie's gullibility arises from her craving for love and acceptance, which she ultimately finds in Arnold's deceptive charm.
Furthermore, Connie's vulnerability stems from her eagerness to be noticed and desired. Connie often pays excessive attention to her appearance, spending hours fixing her hair and makeup, in hopes of capturing the attention of boys. Her need for admiration and validation stems from the lack of affirmation she receives at home. When Arnold Friend enters her life, he offers her exactly what she desires: to be seen as special and desired. Connie's vulnerability is evident when Arnold Friend convinces her that he has been watching her every move, even when she was unaware. His remark, "I wouldnâ€™t even have to have you, I could get you, easily" (Oates), plays on Connie's desire to be noticed and pursued, even if it may come from an unknown and potentially dangerous source. This yearning for attention allows Arnold to manipulate Connie into believing that he has the power to fulfill her deepest desires.
In conclusion, Connie's fragmented family background contributes significantly to her vulnerability to Arnold's manipulation. The lack of a stable family structure, insufficient parental guidance, and Connie's desire for attention all make her an easy target. Connie's family separation leads to a disconnect between her parents and herself, leaving her searching for affirmation elsewhere. Her craving for love and acceptance drives her into the arms of Arnold Friend. Furthermore, her eagerness to be seen and desired makes her an easy target for Arnold's manipulation. Ultimately, Connie's fragmented family background sets the stage for her vulnerability, allowing Arnold to exploit her desires and lead her into a dangerous situation.
