Michelle Obama’s opening remarks at the White House Convention on Food Marketing to Children were powerful and effective, due in large part to the strategic use of both logic and emotion in her speech. By employing these rhetorical tools, Obama was able to captivate her audience and resonate with them on a more personal level.
Throughout her speech, Obama utilized logical reasoning to present her case against the marketing tactics used to target children. She started by providing statistics and facts about childhood obesity rates, drawing attention to the seriousness of the issue. By appealing to the audience’s sense of reason, she was able to establish her credibility and make a persuasive argument. For example, she stated, “Nearly one in three children in this country, and one in two children of color, are on track to develop diabetes in their lifetimes.” This alarming statistic grabs the audience’s attention and forces them to acknowledge the severity of the problem at hand.
In addition to logic, Obama also skillfully employed emotional appeals to engage her audience and elicit empathy. She shared personal anecdotes about her own experiences as a mother, recalling the struggles she faced in trying to provide nutritious meals for her family. By sharing her own vulnerability and the challenges she encountered, she humanized herself and made a connection with the listeners. This evoked empathy and made her message more relatable. Her heartfelt plea, “All children deserve a chance to lead healthy lives, regardless of their zip code or the color of their skin,” tugged at the heartstrings of the audience, compelling them to take action.
By combining logic and emotion, Obama was able to make a compelling argument that resonated with her audience. The use of logical reasoning presented a strong case against food marketing to children, while the emotional appeals added a personal touch that made her message more powerful and relatable. By using both these rhetorical tools effectively, Obama engaged her audience, enlightened them on the severity of childhood obesity, and motivated them to join her in the fight for a healthier future for all children.
