Lookism and extreme body modification are both fueled by the unhealthy beauty standards prevalent in modern society. The media plays a significant role in promoting unrealistic standards of beauty. Advertisements, movies, and social media platforms all depict flawless and unattainable images of physical perfection. This constant barrage of unrealistic images leads individuals to internalize these standards and feel inadequate if they do not conform. As a result, some resort to lookism, where they judge others and themselves based solely on physical appearance. This kind of superficial judgment can lead to discrimination and the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes.
Extreme body modification, on the other hand, is driven by the desire to attain this unattainable standard of beauty. Women, in particular, face immense pressure to conform to societal beauty norms. They are bombarded with messages that their bodies should be thin, flawless, and well-proportioned. This pressure can lead to dissatisfaction with one's own body and result in extreme measures being taken to achieve the desired appearance. In her book, Deviant Behavior, Goode explores the motivations behind extreme body modification, highlighting societal expectations as a significant driving force.
Societal pressures perpetuate both lookism and extreme body modification, creating a toxic beauty culture that takes a toll on individuals' mental health and self-esteem. Women are especially susceptible to these pressures as they navigate a world that constantly objectifies and commodifies their bodies. These pressures can lead to body dysmorphia, eating disorders, and low self-esteem. According to Goode's research, women who undergo extreme body modifications often do so to boost their confidence or gain approval from others, perpetuating the cycle of unattainable beauty standards.
In conclusion, lookism and extreme body modification are interconnected phenomena that stem from unhealthy beauty standards in modern society. Both drive individuals to judge and alter themselves based on physical appearance. These phenomena are fueled by societal pressures and unrealistic beauty ideals, particularly for women. It is crucial that we challenge these standards, promote body positivity, and emphasize the importance of embracing diverse definitions of beauty. Only then can we create a society that values individuals for who they are, rather than how they look.
