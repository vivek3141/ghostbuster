In recent years, Etihad Airways has faced significant backlash for its unethical and irrelevant approach to layoffs. The company's decision-making process has come under scrutiny, with many arguing that increased employee involvement could have prevented these issues. Employee engagement plays a crucial role in organizational performance, job security, and motivation. Additionally, disregarding corporate social responsibility and engaging in discrimination during the change process can have severe consequences.
One way increased employee involvement could have prevented the unethical approach to layoffs is by providing a broader perspective on the situation. When employees are given the opportunity to share their opinions and concerns, decision-makers gain access to diverse viewpoints. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the potential impact of layoffs on employees and the company as a whole. By involving employees in decision-making processes, Ethihad Airways would have been able to identify alternative solutions that could have mitigated the negative effects of layoffs.
Furthermore, employee engagement has a significant impact on job security. When employees are empowered and involved in decision-making, they feel a sense of ownership and loyalty towards the organization. This, in turn, enhances their job security as they become more invested in the growth and success of the company. By neglecting to involve employees in the decision-making processes regarding layoffs, Etihad Airways compromised the sense of job security for its employees, leading to increased stress and anxiety in the workplace.
Employee motivation is another critical aspect affected by their involvement in decision-making processes. When employees feel valued and included in important decisions, they are more likely to be motivated to perform at their best. This motivation stems from the belief that their contributions are recognized and appreciated. In the case of Etihad Airways, the lack of employee engagement in the decision to lay off workers inevitably demotivated the remaining employees. They may have felt undervalued and less inclined to put their best efforts into their work.
The consequences of disregarding corporate social responsibility and engaging in discrimination during the change process cannot be understated. Etihad Airways' unethical approach to layoffs violated the principles of fairness and equal opportunity. This not only damages the company's reputation but also creates a toxic work environment. Discrimination erodes morale, creates divisions among employees, and undermines trust in leadership.
Moreover, ethical violations can lead to legal implications and financial penalties. In some jurisdictions, discriminating against employees based on gender, age, or other protected characteristics is illegal and can result in costly lawsuits. Etihad Airways could have reduced these risks by involving employees in decision-making processes, ensuring transparency and fairness in all their actions.
In conclusion, increased employee involvement in decision-making processes could have prevented the unethical and irrelevant approach to layoffs by Etihad Airways. Employee engagement has a positive impact on performance, job security, and motivation. Disregarding corporate social responsibility and engaging in discrimination during the change process can have severe consequences, including legal implications and financial penalties. Ultimately, organizations must recognize the value of employee involvement and prioritize ethical decision-making to foster a positive and inclusive work environment.
