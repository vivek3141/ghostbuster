In the "Eye of the Storm" video, we see how race really messes things up in the classroom. It's crazy how people treat each other differently just because of their skin color. Like, we all bleed the same, right? But no, some people think they're better just because they're white or have lighter skin. It's messed up.
One clear example of the social construction of race in the video is when the teacher divided the class into brown-eyed and blue-eyed groups. These kids didn't choose their eye color, and yet they were treated so differently. The blue-eyed kids were given special privileges and were praised by the teacher, while the brown-eyed kids were treated like they were dumb. It's not fair at all!
And guess what? The students’ behavior changed because of it. The blue-eyed kids became all cocky and mean towards the brown-eyed kids. They thought they were superior just because of their eye color. It was like they forgot they were all classmates and should treat each other with respect. The brown-eyed kids, on the other hand, started feeling really bad about themselves. They lost confidence and some of them even started believing they were really dumb, just because of how the teacher treated them. It made me so angry to see how easily kids can be influenced by something as stupid as eye color.
But here's the thing – it didn't stop there. The effects of this social construction of race on the students' performance were also clear. In the beginning, the blue-eyed kids were ahead, answering questions and being praised by the teacher. But as soon as the roles were reversed, with the brown-eyed kids becoming the privileged group, the blue-eyed kids' performance declined. They couldn't handle being on the receiving end of unfair treatment. It just shows how our behavior and performance can be affected by the way we are treated and perceived by others.
In conclusion, the "Eye of the Storm" video demonstrates how race is socially constructed and how it affects the behavior and performance of students. It's important for us to realize that race should not define us or how we treat others. We need to break free from these stereotypes and treat everyone equally, regardless of their skin color or eye color.
