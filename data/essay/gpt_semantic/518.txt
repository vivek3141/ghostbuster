Religion has played a significant role in the development of art throughout history.

Furthermore, the depiction of Adam, the first man, served as a reminder of humanity's connection to God and the responsibility to live virtuous lives. The Sistine Chapel Ceiling contributed to the viewers' perception of faith by stimulating a sense of reverence and deepening their understanding of religious teachings.
Another notable example of religious art is Gr端newald's Isenheim Altarpiece, created between 1512 and 1516.

Additionally, Gr端newald incorporates elements of Gothic art, such as distorted figures and intense emotion, to emphasize the suffering endured by Christ. This altarpiece aimed to provide solace and hope to the patients of the hospital, who were often afflicted with diseases and physical pain.
The Isenheim Altarpiece had a profound impact on the viewers' perception of faith. It offered comfort to the sick and suffering, reminding them of Christ's immense love and willingness to endure suffering for their sake. The altarpiece served as a source of solace and encouragement, instilling hope and strengthening the faith of those who experienced it.
Caravaggio's The Calling of St. Matthew, painted in 1599-1600, is another example of religious art during the Baroque period. This artwork portrays the moment when Jesus calls Matthew, a tax collector, to become one of his disciples. Caravaggio's use of light and shadow creates a dramatic effect, drawing attention to the figures and their expressions. The use of contemporary clothing and the realistic depiction of the characters make the scene relatable and accessible to viewers.
The Calling of St. Matthew reflects religious motifs such as the calling of individuals to follow Christ and leave behind their worldly occupations. The contrast between darkness and light symbolizes the spiritual awakening brought by Jesus' invitation.
