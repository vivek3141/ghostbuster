In her thought-provoking essay, "Trying Out One's New Sword," philosopher Mary Midgley offers a critique of moral isolationism while providing a fresh perspective on the evaluation of other cultures. Midgley's arguments challenge the notion that moral neutrality should be maintained when considering cultural practices that may seem morally dubious to some. Through her insightful analysis and use of vivid examples, Midgley urges readers to engage in cross-cultural understanding and ethical evaluation rather than resorting to moral isolationism.
One of Midgley's chief criticisms of moral isolationism is that it fosters a dangerous relativism that undermines moral accountability. She argues that we cannot simply ignore the practices of other cultures and assume they are morally acceptable solely because they differ from our own. Midgley contends that moral isolationism is equivalent to "moral blindness," as it prevents us from questioning and evaluating practices that may lead to harm or suffering. For instance, she highlights the traditional samurai practice of "trying out one's new sword" through killing innocent victims. By showcasing this extreme cultural practice, Midgley challenges the notion that we should remain morally aloof, as doing so would permit grievous acts without any moral condemnation.
Midgley's essay emphasizes the importance of assessing other cultures from a moral perspective. Rather than embracing cultural relativism, she contends that there are universal moral standards that transcend cultural borders. While she acknowledges the diverse practices across cultures, she urges for the critical evaluation of these practices to ensure ethical coherence. Midgley states, "We need to be able to ask ourselves what goes on in other cultures and what might count as evidence against them." This highlights her belief in the value of engaging with other cultures and critically assessing their practices.
Midgley also counters the argument that cultural practices should be judged solely by their internal criteria. She maintains that this approach would undervalue the role of empathy and ethical reflection. By examining the example of the Japanese practice of "trying out one's new sword," Midgley argues that understanding the social context is insufficient without considering the moral implications. She suggests that instead of isolating ourselves from other cultures, we should strive for a balanced approach of respecting cultural diversity while remaining ethically engaged.
To conclude, Mary Midgley's critique of moral isolationism compels readers to reflect on the evaluation of other cultures and practices. Through her vivid example of the samurai tradition, she highlights the dangers of moral blindness and emphasizes the necessity of cross-cultural ethical evaluation. Midgley's arguments emphasize the value of engaging with other cultures and critical assessment, rather than resorting to moral isolationism or cultural relativism. She reminds us that in striving to understand other cultures, we must not abandon our moral compass but rather evaluate practices against universal moral standards. Only then can we foster a balanced appreciation of cultural diversity while maintaining ethical accountability.
