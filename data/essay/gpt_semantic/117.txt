Introduction:
In today's interconnected global market, currency exchange plays a significant role in international trade. As our company expands its operations in Malaysia, it is crucial to assess the impact of currency fluctuations on profitability. In this essay, I will evaluate three scenarios: adjusting for currency fluctuations, using a fixed rate mentioned in the contract, and avoiding currency exchange by purchasing raw materials in MYR. Considering both short-term and long-term perspectives, I will make a recommendation for the most viable and profitable option for our firm.
Body:
1. Adjusting for Currency Fluctuations:
In the short-term, adjusting for currency fluctuations can be a viable option for our company. By actively monitoring exchange rates and hedging against potential risks, we can minimize losses caused by sudden currency fluctuations. For example, through currency derivatives such as forward contracts or options, we can secure a specific exchange rate for future transactions, reducing uncertainty.
However, in the long-term, constantly adjusting for currency fluctuations may not be sustainable. The costs associated with constantly hedging against exchange rate risks can add up, eating into our company's profits. Additionally, fluctuations in currency rates are often influenced by global economic factors, making it challenging to accurately predict and adjust for them consistently.
2. Fixed Rate Mentioned in the Contract:
Using a fixed rate mentioned in the contract can provide stability and predicted profitability in the short-term. If the contract specifies a fixed exchange rate, our company can avoid the risks associated with currency fluctuations and accurately forecast the costs and revenues of our trade in Malaysia.
Nonetheless, relying on a fixed rate may limit our company's long-term growth potential. If the exchange rate remains significantly favorable for our company, we would miss out on potential gains. Conversely, if the exchange rate becomes less favorable, our profitability will suffer. Ultimately, the fixed rate mentioned in the contract may not align with the prevailing market conditions, rendering it less suitable as a long-term strategy.
3. Purchasing Raw Materials in MYR:
Avoiding currency exchange by purchasing raw materials in MYR can be a profitable long-term option for our firm. By transacting in the local currency, we eliminate the volatility associated with currency fluctuations entirely. This strategy ensures a consistent and predictable cost structure, enabling us to plan and optimize our operations effectively.
Furthermore, purchasing raw materials in MYR enhances our competitiveness in the Malaysian market by potentially reducing costs. We can negotiate better deals and benefit from local supplier networks. Maintaining stable costs and gaining a competitive edge will enable us to offer competitive prices to our customers and potentially increase market share.
Conclusion:
Considering both short-term and long-term perspectives, it is recommended that our firm pursues the option of purchasing raw materials in MYR to avoid currency exchange. While adjusting for currency fluctuations can provide short-term stability, the associated costs and uncertainty make it less suitable in the long run. Relying on a fixed rate mentioned in the contract may ensure stability, but it restricts potential gains and growth opportunities. On the other hand, transacting in MYR improves profitability, eliminates currency risks, and enhances competitiveness, making it the most viable and profitable option for our company's trade in Malaysia.
