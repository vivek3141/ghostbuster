Walmart, one of the biggest retail giants in the world, has recently faced criticism for its lack of support and incentives for its workers. As a high-school student, I believe that compensating employees for their performance and considering their interests is crucial in enhancing productivity and job satisfaction. 
Firstly, providing fair compensation to employees is important because it acknowledges their hard work and motivates them to perform better. Employees who feel valued and rewarded for their efforts are more likely to be engaged and committed to their work. In contrast, if workers feel underpaid and undervalued, their motivation and morale may decrease, leading to subpar performance and a negative customer experience.
Furthermore, considering the interests of employees is vital for their overall job satisfaction. When employees feel that their concerns, needs, and goals are taken into account, they are more likely to feel fulfilled in their roles. This can lead to increased loyalty, job satisfaction, and a stronger sense of belonging within the company. A lack of support and incentives, on the other hand, can breed dissatisfaction and ultimately lead to high employee turnover rates.
Ultimately, a company's success is closely tied to the satisfaction and productivity of its employees. By compensating employees for their performance and considering their interests, Walmart, or any other organization, has the opportunity to create a positive working environment that fosters loyalty, productivity, and customer satisfaction. It is crucial for employers to recognize the importance of recognizing and rewarding their employees, as doing so can have a significant impact on the overall success of the company.
