Body: 
1. Patriarchy and Tituba's Subjugation (300 words):
Tituba's life is fundamentally shaped by the oppressive nature of patriarchy. As a slave and a woman, Tituba exists at the lowest rung of the social hierarchy, devoid of power or agency. Condé portrays the patriarchal system through Tituba's early experiences as a household slave in Barbados, where she is subjected to the whims and desires of her masters. Her vulnerability is further amplified when she is sold to Samuel Parris, a Puritan minister who brings her to the oppressive New England society.
Moreover, Tituba's marginalized position intensifies due to her race. The intersectionality of racism and patriarchy manifests as she faces double discrimination. Her skin color and enslaved status strip her of her voice, reinforcing the dehumanization she endures. This deep-seated patriarchy not only shapes her own beliefs and actions but also influences her experiences with others, as patriarchy permeates all relationships in her life.
2. Racism and Its Impact (300 words):
The pervasive racism in I, Tituba is a driving force behind her struggles. Tituba is portrayed as a victim of racism at multiple points throughout the story. From the racialized abuse faced at the hands of her masters to the racialized violence during her imprisonment, Condé highlights the degrading and dehumanizing aspects of racism. Notably, Tituba is consistently portrayed as an "other" due to her Afro-Caribbean heritage, further alienating her from the already hostile society she inhabits.
Additionally, racism engenders internal conflict within Tituba. Her Afro-Caribbean ancestry fuels her internal narrative struggle, as she yearns for acceptance within the white-dominated society while trying to preserve her ethnic and cultural identity. This internal conflict resonates deeply with readers by revealing the emotional toll racism takes on marginalized individuals, shaping their lives and experiences.
3. Resistance and Empowerment (300 words):
Despite the heavy impact of patriarchy and racism on Tituba's life, she gradually becomes a symbol of resistance and empowerment. Through her experiences with Susanna English, a white Puritan woman who challenges societal norms, and Hester, a fellow marginalized woman, Tituba gains the strength and determination required to persevere.
Tituba's journey towards liberation also underscores her growing understanding of intersectionality. She recognizes the importance of solidarity and unity among oppressed individuals, highlighting the necessity of dismantling both patriarchy and racism. Her involvement in witchcraft and later in the slave revolts showcases her willingness to challenge the established power structures.
