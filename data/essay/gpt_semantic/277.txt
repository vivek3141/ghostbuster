In the epic poem Beowulf, the portrayal of gender roles reflects the societal expectations placed on women during the Anglo-Saxon period. Women in this poem are depicted as secondary characters and plot devices, existing primarily to advance the story of men. Their worth is often tied to their marital status and their ability to produce heirs.
One example of this is the character of Wealhtheow, Hrothgar's queen. She is portrayed as a gracious and loyal supporter of her husband's rule, but her role is limited to offering mead to the warriors and providing advice in the mead hall. Wealhtheowâ€™s primary duty is to secure her husband's lineage by bearing him sons. Her worth and value in society are heavily tied to her ability to fulfill this role, rather than her own individual accomplishments or desires.
Another example is Grendel's mother, who is depicted as a monstrous figure seeking revenge for the death of her son. She is presented as a threat to Beowulf and his men, but her actions are ultimately driven by her desire to protect her offspring. Grendel's mother is portrayed as an embodiment of the dangers women can pose when they deviate from societal norms and expectations. Her actions ultimately serve to reinforce the valor and bravery of the male heroes.
Marriage is a central theme in Beowulf, highlighting the importance of women as means of forging alliances and maintaining political stability. One can observe this through the character of Freawaru, daughter of the Danish king. Her marriage to Ingeld, the Heathobard prince, is a strategic decision aimed at preventing future conflicts and fostering peace between the two tribes. Freawaru has no voice or agency in the matter, as her value lies solely in her role as a bargaining chip.
Overall, the portrayal of gender roles in Beowulf emphasizes the subordinate position of women in society. They are depicted as secondary characters and plot devices, serving to fulfill the desires and aspirations of men. The value and worth of women are measured based on their ability to fulfill their expected roles as wives and bearers of sons. Marriage is seen as a means of securing alliances and maintaining social order, illustrating the limited agency and autonomy afforded to women in Anglo-Saxon society.
