For our research study, we wanted to find out what methods were used to select the sample population. The main goal was to investigate the opinions and behaviors of teenagers in relation to social media usage. To do this, we needed to carefully choose a group of students to participate in our study.
To start, we decided to conduct our research in a local high school. This was convenient because we already had connections with the teachers and administration who were willing to cooperate with us. They were able to provide us with a great opportunity to recruit students who were representative of the general teenage population.
In terms of selecting the actual participants, we used a combination of random sampling and stratified sampling. Random sampling was important to ensure that all students had an equal chance of being selected for the study. We used a random number generator to select students from the complete high school population, including all grades. This helped to avoid any bias in our selection process.
Additionally, we used stratified sampling to ensure that our sample population represented the diversity of the high school. We stratified the students based on grade level, gender, and ethnicity. This allowed us to have a mix of participants from different backgrounds and ensured that our results would have a wider generalizability.
To gather our data, we used a self-administered questionnaire. We distributed the questionnaire to all selected students during an assembly. We allowed a sufficient amount of time for them to complete the questionnaire and encouraged them to be honest and sincere in their responses.
Overall, we believe that our selection methods were effective in choosing a sample population that accurately represented the teenage population in our local high school. However, it is important to note that our study has its limitations. Firstly, our findings may not be applicable to teenagers outside of the specific high school we conducted our research in. Additionally, as with any study, there is always a chance for sampling error and bias. Nonetheless, we are confident that our study provides valuable insights into the opinions and behaviors of teenagers in relation to social media usage.
