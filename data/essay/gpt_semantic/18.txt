In Spiegelman's graphic novel Maus, the use of anthropomorphism is an effective literary device that helps to depict the experiences and perspectives of different races during World War II. By portraying characters as animals, Spiegelman creates a sense of distance and objectivity that allows readers to reflect on the Holocaust and the resilience of its victims in a unique and powerful way.
One way anthropomorphism is used in Maus is through the portrayal of Jews as mice and Germans as cats. This choice of animals is not arbitrary, but rather a deliberate decision to represent power dynamics and the horrors of the Holocaust. By depicting Jews as mice, a species known for their vulnerability and innocence, Spiegelman highlights the victimization and persecution they faced during this time. Similarly, by portraying Germans as cats, a predatory and dominant species, Spiegelman conveys the power and aggression that the Nazis exerted over their victims.
Furthermore, this use of anthropomorphism contributes to the reader's understanding of the Holocaust by creating a sense of universality and relatability. By associating human experiences and emotions with animal characters, Spiegelman allows readers to connect on a deeper level and empathize with the characters' struggles. This technique humanizes the victims and makes their experiences more accessible to a wide range of readers, regardless of their background or knowledge of World War II.
The resilience of the Holocaust victims is also effectively conveyed through anthropomorphism. Despite their vulnerable status as mice, the Jewish characters in Maus demonstrate immense strength, courage, and determination in the face of adversity. By portraying them as animals rather than humans, Spiegelman emphasizes their ability to survive and overcome unimaginable hardship. This not only creates a sense of admiration for the characters, but also highlights the indomitable spirit of all those who suffered during the Holocaust.
Moreover, the use of anthropomorphism in Maus allows for a critique of the dehumanization that occurred during the Holocaust. By depicting characters as animals, Spiegelman challenges the notion that any group of people can be reduced to their race or ethnicity. This critique of dehumanization is further emphasized through the use of visual metaphors and symbolism throughout the graphic novel, such as the portrayal of Jews wearing mouse masks to blend in with the dominant cat population. These visual representations serve to remind readers of the dehumanizing effects of war and prejudice.
In conclusion, the use of anthropomorphism in Spiegelman's Maus is a powerful literary device that effectively depicts the experiences and perspectives of different races during World War II. Through the portrayal of characters as animals, the graphic novel provides a unique and relatable lens through which readers can understand the Holocaust and the resilience of its victims. By humanizing the characters, emphasizing their strength, and critiquing dehumanization, Spiegelman creates a work that is both emotionally engaging and intellectually stimulating.
