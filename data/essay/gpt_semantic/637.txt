Analyzing and contrasting the themes of time, war, and the invisibility of evil in Wisława Szymborska's poems "The End and the Beginning" and "Hitler's First Photograph" allows us to delve into the duality of time and its ability to effortlessly recount historical patterns, while also remaining silent about impending events. In these poems, Szymborska explores the process of reconstruction after war, the purity of birth, and the stark contrast between the present and the potential future that Hitler could have embarked upon.
"The End and the Beginning" is a poignant poem that delves into the aftermath of war and the process of rebuilding. It presents us with a landscape that is ravaged by the atrocities of war, with cities reduced to rubble and people struggling to make sense of the devastation. The poem emphasizes the cyclical nature of history, as it highlights the repetitive pattern of destruction and reconstruction. We witness the passage of time as people slowly piece their lives back together, building homes and planting gardens amidst the ruins.
However, despite this cycle of destruction and reconstruction, the poem also reminds us of the invisible evil that lies beneath the surface. The poet mentions the "next" war, which is already present in the minds of those who have survived the previous one. The evil, like time itself, remains elusive and untelling of future events. It is the invisible force that threatens to disrupt the fragile equilibrium achieved through reconstruction.
Similarly, in "Hitler's First Photograph," Szymborska explores the innocence of birth and the contrast between the present and the future. The poem captures a precious moment in time, depicting Hitler as a baby in the photograph. In this innocent state, Hitler is simply a child like any other, devoid of the evil that would later consume him.
The poem, however, leaves us with a sense of unease as it contemplates the potential paths that lie ahead for Hitler. It raises the question of how someone can grow from being an innocent child into a figure responsible for such immense suffering and destruction. The contrast between the present innocence of the photograph and the future horrors that Hitler would enact illuminates the duality of time. It showcases how time can recite historical patterns with ease, yet remains silent about the future, leaving the potential paths of individuals open and uncertain.
Moreover, both poems highlight the reconstruction process after war. In "The End and the Beginning," the rebuilding serves as a testament to the resilience of humanity. Despite the destruction, people continue to rebuild their lives, demonstrating their determination to move forward. This reconstruction is both physical and psychological, as individuals not only rebuild their homes but also strive to regain a sense of normalcy amidst the chaos.
In "Hitler's First Photograph," the notion of reconstruction is also present, albeit in a different form. The poem hints at the potential for shaping a different future for Hitler, had he been guided down a different path. It poses the question of whether, through proper nurturing and guidance, Hitler could have become a force for good rather than the embodiment of evil. This notion of reconstruction after war expands beyond the physical realm and delves into the realm of personal transformation and the power of influence.
In conclusion, Wisława Szymborska's poems "The End and the Beginning" and "Hitler's First Photograph" explore the themes of time, war, and the invisibility of evil. These poems illuminate the duality of time, showcasing its ability to effortlessly recite historical patterns while remaining untelling of future events. They delve into the process of reconstruction after war and reflect on the contrast between innocence and potential paths. Through these poems, Szymborska invites us to contemplate the power of time, the impact of war, and the potential for change in the face of evil.
