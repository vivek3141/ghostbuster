The Star Wars films have always been a big part of popular culture and have played a significant role in shaping our understanding of race and gender. In Berg's article, he explores how the racial and gender aspects of the Star Wars films evolve and challenge stereotypes.
One way in which the Star Wars films challenge racial stereotypes is through the character of Finn. In the original trilogy, the majority of the main characters were white, except for Lando Calrissian. However, in the sequel trilogy, Finn, portrayed by John Boyega, takes center stage as a main protagonist. This representation of a black character in a leading role challenges the stereotype that black characters are only sidekicks or supporting roles. Finn's character development also challenges stereotypes about black men being aggressive or violent, as he is portrayed as kind-hearted and compassionate.
Furthermore, the Star Wars films have also made progress in challenging gender stereotypes. In the original trilogy, Princess Leia was the only prominent female character, and she often played the damsel in distress, needing to be rescued by the male protagonists. However, the sequel trilogy introduces a strong and independent female protagonist, Rey, portrayed by Daisy Ridley. Rey challenges the stereotype of women being dependent on men for their survival and empowers young girls by showing them that they can be strong and capable leaders.
In conclusion, the Star Wars films have evolved and challenged racial and gender stereotypes in significant ways. By featuring diverse main characters and breaking away from traditional depictions, the films influence our perception of race and gender in a positive manner. They open doors for more representation and understanding, proving that everyone, regardless of race or gender, can be heroes.
