The Ubiquity of Whiteness in Media (200 words)
One cannot deny that whiteness has traditionally been portrayed as the standard and norm in cinematic and television productions. The dominance of white narratives, characters, and themes has led to a sense of exclusivity and alienation for people of color. This normalization of whiteness perpetuates harmful stereotypes and fosters a skewed perception of the world.
"Get Out": A Powerful Critique on Whiteness as the Default (200 words)
Jordan Peele's "Get Out" revolutionized the horror genre by addressing the racial undertones and societal structures surrounding whiteness. The film vividly exposes deep-seated racism by introducing Chris, a young Black man, who visits his white girlfriend's family. Through its portrayal of the Armitage family, who prey on unsuspecting Black individuals, "Get Out" masterfully reveals the dangers of assuming whiteness as the default.
The film's depiction of Chris's initial discomfort and anxiety in a predominantly white environment resonates with audiences who have experienced similar situations. This discomfort stems from the implicit bias within society that perpetuates the myth that whiteness is safe, superior, and deserving of default representation. By subverting this narrative, "Get Out" compels viewers to confront their own prejudices and biases ingrained in their perceptions of race and identity.
Whiteness as the Default: Reinforcing Stereotypes (150 words)
The normalization of whiteness reinforces harmful stereotypes and strengthens the hierarchical structure embedded within society. By predominantly featuring white protagonists and relegating characters of color to supporting roles or stereotypes, media perpetuates the notion that non-white individuals are less important or significant. For example, many films continue to depict Black characters as criminals, Latinos as maids or gang members, and Asians as nerds or martial arts experts. These portrayals active malign entire communities, reinforcing racial biases, and eroding self-esteem.
Breaking the Mold: Diverse Representations in Media (150 words)
While the trend of whiteness as the default persists, there are encouraging signs of progress. Several recent films have sought to challenge the status quo, presenting more diverse narratives and characters. For instance, "Black Panther" showcased a predominantly Black cast, highlighting Black excellence and the nuances of African culture. It broke box-office records, demonstrating the undeniable demand for underrepresented stories.
Conclusion (100 words)
The portrayal of whiteness as the default in film, television, and media has significant implications for perceptions of race and identity. By examining the groundbreaking film "Get Out" and other notable examples, we can recognize the ways in which this bias perpetuates harmful stereotypes, reinforces hierarchical structures, and negatively impacts individuals from diverse racial backgrounds. However, there is also reason for optimism. The emergence of more inclusive narratives and diverse representations in recent years offers hope for a future where all races and identities are authentically represented and celebrated in media.
