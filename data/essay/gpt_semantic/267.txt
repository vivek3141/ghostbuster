In Diana Kendall's essay "Framing Class, Vicarious Living, and Conspicuous Consumption," she argues that the media plays a significant role in shaping society's perception of social class and contributes to the existing inequality. I agree with Kendall's argument as the media often portrays the upper and lower classes in a certain way, influencing human behavior and, subsequently, impacting the quality of life for lower-class individuals.
The media tends to portray the upper class as prosperous, sophisticated, and powerful, creating an irresistible image that people aspire to. Television shows, movies, and advertisements often depict wealthy individuals living lavish lifestyles, driving expensive cars, and residing in opulent homes. These portrayals create a desire for people to attain such a lifestyle, leading them to work harder and pursue material possessions. As a result, this perpetuates the myth that success and happiness are intrinsically linked to wealth and ownership.
On the other hand, the media often portrays the lower class in a negative light. News stories about poverty and crime tend to focus on lower-class communities, reinforcing stereotypes and contributing to stigmatization. This portrayal can lead to the perception that lower-class individuals are lazy or deserving of their disadvantaged circumstances, thus justifying societal inequalities.
These depictions in the media influence human behavior by shaping our desires and aspirations. Many individuals strive to achieve the lifestyles they see on television and in movies, even if it means perpetuating social inequalities. This consumer culture driven by the media's portrayal of the upper class fuels a cycle of materialism and conspicuous consumption. It not only deepens the divide between social classes but also perpetuates an unsustainable economic model and contributes to environmental degradation.
The consequences of this influence on behavior are far-reaching, particularly for lower-class individuals. The relentless pursuit of material possessions places an immense financial burden on those already struggling to make ends meet. Moreover, the focus on material wealth and status overshadows the importance of education, health, and community, exacerbating existing inequalities. This can lead to a diminished quality of life for lower-class individuals, who may never achieve the wealth and social status glorified by the media.
In conclusion, the media plays a significant role in shaping our perception of social class and contributes to the legitimate inequality in society. The portrayal of upper and lower classes in the media, the impact on human behavior, and the subsequent effects on the quality of life for lower-class individuals are all interconnected. This phenomenon emphasizes the need for critical media literacy and collective efforts to challenge these representations and work towards a more equitable society.
