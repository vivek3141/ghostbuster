The Victorian Era and modern America are two distinct time periods that differ greatly in terms of moral values, societal norms, and their impact on literature and crime rates. Although the Victorian Era is often romanticized as a period of strict moral values and virtuous living, modern America has loosened its grip on traditional values, leading to changes in societal norms and literary themes. These changes have also had an impact on crime rates in both eras.
One major difference between the Victorian Era and modern America is the moral values upheld by society. During the Victorian Era, morality and virtue were highly regarded, and strict standards of conduct were expected. The emphasis on Christian values meant that actions were often judged based on how closely they aligned with religious standards. In contrast, modern America has experienced a shift away from traditional morals, with more emphasis being placed on individual autonomy and personal freedoms. This shift has resulted in a more diverse range of moral perspectives and a greater acceptance of behaviors that were once considered taboo.
The differences in moral values between the two eras have also had an impact on societal norms. In the Victorian Era, societal norms were more rigid and conformist, with expectations of modesty and propriety. Women were expected to be submissive and adhere to a domestic role, while men were expected to fulfill the role of the breadwinner. These societal norms were reflected in literature of the time, with works often depicting characters who adhered to these gender roles and moral values. However, in modern America, societal norms have evolved to be more inclusive and accepting. Women have gained more rights and opportunities, and gender roles have become less strict. As a result, literature in modern America often explores a wider range of themes and portrays characters who challenge traditional norms.
The changes in moral values and societal norms have also influenced crime rates in the two eras. In the Victorian Era, the emphasis on moral values and strict societal norms resulted in the criminalization of behaviors that deviated from the accepted norms. Crimes such as theft, adultery, and blasphemy were viewed as highly immoral and were often met with severe punishments. The strict moral code of the era, along with strong punishment for crimes, served as deterrents and contributed to lower crime rates compared to modern America.
In contrast, modern America has seen a rise in crime rates, in part due to the shifting societal norms and changing moral values. The focus on individual rights and personal freedoms has led to a more lenient approach towards certain behaviors that were once considered criminal. Additionally, the increased diversity in moral perspectives has made it more challenging to define and enforce a universally accepted standard of morality. This has created a more complex legal system and made it harder to deter criminal behavior.
Literature has also been influenced by the differences in moral values and societal norms between the Victorian Era and modern America. In the Victorian Era, literature often reflected the strict moral code and societal norms. Works such as Charles Dickens' novels portrayed characters who faced moral dilemmas and grappled with societal expectations. These literary works were often used as a platform to critique social injustices and advocate for moral reform.
On the other hand, literature in modern America has become more diverse in terms of themes and perspectives. The shift away from traditional moral values has allowed for more exploration of various social issues such as race, gender, and sexuality. Authors like Toni Morrison and Alice Walker have used literature to shed light on the struggles faced by marginalized communities. The focus has shifted from moralizing and critiquing society to promoting empathy and understanding.
In conclusion, the Victorian Era and modern America differ significantly in terms of moral values, societal norms, and their impact on literature and crime rates. While the Victorian Era upheld strict moral values and societal norms, modern America has embraced a more diverse range of moral perspectives and societal norms. These changes have had implications for literature, with modern works reflecting a wider range of themes and perspectives. Additionally, crime rates have been influenced by the shifting moral values and societal norms, with the Victorian Era experiencing lower crime rates due to the strict moral code, and modern America facing challenges in defining and enforcing universally accepted standards.
