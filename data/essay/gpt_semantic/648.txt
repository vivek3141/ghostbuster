In the world of film, the portrayal of women has been heavily influenced by the concept of the male gaze theory and psychoanalysis. These theories suggest that female characters in movies are often objectified and viewed from a male perspective, catering to the male viewer's desires and fantasies. This has led to a perpetuation of dominance-submission patterns between men and women, which are further reinforced in the melodrama genre.
One film that exemplifies this is "The Postman Always Rings Twice." In this movie, the female lead, Cora, is presented as a seductive and mysterious character, constantly under the male gaze. The camera focuses on her body and highlights her physical attributes, reducing her to a sexual object for male characters and the audience. This objectification limits Cora's agency and reinforces the power dynamics between men and women.
Furthermore, the film portrays Cora as a submissive character, confined by her role in the family. She is married to a much older man, Nick, who controls her actions and decisions. This limitation placed on her by the family further reinforces the dominance-submission patterns between men and women. Cora's desire for freedom and independence is seen as a threat to the traditional family structure, and she ultimately meets a tragic fate as a result.
Another film that demonstrates how the family places limitations on women in the melodrama genre is "The Dark Knight Rises." In this movie, the character of Talia al Ghul is portrayed as a villainous and manipulative woman. She seeks revenge on Batman and uses her sexuality as a means to control men and further her own agenda. This portrayal suggests that powerful women are dangerous and must be suppressed, reinforcing the dominance of men in society.
Furthermore, Talia is portrayed as a submissive character to her father, Ra's al Ghul, who influences her actions and decisions. Her desire for revenge becomes intertwined with her loyalty to her father, and she falls into the role of a pawn in his plans. This portrayal reinforces the idea that women are easily controlled and submissive to male figures of authority.
In conclusion, the portrayal of women in film is often influenced by the male gaze theory and psychoanalysis. This leads to the objectification of female characters and perpetuation of dominance-submission patterns between men and women. The limitations placed on women in the melodrama genre, as seen in "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and "The Dark Knight Rises," further reinforce these power dynamics. It is important to critically analyze and question the portrayal of female characters in film in order to challenge and dismantle oppressive gender norms.
