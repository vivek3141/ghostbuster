Genghis Khan and Hulagu were two prominent Mongol leaders who left a lasting impact on history with their conquests. However, the approaches they took in their conquests greatly differed, especially when it came to the treatment of conquered territories and rulers.
Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol Empire, had a more lenient and diplomatic approach towards conquered territories and rulers. He believed in incorporating the conquered people into his growing empire rather than annihilating them. Khan’s first step was to offer his enemies a chance to surrender peacefully. If they did, he spared their lives and allowed them to maintain their positions of power. Additionally, Khan practiced religious tolerance, which allowed him to win the support of the diverse population he had conquered. He even implemented an advanced postal system and trade routes, which helped in the prosperity of the conquered territories.
On the other hand, Hulagu, Genghis Khan’s grandson, adopted a more brutal and ruthless approach in his conquests. He regarded enemies as obstacles to be eradicated, and mercilessly sacked several cities, including Baghdad. Hulagu was notorious for his cruelty, as he massacred thousands of civilians and destroyed everything in his path. The prime example of his brutality was the sacking of Baghdad, where renowned libraries and centers of knowledge were destroyed, resulting in a significant loss of invaluable historical and intellectual treasures.
In terms of the treatment of rulers, Genghis Khan was known for his pragmatic approach. He respected the authority and intelligence of the rulers he conquered and often incorporated them into his own governance structure. In fact, several conquered rulers, such as the Khwarezmshah, became loyal allies of Khan and served as valuable resources in his administration. In this way, Genghis Khan was able to use the expertise of these rulers to strengthen and stabilize his empire.
Conversely, Hulagu had a different approach when it came to dealing with rulers. He was notorious for his lack of empathy and often executed or imprisoned conquered rulers, considering them a threat to his authority. This harsh treatment resulted in constant rebellions and instilled fear in the hearts of the conquered people.
In conclusion, Genghis Khan and Hulagu had contrasting approaches in their conquests. While Genghis Khan adopted a more diplomatic and inclusive approach, Hulagu was known for his cruelty and brutality. These differing approaches had a long-lasting impact on the conquered territories and rulers, with Genghis Khan’s leniency leading to stability and prosperity, and Hulagu’s ruthlessness breeding fear and rebellion.
