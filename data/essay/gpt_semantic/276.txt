Garnier's advertisement for their new hair food shampoo is a rather compelling and persuasive commercial targeted towards young adults and teenagers. In this essay, I will analyze the strengths and weaknesses of this advertisement, how it effectively appeals to the audience, and suggest strategies that could be used to improve the commercial in the future.
One of the strengths of Garnier's advertisement is its use of relatable characters and situations. The commercial begins by showing a young woman struggling with her hair, which is a situation many teenagers and young adults can relate to. By depicting a common problem, the advertisement immediately captures the audience's attention.
Furthermore, the advertisement makes effective use of bright colors and upbeat music, creating a positive and lively atmosphere. These visual and auditory elements appeal to the target audience by portraying a sense of joy and excitement associated with using the product. This helps strengthen the advertisement's main claim that Garnier's hair food shampoo is transformative and can bring happiness to the consumer.
In addition, the commercial cleverly incorporates before and after shots of the young woman's hair. This technique allows the audience to witness the immediate and noticeable results of using the shampoo. By visually demonstrating the shampoo's effectiveness, Garnier establishes credibility and strengthens its claim that their product can truly improve one's hair.
However, despite these strengths, there are some weaknesses in Garnier's advertisement as well. One of the weaknesses is the lack of diversity in the characters presented. The commercial only focuses on one specific type of person, potentially alienating those who do not identify with the portrayed individual. Including a more diverse range of characters would make the advertisement more inclusive and relatable to a wider audience.
Moreover, the commercial could benefit from providing more concrete evidence or scientific facts to support its claims. While the before and after shots are visually effective, they do not provide substantial evidence for the product's long-term benefits. Including testimonials from real consumers or references to scientific studies could strengthen the advertisement's claims and make it more persuasive.
To improve the commercial in the future, Garnier could consider employing testimonials from influential social media personalities or beauty experts. This strategy would enhance the advertisement's credibility and resonate more with the target audience. Additionally, incorporating information about the ingredients or formulation of the hair food shampoo could help educate consumers about the product's unique selling points.
Garnier could also consider diversifying the cast of characters in their advertisement. Including individuals of different ethnicities, genders, and hair types would not only demonstrate the shampoo's versatility but also make the commercial more inclusive and appealing to a wider audience.
Finally, adding a call to action at the end of the commercial could strengthen its effectiveness. Encouraging viewers to visit Garnier's website for more information or to try a sample of the product would motivate them to take action. This would increase the likelihood of them engaging with the brand and ultimately purchasing the hair food shampoo.
In conclusion, Garnier's advertisement for their hair food shampoo effectively appeals to the target audience by utilizing relatable characters and situations, vibrant colors and music, and visual evidence of the product's effectiveness. However, there is room for improvement, such as diversifying the cast of characters and providing more concrete evidence for the product's claims. By incorporating these strategies and adding a call to action, Garnier could enhance the commercial's overall impact and persuasive power.
