In both "Everyday Use" by Alice Walker and "Sonny's Blues" by James Baldwin, the treatment of education plays a significant role in shaping the characters' lives. Although the stories are set in different time periods and environments, the authors explore the transformative power of education and its effects on individuals' identities, aspirations, and relationships.
In "Everyday Use," the character of Dee serves as a representation of the importance of education in the pursuit of a better life. Dee, who changes her name to Wangero, embraces her African roots and takes pride in her newfound knowledge about her heritage. She values education as a means to escape her rural roots and transcend her background. The quilts in the story serve as a symbol of familial history and legacy, with Dee desiring to possess them as artifacts rather than using them for their intended purpose. Education has given Dee a newfound perspective on her family's history, which ultimately alienates her from her mother and sister.
On the contrary, in "Sonny's Blues," the character of Sonny employs education as a means of self-expression and liberation from the harsh realities of his surroundings. Sonny's passion for jazz music serves as an outlet to cope with his troubled life. Through the guidance of his music teacher, Sonny finds solace and purpose in his studies, allowing him to transcend his oppressed existence. Although his brother initially discourages Sonny's pursuit of music due to the irregularity and instability it brings to his life, it is through his education and the understanding of his music that the brothers are able to bridge the gap of misunderstanding and forge a genuine connection.
The treatment of education affects the characters' lives differently in each story. In "Everyday Use," Dee's pursuit of education results in a divide between her and her family. Her belief in using education to elevate herself above her roots ultimately results in her inability to connect with her family, viewing them as ignorant and lacking cultural awareness. This estrangement highlights the clash between Dee's newfound identity and her family's historical roots. However, it also allows Mama and Maggie to reaffirm their bond and strengthen their sense of heritage, appreciating the value of their ancestral quilts as more than just objects.
On the other hand, in "Sonny's Blues," education serves as a catalyst for reconciliation and healing. Sonny's pursuit of music and education allows him to express his emotions and confront his demons, while also enabling his brother to understand him on a deeper level. It is through Sonny's education that the brothers are able to bridge the gap caused by their differing lifestyles and experiences. Education becomes a way for Sonny to escape his troubled past and find redemption through his art.
In conclusion, the treatment of education in "Everyday Use" and "Sonny's Blues" plays a vital role in shaping the characters' lives. While education can create divisions and misunderstandings, as seen in "Everyday Use," it also has the power to heal and connect, as shown in "Sonny's Blues." Through education, the characters are able to transform their lives, find their true identities, and foster greater understanding within themselves and their relationships.
