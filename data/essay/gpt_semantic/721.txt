Introduction:
John Milton's Paradise Lost and William Shakespeare's Othello hold a prominent position in the world of literature for their skillful and intricate use of contrast and semantic imagery. Through the masterful deployment of dark and light imagery, both authors convey profound meanings and reinforce the boundaries between good and evil in their respective works. However, these works also challenge traditional interpretations, showcasing the complexity and fluidity of these semantic symbols. This essay will delve into the depths of these contrasting symbols, exploring how Milton and Shakespeare manipulate the power of dark and light imagery to emphasize the nuances of human morality and the multifaceted nature of good and evil.
The Power of Dark and Light Imagery:
Both Milton and Shakespeare employ dark and light imagery to amplify the moral boundaries and draw attention to the human struggle between good and evil. In Paradise Lost, darkness represents chaos and evil, whereas light represents order and virtue. Satan and his fallen angels reside in the abyss of darkness, while God and his angels dwell in the divine radiance of light. This stark contrast highlights the eternal discord between these entities and reinforces the boundaries between good and evil.
Similarly, Othello exhibits contrasting associations with darkness and light. Iago, the epitome of deception and villainy, often refers to his malicious plans as being carried out under the cover of darkness. Describing his manipulations, Iago asserts, "When devils do the blackest sins put on, / They do suggest at first with heavenly shows, / As I do now" (II. iii. 380-382). By associating his nefarious schemes with the darkness, Iago illustrates the inherent connection between evil deeds and shadowy circumstances. In contrast, Desdemona, an embodiment of innocence and purity, is frequently associated with light. After her death, Emilia emphasizes her celestial qualities by proclaiming, "She was heavenly true" (V. ii. 125). Therefore, both Milton and Shakespeare eloquently utilize dark and light imagery to accentuate the boundaries that separate good from evil.
Challenging Traditional Interpretation:
However, Milton and Shakespeare do not limit themselves to a simplistic portrayal of black and white morality; instead, they employ dark and light imagery to challenge traditional interpretations and demonstrate the complex nature of these semantic symbols. In Paradise Lost, Milton gives Lucifer, the embodiment of evil, moments of lightness and eloquence. Despite being cast into darkness, Lucifer exhibits remarkable charisma and intelligence, which captivate both his fellow fallen angels and the readers alike. This subversion of traditional interpretations insinuates that evil is not merely a void of light; it possesses qualities that can be beguiling and attractive.
Similarly, in Othello, Shakespeare blurs the lines between good and evil, complicating the associations of darkness and light. Othello, a noble and virtuous character, succumbs to Iago's manipulations and transforms into a malicious murderer. In his moment of darkness, Othello remarks, "When I have plucked the rose, / I cannot give it vital growth again" (V. ii. 13-14). This metaphorical language offers insight into Othello's internal struggle, revealing that even the noblest individuals can succumb to the darkness within. Shakespeare presents a morally complex character, highlighting the unpredictable nature of human morality and the fragility of good under certain circumstances.
The Complexity of Semantic Symbols:
Milton and Shakespeare's works transcend conventional interpretations by showcasing the multifaceted nature of semantic symbols associated with darkness and light. In Paradise Lost, light metaphorically represents God's law and reason, while darkness signifies human freedom and passion. Milton acknowledges that the choices humans make are not inherently good or evil; instead, the alignment with either side depends on the motivations and intentions behind those choices. Adam and Eve, the central human characters, commit the original sin in broad daylight and are aware of the consequences, signifying that the boundary between good and evil lies within the human heart.
In Othello, Shakespeare expands upon the symbolism of light and darkness to highlight the subjective nature of these concepts. When Othello descends into jealousy and rage, he declares, "Put out the light, and then put out the light" (V. ii. 7). The repeated use of "light" here alludes to both Desdemona's life and his own sense of clarity, or moral compass. By extinguishing the light, Othello signifies a deliberate choice to abandon reason and surrender to his darker impulses. This portrayal nuances the association between light and moral goodness, reminding the audience of the fragile nature of human character and the temptation to reject reason in favor of temporary emotional gratification.
Conclusion:
In Paradise Lost and Othello, John Milton and William Shakespeare employ dark and light imagery to convey complex meanings and challenge traditional interpretations. Through these symbols, they reinstate the boundaries between good and evil, while simultaneously exploring the fluidity and complexity of human morality. Ultimately, these works showcase the intricate interplay between light and darkness, emphasizing that the true nature of good and evil lies within the depths of the human psyche, transcending mere external appearances.
