The film "12 Years a Slave" explores the themes of collectivism and individualism in the context of slavery, shedding light on the worldwide issue of human rights. Through the portrayal of prejudice, generalizations, stereotyping, and discrimination against black people, the movie highlights the significant impact these have on the characters' experiences.
Throughout the film, collectivism is portrayed as a tool used by slaveholders to maintain control over their slaves. The slaves are viewed as property rather than individuals, with their lives and worth determined solely by their work output. This collectivist mindset dehumanizes the slaves, reducing them to objects for labor. For example, in one scene, the characters of Solomon and Patsey argue over soap, demonstrating the devaluation of individual needs and desires.
In contrast, the film also touches upon individualism, depicted through the character of Solomon Northup. Solomon struggles to maintain his individual sense of self, clinging to his free status despite being in bondage. His constant desire for freedom and resistance against the oppressive system demonstrate the power of individualism even in the face of overwhelming collectivist pressure.
Another theme explored in the movie is the worldwide issue of slavery, portraying it not simply as a Southern or American problem, but rather as a deep-rooted societal issue. The film showcases the global nature of slavery by including characters from different backgrounds involved in the slave trade. For instance, Mr. Ford, a relatively compassionate slaveowner, acknowledges that the slaves he owns were likely captured by Africans themselves, highlighting the international collaboration that sustained the slave trade.
Prejudice, generalizations, stereotyping, and discrimination against black people are depicted vividly throughout the movie, deeply impacting the characters' experiences. Slaveholders, driven by prejudice and stereotypes, perpetuated discriminatory practices towards black people. For instance, from the very beginning, Solomon is caught off guard when he is kidnapped and sold into slavery solely based on his skin color. This demonstrates how deeply ingrained prejudices against black people were during this time period.
Furthermore, the film portrays the physical and mental abuse inflicted on slaves, exacerbating their experiences of discrimination. The cruel treatment they endured served as a means to reinforce the racial stereotypes that perpetuated the institution of slavery. Slaves like Patsey, who were perceived as threats to the delicate social order, faced severe punishment and derogatory treatment as a result.
The impact of prejudice and discrimination is depicted through the characters' internal struggles. Solomon's struggle to maintain his dignity despite facing constant oppression illustrates the psychological toll that racism and discrimination took on the individuals enslaved. The film highlights how these discriminatory practices permeated every aspect of the slaves' lives, leaving no room for personal identity or self-expression.
In conclusion, "12 Years a Slave" skillfully explores the themes of collectivism and individualism in the context of slavery, shedding light on the worldwide issue of human rights. The portrayal of prejudice, generalizations, stereotyping, and discrimination against black people vividly illustrates the deep-rooted societal issues that perpetuated and sustained the institution of slavery. By examining the impact of these practices on the characters' experiences, the film serves as a powerful reminder of the ongoing struggle for recognition and equality.
