Introduction:
Design plays a pivotal role in various fields, including the construction of Sterile Processing Departments (SPDs) in medical facilities. An efficient SPD design is essential for the proper processing and reprocessing of instruments, ultimately preventing cross-contamination and ensuring the overall effectiveness of the department. This essay will explore the importance of design in SPDs, focusing on adhering to industry standards and implementing a dirty-to-clean workflow to maximize efficiency and minimize the risk of cross-contamination.
