Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison was a significant court case that raised important questions about workplace accommodations and religious freedom. In this essay, we will discuss the alternatives suggested by the Court of Appeals and examine why none of these alternatives were considered viable in the long-run. We will also analyze whether it would have been fair for TWA to grant special treatment to Hardison.
In the case of Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, the Court of Appeals suggested several alternatives that could have potentially resolved the conflict between TWA's scheduling requirements and Hardison's religious practices. These alternatives include allowing Hardison to trade shifts with other employees, hiring temporary workers to cover for Hardison during his religious observances, and even requiring other employees to accommodate Hardison's needs.
While these alternatives may seem viable on the surface, they were ultimately proven to be impractical in the long-run. Allowing Hardison to trade shifts with other employees might have initially seemed like a fair solution, but it would have created a burden on the other employees who would have had to make compromises in their own schedules. This could have led to discontentment among the workforce and potentially discrimination against Hardison by his colleagues who might perceive him as receiving special treatment.
Hiring temporary workers to cover for Hardison during his religious observances also raises significant challenges. Temporarily hiring workers can be costly and time-consuming for the company, especially if Hardison's religious observances occur regularly. Moreover, training temporary staff for just a few shifts would not be efficient for TWA, and might even lead to safety or service quality concerns. It is also important to note that Hardison's religious commitments were outside the scope of the job requirements when he was initially hired, making it unreasonable to expect TWA to incur additional expenses to accommodate them.
Requiring other employees to accommodate Hardison's needs might have seemed like a fair solution as well. However, this would have violated the rights of the other employees who might have different religious or personal commitments of their own. Granting Hardison special treatment would have set a precedent that could potentially lead to other employees demanding similar accommodations in the future. This could have created a chaotic and divisive work environment, prioritizing individual preferences over the overall functioning of the company.
Considering all these factors, it becomes clear that none of the alternatives suggested by the Court of Appeals were viable in the long-run. The court recognized these challenges as well and ultimately decided against forcing TWA to grant special treatment to Hardison as it would have been unfair to the company and its other employees.
It is important to note that religious freedom is a fundamental right protected by the United States Constitution. However, this freedom should not impede the functioning of a business or hinder the rights of other individuals. In the case of TWA, the company had a responsibility to ensure the smooth operation of its business and respect the rights of all employees equally.
In conclusion, the alternatives proposed by the Court of Appeals in the case of Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison were not viable in the long-run due to practical and fairness concerns. Allowing Hardison to trade shifts, hiring temporary workers, or requiring other employees to accommodate his religious observances would have created hardships for the company and its employees. While it is important to respect religious freedoms, it must be done within reasonable boundaries to ensure a fair and harmonious work environment for all.
