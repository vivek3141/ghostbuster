Loneliness is a prominent theme in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and it plays a vital role in shaping the Monster's character. Throughout the novel, both Victor Frankenstein and his creation experience profound feelings of isolation, which leads to the Monster's transformation from a curious being to a resentful creature seeking revenge.
From the beginning, the Monster faces rejection and abandonment, which fuels his loneliness. Upon his creation, Victor Frankenstein immediately flees in horror, leaving the Monster to fend for himself. This abandonment is the catalyst for the Monster's feelings of isolation, as he is left to navigate the world alone, devoid of guidance and companionship. The Monster's loneliness is particularly evident when observing the DeLacey family; he longs to be a part of their lives, to have human connection, but he is unable to make contact due to his hideous appearance.
Furthermore, Shelley explores loneliness through the Monster's desire for a companion. The Monster pleads with Victor to create another being like him, stating that "I am alone and miserable; man will not associate with me" (Shelley 163). This yearning for companionship highlights the Monster's deep-rooted loneliness and his longing to be understood by someone. Shelley uses the Monster's desire for a mate as a means to emphasize his desperate need to escape the confines of isolation.
As the story progresses, the Monster's loneliness turns him into a vengeful being. After being continuously rejected by society, he realizes that he will never be accepted, so he seeks revenge against his creator. By murdering those close to Victor, such as his best friend Henry Clerval and his bride Elizabeth, the Monster ensures that Victor feels the same pain he does â€“ loneliness. The creature's brutal acts are a direct result of the anguish he endured from being isolated and scorned.
Ultimately, it can be argued that Shelley's portrayal of loneliness is intended to evoke sympathy for the Monster. By highlighting how the Monster's isolation drives him to seek companionship and eventually vengeance, Shelley suggests that society's mistreatment of individuals can lead to monstrous consequences. The Monster, although initially a sympathetic character yearning for love and acceptance, is transformed into a ruthless being due to his experiences with loneliness.
In conclusion, loneliness serves as a central theme in Frankenstein, shaping the Monster's character and actions. Through his abandonment, desire for companionship, and subsequent acts of vengeance, Shelley demonstrates how the Monster's profound loneliness can have devastating effects. This exploration of loneliness ultimately prompts readers to reflect on the consequences of isolation and the need for human connection.
