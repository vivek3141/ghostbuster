Rousseau’s concept of self-love, as delineated in his works, is a fundamental aspect of human nature that can be understood through the lens of two distinct manifestations: amour de soi-même and amour-propre. While both forms of self-love play crucial roles in shaping societal interactions, they differ significantly in nature and have varying effects on perpetuating inequalities across various aspects of life. In this essay, I will explore Rousseau’s concept of self-love, the two manifestations it takes, and its application to analyzing the portrayal of a totalitarian society in George Orwell’s novel 1984.
To begin, Rousseau defines amour de soi-même, or self-love, as an innate sense of self-preservation and instinctual care that is present in all human beings. It is the natural love one has for oneself, which manifests in the desire for self-preservation, physical well-being, and avoidance of pain. This form of self-love, according to Rousseau, is rooted in the basic human instinct and is not inherently negative. For instance, a person who feels hungry and seeks food to satiate that hunger is acting out of amour de soi-même. It is a healthy form of self-love that is essential for individual flourishing and survival.
On the other hand, Rousseau introduces another manifestation of self-love called amour-propre, or self-esteem. Unlike amour de soi-même, amour-propre is a socially constructed form of self-love that arises from the perceptions and judgments of others. It is fueled by comparison and the need for recognition, superiority, and validation. Unlike amour de soi-même, which arises naturally, amour-propre is a learned behavior that develops as individuals interact with society. Rousseau argues that amour-propre is the root cause of many human vices and the source of inequalities in society.
The nature of these two manifestations of self-love differs greatly. While amour de soi-même is a natural and essential aspect of human nature, amour-propre is an artificial construct that emerges from societal pressures. In Rousseau’s view, amour de soi-même is a pure form of self-love that does not harm others since it is primarily concerned with self-preservation and well-being. However, amour-propre is ego-driven and volatile in nature, as it relies on external validation and competition for a sense of worth. Rousseau argues that this form of self-love breeds jealousy, vanity, and arrogance, leading to a state of constant comparison and rivalry with others.
The effects of these two forms of self-love extend to societal interactions. Amour de soi-même, being rooted in self-preservation, encourages individuals to seek cooperation and mutual support, as it recognizes the value of others for one’s own well-being. This form of self-love leads to healthy relationships and cooperation among individuals in a society. In contrast, amour-propre creates a negative cycle of competition and comparison. Individuals driven by amour-propre constantly seek validation and superior status, leading to a fractured society characterized by envy, resentment, and a perpetual struggle for recognition. Rousseau argues that amour-propre contributes to the creation of a social hierarchy, as individuals seek to maintain superiority over others to satisfy their ego-driven desires.
The role of these two forms of self-love in perpetuating inequalities is evident across various aspects of life. In Rousseau’s writings, he highlights the influence of amour-propre in the political realm. For instance, he argues that amour-propre leads to the establishment of an unjust social contract, favoring the powerful over the weak. The powerful individuals are driven by amour-propre to ensure their superiority and control, often at the expense of the less socially privileged. This unequal distribution of power and resources perpetuates social inequalities and serves as a basis for societal divisions.
Applying Rousseau’s concept to Orwell’s novel, 1984, the manifestation of amour-propre can be seen in the Party’s totalitarian regime. The Party seeks ultimate control and dominance over its citizens through various means, including surveillance, manipulation, and mind control. The citizens in this society are constantly subjected to the Party’s scrutiny, comparison, and judgment. Their self-esteem, or amour-propre, is systematically eroded, leaving them powerless and subservient to the Party’s authority. The Party sustains its power by manipulating the citizens’ need for recognition and validation, ensuring that their diminished self-worth prevents any resistance or rebellion.
In conclusion, Rousseau’s concept of self-love encompasses two distinct manifestations: amour de soi-même and amour-propre. While both forms play integral roles in shaping societal interactions, they differ significantly in nature and have varying effects on perpetuating inequalities in various aspects of life. Amour de soi-même is a natural and healthy form of self-love, rooted in self-preservation. In contrast, amour-propre is an artificial construct driven by external validation and comparison. It leads to a fractured society characterized by competition and the perpetuation of hierarchies. Applying these concepts to Orwell’s novel 1984, the manifestation of amour-propre can be seen in the Party’s totalitarian regime, which manipulates citizens’ self-esteem to maintain control. Rousseau’s insights on self-love provide valuable perspectives on the dynamics of societal interactions and the perpetuation of inequalities.
