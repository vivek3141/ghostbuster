Moral universalism and moral relativism are two contrasting theories that attempt to understand the nature of morality. While moral relativism posits that moral principles are subjective and vary across different cultures and individuals, moral universalism argues that there are objective moral truths that hold true for all people, regardless of their cultural or individual perspectives. In my view, moral universalism provides a more truthful understanding of morality, as the arguments made in favor of moral relativism ultimately lead back to the existence of a common core moral code and the importance of regulating human relations.
One of the key arguments made in favor of moral relativism is cultural diversity. Proponents of this theory argue that moral principles arise from and are shaped by the specific cultural, historical, and environmental contexts in which individuals live. They suggest that different cultures have different moral values and that it is unfair to judge one society's morals from the perspective of another. While it is true that cultures may have varying moral customs and practices, there exists a common core moral code that is shared amongst them. For instance, across different cultures, there is a general consensus that killing innocents is morally wrong, as it goes against the fundamental principle of preserving human life.
Another argument often presented in favor of moral relativism is individual subjectivity. According to this perspective, moral values are subjective and vary among individuals based on their personal beliefs, emotions, and experiences. However, even within this subjectivity, there are certain moral values that are universally recognized as important for creating a cohesive society. Acts such as honesty, trustworthiness, and fairness are valued across cultures because they are necessary for building social trust and maintaining harmonious relationships.
Moreover, it is crucial to regulate human relations and create a just society. Moral relativism recognizes the need for moral principles to govern human behavior and protect individuals' rights and well-being. The establishment of laws and social norms in different societies aims to ensure that individuals are treated fairly and with respect. This further highlights the existence of a common core moral code, as these laws and norms often reflect common ethical principles such as justice and equality.
In conclusion, while moral relativism emphasizes the subjective nature of morality, it ultimately leads back to moral universalism. The arguments made in favor of moral relativism highlight the presence of a common core moral code and the necessity of regulating human relations. Moral universalism provides a more truthful theory as it recognizes the objective moral truths that transcend cultural boundaries and underline the importance of ethics in our interactions with others.
