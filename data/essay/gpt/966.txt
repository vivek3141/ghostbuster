Introduction (approx. 200 words)
The proliferation of transportation has revolutionized modern society, connecting people across vast distances and facilitating economic growth. However, the environmental impact of this progress cannot be overlooked. Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, the primary mode of transportation for many decades, have been a significant contributor to air pollution, global warming, and accelerated climate change. In this essay, we will discuss the adverse environmental effects of ICE vehicles and highlight the benefits of transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs) as a viable solution.
