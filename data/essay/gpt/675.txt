The opera "Coronation of Poppea" challenges traditional notions of marriage and fidelity through its depiction of adultery in several ways. It subverts the idea of monogamous relationships by portraying characters who are unfaithful to their partners. This theme is explored through the use of various musical techniques, including arias, recitatives, and choruses.
In "Coronation of Poppea," adultery is portrayed as a normal part of the characters' lives. The characters are not restrained by societal expectations of faithfulness in their relationships. This challenges the traditional notion of marriage as a sacred bond between two individuals.
One way in which the opera explores the theme of adultery is through the use of arias. Arias are solo pieces that allow the characters to express their emotions and desires. In "Coronation of Poppea," the arias showcase the characters' inner conflicts and desires for extramarital affairs.

They represent the collective voice of society and highlight the moral implications of adultery. The choruses add depth to the opera by contrasting the individual desires of the characters with the societal norms. Through the choruses, the opera challenges the audience to question the traditional notions of marriage and fidelity.
In terms of musical composition, the opera "Coronation of Poppea" features a variety of instruments commonly found in Baroque orchestras. These instruments include strings, woodwinds, and brass.
