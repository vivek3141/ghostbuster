Currency exchange rates can have a significant impact on the profitability of international trade, and it is crucial for companies to carefully analyze this aspect before making decisions. In the case of our company's trade in Malaysia, we will evaluate three scenarios: adjusting for currency fluctuations, using a fixed rate mentioned in the contract, and avoiding currency exchange by purchasing raw materials in MYR. This analysis will consider both short-term and long-term perspectives to recommend the most viable and profitable option for our firm.
Firstly, adjusting for currency fluctuations could have both advantages and disadvantages. In the short term, it allows our company to minimize the negative impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. By closely monitoring the exchange rates and promptly adjusting the selling price of our products in MYR, we can maintain stable profit margins even in times of currency volatility. Additionally, this strategy allows us to be responsive to changes in the market and maintain competitiveness.
However, in the long term, constantly adjusting prices to account for currency fluctuations may have negative consequences. Frequent price adjustments can lead to confusion among customers and decrease their trust in our company. Moreover, constantly changing prices might make it challenging to build long-term relationships with local suppliers and customers. Suppliers might lose confidence in us, and customers might consider switching to more stable suppliers. Hence, while adjusting for currency fluctuations may be suitable for short-term profitability, it may not be the best option in the long run.
Using a fixed exchange rate mentioned in the contract is another scenario that we can evaluate. This approach provides stability and predictability to our business transactions. By specifying a fixed exchange rate in the contract, we eliminate the uncertainty caused by currency fluctuations. This allows both our company and our customers in Malaysia to plan their budgets more accurately and make informed decisions.
In the short term, using a fixed exchange rate can protect our profitability by preventing sudden decreases in the value of Malaysian Ringgit (MYR). This ensures that the profit margin remains constant, irrespective of any currency fluctuations. It also simplifies financial planning and reduces the need for constant monitoring of exchange rates.
However, in the long term, relying on a fixed exchange rate can be risky. If the MYR appreciates significantly against our home currency, we may end up selling our products at a lower price, leading to reduced profit margins. This situation may arise if the fixed rate is not adjusted periodically to reflect the actual market conditions. Additionally, if the contract specifies a fixed rate above the prevailing market rate, our customers in Malaysia may find our products expensive compared to competitors, which could result in a loss of market share.
Lastly, avoiding currency exchange altogether by purchasing raw materials in MYR is an option that warrants consideration. By sourcing materials locally and transacting in the local currency, our company eliminates the exchange rate risk entirely. This approach would provide stability in both the short and long term, as any changes in the exchange rate would not affect the cost of raw materials.
Furthermore, purchasing raw materials in MYR can have additional benefits. It strengthens our relationship with local suppliers and allows us to support domestic businesses. We may even negotiate better terms with local suppliers, as they may prefer to deal in their own currency.
However, there may be challenges associated with this approach, such as the availability and quality of raw materials locally. Depending on the industry, sourcing everything locally may not be feasible. Additionally, there could be restrictions on imports, limiting our options for purchasing materials in MYR.
Considering both short-term and long-term perspectives, the most viable and profitable option for our firm seems to be a combination of adjusting for currency fluctuations and avoiding currency exchange by purchasing raw materials in MYR. By monitoring exchange rates and adjusting prices when necessary, we can mitigate short-term risks. Simultaneously, by sourcing materials locally in MYR, we can ensure stability and reduce the impact of long-term currency fluctuations.
In conclusion, the impact of currency exchange on the profitability of our company's trade in Malaysia is significant. Analyzing three scenarios – adjusting for currency fluctuations, using a fixed exchange rate, and avoiding currency exchange – enables us to make an informed recommendation. By strategically combining the approaches mentioned, we can maximize profitability in both the short and long term.
