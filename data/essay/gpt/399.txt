On one hand, lookism represents the pervasive bias and discrimination based on physical appearance. It perpetuates the idea that beauty is paramount and equates it with success, power, and desirability. Lookism fuels negative societal judgments and stereotypes, leading to various consequences ranging from lower self-esteem to limited personal and professional opportunities.
On the other hand, extreme body modification is the pursuit of altering one's physical appearance through drastic means, such as plastic surgery, tattoos, or piercings. Although it may seem distinct from lookism, both phenomena share the same roots in unhealthy beauty standards. Extreme body modification can be seen as a response to the pressure to conform to the societal ideal of beauty, pushing individuals to go to extreme lengths to attain it.
The underlying motivations behind lookism and extreme body modification are closely tied to societal expectations, particularly for women. Women are bombarded with unrealistic beauty standards portrayed by the media, reinforcing the notion that they must conform to a narrow and unattainable ideal. This results in immense pressure to fit into this mold, leading to a rise in body dissatisfaction and a drive to modify one's appearance drastically.
Goode's book highlights the social construction of beauty ideals and the impact they have on individuals who deviate from the standardized norm. Society perpetuates these beauty standards by placing a premium on physical attractiveness, thus marginalizing those who do not conform. Such societal pressures contribute to negative body image and increased rates of extreme body modifications.
In conclusion, lookism and extreme body modification are interconnected phenomena that are deeply rooted in unhealthy beauty standards prevalent in modern society. They both emerge from societal pressures and expectations, particularly for women, perpetuated by media, culture, and other external factors. Goode's book emphasizes the detrimental effects of these phenomena, shedding light on the urgent need for a shift in societal beauty standards towards inclusivity, acceptance, and healthy body image.
