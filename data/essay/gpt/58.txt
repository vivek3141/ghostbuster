In "Annabel Lee," the speaker opens the poem by introducing the readers to his great love, Annabel Lee. He describes Annabel Lee as a maiden who lived in a kingdom by the sea. The repetitive use of her name throughout the poem emphasizes her significance, portraying the strong bond they shared. This repetition establishes the foundation for the theme of undying love in the poem.
The speaker's adoration for Annabel Lee reaches beyond mere affection or infatuation. Throughout the poem, Poe employs a range of vivid and haunting imagery to evoke the depth of their connection. For instance, the speaker describes their love as being so profound that "envy of the angels in Heaven" arose. This imagery not only emphasizes the superiority of their love but also hints at the celestial quality of their relationship, elevating their love to a divine level.
Furthermore, Poe employs various symbols throughout the poem that add layers of meaning to the theme of undying love. The kingdom by the sea, where Annabel Lee lived, represents a utopia untouched by time and death. It stands as a symbol of the purity and innocence of their love. The sea itself, a recurring symbol in Poe's works, symbolizes the vastness and eternity of the speaker's devotion. Despite Annabel Lee's physical death, the speaker's love continues to flow like the eternal waves of the sea.
Moreover, the poem explores the concept of immortality through the imagery of the moon. The speaker declares that "the moon never beams without bringing me dreams/ Of the beautiful Annabel Lee." Here, the moon serves as a symbol of eternity, suggesting that their love transcends the boundaries of life and death. The speaker's dreams of Annabel Lee imply that their love is so powerful that it surpasses the boundaries of the tangible world and exists in the realm of dreams and memories.
Additionally, the repetition of the phrase "in this kingdom by the sea" throughout the poem adds to the sense of eternal love. By using this repetition, Poe reinforces the idea that their love is not confined to the realm of earthly existence but stretches beyond into eternity.
The speaker's love for Annabel Lee intensifies after her death. He becomes consumed with grief and continues to mourn her loss, even after she is buried in the sepulcher. He goes on to insist that their love is so strong that not even death can separate them. The speaker believes that the angels in Heaven were envious of their love, and, as a result, they sent down a chilling wind that caused Annabel Lee's death. The imagery of the wind, once again, emphasizes the inescapable power of death.
Despite the tragic ending, the speaker's love for Annabel Lee remains unwavering. He declares that their souls are entwined and that he and Annabel Lee are soulmates. The use of the word "entwined" conveys the intermingling of their souls, suggesting that their love has merged into something greater than themselves.
The theme of undying love is also reinforced through the repetition of the line "For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams/ Of the beautiful Annabel Lee." Even after her death, the speaker's dreams ensure that Annabel Lee is always present in his life. The vivid imagery of the moon beaming suggests that their love continues to radiate, providing the speaker solace and a connection to his beloved even in death.
