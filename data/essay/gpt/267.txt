In her essay "Framing Class, Vicarious Living, and Conspicuous Consumption," Diana Kendall argues that the media plays a significant role in shaping the perception of social class and contributes to legitimate inequality in society. Through the portrayal of the upper and lower classes, the media shapes public opinion and influences human behavior, thereby impacting the quality of life for lower-class individuals.
Kendall highlights how the media often constructs a skewed image of the upper class, depicting them as elite, powerful, and glamorous. Such portrayals create an aspirational narrative that normalizes the pursuit of wealth and material possessions. These images of opulence and indulgence fuel a sense of vicarious living, wherein individuals seek to align themselves with the lifestyles and values of the upper class. Consequently, this glorification of wealth contributes to the widening gap between the rich and the poor.
Conversely, the media often perpetuates negative stereotypes of the lower class, portraying them as lazy, unintelligent, and deserving of their poverty. Such images reinforce societal biases and fuel the belief that lower-class individuals are solely responsible for their socioeconomic status. As a result, the media's portrayal of the lower class perpetuates a sense of social stigma and further marginalizes these individuals, making it even more challenging for them to improve their quality of life.
The impact of media portrayal is not limited to shaping public opinion but also extends to human behavior. Kendall argues that individuals often strive to achieve a specific social status, driven by the media's portrayal of class distinctions. This pursuit creates a culture of conspicuous consumption, where individuals prioritize material possessions as a symbol of status and success. Consequently, lower-class individuals, influenced by media messages, may engage in excessive spending and accumulate debt as they attempt to keep up with the perceived status symbols.
The subsequent effects of media influence on the quality of life for lower-class individuals are profound. The emphasis on material possession and conspicuous consumption perpetuated by the media increases the financial strain on lower-class individuals. These individuals are more likely to prioritize acquiring material goods over investing in education, healthcare, or personal growth. Consequently, their access to opportunities for upward mobility becomes further limited, exacerbating the cycle of poverty.
In conclusion, the media wields significant influence in shaping the perception of social class and contributes to the legitimate inequality in society. By portraying the upper class as aspirational and the lower class as inferior, the media molds public opinion and influences human behavior. These media messages fuel a culture of conspicuous consumption, widening the gap between the rich and the poor and detrimentally impacting the quality of life for lower-class individuals. It is crucial for society to critically engage with the media's portrayal of social class and work towards dismantling the stereotypes that perpetuate inequality.
