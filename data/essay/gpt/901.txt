Achieving Core and Specialty Competencies in a DNP Program: The Role of Nursing and Science-Based Theories in Healthcare Delivery
Introduction
The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program has been a transformative journey that has not only equipped me with core and specialty competencies but has also deepened my understanding of the role of nursing and science-based theories in healthcare. Throughout this program, I have gained valuable insights into the importance of interdisciplinary research and practice themes, the theory of planned behavior, and the incorporation of scholarly evidence in healthcare delivery models. These concepts have not only enhanced my understanding of collaboration, patient safety, and healthcare delivery but also informed my DPI project and future practice improvement interventions.
The Role of Nursing and Science-Based Theories in Healthcare
Nursing is a unique profession that combines both art and science. While the art of nursing revolves around compassionate care, empathy, and therapeutic communication, the science of nursing is grounded in evidence-based practice (EBP) and scientific theories. Science-based theories provide a framework for understanding and guiding nursing practice, helping nurses make informed decisions that promote positive patient outcomes.
From my coursework, it is evident that nursing theories have a significant impact on healthcare delivery. For example, the Watson's Theory of Human Caring emphasizes the importance of forming a therapeutic relationship with patients, where nurses exhibit empathy, compassion, and respect for their individual needs. Applying this theory in my coursework has enhanced my understanding of the importance of holistic patient care and the role of the nurse as a healer and advocate.
Interdisciplinary Research and Practice Themes
Interdisciplinary research and practice are crucial aspects of healthcare delivery and collaboration. In my DNP program, I have participated in research projects and discussions that brought together professionals from diverse disciplines, such as medicine, pharmacy, and social work. These experiences have greatly contributed to my understanding of the value of collaboration in healthcare.
Working with professionals from different disciplines has allowed me to appreciate their unique perspectives and the importance of integrating these perspectives into patient care. For example, in a case study on pressure injuries, an interdisciplinary team could provide valuable insights into prevention strategies, wound management techniques, and patient education. Through interdisciplinary collaboration, evidence-based decisions can be made, leading to improved healthcare outcomes and patient safety.
Incorporating Scholarly Evidence in Healthcare Delivery Models
The integration of scholarly evidence plays a crucial role in providing efficient and effective healthcare delivery. As healthcare professionals, it is our responsibility to provide care based on the best available evidence. Science-based theories provide a framework for critically evaluating and applying this evidence to practice.
In my coursework, I have engaged in literature review activities where I explored and critically analyzed research studies. These activities have enhanced my ability to evaluate the quality and applicability of evidence and make evidence-based decisions. For example, in a literature review on patient safety practices, I discovered that the implementation of standardized protocols for pressure injury prevention significantly reduced the incidence of pressure injuries in healthcare settings. Armed with this knowledge, I can now confidently advocate for the adoption of evidence-based practices within my own practice setting.
Effectiveness of the Theory of Planned Behavior
The theory of planned behavior (TPB) has proven to be effective in addressing specific health problems, such as pressure injuries. TPB suggests that individuals' behavior is influenced by their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. By targeting these factors, healthcare professionals can design interventions that promote positive health behaviors.
In my practice immersion hours, I had the opportunity to witness the effectiveness of TPB in action. For instance, in a pressure injury prevention program, education sessions were conducted to improve nurses' knowledge and attitudes towards pressure injury prevention. These sessions aimed to reinforce positive attitudes, establish subjective norms, and enhance nurses' perceived behavioral control. As a result, nurses reported increased compliance with pressure injury prevention protocols and a decrease in pressure injury incidence.
Application of Knowledge to DPI Project and Practice Improvement Interventions
The competencies achieved throughout the DNP program have directly informed my DPI project and my approach to practice improvement interventions. The knowledge and skills gained in collaboration, interdisciplinary research, evidence-based practice, and TPB have provided a solid foundation for developing and implementing effective interventions.
For my DPI project, which focuses on reducing pressure injuries in a long-term care facility, I have applied the knowledge gained to inform my interventions. I have engaged in interdisciplinary collaboration with healthcare professionals from diverse disciplines to design a comprehensive prevention program. This program incorporates evidence-based practices and utilizes the TPB framework to address nurses' attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. By utilizing these competencies and theories, the project aims to reduce pressure injury incidence and improve patient safety.
Conclusion
The DNP program has been instrumental in enhancing my understanding and application of core and specialty competencies in nursing. The integration of nursing and science-based theories in healthcare delivery models has not only improved patient outcomes but also enhanced collaboration and patient safety. The theory of planned behavior has proven effective in addressing specific health problems, such as pressure injuries, and practice immersion hours have provided valuable insights into its implementation. By applying the knowledge gained from achieving course competencies, I am better equipped to develop and implement evidence-based interventions in my practice, as exemplified in my DPI project. As I move forward in my nursing career, I am confident that the knowledge and skills gained in this program will continue to inform and enhance my practice improvement interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and healthcare delivery.
