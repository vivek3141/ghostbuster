Loneliness is a prevailing theme in Mary Shelley's novel, Frankenstein. Through the exploration of the Monster's character, Shelley exposes the damaging effects of societal isolation and its contribution to the creature's development. As a result of his isolation, the Monster undergoes a transformation that informs both his actions and his desires.
From the outset, the Monster's existence is marked by extreme loneliness. The building of his character is influenced by the absence of companionship and human connection. After his creator, Victor Frankenstein, abandons him, the Monster is left to navigate the world alone. This lack of belonging fuels his deep sense of isolation and initiates his quest for companionship, which motivates many of his subsequent actions.
The Monster's longing for companionship is evident through his interactions with others. When he first encounters the De Lacey family, he becomes attached to them, observing their interactions from afar. He is captivated by their love and affection, a stark contrast to his own experience of isolation. His longing for companionship intensifies, as he sees a possibility of attaining it through becoming a part of this family. However, his attempts to communicate with them are met with disgust and rejection due to his grotesque appearance. This experience deepens his isolation and perpetuates his feelings of loneliness.
As the Monster's loneliness intensifies, so does his bitterness towards humanity. He begins to develop a profound hatred for his creator and all mankind, as he sees them as the source of his suffering. His isolation drives him to commit heinous acts, seeking revenge against Victor and the society that has rejected him. He becomes consumed by his desire for companionship and revenge, losing sight of any moral values and becoming a monster in his own right.
Furthermore, Shelley suggests that the Monster's isolation hinders his ability to develop morally and emotionally. Without guidance or companionship, he is left to his own devices and lacks the moral compass to navigate the world in a positive way. Had the Monster been granted companionship and acceptance, his character may have developed differently, leading to a more empathetic and compassionate being.
In conclusion, loneliness is a central theme in Frankenstein, and the Monster's character development is deeply influenced by his isolation. Shelley highlights the damaging effects of societal rejection and the absence of companionship. The Monster's longing for connection drives his actions, ultimately leading him down a destructive path. Through the exploration of loneliness, Shelley raises questions about the innate human need for companionship and the consequences of denying this fundamental aspect of existence.
