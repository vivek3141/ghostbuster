In their study "Anxiety level of university students during COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia," Khoshaim et al. aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of university students in Saudi Arabia, specifically focusing on anxiety levels. The study consisted of a survey administered to 500 university students, with questions related to anxiety symptoms, fear of COVID-19, and the perceived impact of the pandemic on their academic performance and social life.
The findings of the study revealed that a significant portion of university students in Saudi Arabia experienced high levels of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors such as fear of contracting the virus, uncertainty about the future, disruption of academic activities, and limited social interaction contributed to heightened anxiety levels. Additionally, female students reported higher levels of anxiety compared to their male counterparts.
This study contributes to our understanding of the impact of the pandemic on students' mental health in Saudi Arabia. By highlighting the specific context of Saudi Arabian university students, it adds to the growing body of literature on the psychological effects of the pandemic across various cultural and socio-economic settings. Moreover, the findings underscore the need for targeted interventions and support services for university students to address their anxiety levels effectively.
Understanding the impact of the pandemic on students' mental health is crucial for both policymakers and educators. Such knowledge enables them to develop appropriate strategies and interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic on students' well-being. By recognizing the specific anxieties faced by university students in Saudi Arabia, this study provides a foundation for tailored support systems that can address the unique challenges faced by this population.
