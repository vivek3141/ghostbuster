Euthanasia, the act of intentionally ending a person's life in order to relieve their suffering, is a deeply controversial subject with profound ethical implications. Three ethical theories – teleology, deontology, and Emmanuel Lévinas' "face of the other" theory – provide different perspectives on euthanasia and consider it to be deeply unethical and contradictory to moral laws. By analyzing the viewpoints of these theories, one can gain a comprehensive understanding of the ethical dimensions of euthanasia.
Teleology, also known as consequentialism, focuses on the outcomes or consequences of an action to determine its ethical value. From a teleological perspective, euthanasia is deemed unethical due to the potential implications it may have on society as a whole. The concern lies in the possibility of granting too much power to individuals to make life-altering decisions. If euthanasia becomes an accepted practice, vulnerable populations such as the disabled, elderly, or mentally ill may be at risk of coercion or abuse. Furthermore, allowing euthanasia can undermine the sanctity of life, as life is seen as disposable and its preservation becomes contingent upon one's quality of life. Teleology emphasizes that preserving human life should be a fundamental moral duty.
On the other hand, deontology, which involves adhering to moral rules or duties regardless of the consequences, also views euthanasia as unethical. Deontologists argue that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, regardless of their outcomes. As per the principle of doing no harm, it is the duty of healthcare professionals to preserve life and alleviate suffering, rather than actively participating in ending it. Deontologists emphasize that there are certain moral laws and duties that should never be violated, and intentionally causing someone's death contradicts these fundamental ethical principles.
Emmanuel Lévinas, a prominent 20th-century philosopher, presents a unique perspective on euthanasia through his "face of the other" theory. Lévinas argues that ethical responsibilities arise from encountering the face of another person, which signifies their individuality, vulnerability, and uniqueness. According to this theory, euthanasia is deeply unethical because it objectifies the other person, reducing them to mere objects of our control and manipulation. By actively ending their life, we fail to acknowledge their inherent dignity and autonomy. Lévinas emphasizes that our ethical responsibility lies in the care and respect we owe to others, particularly those who are most vulnerable and dependent upon us.
Although these three ethical theories approach euthanasia from different angles, they converge in their conviction that euthanasia is deeply unethical and contradictory to moral laws. Teleology argues that the potential consequences of legalizing euthanasia, such as the devaluation of life and the risk of abuse, outweigh any individual's right to end their suffering. Deontology maintains that actively causing harm to another person, even with their consent, violates our moral duty to preserve life. Lévinas' "face of the other" theory encompasses both teleology and deontology, drawing attention to the intrinsic dignity of the other person and the ethical responsibility we have to care for them.
It is crucial to consider these ethical implications when discussing euthanasia. While there are compelling arguments in favor of euthanasia, such as an individual's right to die with dignity and autonomy, the ethical theories discussed above highlight the importance of preserving life, respecting human dignity, and the complex web of relationships that we exist within. The potential for abuse, the devaluation of life, and the objectification of the individual all raise serious ethical concerns that should not be taken lightly.
In conclusion, teleology, deontology, and Emmanuel Lévinas' "face of the other" theory all converge in their view that euthanasia is unethical and contradictory to moral laws. These ethical perspectives emphasize the importance of preserving life, respecting human dignity, and our responsibility to care for others. While the subject of euthanasia may continue to generate debate, acknowledging and understanding the ethical implications from these perspectives is crucial to make informed decisions regarding end-of-life care and respect for human life.
