Furthermore, this track's relevance in the neo-soul genre stems from its introspective and authentic nature. Neo-soul as a genre often explores themes of self-discovery, personal growth, and spirituality. "Bag Lady" perfectly embodies these elements, showcasing Badu's vulnerability and emotional depth. The genre's emphasis on introspection and introspection aligns with the song's message of self-reflection, ultimately deepening our understanding of its meaning.
