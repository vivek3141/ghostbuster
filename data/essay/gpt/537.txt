In the early 20th century, the Harlem Renaissance emerged as a cultural and artistic movement that celebrated the African American experience. During this period, Zora Neale Hurston, a black female writer, made significant contributions to the Harlem Renaissance with her novel "Their Eyes Were Watching God." Through her exploration of themes, use of language, and artistry, Hurston vividly exemplifies the essence of the Harlem Renaissance and the cultural movement occurring in Harlem at that time.
One prominent theme in Hurston's novel that exemplifies the Harlem Renaissance is the search for self-identity. Set in the early 20th century, the story follows a young black woman named Janie Crawford as she embarks on a journey of self-discovery. Janie begins her life conforming to societal expectations and the demands of her two previous husbands, but she ultimately breaks free and finds her own voice and identity. Hurston's depiction of this journey resonates with the Harlem Renaissance's emphasis on self-expression and individualism. Through Janie's quest for self-fulfillment, Hurston mirrors the larger search for identity that was central to the artistic and cultural movement of the Harlem Renaissance.
Furthermore, the language employed in "Their Eyes Were Watching God" demonstrates Hurston's affiliation with the Harlem Renaissance. Hurston, known for her use of African American Vernacular English (AAVE), captures the unique voice and cadence of black southern dialects in her writing. This authentic representation of black speech reflects the Harlem Renaissance's goal of celebrating African American culture and heritage. By embracing AAVE, Hurston highlights the beauty and richness of black language, challenging the notion that only "standard" forms of English are valid. 
In fact, Hurston's use of language in the novel is an artistic tool that mirrors the vibrant and dynamic atmosphere of Harlem during the Renaissance. Her writing is filled with rich metaphors, vivid imagery, and poetic descriptions, creating a sensory experience for the reader. For instance, she enhances the beauty of nature by describing the blossoming pear tree as "a pear tree blossom in the spring" and contrasting it with "the differences between women and men" (Hurston 11). This use of artistry not only captures the essence of the Harlem Renaissance, but also reflects the larger literary trends of the time, where writers sought to experiment with language and form to capture the complexities of the human experience.
Another way Hurston exemplifies the Harlem Renaissance is through her portrayal of female empowerment and sexuality. "Their Eyes Were Watching God" challenges traditional gender roles and presents Janie as a strong, independent woman who defies societal expectations. Through Janie's relationships with her three husbands, Hurston explores the themes of love, desire, and the limitations imposed on women by patriarchal society. Janie's journey to find love on her own terms is not only a personal quest, but also a reflection of the wider social changes occurring during the Harlem Renaissance. The movement encouraged women to assert their independence and claim agency over their own lives, embracing their sexuality and challenging traditional norms.
Moreover, Hurston's depiction of the black community in the novel reflects the communal aspect of the Harlem Renaissance. Hurston paints a vibrant and diverse picture of black life in the fictional town of Eatonville, Florida. Through the use of colorful, memorable characters, she captures the complex social dynamics and cultural richness of the African American community. The Harlem Renaissance was a movement that celebrated community and sought to establish a collective sense of identity and belonging. Hurston's vivid portrayal of the black community brings to life the spirit of camaraderie and solidarity that characterized Harlem during that time period.
Hurston's novel is a testament to her ability to capture the essence of the Harlem Renaissance by embodying its themes, language, and artistic spirit. The themes of self-identity, female empowerment, and communal bonds resonate with the broader cultural movement of the time. Hurston's use of language, particularly her embrace of AAVE, reflects the Harlem Renaissance's celebration of African American culture and heritage. Additionally, her artistry and poetic descriptions create a vivid and sensory experience for the reader, capturing the vibrancy and dynamic atmosphere of Harlem. Overall, "Their Eyes Were Watching God" stands as a testament to Zora Neale Hurston's contribution to the Harlem Renaissance and her ability to capture the spirit of that transformative cultural movement.
