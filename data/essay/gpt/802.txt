The portrayal of whiteness as the default in film, television, and media has long been a prevalent issue in our society. While progress has been made to depict diverse perspectives and narratives, there is still a long way to go. This perpetuation of whiteness as the norm has had a significant impact on perceptions of race and identity, leading to a skewed understanding and unequal representation. In exploring this issue, it can be useful to examine the film "Get Out" and other notable works that shed light on this phenomenon.
"Get Out," directed by Jordan Peele, is a groundbreaking horror film that delves into the experience of being a Black man in America. The story follows Chris Washington, an African-American man, as he visits the home of his white girlfriend's family. The film deftly explores the systemic racism and subtle microaggressions faced by people of color in predominantly white spaces. By presenting an African-American perspective in a genre typically dominated by white narratives, "Get Out" challenges the default portrayal of whiteness in cinema.
One of the most striking portrayals in the film is the character of Rose Armitage, Chris's girlfriend. Rose initially presents herself as a well-meaning, liberal white woman who is empathetic towards racial issues. However, as the narrative progresses, it becomes evident that her intentions are sinister. This portrayal challenges the common stereotype of white saviors and allies, who are often positioned as the moral compasses in stories involving people of color. By subverting this trope, "Get Out" highlights the dangers of assuming well-intentioned whiteness.
Another film that sheds light on the issue of whiteness as the default is "The Dark Knight." Although not explicitly about race, the way it handles Harvey Dent's character is telling. Harvey Dent, a white man, is portrayed as a public hero, his downfall serving as a significant plot point. Meanwhile, the character of Lucius Fox, portrayed by Morgan Freeman, is left to be the voice of reason and moral guidance in the background. This subtle portrayal reinforces the notion that authority and heroism are inherently tied to whiteness, while people of color are relegated to supporting roles.
Moreover, the portrayal of whiteness as the default in media extends beyond casting choices and characters. It encompasses the broader narratives and storylines that are predominantly centered around white perspectives. For instance, in romantic comedies, the primary love stories usually revolve around white characters. The romantic relationships between people of color are often sidelined as secondary or exoticized. This perpetuates the idea that love and romance are primarily the domain of white individuals, marginalizing other racial identities.
The impact of such skewed representations cannot be overstated. They create and reinforce a hierarchy based on race, where whiteness is seen as the gold standard of beauty, success, and normalcy. This has severe consequences for people of color, who often internalize these distorted perceptions, leading to feelings of inferiority and inadequacy. Additionally, the limited representation of diverse backgrounds perpetuates stereotypes, misunderstandings, and even racism, as audiences are not exposed to a wide range of perspectives and experiences.
However, it is crucial to acknowledge that progress has been made in recent years. Films like "Moonlight" and "Black Panther" have shattered records and won critical acclaim, demonstrating the demand for diverse narratives. These films offer nuanced portrayals of Black stories and identities, challenging the preconceived notions of whiteness as the default. Further, initiatives like the "#OscarsSoWhite" movement have shed light on the lack of diversity in Hollywood, resulting in increased discussions surrounding representation and inclusion.
In conclusion, the portrayal of whiteness as the default in film, television, and media has had a significant impact on perceptions of race and identity. The tendency to center narratives around white characters, as well as the limited representation of diverse backgrounds, perpetuates existing inequalities and reinforces harmful stereotypes. However, recent works such as "Get Out" and "Moonlight" have paved the way for more inclusive storytelling, sparking conversations about representation. It is imperative for filmmakers, audiences, and industry gatekeepers to continue challenging the default narrative of whiteness, to create a more equitable and diverse media landscape.
