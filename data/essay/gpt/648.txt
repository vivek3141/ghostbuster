The portrayal of women in film has often been critiqued for reinforcing traditional gender roles and perpetuating the dominance-submission patterns between men and women. Two films that provide significant examples of this are "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and "The Dark Knight Rises". Through the lens of the male gaze theory and psychoanalysis, it becomes evident how the limitations imposed by the family in the melodrama genre play into these patterns of dominance.
The male gaze theory, coined by Laura Mulvey, argues that the camera's point of view in mainstream films, predominantly controlled by male directors, tends to objectify women as passive objects of desire for male viewers. This is evident in "The Postman Always Rings Twice", where Cora, the female lead, is consistently framed and shot in a way that emphasizes her sexual allure. The camera often lingers on her curves, accentuating her body as an object of desire. This portrayal reinforces the patriarchal dominance-submission pattern, as Cora's sexuality is used to manipulate and control her.
Psychoanalysis also plays a role in the limitation of women in film. Sigmund Freud's theories suggest that women are trapped by cultural expectations, particularly within the family structure. In "The Dark Knight Rises", Miranda Tate is initially portrayed as a powerful businesswoman. However, it is later revealed that she is merely a pawn in the plan of the male antagonist, Bane. Her ultimate purpose in the narrative is to fulfill the role of a subordinate woman, who accepts her predestined position under male rule.
The melodrama genre, characterized by its emphasis on family dynamics and emotional vulnerability, further reinforces these limitations. In "The Postman Always Rings Twice", Cora's marriage to an older, impotent man restricts her agency and imposes a submissive position. Similarly, in "The Dark Knight Rises", the family dynamics between Miranda and her father contribute to her eventual submission to male dominance.
By examining the portrayal of women in film through the concepts of the male gaze theory and psychoanalysis, it becomes clear how the limitations imposed by the family in the melodrama genre reinforce the dominance-submission patterns between men and women. The specific examples from "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and "The Dark Knight Rises" highlight the objectification and subordination of women, perpetuating the unequal power dynamics between genders perpetuated by mainstream cinema. It is crucial for filmmakers to challenge these tropes and strive for more nuanced and empowering portrayals of women in film.
