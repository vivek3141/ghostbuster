Introduction: 
Preventative care has proven to be a crucial aspect of healthcare, particularly in addressing long-term health issues and mitigating the impact of future health emergencies. By adopting a proactive approach that focuses on promoting healthy lifestyles, managing environmental factors, and addressing genetic predispositions, healthcare facilities can significantly improve public health outcomes. This essay aims to analyze various methods and strategies for increasing preventative care measures in healthcare facilities by considering the role of lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and genetic predispositions. Additionally, by applying principles of project management, a comprehensive project will be proposed to integrate multiple preventative care methods, evaluating its applicability in improving public health outcomes.
