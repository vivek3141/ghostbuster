In the history of social movements, leaders have emerged to champion the cause for change. Among these leaders, Martin Luther King Jr. and Alicia Garza have stood tall as influential figures who sparked movements for justice and equality. While both leaders share a common goal of advocating for change, they approach their speeches in different ways, with Dr. King focusing on a vision of the future and Alicia Garza highlighting present realities of oppression. Furthermore, their speaking styles and the locations chosen for their speeches contribute significantly to their effectiveness as leaders.
Dr. King, known for his pivotal role in the Civil Rights Movement, emphasized a vision of the future in his speeches.

By focusing on a hopeful and aspirational vision, Dr. King was able to inspire and mobilize a vast number of individuals towards a common goal. His speeches acted as a unifying force, captivating the audience and instilling a sense of hope and determination.
In contrast, Alicia Garza, one of the co-founders of the Black Lives Matter movement, highlights the present realities of oppression in her speeches. Garza's speeches address the systemic racism and violence faced by Black communities. She depicts a grim reality that exists in the present, acknowledging the magnitude of the problem at hand. By centering her speeches on the current conditions of oppression, Garza aims to galvanize immediate action.
