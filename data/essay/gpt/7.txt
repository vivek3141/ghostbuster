In the film Every Secret Thing, the complex emotional attachment between Alice and her mother plays a pivotal role in the events that unfold. The mother complex and the mother archetype contribute to shaping their relationship, ultimately leading to the tragic kidnappings and murders that occur throughout the film.
The mother complex is a psychological concept that describes an individual's emotions and behaviors influenced by the relationship with their mother. In the case of Alice, she has a deeply rooted attachment to her mother, who is overprotective and controlling. This complex relationship is evident from the beginning when Alice is released from prison after serving time for a previous abduction. The audience can sense Alice's yearning for her mother's love and approval, mirroring her desire for a maternal figure in her life.
The mother archetype, on the other hand, represents an innate understanding of the role of motherhood. It can be seen in various aspects of Alice's and her mother's interactions. Alice's mother predominantly fits the archetypal mold of a caring and nurturing figure, but due to her overprotectiveness, her attempts to control Alice's life become stifling. This ultimately leads to a manifestation of Alice's repressed emotions and pent-up frustrations, which drive her towards repeating her past crimes.
The impact of the mother complex and the mother archetype on the kidnappings and murders in the film lies in the power dynamics between Alice and her mother. Alice, craving her mother's love and validation, resorts to drastic measures in order to gain her attention. The kidnappings can be seen as a cry for help, an attempt to demonstrate her capability and worth to her mother, as well as a desire to regain control over her own life.
Moreover, the mother's overprotectiveness and constant monitoring create a sense of suffocation for Alice. This prompts her to rebel and seek solace in acts of violence, as a means to establish her own power and individuality. The murders can be interpreted as a desperate attempt to break free from the grasp of her mother's influence.
In conclusion, the complex emotional attachment between Alice and her mother in Every Secret Thing intricately contributes to the events that unfold throughout the film. The mother complex and the mother archetype shape their relationship dynamics, leading to the kidnappings and murders as a result of Alice's yearning for love and independence, conflicted with her mother's controlling nature.
