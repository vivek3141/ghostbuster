Abstract:
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019 served as a catalyst for a global race to develop effective vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This essay aims to discuss the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines, examining their underlying mechanisms, approval processes, and subsequent distribution challenges. Additionally, the impact of the pandemic on various aspects of public life will be explored, spanning healthcare systems, economies, education, and social interactions. An understanding of the structure and nature of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, as well as its similarities to previous coronaviruses, will further shed light on the severity and global significance of this ongoing crisis.
