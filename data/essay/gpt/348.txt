Lady Mary Wroth’s sonnet, “In this strange labyrinth,” delves into profound themes of love, loss, and identity. This sonnet serves as a critique of the societal constraints placed on women during the Renaissance and uses the metaphor of a labyrinth to symbolize suffocation and entrapment. With religious allusions woven throughout the poem, the speaker’s search for true love becomes an allegory for the profound spiritual and emotional journey that women faced in order to obtain liberation.
The title itself, “In this strange labyrinth,” immediately suggests a sense of confusion and disorientation. The speaker portrays the societal norms of the Renaissance as a complex maze; a perplexing and restrictive structure. The labyrinth, throughout the poem, symbolizes the suffocating societal constraints imposed on women. Wroth emphasizes this metaphor by using words such as “thick grown,” “dark,” and “turnings” to create an atmosphere of claustrophobia and entrapment. The labyrinth becomes a visual representation of the suffocating expectations society had for women during this period.
Furthermore, the theme of love is intricately tied to the theme of identity in this sonnet. The speaker mourns the loss of love and the subsequent impact on her ability to establish her own identity. She refers to her heart as a “blown rose” that has been “withered” by the loss of love. This loss is not only a romantic one, but also a loss of personal agency, as women were expected to place their devotion entirely on their husbands or fathers. By using the imagery of the “blown rose” and “faded leaves,” Wroth underscores the devaluation and ultimate death of the speaker’s own desires and aspirations.
However, amidst the suffocating labyrinth, the speaker longs for true love and fulfills her yearnings through a religious allusion. The speaker’s search for true love extends beyond the conventional limitations of society. She states, “But whither am I strayed? I need not raise/Trophies to thee from other men’s dispraise.” Here, the speaker suggests that true love comes from a higher power, implying that societal conventions are irrelevant to the pursuit of genuine connection. The connection between the speaker’s search for true love and her religious allusions suggests that love exists beyond societal norms and expectations. It becomes a spiritual journey, pursued with the same fervor as a religious pilgrimage.
Furthermore, the religious allusion brings forth the idea that true love is not only a search for emotional fulfillment but also for liberation. The speaker alludes to the story of Theseus and Ariadne, presenting Ariadne as a martyr of love. Ariadne sacrifices her own happiness and agency to ensure the success of Theseus’ journey through the intricate maze of the Minotaur’s labyrinth. In referencing this myth, the speaker suggests that society expects women to sacrifice their autonomy and happiness for the sake of men. The religious allusion serves as an allegory for the speaker’s internal struggle for liberation from these societal constraints.
In conclusion, Lady Mary Wroth’s sonnet “In this strange labyrinth” explores themes of love, loss, and identity within the context of the Renaissance. The labyrinth functions as a metaphor for the suffocating nature of societal constraints placed on women during this period. The religious allusions woven throughout the poem serve to heighten the significance of the speaker’s search for true love as an allegory for the pursuit of emotional and spiritual liberation. Wroth’s sonnet ultimately highlights the tragedy of a society that forces women into labyrinths, depriving them of their own desires, identities, and agency. Through her powerful use of language and imagery, Wroth challenges societal norms and provides a poignant critique of the limitations placed upon women during the Renaissance.
