In the world of literature, word choice and stylistic devices play a pivotal role in shaping the overall tone and impact of a piece of writing. This can be clearly seen when analyzing three literary excerpts: William Shakespeare's "To be or not to be" soliloquy from Hamlet, F. Scott Fitzgerald's description of Gatsby's glamorous parties in The Great Gatsby, and Maya Angelou's poem "Still I Rise." 
Shakespeare's "To be or not to be" soliloquy showcases the existential crisis faced by Hamlet. The careful selection of words reflects his contemplative state of mind. Phrases like "To be or not to be," "whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer," and "the dread of something after death" evoke a sense of introspection and melancholy. The use of rhetorical questions, such as "Who would fardels bear," adds an air of desperation, intensifying the impact of the soliloquy. Shakespeare's poetic language and metaphors, such as "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune," enhance the emotional weight of Hamlet's existential dilemma, ultimately contributing to the overall tone of profound introspection and despair.
Moving onto Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, the author's choice of descriptive language creates a vivid portrayal of Gatsby's extravagant parties. Words like "riotous" and "lavish" paint a picture of opulence and excessiveness. Additionally, Fitzgerald employs similes, comparing the parties to "an amusement park" and "a scene from the war," intensifying the impact of the description. The repetition of phrases like "champagne and the stars" and "drunk tanks and automobiles" further emphasize the excessive nature of Gatsby's parties and contribute to the overall tone of indulgence and decadence.
Finally, Angelou's poem "Still I Rise" is a powerful expression of resilience and defiance against adversity. The poet's choice of empowering words such as "rise," "boom," and "sassiness" establishes a defiant tone. Stylistic devices such as repetition, particularly the phrase "Still I rise," add emphasis to the poem's theme of resilience and contribute to its impact. Angelou's use of metaphors, comparing herself to "air" and "moons," allows the reader to envision her strength and determination. The overall tone of the poem is one of resilience, strength, and triumph.
In conclusion, word choice and stylistic devices are highly influential in shaping the overall tone and impact of literary excerpts. Shakespeare's soliloquy, Fitzgerald's vivid descriptions, and Angelou's poem each demonstrate how the careful selection of words and stylistic devices contribute to the unique tone and impact of their respective works.
