The "Eye of the Storm" video effectively demonstrates the social construction of race in the classroom and its significant effects on students' behavior and performance. This impactful video showcases a powerful experiment conducted in the 1960s, where a third-grade teacher created an artificial discriminatory environment to teach her students about the consequences of racism.
Throughout the video, we can observe how the teacher divided her students based on their eye color, creating a social hierarchy within the classroom. The students with blue eyes were deemed superior, while those with brown eyes were treated as inferior. This exercise exemplifies how arbitrary physical characteristics, such as eye color, can be utilized to construct social hierarchies even in a controlled educational setting.
As the video progresses, the observed effects on the students' behavior and performance are undeniable. Initially, the blue-eyed students quickly adapted to their privileged position, displaying increased confidence and dominance over their brown-eyed peers. Conversely, the brown-eyed students visibly struggled with their newfound label as inferior, exhibiting decreased self-esteem and a lack of participation in classroom activities.
Moreover, the video sheds light on the profound impact of racial discrimination on academic performance. The blue-eyed students, driven by their elevated social status, excelled academically and showcased exceptional adaptability. On the other hand, the brown-eyed students faced significant obstacles, such as anxiety, self-doubt, and decreased motivation. Consequently, their academic performances suffered, highlighting the degree to which social constructions of race can hinder educational achievement.
Additionally, the video underscores the role of discriminatory environments in shaping students' behavior. Racial prejudice not only affects the targeted group but also influences the attitudes and actions of those considered privileged. The blue-eyed students, for example, exhibited signs of overconfidence, arrogance, and intolerance towards their brown-eyed peers. This demonstrates the detrimental consequences of a biased educational environment on the development of empathy and respect among students.
In conclusion, the "Eye of the Storm" video exemplifies the social construction of race within the classroom and its profound influence on students' behavior and performance. It illustrates the arbitrary nature of racial hierarchies while highlighting the emotional and academic toll discrimination takes on individuals. This video serves as a powerful reminder of the imperative need to address and dismantle such social constructs to foster a more equitable and inclusive educational environment.
