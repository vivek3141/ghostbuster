In Olga Tokarczuk's captivating novel, "Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead," the protagonist's use of nicknames presents a unique lens through which her values and perspective on humans and animals are revealed. Janina, the enigmatic and eccentric protagonist, uses nicknames as a way to undermine and challenge societal norms, offering a distinctive contrast between names and nicknames that speaks volumes about her worldview.
Janina attaches nicknames to the people she encounters in her small Polish village, such as Oddball, Bigfoot, and Dizzy. These unconventional monikers reflect her rejection of the prescribed identities forced upon individuals. By bestowing such names, Janina transcends the superficiality of traditional names and addresses the essence of each person. This suggests a deep understanding and appreciation for individuality, emphasizing that true character lies beyond societal labels.
Moreover, Janina's use of nicknames allows her to blur the distinction between humans and animals. She assigns animal-related nicknames to those with whom she feels a deeper connection, considering animals as equals or even as superior beings. For instance, she refers to the neighbor she deeply admires as "Moose." By attributing animal nicknames to certain individuals, Janina breaches the hierarchical divide, highlighting the shared vulnerability and inherent value of all living creatures. Her perspective challenges the conventional belief that humans are superior to animals, instead championing harmony and coexistence.
Furthermore, Janina's preference for nicknames can be seen as her resistance to the artificiality of society. She questions the notion that names carry inherent power and meaning. Janina recognizes that names are often mere signifiers without genuine substance. By embracing nicknames, she symbolically discards the superficial fa√ßade upheld by society, reminding others of the inherent emptiness in it.
Janina's use of nicknames in "Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead" creates a powerful contrast between names and nicknames, providing insights into her values and perspectives on humans and animals. Through the unconventional naming practice, she calls attention to the depth of individuality, challenges human exceptionalism, and questions the significance of societal constructs. Janina's unique approach encourages readers to not only question the importance we place on names but also reconsider our treatment of both humans and animals, ultimately promoting a more compassionate and inclusive world.
