Garnier's advertisement for their new hair food shampoo is a compelling piece of marketing that effectively appeals to its audience while showcasing the strengths of the product. However, there are still weaknesses that can be addressed to further bolster the commercial's impact.
One of the main strengths of Garnier's advertisement is its ability to resonate with the target audience. The ad targets individuals who are health-conscious and seek natural solutions for their hair care needs. By presenting the hair food shampoo as a product made from 98% natural ingredients, Garnier effectively captures the attention of these customers. The use of vivid visuals, such as shots of luscious fruits and nourishing ingredients, further reinforces the natural and healthy claims of the product. This appeals to consumers who prioritize authenticity and are willing to pay a premium for natural products.
Additionally, the commercial effectively strengthens its main claim by providing before and after testimonials from real customers. By showcasing the transformative results of using the hair food shampoo, Garnier offers firsthand evidence of the product's effectiveness. This strategy not only bolsters the main claim but also helps to establish credibility and trust in the brand.
Moreover, the ad effectively employs emotional appeal to further strengthen its impact. By portraying individuals with damaged, lifeless hair at the beginning of the commercial, Garnier taps into the audience's desire for hair that looks vibrant and healthy. The ad then proceeds to show how the hair food shampoo can deliver these results, eliciting a sense of hope and aspiration within the viewers. This emotional connection helps to create a stronger desire for the product and strengthens Garnier's main claim of revitalizing hair.
However, there are weaknesses in Garnier's advertisement that can be addressed to improve its overall effectiveness. Firstly, there is a lack of diversity in the testimonials featured in the commercial. While these testimonials serve as powerful evidence of the product's effectiveness, it would have been more impactful to include a wider range of ethnicities and hair types. This would have made the advertisement more relatable to a broader audience, increasing its appeal and strengthening its claims.
Furthermore, the commercial could benefit from addressing potential concerns or skepticism that the audience may have. By acknowledging that some customers may be skeptical about the effectiveness of the product, and then providing more scientific or expert backing for their claims, Garnier can counter potential doubts and enhance the credibility of their advertisement. Including endorsements from hair professionals or dermatologists, for example, can lend further authority and address any reservations that viewers may have.
In terms of future strategies, Garnier could consider incorporating user-generated content to strengthen the appeal of their advertisement. It could encourage customers to share their before and after experiences with the hair food shampoo on social media platforms, accompanied by a designated hashtag. Curating and including these user testimonials in future commercials would not only make the ads more authentic but also engage customers actively in spreading the word about the product.
Overall, Garnier's advertisement for their hair food shampoo effectively appeals to the target audience and strengthens their main claim through the use of natural ingredients, testimonials, and emotional appeal. However, by addressing the lack of diversity in testimonials and addressing potential concerns or skepticism, Garnier can further improve the commercial's impact. Incorporating user-generated content can also enhance authenticity and actively engage customers in promoting the product. By implementing these strategies, Garnier can continue to attract new customers and solidify the brand's position in the hair care industry.
