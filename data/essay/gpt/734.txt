Mary Midgley is a renowned British philosopher who has made significant contributions to the field of moral philosophy. In her essay "Trying Out One's New Sword," Midgley critiques moral isolationism and offers her unique perspective on evaluating other cultures. According to her, moral isolationism is an inadequate approach to understanding and assessing moral practices of different societies.
Moral isolationism, as Midgley defines it, is the belief that one cannot pass judgment on the moral practices of other cultures, as they are deemed to be incomprehensible from an outside perspective. This perspective implies that moral values are completely arbitrary and irreducible to a common set of principles. However, Midgley argues against this notion, claiming that this approach is detrimental to our understanding of different cultures and prevents us from making meaningful ethical assessments.
Midgley highlights the flaw of moral isolationism by presenting the 18th-century Japanese practice of "trying out one's new sword" as an example. In this practice, samurais were allowed to test their newly forged swords on unsuspecting peasants. Moral isolationism would suggest that this practice should be accepted as a cultural norm, without any criticism. However, Midgley disagrees and asserts that there are universal moral values that can serve as a basis for evaluating such practices. She argues that the notion of human rights is one such universal value, which should not be compromised by cultural relativism.
Midgley further illustrates her critique of moral isolationism with the example of female genital mutilation (FGM). FGM is a traditional practice in some African cultures that involves the removal of certain parts of the female genitalia. Moral isolationism would argue that since this practice is deeply embedded in the culture, it cannot be criticized. Midgley disagrees, stating that this practice violates the rights and bodily integrity of women, and should be condemned based on universal principles of human rights.
Midgley proposes an alternative perspective on evaluating other cultures, which she calls "moral progress." She suggests that understanding and evaluating practices of other cultures should be done with the intention of contributing to the moral improvement of societies. By adopting this approach, we can seek to challenge harmful practices and promote positive change, rather than simply accepting cultural practices without question.
In conclusion, Mary Midgley's critique of moral isolationism is a persuasive argument against the idea that moral practices of different societies are incomprehensible and cannot be evaluated. Her examples from "Trying Out One's New Sword" effectively demonstrate the flaws of moral isolationism. Midgley's alternative perspective of moral progress encourages a more nuanced and critical approach to understanding and evaluating the practices of other cultures, with the aim of fostering moral improvement. Ultimately, her insights provide valuable guidance for navigating the challenges of multicultural ethics in today's globalized world.
