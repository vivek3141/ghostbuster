The CALM Act of 2012, aimed at reducing the excessively loud volume of commercials on television, has had some success in regulating the issue to a certain extent. The Act mandates that broadcasters maintain a consistent volume between programs and advertisements. This has resulted in noticeable improvements, as viewers no longer have to constantly adjust their volume levels during commercial breaks. Furthermore, the legislation has provided the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with the authority to enforce compliance, thereby increasing accountability among broadcasters.
However, there are limitations to the CALM Act. Firstly, it only applies to commercials aired on television, leaving out streaming platforms and online advertisements. This technological loophole allows advertisers to bypass the regulations and continue to broadcast loud commercials through other platforms. Moreover, the Act fails to address the issue of excessively loud programs or content material, which can still disrupt viewers' experiences.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the increased complaints about commercial volume suggest that advertisers have found alternative methods to circumvent the CALM Act. One of these methods is through the use of dynamic range compression techniques, which cleverly manipulate audio levels to maintain an overall lower volume but with occasional sharp spikes of sound during key moments. This tactic works around the Act by exploiting the technicalities of volume regulation.
In conclusion, while the CALM Act has made significant strides in regulating commercial volume on television, it has its limitations. Advertisers have adapted to the Act's restrictions, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, by employing alternative methods to bypass the regulations. Therefore, it is essential for policymakers to review and update the Act, ensuring that it covers all advertising platforms and addresses other audio-related concerns, to maintain a consistent and enjoyable television viewing experience for all.
