Black women face significant challenges in accessing quality healthcare during pregnancy and childbirth. The existence of systemic biases, racial disparities, and medical mistrust can lead to adverse outcomes. However, proposed solutions such as promoting culturally competent care, increasing access to prenatal care, providing comprehensive and holistic care, engaging community-based programs, and increasing representation and diversity in healthcare can address these challenges. By implementing these solutions, the maternal health and possibilities for black women can be significantly improved, leading to better health outcomes and equitable healthcare experiences.
