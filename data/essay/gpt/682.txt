In Mary Shelley’s novel, Frankenstein, the character of Victor Frankenstein evokes both sympathy and believability due to his positive and negative traits, traumatic past, and lonely present. While his relentless passion for knowledge and creation make him relatable, his reckless actions and disregard for the consequences of his actions also make him deeply flawed. Frankenstein’s traumatic past, including the deaths of his loved ones, instigate his desire to conquer death, providing a justifiable motive for his actions. However, it is his isolation and the consequences he faces that ultimately serve as a warning and provide valuable lessons for readers.
One cannot deny the positive traits possessed by Frankenstein that make him sympathetic and believable. From a young age, he exhibits a thirst for knowledge, which is a relatable trait for many individuals. Frankenstein’s passion for knowledge eventually drives him to create a living being. This desire to push boundaries and explore the unknown is plausible, as it mirrors human curiosity and ambition. Furthermore, his ability to create such a complex creature showcases his intelligence and determination. These positive traits not only make him relatable but also engender empathy for his character.
However, Frankenstein’s negative traits also come to the forefront, rendering him flawed. His relentless pursuit of knowledge turns into an obsession, blinding him to the consequences of his actions. He becomes so engrossed in his creation that he neglects his loved ones and his own moral judgment. Frankenstein’s recklessness ultimately leads to the destruction of everything he holds dear, displaying the dangers of unchecked ambition. By examining his negative traits, readers can understand the importance of balance and responsibility in the pursuit of knowledge.
Frankenstein’s traumatic past plays a significant role in shaping his character and evoking sympathy. The deaths of his mother, best friend, and wife haunt him, prompting him to embark on a dangerous quest for power over life and death. His traumatic experiences are understandable catalysts for his actions, as the agonizing pain of loss often drives individuals to extreme measures. Frankenstein’s tragic past allows readers to empathize with his motivations, blurring the line between right and wrong in his quest for reanimation.
Furthermore, Frankenstein’s lonely present adds a layer of sympathy to his character. After creating the creature, Frankenstein is tormented by guilt and regret, isolating himself from society. The creature he created is abandoned, left to navigate the world alone and rejected by society. This loneliness is mirrored in Frankenstein’s own life, as he becomes isolated from his loved ones and suffers the consequences of his actions alone. Frankenstein’s alienation and anguish serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of isolation and the perils of neglecting one’s moral obligations.
In conclusion, the character of Frankenstein is both sympathetic and believable due to his positive and negative traits, traumatic past, and lonely present. While his passion for knowledge and creation make him relatable, his reckless actions and disregard for the consequences of his actions also render him deeply flawed. The traumas he experiences and the consequences he faces serve as a warning and provide valuable lessons for readers, highlighting the importance of balance and responsibility in the pursuit of knowledge. Mary Shelley’s portrayal of Frankenstein highlights the complexities of human nature and the triumphs and tragedies that can arise when one loses sight of their humanity in the pursuit of power.
