Education is an integral aspect of human development; it shapes individuals' perspectives, enhances their potential, and impacts their lives profoundly. In the short stories "Everyday Use" by Alice Walker and "Sonny's Blues" by James Baldwin, education is addressed, albeit differently, serving as a crucial element that influences the characters and their choices.
In "Everyday Use," education is portrayed as a source of empowerment and validation. Walker's protagonist, Dee, has embraced education, distancing herself from her rural roots and changing her name to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo. Dee's pursuit of education has granted her the ability to escape poverty and ignorance, as well as to challenge the limited opportunities imposed on African American women. She sees education as a vehicle to acquire knowledge and assert control over her identity.
However, Dee's education alienates her from her family and heritage. She dismisses her mother and sister, Maggie, as uneducated and backward. Dee's arrogance and air of superiority create a divide with her family, as she believes her education gives her exclusive privileges. This tension reaches its peak when Dee demands to take cultural artifacts, such as the quilts made by her grandmother, to display as decorative items, rather than embracing them for their sentimental and historical value. This highlights the negative effects of education when it leads to a detachment from one's background and a sense of cultural superiority.
On the other hand, in "Sonny's Blues," education is depicted as a means of escaping from poverty and despair. Sonny, the protagonist, is a talented musician who uses education as an outlet for his emotions and struggles. His passion for playing the piano helps him cope with the harsh reality of his community and find solace amidst despair. Sonny's brother, the narrator, initially sees education as a path towards stability and success, as he becomes a teacher. However, he soon realizes that Sonny's education takes a different form, manifested through his music.
The impact of education becomes evident when Sonny's brother witnesses the power of music to transform Sonny's life, providing him with a glimpse of hope and redemption. Sonny's experience with addiction and incarceration reflects the challenges faced by many African Americans during the time the story was set. Nevertheless, it is through his education in music that he finds a way to express his inner struggles and transcend the limitations imposed by his environment.
In conclusion, while education plays a significant role in both "Everyday Use" and "Sonny's Blues," it is portrayed differently and has distinct influences on the characters' lives. In "Everyday Use," education leads to alienation and a sense of cultural superiority, resulting in a loss of connection with their heritage. Conversely, in "Sonny's Blues," education through music offers an escape from adversity and provides a means of expression and redemption. These stories reflect the complexities of education and its impact on individuals, emphasizing the importance of understanding the balance between personal growth and maintaining cultural roots.
