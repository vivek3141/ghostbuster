Using Corey's Ethical Decision-Making Model to Analyze an Ethical Dilemma in a Case Study and Discuss Potential Courses of Action for an Ethical Counselor
Introduction:
Ethical dilemmas are an integral part of the counseling profession. Counselors often find themselves facing complex situations where they must make difficult choices that can have a profound impact on their clients. In such instances, Corey's ethical decision-making model can be a valuable tool to guide counselors in navigating through the ethical maze. This essay will analyze an ethical dilemma presented in a case study while applying Corey's model and discussing potential courses of action that an ethical counselor can take.
Case Study:
In the case study, a counselor named Sarah is faced with a difficult ethical dilemma. Sarah has been seeing a client named Josh for the past six months, helping him work through his struggles with depression and anxiety. One day, Josh begins to express romantic feelings for Sarah, which she finds both surprising and uncomfortable. Sarah is torn between several ethical principles: non-maleficence, autonomy, beneficence, and her duty to maintain professional boundaries.
Using Corey's Ethical Decision-Making Model:
The first step in Corey's model is to identify the problem. In this case, the problem is the conflicting feelings expressed by the client and the counselor's discomfort with maintaining professional boundaries.
The second step is to gather relevant information. Sarah should consider the nature of her therapeutic relationship with Josh, his emotional state, and any potential harm that may arise from continuing the relationship.
Thirdly, Sarah should identify her own values and feelings regarding the situation. She might explore her beliefs about dual relationships, crossing professional boundaries, and personal values that might be influencing her decision-making process.
The fourth step involves considering potential ethical guidelines, principles, and codes of conduct. Sarah should consult the code of ethics provided by her professional organization, such as the American Counseling Association (ACA), to determine what standards they provide about boundaries and relationships with clients.
The next step, step five, is to explore possible courses of action. In this case, Sarah might consider the following options: terminating therapy immediately, having a conversation with Josh about appropriate boundaries, seeking supervision or consultation, or referring Josh to another counselor.
Step six involves considering the potential consequences of each course of action. Terminating therapy abruptly might be harmful to Josh's mental health, while having a conversation with him might open up opportunities for addressing the issue and maintaining trust in the therapeutic relationship.
The seventh step is the implementation of the chosen course of action. Sarah could initiate a conversation with Josh in a supportive and non-confrontational manner, emphasizing the importance of maintaining clear boundaries while reassuring him that his feelings are valid and understandable.
The final step in Corey's model is evaluating the decision and subsequent actions. Here, Sarah should reflect on whether her chosen course of action benefitted both Josh and herself, and if any aspects of the ethical dilemma were left unresolved.
Potential Courses of Action:
1. Termination: Sarah could terminate therapy with Josh to avoid any potential harm resulting from a romantic relationship. This option upholds the principle of non-maleficence by prioritizing Josh's well-being, but it may also raise concerns about autonomy and the client's right to choose and participate in the decision-making process.
2. Conversation: Sarah could initiate a conversation about boundaries with Josh, explaining her professional responsibilities and the potential consequences of engaging in a romantic relationship. This course of action allows the counselor to assert professional boundaries while still respecting Josh's autonomy and the therapeutic relationship.
3. Supervision/Consultation: Sarah could seek supervision or consultation from a more experienced counselor to gain insight into handling this ethical dilemma. Consulting with a colleague or supervisor can provide additional perspectives and guidance regarding the best course of action.
4. Referral: Sarah could consider referring Josh to another counselor who may be better equipped to handle the situation. Referring Josh to another professional ensures that he continues to receive the help he needs, while also allowing Sarah to maintain her own ethical responsibilities.
Conclusion:
Ethical dilemmas are complex and challenging, requiring counselors to analyze the situation and consider various factors before making a decision. Corey's ethical decision-making model serves as a valuable framework for guiding counselors through this process. In the case study discussed above, applying Corey's model can help a counselor like Sarah to navigate the ethical quandary presented by Josh's romantic feelings. By considering potential courses of action, such as termination, conversation, supervision/consultation, or referral, an ethical counselor can make a well-informed and principled decision that prioritizes both the client's well-being and the maintenance of professional boundaries.
