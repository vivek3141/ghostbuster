Body:
1. Collectivism: The film highlights the pervasive nature of collectivism within the institution of slavery. Slaves are treated as chattel and denied any sense of individuality or autonomy. Their identities are systematically erased, reducing them to the status of property. Consequently, this collectivist perspective on slavery perpetuates the dehumanization of black people, fueled by the belief in white supremacy.
a. Physical and Psychological Abuse: The slaves' shared experiences of physical and psychological abuse emphasize the collective trauma endured under slavery. These inhumane acts are inflicted upon the enslaved individuals as a means of asserting dominance and control, stripping them of their humanity.
b. Unity in Resistance: However, despite the oppressive conditions, the film also showcases instances of collectivism being utilized as a source of strength and resistance. The power of collective consciousness is evident in moments where slaves provide emotional support to one another, and it underlines the significance of unity in fighting against slavery.
2. Individualism: The film juxtaposes the concept of collectivism with the power of individualism, emphasizing the unique experiences and challenges endured by different characters. Through their distinct narratives, the film portrays individualism as a catalyst for change and expressions of resilience against the horrors of slavery.
a. Solomon Northup: As the protagonist, Solomon Northup stands as a testament to the strength of individualism amidst collective suffering. His determination to maintain his identity and reclaim his freedom sets him apart. While his fellow slaves succumb to the dehumanizing effects of slavery, Solomon's individualism acts as an agent of resistance, inspiring hope in others.
b. Patsey: Patsey, another pivotal character, embodies both collectivist and individualist experiences simultaneously. While she endures the collective suffering of slavery, she also encounters specific prejudice in the form of sexual exploitation, highlighting the complexities within broader systemic issues.
3. Slavery as a Worldwide Issue: The film extends its analysis of collectivism and individualism to portray slavery as a global problem, transcending geographical boundaries and encapsulating various forms of oppression.
a. Plantation Hierarchy: The movie shows how inferiority based on race and systems of superiority transcend national borders. The hierarchical structure of the plantation, with white slaveowners at the top and black individuals at the bottom, illustrates a system deeply ingrained across different societies, making slavery a worldwide concern.
b. Prejudice and Stereotyping: The film portrays prejudice, generalizations, and stereotyping as tools utilized by societies to perpetuate the institution of slavery. By depicting these biases as prevalent and deeply ingrained within societies, it underscores the need for global acknowledgement and change in perceptions of race.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, "12 Years a Slave" effectively analyzes the themes of collectivism and individualism to portray the institution of slavery as a worldwide issue. The film gracefully showcases the dehumanization of black people through systematic prejudices, generalizations, stereotyping, and discrimination. By highlighting the power of collectivism and individualism in resisting and transcending slavery, it serves as a call to action for a global recognition of the need to dismantle systemic oppression. The film's portrayal of this historical struggle encourages viewers to confront their own biases and advocate for a more inclusive and equitable world.
