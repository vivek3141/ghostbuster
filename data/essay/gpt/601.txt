Graphs are essential tools that contribute significantly to the clarity and understanding of data in articles. They provide readers with a visual representation of complex information, making it easier to interpret and comprehend. One exemplary use of graphs can be seen in the article "How the pandemic has affected weddings" published in the New York Times, which effectively employs bar charts to convey the impact of COVID-19 on the wedding industry.
In this article, bar charts are used to display various aspects of the pandemic's effect on weddings, such as the number of cancellations and postponements, changes in guest count, and alterations in wedding budgets. Each bar chart is carefully labeled and color-coded, ensuring that readers can easily identify and compare different data points. This allows readers to grasp the magnitude of the changes brought about by the pandemic and draw direct comparisons between different categories.
For instance, one of the bar charts in the article compares the number of wedding cancellations and postponements from March to June 2019 and the same period in 2020.

The use of different colors for cancellations and postponements allows readers to see at a glance how the pandemic has affected weddings differently over time. The bars for each month are labeled, providing readers with specific details and facilitating a deeper understanding of the data.
Another bar chart in the article focuses on changes in the size of wedding guest lists. By using bars of varying heights, the chart effectively conveys the scale of these changes. The chart also differentiates between smaller and larger weddings, utilizing colors to represent the number of guests in different ranges. As a result, readers can easily identify the extent to which wedding guest lists have been affected by the pandemic and compare trends between different wedding sizes.
Furthermore, bar charts are also utilized to show the changes in wedding budgets during the pandemic. By employing horizontal bars that represent the percentage of couples spending more or less on their weddings, the reader can quickly comprehend the financial impact of the pandemic on engaged couples. The color-coded bars further enhance the understanding of the data by visually distinguishing between budget increases and decreases.
