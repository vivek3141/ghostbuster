Interaction, both in real life and online, also plays a crucial role. In face-to-face interactions, individuals are exposed to different social cues, attitudes, and opinions. If individuals consistently receive positive feedback, compliments, and affirmations, their self-esteem and confidence are likely to increase. Conversely, negative interactions can have the opposite effect, stripping individuals of their self-confidence.
Similarly, social media's influence is significant. Individuals often present themselves in curated ways on these platforms, creating an idealized version of themselves. This perpetuates the notion of the "generalized other," where individuals believe they should conform to societal expectations and norms. This idealized self-image further affects individuals' perception of self, leading to either an inflated or diminished self-esteem.
Furthermore, social media platforms provide knowledge acquisition opportunities by presenting idealized lifestyles, beauty standards, and success stories. Exposure to this curated content can result in individuals feeling inadequate and questioning their own worth and achievements. The constant comparison and desire to meet these standards can have detrimental effects on individuals' self-esteem and confidence.
In conclusion, mass media has a profound impact on individuals' self-esteem and confidence. Interactions, affirmation, and knowledge acquisition, as influenced by the generalized other and social media, are crucial in shaping one's perception of self. It is essential for individuals to critically evaluate media messages, focus on their own unique qualities, and surround themselves with positive and supportive relationships to maintain a healthy self-esteem and confidence.
