In recent years, there have been numerous instances where companies have taken unethical and irrelevant approaches to handling layoffs. One such case is that of Etihad Airways, where the company displayed a complete disregard for corporate social responsibility and discrimination in their change process. This essay will argue that increased employee involvement in decision-making processes could have prevented such approaches and will discuss the impact of employee engagement on performance, job security, and motivation.
Firstly, increased employee involvement in decision-making processes would have provided a platform for open communication and transparency. When employees are engaged in decision-making, they feel valued and are more likely to contribute their ideas and suggestions. In the case of Etihad Airways, involving employees in the decision-making process would have allowed them to provide insights and opinions on how the company could handle layoffs in a more ethical and relevant manner. Employees could have suggested alternatives to layoffs, such as implementing cost-saving measures or reallocating resources.
Moreover, when employees are engaged in decision-making, they feel a sense of ownership over the decisions made. This sense of ownership translates into higher levels of motivation and commitment to achieving the desired outcomes. By involving employees in the decision-making process, Etihad Airways could have motivated its workforce to work towards finding viable solutions to the challenges faced by the company rather than resorting to unethical practices like discriminatory layoffs.
In addition to improved motivation, employee engagement also has a positive impact on performance. When employees are engaged and have a stake in the decisions made by the company, they are more likely to go the extra mile and deliver exceptional performance. This is because they feel a sense of responsibility and pride in their work, knowing that their input and opinions are valued. By disregarding employee involvement and opting for an unethical and irrelevant approach to layoffs, Etihad Airways not only damaged its reputation but also potentially lost out on the valuable contributions its employees could have made to the company.
Furthermore, increased employee involvement in decision-making processes would have contributed to job security. When employees are consulted and involved in the decision-making process, they are more likely to feel secure and trust in the company's decisions. This trust fosters a positive work environment and reduces the fear of uncertain job outcomes. In the case of Etihad Airways, involving employees in decision-making could have provided them with a better understanding of the company's challenges and the necessity of layoffs. Moreover, employees could have suggested alternative measures to minimize the impact on job security, such as implementing temporary pay reductions or offering voluntary redundancy schemes.
Lastly, disregarding corporate social responsibility and engaging in discriminatory practices during the change process can have severe consequences. Not only does it damage the company's reputation, but it also leads to employee dissatisfaction and a negative work culture. Discrimination in layoffs can result in a loss of trust and loyalty from employees, leading to decreased productivity and increased turnover. Moreover, companies that fail to uphold ethical practices may face legal consequences, regulatory scrutiny, and financial penalties.
In conclusion, increased employee involvement in decision-making processes could have prevented the unethical and irrelevant approach to layoffs by Etihad Airways. Employee engagement positively impacts performance, job security, and motivation. Disregarding corporate social responsibility and engaging in discriminatory practices during the change process can have severe consequences for companies. It is crucial for companies to recognize the value of their employees' contributions and involve them in decision-making to ensure ethical and relevant approaches to challenges like layoffs.
