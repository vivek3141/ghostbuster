Expressionism in art during the 19th and early 20th centuries played a significant role in conveying intense emotions and departures from representing reality. Artists delved into the realm of emotions, portraying scenes that broke traditional artistic conventions. This essay will explore the ways in which expressionism was employed by artists in this period, with a focus on understanding the extent to which they conveyed emotions. Specific artworks such as Delacroix's The Lion Hunt, Munch's The Scream, Corinth's Nude Girl, and Kirchner's Seated Girl will be analyzed, offering insight into the artist's intentions.
One notable example of expressionism can be found in Delacroix's The Lion Hunt. Painted in 1855, this artwork captures the chaotic and intense emotions of a hunt. The vivid colors and energetic brushstrokes give the painting a sense of urgency, evoking the emotions of fear and excitement. Delacroix's departure from reality is evident in the distorted proportions of both the human figures and the animals, emphasizing the emotional intensity rather than portraying a realistic scene.
Similarly, Munch's The Scream, painted in 1893, depicts a figure tormented by an overwhelming sense of anxiety and despair. The swirling lines and vibrant colors contribute to a sense of chaos and unease. The figure's elongated and distorted features, as well as the suggestive background, convey an intense emotional state that transcends traditional representations of reality. By distorting the forms and colors, Munch effectively communicates the intense emotional experience of the protagonist.
In Lovis Corinth's Nude Girl (1900), expressionism is manifested through the depiction of a young woman. Corinth's brushwork is loose and expressive, capturing the female figure with bold strokes of paint. The artist's departure from representing reality can be seen in the exaggerated curves and dramatic lighting, emphasizing the sensuality and emotional intensity of the subject. Corinth conveys a raw, powerful emotion, suggesting vulnerability and desire.
The expressionist qualities of expressionism can also be witnessed in Kirchner's Seated Girl (1910). The distorted features and elongated forms of the figure and surroundings create an unsettling and somber atmosphere. By departing from reality, Kirchner effectively conveys a sense of emotional turmoil and introspection. The emphasis on color and form allows for the exploration of deep psychological states, which traditional artistic techniques do not often capture.
The industrial revolution and religion played significant roles in shaping sculptures during this period. Artists responded to the rapid changes brought about by industrialization and the loss of spirituality through their works. Kandinsky's Composition VII (1913) is an example of this response. The fragmented shapes and disjointed forms in the painting convey a sense of chaos and confusion, mirroring the disarray caused by industrialization. The absence of recognizable objects or figures further emphasizes the departure from representing reality.
In August Macke's Great Zoological Garden (1912), the impact of religion on sculptures is evident. The vibrant and expressive colors reflect the artist's attempt to capture spiritual experiences in an increasingly secular world. The animals in the painting are portrayed with dynamic brushwork, conveying their vitality and connection to nature. Macke uses symbolism and abstraction to communicate deep-seated religious emotions, departing from a realistic representation.
Additionally, sculptures played a crucial role in conveying themes of melancholy and loss in women's relationships. Wilhelm Lehmbruck's Kneeling Woman (1911) is a sculpture that encapsulates this idea. The figure's posture and facial expression communicate feelings of sadness and resignation. Through the use of smooth and flowing lines, Lehmbruck manages to convey the vulnerability and emotional toll experienced by women in their relationships. 
In conclusion, expressionism in art during the 19th and early 20th centuries allowed artists to convey intense emotions and depart from representing reality. The analyzed artworks such as Delacroix's The Lion Hunt, Munch's The Scream, Corinth's Nude Girl, Kirchner's Seated Girl, as well as sculptures by Kandinsky and Macke, demonstrate the extent to which artists were able to capture and communicate emotions through their departure from traditional artistic conventions. The impact of the industrial revolution and religion on sculptures were also notable, as artists responded to social and cultural changes through their works. Sculptures like Lehmbruck's Kneeling Woman further conveyed themes of melancholy and loss in women's relationships. These artworks and sculptures offer valuable insights into the power of expressionism in conveying intense emotions and departing from representing reality.
