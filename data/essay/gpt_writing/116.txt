Body:
1. Importance of Employee Involvement in Decision-Making:
Effective decision-making hinges on involving employees in the decision-making process rather than imposing decisions from the top down. Employees possess valuable insights, expertise, and perspectives that can contribute to well-rounded decisions.
   a. Ensure unbiased perspectives: Cross-functional input and diverse perspectives reduce the likelihood of biased decision-making.
   b. Enhance decision quality: Employees' firsthand knowledge of their roles and the organization allows for better-informed decisions.
   c. Boost employee commitment: Involvement in decision-making processes promotes a sense of ownership, leading to increased dedication and motivation.
2. Impact of Employee Engagement on Performance, Job Security, and Motivation:
Employee engagement, stemming from increased involvement in decision-making, has significant positive effects on different aspects of organizational success.
   a. Performance enhancement: Engaged employees are more likely to demonstrate discretionary effort, leading to improved productivity, creativity, and innovation.
   b. Job security improvement: Involving employees in decision-making can shape more sound and sustainable decisions, reducing the risk of layoffs and preserving job security.
   c. Motivation and job satisfaction: Employee involvement fosters a sense of empowerment, trust, and recognition, contributing to higher levels of motivation and job satisfaction.
3. Consequences of Disregarding Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Discrimination:
Etihad Airways' unethical and irrelevant approach to layoffs not only violated principles of CSR, but also perpetuated discrimination, resulting in significant consequences.
   a. Damage to company reputation: The disregard of CSR negatively impacts the public perception of the organization, potentially leading to customer and investor loss.
   b. Legal repercussions: Discrimination during layoffs may result in potential lawsuits and legal penalties.
   c. Negative employee morale and decreased productivity: Employees who witness unethical practices experience lowered morale, negatively impacting productivity, teamwork, and overall organizational climate.
Conclusion:
Increased employee involvement in decision-making processes is crucial to prevent unethical approaches in organizations, such as Etihad Airways' approach to layoffs. The influence of employee engagement on performance, job security, and motivation cannot be underestimated. Further, disregarding corporate social responsibility and engaging in discriminatory practices during change processes highlight the severe consequences for both individuals and the entire organization. To promote a fair and ethical work environment, businesses should strive for inclusive decision-making, valuing the perspectives and inputs of their employees.
