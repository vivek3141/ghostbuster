Introduction:
The "war on drugs" has been a widely contested initiative that has inadvertently perpetuated racial disparities and gender inequalities within the criminal justice system. Despite claiming to combat drug-related issues, this essay aims to delve into the realities faced by racial minorities and women, proposing that biased enforcement, institutionalized racism, and inequality within the criminal justice system exacerbate injustice and worsen living conditions for those affected.

It is crucial to address these disparities by advocating for fairer policies, such as sentencing reforms, bail reform, and investing in drug treatment programs. By striving for social justice, equity, and an unbiased criminal justice system, we can begin to dismantle the disproportionately harmful effects of the war on drugs and promote a more inclusive and just society for all individuals.
