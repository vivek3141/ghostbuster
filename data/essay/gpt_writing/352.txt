Introduction:
Tribal gaming has emerged as a significant avenue for Native American tribes to assert their sovereignty and preserve their long-held cultural heritage. By engaging in gaming activities on their own lands, tribes have not only secured economic independence but also preserved their cultural practices and revitalized their communities. This essay will delve into the ways in which tribal gaming contributes to tribal sovereignty and upholds their cultural heritage, emphasizing its role in generating revenue, fostering self-governance, and strengthening cultural identity.
