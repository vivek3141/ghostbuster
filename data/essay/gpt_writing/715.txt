Education is a fundamental aspect of human development, shaping individuals' lives and influencing their perspectives. In the short stories "Everyday Use" by Alice Walker and "Sonny's Blues" by James Baldwin, education plays a crucial role in the characters' lives, impacting their identity, relationships, and personal growth. While both stories explore the theme of education, they differ in terms of the characters' attitudes towards education, their access to it, and the implications it has on their lives.
In "Everyday Use," Walker presents two sisters, Maggie and Dee, who have contrasting views on education. Dee is portrayed as a highly educated woman who embraces her African heritage and seeks to make use of her education by affixing value to material artifacts. Her education has led her to adopt an Afrocentric ideology, causing her to reject her former rural upbringing. In contrast, Maggie, who has limited access to formal education, treasures her heritage and values sentimental objects linked to her family's history. The divergent attitudes towards education in the story illustrate the impact education can have on one's sense of identity and connection to cultural heritage.
In "Sonny's Blues," education is presented as a potential means of escape from poverty and despair. The protagonist, Sonny, is a talented musician who turns to jazz as a way to cope with the hardships of his life. His brother, the story's narrator, initially underestimates the power of education and music but eventually realizes their transformative potential. As Sonny takes the initiative to pursue a formal education in music, it becomes evident that education is instrumental in defining his purpose and enabling him to overcome adversities. The story highlights how education can serve as a catalyst for personal growth and self-discovery.
Furthermore, the treatment of education in the stories contributes to the dynamics of the characters' relationships. In "Everyday Use," education becomes a symbol of division between Dee and her family. Dee's newfound intellectual superiority and disregard for her family's traditional lifestyle create a rift between them. This tension underscores the potential alienation that education can breed when it is seen as superior to others' experiences and knowledge. In contrast, Maggie's lack of formal education allows her to maintain a deep connection with her family and cultural heritage. The differing attitudes towards education ultimately contribute to the estrangement between Dee and her family.
In "Sonny's Blues," education becomes a source of understanding and reconciliation between the brothers. The narrator, initially detached from Sonny, gains insight into his brother's life through attending one of his performances. The experience of witnessing Sonny's talent and understanding the significance of his education in music enables the narrator to bridge the gap between them. Education thus serves as a catalyst for empathy and connection in their relationship.
In conclusion, the treatment of education in "Everyday Use" and "Sonny's Blues" presents contrasting attitudes and implications in the lives of the characters. While Dee's education in "Everyday Use" leads to a disconnection from her family and cultural heritage, Maggie's limited access to education allows her to preserve the familial connection. Conversely, in "Sonny's Blues," Sonny's pursuit of education in music helps him overcome adversity and fosters understanding and reconnection between him and his brother. These stories highlight the significant impact education can have on individuals' identities, relationships, and personal growth.
