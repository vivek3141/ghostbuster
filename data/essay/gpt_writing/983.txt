In their respective works, "Drive-Thru Dreams: A Journey through the Heart of America's Fast-Food Kingdom" by Adam Chandler and "Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal" by Eric Schlosser, the authors examine the profound influence of fast-food culture in American society. To engage their audience and convey the significance of their claims, both authors employ vivid imagery and a compelling emotional appeal through the persuasive technique of pathos.

His use of personal anecdotes and sentimental language elicits an emotional response, engaging readers and fostering a connection, thus encouraging them to delve deeper into the book's contents.
In contrast, Schlosser employs emotional appeal by exposing the injustices prevalent within the fast-food industry. He highlights the exploitation of workers, the detrimental health effects, and the erosion of traditional American values.
