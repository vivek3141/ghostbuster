Introduction:
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein delves into the realm of existential questions surrounding the nature of loneliness and its profound impact on the Monster's character development. As the story unfolds, Shelley explores how social isolation, emotional abandonment, and societal rejection contribute to the Monster's anguish and transformation into a complex and tragic figure. This essay aims to discuss the theme of loneliness in Frankenstein, shedding light on its influence on the Monster's character development throughout the novel.
Body Paragraph 1: Birth of Loneliness
In the opening chapters, Shelley emphasizes the Monster's struggle with profound isolation right from its very birth. The Monster awakes to a world devoid of companionship, discovering that its existence elicits only fear and revulsion. This primal rejection initiates the Monster's profound sense of loneliness, compelling it to seek understanding, acceptance, and a sense of belonging.
Body Paragraph 2: Emotional Abandonment and Its Effects
As the Monster embarks on its journey, it encounters profound emotional abandonment from its creator, Victor Frankenstein. Driven by a mixture of fear and disgust, Victor rejects his creation, shattering the Monster's hopes for a nurturing relationship. This abandonment leaves the Monster without guidance or emotional support, further deepening its feelings of loneliness. The Monster's desire to establish an emotional connection with Victor ultimately drives it to seek vengeance, as its despair is gradually replaced by anger and a thirst for revenge.
Body Paragraph 3: Rejection by Society: The Ultimate Solitude
The Monster's encounters with society expose the harsh reality of its isolation. People from all walks of life consistently reject and marginalize it based solely on their immediate physical perception of its horrific appearance. The Monster's attempts to forge authentic connections with other individuals, such as the DeLacey family, are swiftly rejected due to society's prejudiced notions. This perpetual rejection drives the Monster further into a life of loneliness, fueling its feelings of resentment and bitterness.
Body Paragraph 4: The Paradox of Loneliness and the Monster's Transformation
While loneliness is traditionally associated with negative emotions, Shelley presents a paradox in Frankenstein. The Monster's profound sense of loneliness ultimately serves as a catalyst for the development of its character. Through its experiences of rejection and isolation, the Monster delves into self-reflection, contemplation, and the acquisition of knowledge. In its solitude, the Monster becomes an intellectual and articulate being capable of questioning societal norms and the actions of its creator.
Conclusion:
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein overwhelmingly emphasizes the destructive power of loneliness and its transformative impact on the Monster's character development. Through the Monster's interactions with a hostile society, emotional abandonment by its creator, and perpetual solitude, Shelley highlights the profound effects of loneliness on an individual's psyche. The Monster's journey from despair to anger and then to introspection ultimately demonstrates the complexity of loneliness and its role in shaping individual identities. As readers, we are urged to consider the consequences of societal rejection and emotional isolation, ultimately inviting us to reflect on our own responsibility in creating a sense of belonging and empathy in our communities.
