This consistency enhances brand recognition, builds trust, and communicates credibility to stakeholders.
B. Crisis Management:
A well-implemented digital engagement policy equips organizations with a crisis management framework. When facing negative feedback or potential crises, the policy provides guidance on how to respond promptly, empathetically, and effectively.
