The impacts on the company, film, and public perception were not entirely favorable, but the decision aimed to prioritize employee safety and prevent further damage. The government's role in this case highlighted the need for improved cybersecurity legislation and international cooperation. Suggesting alternative actions such as enhanced cybersecurity measures and international collaboration can contribute to preventing future cyber attacks on U.S. organizations. Ultimately, while Sony's response may have been imperfect, it serves as a case study to inform organizations on balancing artistic freedom, security concerns, and reputational risks in the face of cyber attacks.
