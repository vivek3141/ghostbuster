Introduction:
Modern society places great emphasis on physical appearance, leading to the formation of unhealthy beauty standards. This essay aims to explore the connection between lookism and extreme body modification, as well as analyze the underlying motivations behind each phenomenon. By delving into the societal pressures and expectations, especially those imposed on women, we can gain a deeper understanding of how these unhealthy beauty standards persist. In support of these arguments, evidence from Goode's book, "Deviant Behavior," will be presented.
Body:
1. Lookism and its impact on unhealthy beauty standards:
Lookism refers to the prejudice and discrimination based on physical appearance, which leads to body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and unhealthy beauty standards. Individuals are judged by their looks rather than their inner qualities and capabilities, fostering a society where appearance dominates a person's worth.
- Evidence from Goode's book: Goode explores the societal pressures placed on individuals to conform to certain beauty ideals, highlighting that those who deviate from these standards, such as having unconventional body types, may face discrimination and marginalization.
2. Extreme body modification's connection to unhealthy beauty standards:
Extreme body modification involves altering one's appearance through drastic and often permanent means, such as cosmetic surgery, body piercing, or tattooing. This phenomenon is directly linked to unhealthy beauty standards as it stems from a desire to conform to societal expectations and achieve a specific physical ideal.
- Evidence from Goode's book: Goode discusses how societal expectations place immense pressure, particularly on women, to meet unrealistic beauty standards, leading to the pursuit of extreme body modifications as a means to achieve these expectations.
3. The differences between lookism and extreme body modification:
Although both lookism and extreme body modification contribute to unhealthy beauty standards, they differ in their manifestations and psychological motivations.
- Lookism operates on a social level, perpetuating discrimination and bias against individuals who do not conform to beauty standards.
- Extreme body modification, however, encompasses an individual's deliberate and voluntary efforts to modify their bodies to conform to these standards.
4. Underlying motivations behind lookism and extreme body modification:
Understanding the motivations behind lookism and extreme body modification is crucial to comprehending why individuals succumb to these unconventional behaviors.
- Lookism is often driven by societal norms, media influence, and social expectations. This pressure forces individuals to adhere to certain beauty standards, leading to a prejudiced perspective on physical appearance.
- Extreme body modification, on the other hand, may be motivated by personal insecurities, a desire for self-expression, or an attempt to gain social acceptance. Individuals engaging in extreme body modification often seek to "fix" perceived flaws or compensate for their feelings of inadequacy based on societal standards.
Conclusion:
In contemporary society, the presence of lookism and extreme body modification highlights the pervasiveness of unhealthy beauty standards. By critically examining the underlying motivations behind these phenomena, we can better understand the societal pressures which contribute to their persistence, particularly for women. By raising awareness and promoting body positivity, society can work towards dismantling these unhealthy beauty standards and creating a more inclusive and accepting environment for all individuals.
Note: The evidence from Goode's book, "Deviant Behavior," should be supplemented with scholarly research and studies on the topic to provide a well-rounded and comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.
