Body:
1. Symbolism in "Jupiter and Semele"
Gustave Moreau skillfully employs symbolism to convey the dichotomy between humans and the divine. 
a. Jupiter: The central figure of the painting, Jupiter, represents the divine omnipotence and power. Moreau presents Jupiter with a regal and majestic stance, adorned with a golden aura radiating around him. This symbolism emphasizes Jupiter's godly nature, highlighting his celestial position.
b. Semele: Semele, portrayed as a mortal woman, represents humanity's vulnerability in the presence of the divine. Moreau captures her frailty and sensuality, emphasizing her physicality. Semele's gaze of longing and vulnerability toward Jupiter heightens the contrast between the two realms.
c. Background and context: The mystical and ethereal background further emphasizes the otherworldly nature of the divine realm. The combination of celestial bodies and heavenly clouds implies a transcendental environment inaccessible to mere mortals.
2. The Theme of Desire and Temptation
In "Jupiter and Semele," the theme of desire and temptation plays a significant role in illustrating the difference between humans and the divine.
a. Human Desires: Semele's longing gaze symbolizes human desire for divine experiences and power. This desire, though natural for humans, contains inherent danger when interacting with the divine, as humans cannot handle the overwhelming power and majesty of gods.
b. Divine Temptation: Jupiter's seductive aura and divine power represent the temptation of the divine realm. Semele's interaction with Jupiter highlights the peril inherent in desiring the divine, as her mortal nature cannot withstand the overwhelming divine power, inevitably leading to her destruction.
3. Mortality vs. Immortality
Moreau's painting explores the contrast between the finite nature of humanity and the eternal existence of the divine.
a. Mortal Frailty: Semele's vulnerable depiction symbolizes human fragility. Moreau suggests that humans, bound by physical and temporal constraints, are limited in their capacity to comprehend and endure the overwhelming power of divinity.
b. Divine Immortality: Jupiter's godly stature and perfect countenance represent divine immortality. The golden aura surrounding him signifies his eternal nature. This juxtaposition serves as a reminder of the unbridgeable gap between the human and the divine.
Conclusion:
In "Jupiter and Semele," Gustave Moreau skillfully employs symbolism and themes to explore the dichotomy between humans and the divine. Through contrasting representations of mortal vulnerability and divine power, Moreau portrays the insurmountable gulf separating these two realms. The painting serves as a powerful reminder of humanity's finite existence and the immense power and grandeur of the celestial sphere. Moreau's masterpiece invites viewers to reflect on the inevitable limitations and aspirations of being human in the face of the divine.
