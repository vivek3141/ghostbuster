1. Indulging Oneself
Ignatius consistently exhibits a strong sense of entitlement and an excessive need to gratify his desires. His relentless quest for personal enjoyment is showcased through his disinterest in conventional employment and his self-indulgent habits, such as his gluttony and obsession with physical pleasure. Ignatius frequently prioritizes his idiosyncratic pleasures over obligations to his community, demonstrating a lack of empathy and disregard for the consequences of his actions. Ignatius' self-indulgent behavior contributes to his inability to connect with those around him, perpetuating a divisive rift between himself and his community.
2. Arrogance
One of the defining features of Ignatius' character is his inflated sense of self-importance. He consistently displays arrogance, believing himself to be intellectually superior to those he encounters. This often leads Ignatius to belittle and demean others, boasting about his supposed genius and ridiculing those who fail to meet his perceived standards. Ignatius' arrogant attitude and condescension isolate him from the community, as he struggles to form meaningful connections due to his inability to empathize with or respect others.
3. Deceit
Ignatius frequently resorts to deceit as a means of manipulating those around him. His deceptive nature is particularly evident in his interactions with his mother, whom he deceives about his unemployment, financial struggles, and involvement in various schemes. Ignatius' deceitful behavior serves to manipulate others for his personal gain, ultimately exacerbating his isolation from the community. His dishonesty further alienates him from potential allies, making it increasingly challenging for him to fit into his environment.
4. Impact on Fitting into the Community
Ignatius' symptoms of antisocial personality disorder directly contribute to his inability to fit into his community. His self-indulgence, arrogance, and deceit undermine his ability to form genuine connections and empathize with others. This inability to cultivate meaningful relationships creates a sense of detachment between Ignatius and his environment, perpetuating his feelings of social exclusion. The disdain with which he views society further distances him from potential social opportunities, making it increasingly challenging for Ignatius to integrate himself into his community.
Conclusion

These characteristics have a profound impact on Ignatius' ability to fit into his community, causing social alienation and exacerbating his struggles with connection and belonging.
