Introduction
The debate between moral universalism and moral relativism centers on the question of whether there exist objective and universally applicable moral principles or whether moral judgments are subjective and contingent upon individual perspectives and cultural contexts. While moral relativism presents strong arguments highlighting the importance of cultural diversity and subjective moral frameworks, ultimately, these arguments inadvertently lead back to the recognition and significance of a common core moral code and the need for regulating human relations. This essay explores the arguments made in favor of moral relativism, uncovers their underlying premises related to a universal moral foundation, and provides examples that support the understanding that moral universalism is indeed a more truthful theory.
Cultural Diversity and Subjective Frameworks of Moral Relativism
Moral relativism argues that moral judgments are relative to one's individual beliefs or the cultural context in which they are embedded. It emphasizes cultural diversity as evidence that there are no universally objective moral principles. Under this perspective, actions are deemed morally right or wrong based on the standards of each specific culture or individual.
However, upon closer examination, the very notion of cultural diversity presupposes the existence of shared core moral values that transcend specific cultures. For instance, the existence of human rights movements across diverse societies indicates a common belief in the intrinsic dignity and worth of individuals. Without this foundational moral principle, social progress and efforts in securing human rights would be illogical and unfeasible, as they would lack a universally recognizable principle to rally behind.
Moreover, moral relativism implies a recognition of individual autonomy and personal freedoms. Yet, it is precisely because society acknowledges the importance of these values that legal systems are established to protect individuals' rights to life, liberty, and property. The existence of such legal frameworks, enforced by governments worldwide, demonstrates the recognition of common human values that go beyond cultural boundaries.
Regulating Human Relations: The Importance of Moral Universalism
An inherent characteristic of moral relativism is its tendency to rely on regulating human relations. While moral relativism asserts that moral judgments are contingent, it necessitates systems of negotiation, compromise, and tolerance among individuals and cultures. This regulatory aspect ultimately acknowledges the significance of establishing shared norms and principles, which aligns with the universalist perspective.
By encouraging dialogue, empathy, and cultural exchange, moral relativism indirectly promotes the identification of shared values, leading to the development of universal principles of moral conduct. For instance, recognizing and respecting cultural differences in the context of human rights discussions allows for a more nuanced understanding that can lead to universally applicable principles, such as the condemnation of genocide or the protection of children's rights.
Common Core Moral Code: Foundation of Moral Universalism
The recognition of a common core moral code can be traced in various cultural and religious traditions. Despite the differences in religious beliefs and cultural practices, many moral values and principles are shared across societies. For example, virtues like honesty, fairness, compassion, and respect are valued in numerous cultures and are often considered integral to the functioning of just societies.
Moreover, societies throughout history have developed moral philosophies that aim to establish moral principles meant to govern human behavior universally. Philosophical theories such as Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative, which emphasizes the unconditional nature of moral duties, reveal the persistence of seeking universally applicable moral principles.
Conclusion
While moral relativism highlights the importance of cultural diversity and individual perspectives, its arguments ultimately expose the presupposition of a common core moral code and the need for regulating human relations. The existence of universally recognizable human rights, legal systems, and shared values across cultures demonstrates that moral universalism holds greater truthfulness as a theory. By acknowledging the interconnectedness of diverse moral perspectives and the existence of a common core moral code, we can foster a more inclusive and ethical global society.
