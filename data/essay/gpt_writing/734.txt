Body
1. Critique of Moral Isolationism
Midgley contends that moral isolationism, or the belief that each culture has its own independent moral code, is an intellectually flawed position. According to Midgley, a strictly isolationist view leads to a dangerous relativism that inhibits any form of moral progress. She suggests that there is an underlying moral unity among humans, and there are universal human values that can be identified across cultures.
One example Midgley utilizes in her essay is the case of the Samurai warriors of feudal Japan. She argues that moral isolationism would lead us to cling to a dubious belief that the Samurai's act of slaying innocent people is solely a matter of cultural difference. Midgley emphasizes that the belief in inherent cultural immunity not only prevents us from condeming the act but also refrains from asking difficult questions about the morality of the Samurai's actions.
2. The Need for Critical Engagement
Midgley calls for a more nuanced approach to evaluating other cultures, one that involves critical engagement rather than a blanket acceptance or rejection. She advocates for understanding and assessing cultural practices by using empathy, reasoned debate, and objective evaluation informed by universal human values.
Midgley argues that cultural practices should be evaluated based on their adaptability in addressing the perceived moral problems within a given society. She highlights the importance of distinguishing between essential cultural practices and those that are contingent or subject to change. For instance, she questions the ethical implications of ancient foot-binding practices in China, suggesting that understanding the historical context is crucial in critiquing such a practice and advocating for its abandonment.
3. Cultivating Cross-cultural Ethical Frameworks
Midgley promotes the idea of cultivating cross-cultural ethical frameworks, which encourage dialogue and shared moral understanding between cultures. She challenges the notion that evaluating other cultures is an ethnocentric act and instead argues for the development of a perspective that appreciates both cultural diversity and universal ethical principles.
In her essay, Midgley discusses the need for recognizing the potential richness of cultural resources while also being attentive to ethical dangers. By adopting an open-minded approach that engages in respectful dialogue, societies can forge ethical frameworks that foster growth, promote human dignity, and challenge harmful cultural practices.
Conclusion
Mary Midgley's critique of moral isolationism and her perspective on evaluating other cultures urges us to move beyond the confines of cultural relativism and embrace a more nuanced and critical engagement with diverse cultural practices. Through her essay "Trying Out One's New Sword," Midgley highlights the limitations of moral isolationism and encourages the cultivation of cross-cultural ethical frameworks. By incorporating these insights, we can appreciate cultural diversity while upholding universal human values and facilitating moral progress.
