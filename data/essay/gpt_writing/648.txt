Introduction:
Throughout the history of cinema, the portrayal of women has been subject to various theories and criticism. One such theory that sheds light on this issue is the male gaze theory, which suggests that the viewpoint in film is often constructed from a heterosexual male perspective, objectifying women as passive objects of desire. By combining this theory with psychoanalysis, we can analyze how the portrayal of women in the melodrama genre is limited by the expectations of the family structure, perpetuating dominant-submissive patterns between men and women. This essay will examine these concepts with specific reference to the films "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and "The Dark Knight Rises."

Conclusion:
The male gaze theory and psychoanalysis offer valuable frameworks for understanding the portrayal of women in film. When exploring the specific examples of "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and "The Dark Knight Rises," it becomes evident how the limitations imposed by the family in the melodrama genre reinforce dominance-submission patterns between men and women. These patterns perpetuate gender inequality and restrict female agency and empowerment. As audiences and creators, we must strive for more progressive and inclusive narratives that challenge these restrictive portrayals, allowing women to break free from the cycle of objectification and passivity depicted on screen.
