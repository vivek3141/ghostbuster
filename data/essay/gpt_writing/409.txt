Breckinridge's work with the FNS facilitated groundbreaking medical research carried out in remote areas. The organization collected data on health-related issues specific to rural communities, enabling evidence-based decisions and interventions to improve healthcare outcomes. This research has since served as a valuable resource for medical practitioners and policymakers.
b. The Hyden Experiment:
Breckinridge initiated what came to be known as the "Hyden Experiment." This experiment focused on demonstrating the efficacy of nurse-midwifery and its positive impact on the community. The results of this groundbreaking study added weight to the argument for expanding nurse-midwife services across the country, reinforcing the importance of evidence-based practices in healthcare.
