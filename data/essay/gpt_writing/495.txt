Introduction:
Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, pose a significant challenge to healthcare providers, particularly in community settings where resources may be limited. When not adequately prevented or treated, pressure ulcers can lead to severe pain, infection, and prolonged hospital stays. This essay explores how pressure-reducing support surfaces can be effectively employed in community settings to prevent and treat pressure ulcers in adults, ensuring the delivery of optimal care.
