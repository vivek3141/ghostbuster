Introduction:
The Victorian era (1837-1901) and modern America are two distinct periods in history, each characterized by unique moral values, societal norms, and their influence on literature and crime rates. While the Victorian era was characterized by its strict moral code, societal conservatism, and predominant influence of religion, modern America presents a more diverse and progressive society. This essay aims to compare and contrast these two eras, focusing on their moral values, societal norms, and the impact of these factors on literature and crime rates.
Moral Values:
During the Victorian era, moral values were deeply rooted in Christian beliefs. Virginity, chastity, modesty, and self-control were highly valued virtues. The emphasis on moral purity reflected the Victorian society's desire for restraint and self-discipline. Conversely, modern America witnesses a diverse range of moral values influenced by cultural, religious, and individual perspectives. The emphasis has shifted towards personal freedom, individualism, and inclusivity, where diverse expressions of morality find acceptance.
Societal Norms:
Victorian society adhered to strict societal norms, reinforcing the patriarchal structure, where women were expected to be submissive, domestic, and religiously pious. The concept of separate spheres, where men occupied the public sphere and women stayed in the private domestic sphere, governed societal interactions. However, in modern America, gender roles have evolved significantly, marked by increasing gender equality and the recognition of LGBTQ+ rights. Modern society promotes inclusivity, encouraging individuals to challenge traditional norms and amplifying diverse voices.
Impact on Literature:
In the Victorian era, literature reflected societal norms and values. Novels like Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" and Charles Dickens' "Great Expectations" scrutinize societal expectations surrounding marriage, class structure, and the complexities of morality. Victorian literature often presented moral tales exemplifying the consequences of transgressing societal norms. On the other hand, literature in modern America exhibits a broader range of themes and genres, reflecting the multifaceted nature of society. Contemporary authors explore complex moral dilemmas, diverse perspectives, and blurred boundaries, inviting readers to question traditional values and norms.
Crime Rates:
During the Victorian era, strict moral values and societal norms contributed to a perceived decline in crime rates. The fear of ostracization, as well as the influence of religion's moral teachings, acted as deterrents for criminal behavior. Nonetheless, the Victorian society witnessed its share of covert crimes, such as prostitution, financial fraud, and child labor exploitation. In modern America's more diverse and urbanized society, crime rates are influenced by complex factors such as poverty, inequality, and societal pressures. Advanced technology and changing moral boundaries have also led to the emergence of new types of crimes, such as cybercrime and identity theft.
Conclusion:
Comparing the Victorian era with modern America in terms of moral values, societal norms, literature, and crime rates reveals the significant evolution of society. While the Victorian era was characterized by a strict moral code and conservative societal norms, modern America embraces a more diverse and inclusive society, where morality is personal and subjective. Literature, reflecting these changes, evolves from moralistic tales to encompassing a wide range of themes, challenging traditional values. Crime rates have transformed with socioeconomic shifts and technological advancements. Overall, these periods represent distinct snapshots of social evolution, highlighting the ever-changing nature of society.
