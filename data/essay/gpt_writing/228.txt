Introduction:
Domestic violence and abuse are silent epidemics that affect millions worldwide. As frontline healthcare providers, it is vital to be able to identify the warning signs of such abuse and take appropriate action when we suspect our patients are victims. By doing so, we can contribute to breaking the cycle of abuse, ensuring the safety and well-being of those who seek our care. This essay discusses the warning signs of domestic violence and abuse and outlines the appropriate actions healthcare providers should take to support and protect their patients.

It is crucial to understand our legal and ethical obligations regarding documentation, reporting, and collaboration with multidisciplinary teams. By working collectively towards breaking the cycle of abuse, healthcare providers play a pivotal role in advocating for the well-being and safety of our patients.
