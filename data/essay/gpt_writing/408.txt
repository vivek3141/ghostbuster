Introduction:
The concept of commodity fetishism, originally introduced by Karl Marx, remains highly relevant in modern society. This essay will explore the application of commodity fetishism to contemporary society, with a specific focus on the fetishization of technological trends. By delving into labor, marketing strategies, and the disconnect between value and worth, we will uncover the impact and implications of this phenomenon.
Body:
1. Labor: 
Commodity fetishism refers to the process in which the value of a product is detached from the labor involved in its production. In modern society, this detachment is evident in the technological industry where products are worshipped while the hidden labor behind their creation remains obscured. Skilled workers and their efforts are often disregarded, leading to the devaluation of their worth. This dehumanizing view of labor contributes to the perpetuation of commodity fetishism.
2. Marketing strategies:
The marketing tactics employed by technology companies play a significant role in fetishizing technological trends. Through aggressive advertising campaigns, companies create an artificial need for new products, generating an insatiable desire for the latest gadgets. The public becomes fixated on owning these products, thereby associating them with social status and success. The emphasis on marketing cultivates a society highly susceptible to the commodification and fetishization of technology.
3. The disconnect between value and worth:
Modern society's obsession with technological trends has led to a disconnection between the value and worth of products. The value of a product often becomes inflated due to branding and societal implications, leading consumers to assign a higher worth to items than they truly possess. This disconnect is evident when consumers prioritize external appearances or the latest features over functionality or durability.
4. Impact on society:
The fetishization of technological trends has far-reaching consequences impacting both individuals and society. From an individual perspective, the constant pursuit of the latest gadgets often leads to financial strain, as products are frequently replaced despite the functional lifespan of the previous ones. Additionally, obsession with technological trends contributes to an unsustainable consumer culture, generating excessive waste and environmental harm. 
Furthermore, the labor exploitation that occurs within the industry is perpetuated by the fetishization of technology. Workers in low-wage countries often face poor working conditions and extended hours to meet the constant demands for new products. This exploitation furthers the disconnect between the value of labor and its worth.
Conclusion:
Commodity fetishism, once identified as a cornerstone of capitalist societies, continues to permeate modern society, particularly in relation to the technological trend obsession. The labor, marketing strategies, and the disconnection between value and worth provide a critical lens through which to analyze this phenomenon. To address this issue, individuals must become conscious consumers, considering the true value and necessity of products rather than succumbing to shallow trends. Additionally, systemic changes are necessary to prioritize the value of labor, promote sustainability, and challenge the fetishization of technology in order to foster a more equitable and responsible society.
