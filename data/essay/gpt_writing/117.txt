Introduction:
The globalization of trade has presented businesses with both opportunities and challenges, particularly regarding currency exchange and its impact on profitability. In this essay, we will examine the three scenarios of adjusting for currency fluctuations, using a fixed rate mentioned in the contract, and purchasing raw materials in Malaysian Ringgit (MYR). By considering both short-term and long-term perspectives, we will evaluate the viability and profitability of each option and make a recommendation for our firm.
Body:
I. Adjusting for Currency Fluctuations:
One approach to mitigating the impact of currency exchange on profitability is to actively respond to fluctuations in the exchange rate. This strategy requires monitoring currency markets and adjusting prices to match the prevailing rates. In the short-term, this option may help maintain a stable profit margin. When the domestic currency is relatively weak against the MYR, increased sales revenue can be realized due to the favorable exchange rate. However, there are several challenges to consider:
a. Increased Complexity: Constantly adjusting prices to match currency fluctuations may lead to operational complexities and require increased resources for monitoring and implementation.
b. Potential Losses: Over time, exchange rates can go either way, and if the domestic currency strengthens against the MYR, profits could decline, eroding the anticipated benefits.
c. Customer Perception: Frequent price adjustments may negatively affect customer loyalty and trust if perceived as opportunistic or unpredictable.
Considering the long-term perspective, the sustainability of this strategy depends heavily on the firm's ability to accurately forecast currency movements. However, predicting exchange rate fluctuations with high accuracy is a challenging task, making this option relatively risky.
II. Using a Fixed Rate Mentioned in the Contract:
Another approach to addressing currency exchange impacts on profitability is to establish a fixed rate within contractual agreements. This allows the firm to maintain a predictable cost structure and protect profit margins. While this strategy offers stability, it also poses certain limitations:
a. Market Misalignments: Fixed rates may lead to situations where domestic currency devalues against the MYR, resulting in missed opportunities to increase profits.
b. Reduced Competitive Advantage: Rigidly adhering to fixed rates might make the company less competitive compared to industry peers who exploit fluctuating exchange rates.
c. Contractual Constraints: Negotiating fixed exchange rates in contracts can be challenging, especially in cases where parties are not willing to assume the associated risks.
In terms of the long-term perspective, using fixed rates may provide stability but potentially limit the company's ability to capitalize on favorable currency movements. It is important to recognize that the success of this strategy heavily relies on accurately predicting a fixed exchange rate that is both commercially viable and reflective of long-term market conditions.
III. Avoiding Currency Exchange by Purchasing Raw Materials in MYR:
An alternative approach for mitigating currency exchange impacts is to purchase raw materials directly in MYR, thus avoiding the need for currency conversion altogether. This scenario offers several advantages, both in the short and long term:
a. Cost Stability: Eliminating currency exchange fluctuations minimizes transaction costs and protects against potential losses arising from unfavorable exchange rates.
b. Supplier Relationships: Engaging with local suppliers in Malaysia increases opportunities for building strong relationships, potentially leading to improved pricing, quantity, and quality of raw materials.
c. Competitive Advantage: By purchasing raw materials directly in the local currency, our company can gain a competitive advantage over firms relying on international sourcing due to cost savings and increased flexibility.
In terms of long-term viability, this strategy reduces exposure to currency risks, ensuring more stable profitability. Additionally, it allows our firm to establish a strong presence in the Malaysian market, potentially initiating expansion opportunities and targeted investments.
Conclusion:
Considering the impact of currency exchange on profitability in Malaysia, it is advised that our company adopts the strategy of avoiding currency exchange by purchasing raw materials in MYR. This long-term approach allows for stability in costs, fosters strong supplier relationships, and provides a competitive advantage over rivals reliant on international sourcing. While adjusting for fluctuations and utilizing fixed rates offer short-term benefits, the potential risks and limitations associated with these strategies make them less viable options in the long run.
By embracing the recommended strategy, the company will not only safeguard profitability but also position itself to thrive in the Malaysian market, paving the way for future growth and success.
