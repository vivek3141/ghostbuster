Introduction:
Racism and inequality have historically plagued the education system in the United States, resulting in substantial disparities in employment rates between Black Americans and their white counterparts. This essay aims to discuss the impact of racism and inequality in education on the higher unemployment rate among Black Americans compared to white Americans. Furthermore, it will explore the factors contributing to structural, cyclical, and frictional unemployment within the African American community. Finally, viable measures to address these disparities and bridge the unemployment gap will be proposed.
