Introduction:
The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply impacted our lives, transforming the way we work and interact. In Lufkin's article on the impact of presenteeism in this era, the focus shifts towards recognizing the true motives behind presenteeism and the effects of subconscious biases on employee relationships. This essay explores the importance of understanding the underlying motivations behind presenteeism, sheds light on the halo and mere exposure effects in determining promotions, and delves into the potential drawbacks of basing career growth solely on physical presence rather than overall performance.

1. Unveiling the Motives behind Presenteeism:
In the era of the pandemic, where remote work prevails, presenteeism has gained a new definition. Employees may feel the need to consistently exhibit physical presence through extended working hours, responding promptly to messages, or showing engagement during video conferences. However, it is essential to recognize the true motivations behind this behavior. It could stem from concerns about job security, fear of missing out on opportunities, a desire for recognition, or feeling pressured to maintain productivity levels. Understanding these underlying motives allows for addressing the issue more effectively, fostering a healthier work environment that prioritizes overall well-being.
2. The Impact of Subconscious Biases:
Subconscious biases can significantly affect employee relationships within an organization, potentially hindering unbiased decision-making processes, such as promotions. The halo effect, where a positive perception of an individual in one area influences judgments in unrelated areas, can lead to promotions based on superficial elements rather than an individual's true potential. Additionally, the mere exposure effect suggests that familiarity can create affinity, causing managers to favor employees they frequently interact with physically. Such biases not only impede fair career growth opportunities but also undermine the overall efficiency and diversity within the workplace.
3. The Detrimental Consequences of Physical Presence-Centric Metrics:
Basing career growth solely on physical presence can undermine employee performance while perpetuating inequality. In a remote work setting, where employees are judged primarily on their presence in video conferences or time logged online, the focus shifts away from actual outputs and becomes more about appearance. Employees who put in extensive face time may receive promotions regardless of their true contributions, while those who excel but work remotely may be overlooked. This not only undermines intrinsic motivation and productivity but also discourages diverse perspectives and ideas, perpetuating traditional hierarchies rather than fostering innovation.
4. Realigning Career Growth with Performance:
To mitigate the potential drawbacks of presenteeism, organizations must shift their focus towards evaluating employee performance comprehensively. Valuing outputs, achievements, and overall contributions aligns career growth with merit and productivity instead of physical presence. Assessing employees based on specific goals, project outcomes, or value-added to the organization ensures a fair and objective approach, which ultimately cultivates a culture of innovation, creativity, and inclusivity. Developing performance-based metrics encourages individuals to maximize their potential, leading to better overall organizational outcomes.
Conclusion:
Recognizing the true motivations behind presenteeism in the era of pandemic and social transformation is crucial. Mitigating the impact of subconscious biases, such as the halo and mere exposure effects, on employee relationships is essential for fair promotions and fostering diversity. Most importantly, organizations must understand the potential detrimental consequences of basing career growth solely on physical presence, and instead align career progression with performance. By implementing these measures, organizations can foster a work environment that values true merit, encourages individual growth, and embraces diverse perspectives, ultimately leading to a more resilient and successful future.
