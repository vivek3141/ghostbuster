In Olga Tokarczuk's novel "Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead," the protagonist, Janina Duszejko, makes frequent use of nicknames to describe the characters she encounters throughout the story. Janina's intentional choice of nicknames and the contrast between names and nicknames in the novel hold deep significance, reflecting her values and perspective on humans and animals.
Through Janina's use of nicknames, we gain insight into her perception of individuals and their character traits. For instance, Janina refers to her neighbor, Oddball, as such due to his unkempt appearance and unconventional behavior. His nickname reflects her perception of him as an outsider or oddity, someone who does not conform to societal norms. Similarly, she calls her other neighbor, Dowdy, highlighting her unflattering and frumpy appearance. Janina's use of nicknames allows her to capture the essence of these characters with a single word, emphasizing her unique perspective on human nature.
Furthermore, the contrast between names and nicknames in the novel highlights Janina's disillusionment with society's prioritization of human life over that of animals. While humans possess official names, Janina often refers to them by their nicknames, thereby reducing their significance and challenging societal hierarchies. In contrast, animals, such as deer and foxes, are often given unique names by Janina, suggesting a level of respect and recognition for their individuality. Janina's deliberate choice to assign names to animals implies a belief in their equal worth and intelligence, challenging the dominant anthropocentrism prevalent in society.
Janina's use of nicknames not only challenges societal norms but also serves as a commentary on the superficiality of human relationships. Throughout the novel, she encounters individuals with complex personalities, yet their official names often fail to capture their true essence. By resorting to nicknames, Janina exposes the limitations of conventional labels and invites readers to question the authenticity of relationships built solely on surface-level judgments. In contrast, Janina's naming of animals implies a deeper connection and understanding between herself and the natural world.
Additionally, Janina's use of nicknames reflects her eccentric and rebellious nature, as she refuses to adhere to societal expectations. Her decision to disregard official names and assign unconventional nicknames is a manifestation of her desire for autonomy and independence. In a world that attempts to control and categorize individuals, Janina's use of nicknames demonstrates her refusal to conform, ultimately leading to her marginalization within the community.
In conclusion, Janina's use of nicknames and the stark contrast between names and nicknames in "Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead" symbolize her values and perspective on humans and animals. Through the careful choice of nicknames, Janina offers a unique understanding of the characters she encounters while challenging societal hierarchies and emphasizing the equal worth of animals. Furthermore, the use of nicknames highlights Janina's rebellious nature and serves as a critique of the superficiality of human relationships. Olga Tokarczuk's portrayal of Janina's perspective through nicknames adds depth and complexity to the novel, encouraging readers to question established norms and reflect on the value we assign to different forms of life.
