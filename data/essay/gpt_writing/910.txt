Introduction:
The "Eye of the Storm" video offers profound insights into the social construction of race and its impact on students' behavior and performance within the classroom context. This thought-provoking documentary reveals significant inequalities, biases, and discrimination perpetuated by societal constructs of race. By examining the video's depiction of explicit racial divisions and their impact on students, we can better understand the dynamics that shape classroom behavior and academic outcomes. This essay aims to explore the ways in which the "Eye of the Storm" video demonstrates the social construction of race in the classroom and the observed effects on students' behavior and performance.
Body:
1. Depictions of the Social Construction of Race:
The "Eye of the Storm" video vividly showcases how racial biases and stereotypes are socially constructed and perpetuated in the classroom. Through the use of the blue-eyed and brown-eyed experiment, conducted by Jane Elliott, implicit biases, discriminatory behavior, and racial divisions are exposed. By arbitrarily assigning superiority and inferiority based on eye color, the video demonstrates the artificiality of racial categorizations while highlighting their influence on individuals' behavior.
2. Impact on Students' Behavior:
The social construction of race in the classroom, as depicted in the video, significantly impacts student behavior. When the students were divided based on eye color, those designated as "inferior" experienced feelings of inferiority, decreased self-esteem, anxiety, and noticeably changed their behavior. They become submissive, disengaged, and lost confidence in their abilities. Conversely, those assigned the "superior" role displayed enhanced self-confidence, assertiveness, and adopted a condescending attitude towards the "inferior" students. Such behavior reinforces the power dynamics associated with racial constructions and perpetuates a toxic environment within the classroom.
3. Influence on Academic Performance:
The "Eye of the Storm" video also unveils the direct impact of the social construction of race on students' academic performance. The students belonging to the "inferior" group struggled academically, their test scores dropped, and their overall performance deteriorated. This decline can be attributed to diminished self-confidence and reduced motivation to perform in an environment where they are consistently treated as inferior. On the other hand, the "superior" students demonstrated an increased ability to grasp concepts quickly and showcased improved academic performance. The disparity in achievement corroborates the correlation between social constructs of race and academic success, stagnant growth, and perpetuation of racial inequality.
4. The Role of Teacher Influence:
A striking aspect of the "Eye of the Storm" video is the influential role the teacher, Jane Elliott, plays in shaping students' behavior and performance. Through her implementation of the experiment, she provokes reactions, encourages self-reflection, and exposes students to the impact of racial constructs. While this highlights the transformative influence of educators, it also reinforces the responsibility they bear in challenging and dismantling racial biases within the classroom. The video emphasizes the significance of creating an inclusive and equitable learning environment where students feel valued, irrespective of their ethnicity or race.
Conclusion:
The "Eye of the Storm" video effectively demonstrates how the social construction of race impacts students' behavior and performance within the classroom. By emphasizing the arbitrary nature of racial distinctions through the blue-eyed and brown-eyed experiment, the video highlights the harmful consequences of such constructs. The observed effects of this social construction are reflected in students' behavioral changes, declining academic performance, and perpetuated racial disparities. It is essential for educators to take an active role in challenging and dismantling racial biases to create a more inclusive and equitable learning environment. Ultimately, through education and fostering awareness, we can work towards eradicating the negative influence of the social construction of race, fostering better understanding, empathy, and equality among students.
