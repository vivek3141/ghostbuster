Introduction:
Jean-Jacques Rousseau provided a nuanced exploration of self-love, presenting two distinct manifestations: amour de soi-même and amour-propre. This essay aims to analyze the nature of these two forms of self-love, their impact on societal interactions, and their role in perpetuating inequalities. By examining Rousseau's writings and applying these concepts to George Orwell's novel 1984, we can uncover the ramifications of self-love within a totalitarian society.

Conclusion:
Rousseau's concepts of self-love, encompassing amour de soi-même and amour-propre, shed light on the differential effects of these forms of self-love on societal interactions and the perpetuation of inequalities. While amour de soi-même promotes cooperation and well-being, amour-propre fuels rivalry, power-seeking, and social division. As seen in Orwell's 1984, a totalitarian society magnifies the destructive influence of amour-propre, reinforcing the importance of recognizing and balancing these manifestations of self-love in our own lives to foster a more equitable society.
