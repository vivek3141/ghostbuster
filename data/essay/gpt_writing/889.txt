Saint Augustine's Confessions presents a comprehensive account of his spiritual journey and the yearning for inner peace that underlies it. Augustine, tormented by his earthly desires, leads a life filled with inner turmoil. Struggling with the immense burdens of his past and the pressures of societal expectations, he initially finds himself mired in the chaos of lust, ambition, and pride.
