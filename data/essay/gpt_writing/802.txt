Introduction:
The portrayal of whiteness as the default in film, television, and media has long been a prevailing trend that affects how society perceives race and constructs identities. This essay will explore the impact of such portrayals using the groundbreaking film "Get Out" in correlation with other notable examples. By analyzing the perpetuation of white-centric narratives, character archetypes, and implicit biases, we can begin to understand how these portrayals shape societal perceptions and thereby perpetuate racial inequalities.
Body:
1. The Power of Narrative Construction:
In the realm of filmmaking, the construction of narratives plays a pivotal role in maintaining whiteness as the default. These narratives often revolve around white characters, relegating characters of color to supporting roles or stereotypes. For instance, "Get Out" deconstructs this norm by placing a Black protagonist at the center of the story while challenging and subverting audience expectations. In contrast, films like "The Hangover" series and "Bridesmaids" predominantly showcase white leads, reinforcing the notion that whiteness is the norm.
2. Character Archetypes and Stereotypes:
Whiteness as the default is further perpetuated through character archetypes and stereotypes. Common archetypes such as the hero, romantic lead, or intellectual are disproportionately assigned to white characters, whereas characters of color are often confined to predefined stereotypes such as the sidekick, exotic figure, or villain. By relegating characters of color to recurring stereotypes, media inadvertently reinforces a skewed perception of race, which in turn impacts real-world attitudes and assumptions.
3. Implicit Biases and Identity Formation:
Media representation significantly influences how individuals construct their racial identities. With whiteness as the default, people of color may internalize negative or limiting beliefs about their own identities. These implicit biases may lead to self-doubt, diminished self-esteem, and a diminished sense of belonging in society. Films like "Moonlight" and "Crazy Rich Asians" provide examples of representation that challenge these biases, empowering viewers from marginalized communities and inspiring a sense of pride and authenticity.
4. The Reinforcement of White Supremacy:
The portrayal of whiteness as the default not only erases diverse experiences but also reinforces white supremacy. Media that perpetuates the notion of a universal, color-blind default maintains the status quo, which favors white perspectives, stories, and characters. This perpetuation of white-centered narratives marginalizes the experiences and voices of people from diverse racial backgrounds, hindering the progress towards inclusive societies.
Conclusion:
The portrayal of whiteness as the default in film, television, and media has profound implications for perceptions of race and identity. By examining examples like "Get Out" along with other films, it becomes evident that the dominant presence of white narratives, character archetypes, and implicit biases contribute to the perpetuation of racial inequalities. Recognizing and challenging these patterns is essential for cultivating a more inclusive media landscape, where diverse representations authentically reflect the realities and experiences of all racial identities.
