Introduction: 
The issue of how to punish the felony of attempted kidnapping in relation to the underlying substantive offense has drawn considerable attention. This essay aims to explore the author's opinion on this matter by examining the examples provided and delving into the pertinent elements that should be considered when determining verdicts in cases involving both kidnapping and attempted kidnapping.
Understanding the Author's Opinion:
The author presents a viewpoint that suggests punishing attempted kidnapping in a manner consistent with the underlying substantive offense. This argument is rooted in the assertion that the degree of culpability and potential harm associated with kidnapping and attempted kidnapping are comparable. By treating these offenses equally, the author argues for a consistent application of justice and a deterrent effect on potential perpetrators.
Elements to Consider:
When determining a verdict for cases involving kidnapping and attempted kidnapping, several essential elements must be taken into account. Firstly, the intent of the perpetrator should be carefully analyzed. In kidnapping cases, the intention to unlawfully confine or transport a victim against their will is central. In attempted kidnapping cases, there is an evident intent to commit the substantive offense, although it may have been impeded by external factors. Intent, therefore, plays a crucial role in assessing the culpability and potential danger to the victim.
Secondly, the actus reus, or unlawful act, must be evaluated. Kidnapping involves the physical movement, confinement, or transportation of an individual. In attempted kidnapping, although the act was not fully executed, there usually remains substantial evidence of the preparation, steps taken, or overt acts indicating a clear intention to commit the offense. These acts demonstrate a significant threat to the victim's well-being, albeit potentially thwarted by timely intervention or external factors.
Furthermore, the potential harm inflicted on the victim, both physically and psychologically, is a paramount consideration. Kidnapping exposes victims to various dangers, such as physical violence, sexual assault, or emotional trauma from prolonged captivity. The mere attempt to commit such a heinous act already imposes considerable distress on victims and society at large. Failing to treat attempted kidnapping with the appropriate gravity may trivialize the trauma experienced by survivors, potentially resulting in an inadequate restorative response.
Examples and their Implications:
The provided examples serve to reinforce the author's perspective on punishing attempted kidnapping akin to the underlying substantive offense. Consider the case of an individual who planned and prepared to kidnap a child but was apprehended before the act was executed. The severity of the intent, combined with the potential harm to the child, should not be underestimated merely due to the intervention of law enforcement. Treating this attempted crime as a lesser offense would undermine the significant steps taken by law enforcement to prevent harm and deter future perpetrators.
However, it is essential to recognize distinguishing factors that could affect the determination of the verdict. For instance, if the attempt is interrupted at an early stage, lacks clear evidence of an imminent threat, or if the intended victim cannot be clearly identified, a more nuanced approach may be warranted. Alternative punishments, such as intensive rehabilitation, psychological evaluations, or strict supervision, could be explored in such cases. Nonetheless, these considerations should not diminish the gravity of the act, but rather recognize the potential for rehabilitation and the specific circumstances surrounding the attempt.
Conclusion:
Considering the author's opinion and the elements involved in determining verdicts for kidnapping and attempted kidnapping cases, it is evident that punishing attempted kidnapping in line with the underlying substantive offense is crucial. Assessing intent, analyzing the actus reus, recognizing potential harm to victims, and evaluating individual circumstances should all guide the justice system towards consistency and fairness. By doing so, we can strive for a justice system that protects and upholds the rights of both potential victims and perpetrators, while sending a strong deterrent message to would-be criminals.
