- Preview the main points to be discussed in the essay
Body: 
I. Environmental Impact of Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (450-500 words)
A. Greenhouse Gas Emissions
   1. Discuss the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), a major greenhouse gas, by ICEVs
   2. Analyze the contribution of ICEVs in global climate change and its associated consequences
   3. Highlight the role of other greenhouse gases emitted by ICEVs, such as nitrous oxide (NOx) and methane (CH4)
   4. Evaluate the cumulative impact of these emissions on air quality, health, and ecosystems
B. Air Pollution
   1. Examine the release of pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
   2. Discuss the detrimental effects of these pollutants on human health, including respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular diseases
   3. Evaluate the impact of air pollution on the environment, including acid rain formation, smog, and habitat degradation
   4. Include case studies or statistics to highlight the severity of these issues in highly populated areas
C. Finite Resource Depletion
   1. Explore the heavy reliance of ICEVs on fossil fuels, such as petroleum and diesel
   2. Discuss the geopolitical and economic consequences of depleting these finite resources
   3. Highlight the potential for resource conflicts and price volatility due to the dependency on limited fossil fuel reserves
II. Benefits of Replacing Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles with Electric Vehicles (550-600 words)
A. Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions
   1. Elaborate on the emission benefits of EVs, comparing them to ICEVs
   2. Discuss the potential positive environmental impact of transitioning to EVs, specifically in terms of reducing CO2 emissions
B. Air Quality Improvements
   1. Analyze how the absence of tailpipe emissions from EVs leads to improved air quality, especially in urban areas
   2. Discuss the reduction in health risks associated with decreased exposure to harmful pollutants
