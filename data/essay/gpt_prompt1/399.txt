Lookism perpetuates unhealthy beauty standards by emphasizing the importance of physical attractiveness. Society has ingrained the belief that those who conform to beauty ideals are more socially accepted, successful, and confident. Goode's book, Deviant Behavior, illustrates how the media, including fashion magazines and advertisements, perpetuate unrealistic and unattainable beauty standards. This constant exposure to a narrow definition of beauty leads individuals to develop an unhealthy obsession with their appearance, fostering insecurity and low self-esteem.
Moreover, societal pressures to adhere to beauty ideals contribute to extreme body modification, particularly for women. In today's society, women are bombarded with expectations to possess a certain body type, such as a slim figure, flawless skin, and specific facial features. Failure to meet these expectations can result in social exclusion and heightened scrutiny. As a result, some individuals resort to extreme body modifications such as cosmetic surgeries, excessive tattooing, and body piercings to conform to societal norms and enhance their attractiveness.
The motivations behind these phenomena differ slightly. Lookism stems from the fear of being socially rejected based on appearance, causing individuals to develop a discriminatory mindset towards those who do not conform to beauty ideals. Extreme body modification, on the other hand, can be motivated by a desire for self-expression, rebellion against societal norms, or an attempt to gain control over one's body image.
In conclusion, lookism and extreme body modification are interconnected phenomena that highlight the negative consequences of unattainable beauty standards in modern society. Lookism perpetuates discrimination and unrealistic beauty expectations, while extreme body modification is driven by societal pressures to conform. By understanding the motivations and societal pressures behind these phenomena, we can work towards promoting healthier beauty standards that embrace diversity and individuality.
