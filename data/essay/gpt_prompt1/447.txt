1. Intrinsic Motivations:
First and foremost, my motivation to pursue nursing is rooted in my unwavering compassion for others. Since childhood, I have possessed an innate desire to help those in need, and nursing provides a tangible avenue to fulfill this calling. Witnessing my grandmother's illness during my formative years, I realized the impact a single compassionate and skilled nurse can have on a patient's journey. Their selflessness, empathy, and resilience in the face of adversity inspired me deeply. As I shadowed nurses and interacted with patients during my clinical experiences, this intrinsic motivation has only grown stronger, solidifying my decision to pursue a career in nursing.
2. Extrinsic Motivations:
Beyond intrinsic factors, there are several external factors that fuel my motivation to pursue nursing. Firstly, the ever-growing demand for healthcare professionals compels me to contribute to bridging the widening gap between healthcare needs and available resources. The aging population, coupled with the rising prevalence of chronic diseases, presents a complex healthcare landscape that calls for dedicated individuals ready to step up and make a difference. Furthermore, the stability and versatility provided by the nursing profession make it an attractive career choice. The nursing field offers diverse avenues for specialization, from critical care to pediatrics, allowing me to constantly learn, adapt, and explore new horizons.

My exposure to healthcare settings through volunteer work and internships has provided me with firsthand experience in patient care, teamwork, and problem-solving. These experiences have honed my ability to handle high-pressure situations while maintaining composure and empathy.
To further augment my preparedness, I have actively sought out opportunities to develop my skills. For instance, I completed a CPR certification course, which not only reinforced my commitment to patient safety but also instilled a sense of responsibility and confidence in responding to medical emergencies. Additionally, I have actively engaged in healthcare-related workshops and seminars to enhance my understanding of current medical advancements, ethical dilemmas, and cultural competency.
