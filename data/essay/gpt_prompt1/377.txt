In the novel, Janina affectionately assigns nicknames to both humans and animals alike, often based on their physical characteristics or behaviors. For instance, she refers to her neighbor Oddball due to his eccentricity, to Dizzy as he is a police officer, to Big Foot due to the policeman's tall stature, and even to her deceased dog as Princess. By giving these nicknames, Janina breaks the conventional norms of referring to individuals solely by their given names. This highlights her tendency to view each being as unique and deserving of individual recognition beyond societal constructs.

Throughout the novel, she is deeply troubled by the hunting activities in her community. By assigning animals with personalized nicknames, Janina emphasizes their individuality, making it harder for others to ignore or devalue their lives. Her use of nicknames acts as a means of humanizing animals, reinforcing her belief that animals are not mere objects but sentient beings with their own worth.
