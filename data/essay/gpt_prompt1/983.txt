The use of pathos, or emotional appeal, is a powerful persuasive technique employed by authors to engage their audience. In Adam Chandler's "Drive-Thru Dreams: A Journey through the Heart of America's Fast-Food Kingdom" and Eric Schlosser's "Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal," both authors effectively employ vivid imagery and emotional appeal in the introductions to captivate their readers and support their claims about the role of fast-food culture in American society.
In his introduction, Chandler begins with a poignant story of his childhood experience with fast food. He vividly describes the excitement and joy he felt when his family visited McDonald's, painting a wholesome picture of an American family tradition. By recounting this personal memory, Chandler taps into the reader's emotions and nostalgia, creating an immediate connection. The use of vivid imagery, such as "golden arches glowing in the distance," transports the reader to that moment, making the scene relatable and inviting the audience to delve deeper into the book.
Similarly, Schlosser's introduction in "Fast Food Nation" starts with a vivid depiction of Colorado Springs, focusing on the bustling and ever-present fast-food restaurants.

This statistic evokes an emotional response, potentially causing readers to reflect on their own spending habits and question the role of fast food in their lives.
Both authors employ emotional appeal to engage their audience and support their claims about the role of fast-food culture in American society. Chandler exposes the emotional attachment people develop to fast food, highlighting its significance in American culture.
