1. Understanding Culturally Sensitive Care (150 words):
Culturally sensitive care refers to a healthcare approach that incorporates cultural beliefs, practices, and values into service delivery. It recognizes the importance of cultural heritage and respects the diverse needs of Indigenous communities. This approach requires healthcare providers to possess cultural competence, which includes knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for effective cross-cultural interactions. By respecting Indigenous worldviews, traditional healing practices, and incorporating culturally relevant healthcare practices, providers can foster trust, effectively communicate, and promote health equity.
