The CALM (Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation) Act of 2012 was implemented with the aim of addressing the annoying issue of excessively loud television commercials. This essay aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Act in regulating commercial volume on television and discuss its limitations, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
To a certain extent, the CALM Act has been successful in mitigating the volume disparity between television shows and their advertisements. The Act required the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish and enforce rules preventing commercial volume from exceeding the average volume of the television program in which it is embedded. As a result, television viewers have experienced a reduction in sudden increases in volume when commercials interrupt their favorite shows. This improvement is evident from the decrease in complaints and increased satisfaction levels reported by viewers.
However, despite its positive impact, the CALM Act has several limitations that advertisers readily exploit. Advertisers have resorted to various strategies to circumvent the Act's restrictions, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. These include utilizing audio compression techniques, tweaking sound design, and strategically placing louder elements within commercials. By employing these alternative methods, advertisers seek to maintain an audible impact and grab viewers' attention, effectively bypassing the Act's intent.
Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has seen a surge in complaints regarding the volume of commercials. With more people staying at home and watching television, the increased exposure to ads has amplified the annoyance caused by any volume discrepancies. Advertisers have capitalized on this situation, further exploiting the limitations of the CALM Act to maximize the impact of their advertisements.
In conclusion, while the CALM Act has been somewhat effective in reducing the volume disparity between television shows and commercials, it has inherent limitations that advertisers have found ways to circumvent, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. To better regulate commercial volume, further amendments to the Act might be necessary, alongside increased monitoring and enforcement by the FCC.
