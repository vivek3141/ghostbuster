Introduction (50 words):
The United States' military intervention in Cuba during the Spanish-American War raised questions about the extent to which it was justified. To evaluate this, it is necessary to examine the reasons behind the conflict, the portrayal of the war as a battle for Cuban interests by the American government, and evaluate the consequences of the US gaining control of the island.
Body - Reasons behind the Conflict (100 words):
The Cuban War of Independence against Spain exposed the harsh treatment and oppression endured by the Cuban people. The US justified its intervention by claiming the conflict threatened American economic interests and national security. This was mainly due to the sinking of the USS Maine, which fueled anti-Spanish sentiment in the US. The explosion, although accidental, was used by the American media and government to rally public support for the war.
Body - American Government's Portrayal of the War (100 words):
The US government painted the Spanish-American War as a noble mission to liberate the Cuban people from Spanish tyranny. Theaters of war were often depicted as places where American soldiers fought for a just cause. However, this portrayal was partly a smokescreen for the US's broader imperialistic ambitions. President McKinley's insistence on "benevolent assimilation" was a clear indication that the US saw Cuba not just as a friend, but as a future territory.
Body - Consequences of US Control (100 words):
Gaining control of Cuba led to both positive and negative consequences. On one hand, the US brought infrastructure development, sanitation improvements, and economic stability to the island. However, this came at the cost of Cuba losing its political independence. The Platt Amendment, which allowed the US to intervene in Cuban affairs, infringed on Cuba's sovereignty and perpetuated US dominance in the region. American corporations exploited Cuban resources, causing resentment among the locals.
Conclusion (50 words):
In conclusion, while the United States had legitimate motivations for intervening in Cuba during the Spanish-American War, it is difficult to argue that its military intervention was entirely justified. The conflict was a mix of genuine concern for Cuban liberation and a desire to expand American influence. The consequences of US control left a lasting impact on Cuba's political autonomy and influenced its subsequent relationship with the United States.
