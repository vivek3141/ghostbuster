In the study "Anxiety Level of University Students during COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia" conducted by Khoshaim et al., the impact of the pandemic on students' mental health in the specific context of Saudi Arabia is examined. The research delves into the anxiety levels experienced by university students and provides crucial insights into the toll taken by COVID-19 on their psychological well-being.
By utilizing a quantitative approach, the study surveyed a representative sample of university students in Saudi Arabia, employing standardized questionnaires such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) to assess anxiety levels. The findings indicate that a significant proportion of students experienced heightened anxiety during the pandemic. Factors such as fear of infection, uncertainty regarding academic activities, and the transition to online learning emerged as major stressors contributing to increased anxiety levels.
This research contributes to our understanding of the impact of the pandemic on students' mental health in Saudi Arabia by highlighting the unique challenges faced by this particular group. By focusing on a specific context, the study recognizes the cultural, social, and academic elements that influence students' anxiety levels. The results emphasize the need for targeted interventions and support services to alleviate anxiety and promote mental well-being among university students during similar crises.
Moreover, the study's findings hold significance not only for Saudi Arabia but also for other countries facing similar circumstances. Understanding the experiences of students in different contexts allows for the development of tailored strategies to address mental health challenges among university populations. Overall, this research serves as a valuable resource for policymakers, educators, and mental health professionals in developing effective interventions to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic on students' mental health.
