Character Portrayal:
Okorafor strategically utilizes specific details to create vivid and multifaceted characters that resonate with readers.

By contrast, the alien Ayodele is described with mysterious, luminescent eyes, signifying the enigmatic influence she holds over the narrative.
Setting as a Character:
The detailed portrayal of the setting in Lagoon goes beyond mere descriptions of physical surroundings; it takes on the characteristics of a character itself. Lagos, with its contrasting elements of vibrant city life and underlying decay, serves as a melting pot for the novel's themes. Okorafor expertly weaves in specific details such as the sounds of the bustling streets, the pungent odor of open sewers, and the vivid colors of street stalls, enabling readers to immerse themselves in the surroundings.

Cultural References and Themes:

Symbolism and Allegory:
A final layer of detail in Lagoon is found in the symbolic elements that subtly shape the plot and themes. The appearance of mythical creatures, such as the giant swordfish, and Ayodele's ability to embody different entities, highlights the ongoing power struggle between humans and nature. These symbols serve as allegories for environmental degradation, the need for ecological stewardship, and the fragility of the natural world. Okorafor's use of specific details imbues these symbols with depth and invites readers to reflect on the consequences of human actions and the urgent need for change.
