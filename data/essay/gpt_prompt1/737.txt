Introduction (50 words):
Wealth distribution in the United States has been a topic of concern in recent years. This essay will examine the current patterns of wealth distribution in the country, focusing on the underpayment of registered nurses (RNs) and the overpayment of National Football League (NFL) players. Utilitarian ethics will be utilized as a framework to justify the selection of these examples and argue for compensation alignment with social importance.

Wealth Distribution Patterns in the U.S.:
The wealth distribution in the United States currently exhibits significant disparities, with a disproportionate concentration of wealth among a small percentage of individuals. According to the Pew Research Center, the wealthiest 20% of Americans hold more than 80% of the country's wealth, leaving the remaining 80% to share the remaining 20%. This uneven distribution is concerning from a utilitarian perspective, which emphasizes maximizing overall social well-being. Such concentration of wealth undermines the equal opportunity and social welfare principles of utilitarianism.
Underpayment of Registered Nurses:
Registered nurses (RNs) play a vital role in society, providing essential healthcare services to patients and contributing significantly to public welfare. Despite their crucial role, many RNs struggle with inadequate compensation. This underpayment is alarming when considering the invaluable services they provide, as their work directly impacts the well-being and quality of life of countless individuals. Utilitarian ethicsâ€™ emphasis on maximizing overall happiness and societal well-being would argue for fair compensation that aligns with the social importance of their work, promoting overall societal welfare.
Overpayment of NFL Players:
National Football League (NFL) players, on the other hand, often receive excessively high salaries, even though their profession primarily entertains rather than provides essential services. While they undoubtedly possess exceptional athletic talents and contribute to the thriving sports industry, the vast sums of money allocated towards their compensation often seem disproportionate to their societal importance. Utilitarian ethics would question the moral justification for such disproportionate rewards when those resources could be allocated towards improving sectors that more directly benefit society as a whole.
Justification for Compensation Alignment:
Utilitarian ethics supports the notion of aligning compensation with the degree of social importance of a profession. By doing so, resources can be distributed more equitably and efficiently, promoting greater overall well-being. Allocating appropriate compensation for RNs would incentivize more individuals to pursue and remain in this essential profession, ultimately improving healthcare quality and accessibility for the population. Similarly, reducing excessive salaries for NFL players could help redirect financial resources towards other sectors, such as infrastructure, education, or healthcare, which have a more direct impact on societal well-being.
Possible Strategies for Correcting Injustice:
To address this injustice, several strategies can be evaluated. Limiting NFL players' wages could be implemented, ensuring they receive substantial but proportionate compensation while allowing resources to be directed elsewhere. Imposing profit use rules on sports entities might require organizations to dedicate a portion of revenue towards societal welfare projects, strengthening social impact. Additionally, legislative action could be pursued to increase the minimum wages for RNs, ensuring their compensation better aligns with their societal significance.
Conclusion (50 words):
In conclusion, the current wealth distribution patterns in the United States reveal stark inequalities. Utilitarian ethics provide a framework to assess the underpayment of registered nurses and the overpayment of NFL players in relation to their social importance. Correcting this injustice requires proper compensation alignment and implementation of strategies that promote overall societal welfare.
