Abstract:
Postpartum depression (PPD) is a prevalent mental health condition that affects numerous African American women, exacerbating the challenges they already face due to racial disparities. This essay aims to emphasize the significance of early screening and intervention for PPD in African American women, highlighting the profound impact it has on both their well-being and the long-term development of their children. By examining the unique cultural, social, and environmental factors that contribute to elevated rates of PPD, exploring the consequences of untreated PPD on maternal mental health, parenting practices, and child development, and discussing potential strategies for early identification and targeted interventions, we can foster a comprehensive understanding of the importance of addressing PPD in African American communities.
