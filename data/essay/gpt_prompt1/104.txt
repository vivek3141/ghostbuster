Introduction:
Bias and discrimination persist as pervasive issues in society, significantly affecting social inclusion. Through critically examining TED Talks by Smith (2015) and Abdel-Magied (2014), alongside an article published by The New York Times (2016), this essay aims to analyze the influence of bias on individuals' self-esteem and confidence. Specifically, this analysis will focus on racial bias and its effects on structural levels within society.

Bias Manifestations:
Smith's TED Talk sheds light on implicit bias, emphasizing how preconceived notions shape our perceptions, decisions, and behavior. These biases, often unconscious, perpetuate stereotypes and hinder social inclusion. Abdel-Magied's TED Talk examines the intersectionality of biases, such as gender, religion, and race, elucidating how multiple layers of discrimination further marginalize individuals.
Effects on Individuals' Self-esteem and Confidence:
Racial bias significantly impacts individuals' self-esteem and confidence. Discrimination based on skin color or ethnicity often leads to feelings of inferiority and internalized racism. Individuals, especially those from marginalized groups, may struggle to assert their voice, encountering societal barriers to personal growth and professional opportunities. Additionally, persistent experiences of bias erode self-worth, limiting individuals' aspirations and diluting their potential contributions to society.
Effects on Structural Levels within Society:
Racial bias perpetuates inequalities at structural levels within society. The New York Times article highlights how institutional practices, such as hiring decisions, educational policies, and criminal justice systems, are influenced by racial biases. These biases foster systemic inequalities, leading to a lack of representation, unequal access to resources, and perpetuation of socio-economic disparities. Consequently, the excluded individuals face limited opportunities for personal growth and advancement, reinforcing the cycle of discrimination.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, bias and discrimination have significant implications on social inclusion, self-esteem, and confidence. By exploring the TED Talks by Smith (2015) and Abdel-Magied (2014) alongside The New York Times article (2016), it becomes apparent that biases manifest in various forms and perpetuate inequalities within society. Racial bias, in particular, hampers individuals' self-esteem and confidence while simultaneously influencing structural levels of society. Recognizing the adverse effects of bias and discrimination is crucial for promoting a more inclusive society, where individuals can freely express themselves and contribute without fear of exclusion or marginalization. Taking conscious efforts to challenge biases and embrace diversity will pave the way for a more equitable future.
