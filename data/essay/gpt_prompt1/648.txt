The portrayal of women in film has long been a subject of scrutiny and analysis. One lens through which we can understand the representation of women is the concept of the male gaze theory, a term coined by Laura Mulvey. This theory suggests that films are often made from a male perspective, with women being objectified and positioned as passive objects of desire. Moreover, one can also apply psychoanalysis to deconstruct the portrayal of women in film, as it delves into the unconscious desires and fears that shape our behavior.
In the melodrama genre, the limitations imposed on women are evident. These films often revolve around themes of family and traditional gender roles, perpetuating dominant-submissive patterns between men and women. Women are frequently portrayed as victims, bound by societal norms and suppressed desires. Examples of such limitations can be seen in the films "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and "The Dark Knight Rises."
In "The Postman Always Rings Twice," the female protagonist, Cora, epitomizes the limitations placed on women. Cora is trapped in a loveless marriage, longing for escape and freedom. However, societal expectations and the role of women as submissive wives confine her. Cora's desires are suppressed, leading to her involvement in a passionate affair that ultimately leads to tragedy. This illustrates the melodramatic depiction of the constraints placed on women, reinforcing the dominance-submission patterns inherent in the genre.
Similarly, in "The Dark Knight Rises," the character of Miranda Tate showcases the limitations placed on women in a different context. Miranda initially appears as a powerful businesswoman, seemingly challenging traditional gender roles. However, it is later revealed that her true identity is Talia al Ghul, a vengeful villain, subservient to the male antagonist, Bane. This twist subverts the expectations of female empowerment, emphasizing the dominance-submission patterns ingrained within the narrative.
By analyzing the limitations imposed on women in the melodrama genre, it becomes apparent that these narratives serve to reinforce the dominance-submission patterns between men and women. These films perpetuate traditional gender roles and restrict women's agency. The male gaze theory and psychoanalysis provide a valuable lens for understanding the portrayal of women in film, revealing the power dynamics at play within the narratives of "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and "The Dark Knight Rises." Through examining these specific examples, it becomes evident that the family's influence and societal expectations greatly shape the representation and roles of women in film.
