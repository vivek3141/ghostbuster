Introduction:
Currency exchange is an essential aspect of international trade, and its impact on a company's profitability cannot be overlooked. In this essay, I will evaluate three scenarios to analyze the impact of currency exchange on our company's trade in Malaysia. These scenarios include adjusting for currency fluctuations, using a fixed rate mentioned in the contract, and avoiding currency exchange by purchasing raw materials in Malaysian Ringgit (MYR). After analyzing both short-term and long-term perspectives, I will make a recommendation on the most viable and profitable option for our firm.

1. Adjusting for Currency Fluctuations:
Currency fluctuations can significantly affect a company's profitability. When the domestic currency strengthens against the Malaysian Ringgit, it can lead to decreased export revenues and increased import costs. Conversely, a weaker domestic currency can boost export revenues but increase import costs.
In the short-term, adjusting for currency fluctuations by hedging or using financial instruments can provide stability. This helps mitigate the negative impact of currency fluctuations on our company's trade. However, in the long term, relying solely on adjusting for currency fluctuations may not be the most viable and profitable option. Hedging can incur additional costs, and the complexity of currency markets makes it challenging to accurately predict future exchange rates. Moreover, currency fluctuations can still have unpredictable effects on trade profitability, even with hedging measures in place.
2. Using a Fixed Rate Mentioned in the Contract:
Another scenario to consider is using a fixed exchange rate mentioned in the contract. This option provides stability and certainty for both parties involved. By fixing the exchange rate at the time of signing the contract, the impact of future currency fluctuations is minimized.
In the short term, using a fixed rate can provide stability in financial planning and reduce the uncertainties associated with currency exchange. However, in the long term, this option may not be the most profitable. The fixed rate may not accurately reflect the currency's value, leading to potential discrepancies in the cost of raw materials, which can affect profitability. Additionally, the fixed rate might not be adjusted if there are significant exchange rate movements, causing the contract to become less favorable over time.
3. Avoiding Currency Exchange by Purchasing Raw Materials in MYR:
In this scenario, our company would purchase raw materials directly in Malaysian Ringgit, mitigating the need for currency exchange altogether. By eliminating the currency exchange risks, we can ensure a more stable pricing structure and reduce the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on profitability.
In the short term, avoiding currency exchange can provide immediate cost savings and protect against exchange rate volatility. Moreover, it simplifies financial planning and reduces transaction costs associated with currency conversion. However, in the long term, there may be potential limitations to this option. Firstly, sourcing raw materials solely in MYR may limit the options available or result in higher costs due to reduced competition. Additionally, it may require establishing relationships with local suppliers, which could impact supply chain logistics and potentially limit flexibility.
Conclusion:
After evaluating the impact of currency exchange on our company's trade in Malaysia, it is recommended that our firm considers a combination of approaches to achieve the most viable and profitable option in both the short term and long term. This includes adjusting for currency fluctuations to provide stability, utilizing fixed rates mentioned in contracts to mitigate uncertainties, and selectively purchasing raw materials in MYR to avoid exchange rate risks. By implementing a strategic approach that combines these options, our company can benefit from a balanced approach that maximizes profitability while minimizing currency exchange risks in our trade with Malaysia.
