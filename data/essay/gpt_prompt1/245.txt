Introduction (approximately 150 words)
Public corruption is a complex issue plaguing societies internationally, with far-reaching consequences for individuals, organizations, and entire societies.

Furthermore, it will critically assess the impact of ethics in the criminal justice system as a potent tool for addressing and preventing public corruption.
Body:
I. Individual Level Explanations (approximately 350 words)
At the individual level, a variety of factors contribute to public corruption. This section will explore two major explanations: personal greed and a lack of ethical compass.
A. Personal Greed
Individuals driven by personal greed often engage in corrupt practices, seeking personal gain at the expense of the public interest. Examples such as political bribery, police misconduct, or judicial malpractice will underscore this motivation.
B. Lack of Ethical Compass
The absence of a strong ethical compass can lead individuals to disregard norms and engage in corrupt acts. This section will investigate situational factors, such as diffusion of responsibility and rationalization, that erode ethical decision-making within the criminal justice system.
II. Organizational Level Explanations (approximately 350 words)
Corrupt practices are not limited to individuals; they can also permeate entire organizations. This section will examine two prominent explanations for corruption at the organizational level: systemic failures and cultural influences.
A. Systemic Failures
Flaws within the structure and processes of organizations often provide ‘loopholes’ for corruption to flourish. The essay will analyze instances such as ineffective oversight, inadequate internal controls, and flawed recruitment practices that contribute to organizational corruption.
B. Cultural Influences
Organizational cultures that inadvertently or intentionally foster corruption can significantly contribute to its prevalence. Drawing upon real-life examples, such as the notorious Enron scandal, the analysis will highlight the significance of organizational values, norms, and leadership in shaping individuals' behavior and perpetuating corruption.
III. Societal Level Explanations (approximately 350 words)
Public corruption occurs within a broader societal context shaped by various factors. This section will explore two factors contributing to corruption at a societal level: political and social instability.
A. Political Instability
Societies grappling with political instability, weak institutions, and corruption within political systems often experience higher levels of public corruption. Case studies from countries such as Nigeria or Ukraine will illustrate the detrimental impact of political instability on public corruption rates.
B. Social Instability
Economic disparities, social unrest, and lack of access to basic services can create fertile grounds for corruption to thrive. Examining real-life examples, such as bribery in developing healthcare systems, this section will analyze the correlation between social instability and public corruption.
