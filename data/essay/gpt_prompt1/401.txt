The loyalty ladder is a conceptual framework that illustrates the progression of customers from being aware of a brand to becoming loyal advocates. It consists of multiple stages, with each stage representing a level of commitment. These stages often include prospects, customers, supporters, advocates, and ultimately, brand champions. Moving customers up the loyalty ladder is an integral part of developing strong and lasting relationships.
