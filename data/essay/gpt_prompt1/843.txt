In Donna Woodfolk Cross's article, "Propaganda: How Not to Be Bamboozled," she argues that propaganda is neither inherently good nor bad, but rather a tool that can be exploited for various purposes. Cross effectively highlights different fallacies and demagoguery techniques by providing examples throughout her article. One notable fallacy she illustrates is the association fallacy, which subtly sways readers' opinions.
The implementation of an association fallacy is evident when Cross uses examples predominantly from right-wing talking points. By showcasing only one side of the political spectrum, the article lacks representation for opposing viewpoints, raising concerns about bias. This lack of diverse examples undermines the article's intention to expose propaganda, as it inadvertently becomes a tool for propaganda itself.
Despite the irony of the article's intention, Cross skillfully presents various techniques used in propaganda. She highlights fallacies, such as ad hominem attacks and appeal to fear, to demonstrate their persuasive power. By analyzing these techniques in detail, Cross forces readers to critically evaluate their beliefs and the propaganda they encounter in everyday life.
Overall, Cross's article effectively analyzes the use of propaganda by illustrating different fallacies and demagoguery techniques. However, the implementation of an association fallacy and the lack of representation for opposing viewpoints compromise the article's credibility and inadvertently turn it into a propaganda tool. Nonetheless, the article successfully exposes the power and manipulation behind propaganda, encouraging readers to be aware and vigilant in their consumption of information.
