In her essay "Framing Class, Vicarious Living, and Conspicuous Consumption," Diana Kendall argues that the media significantly influences the perception of social class and contributes to the legitimate inequality in society. This essay will discuss the portrayal of the upper and lower classes in media, the impact on human behavior, and the subsequent effects on the quality of life for lower-class individuals.
The media often portrays the upper class as wealthy, powerful, and successful, displaying luxurious lifestyles, extravagant mansions, and exclusive events. This portrayal encourages the desire to achieve similar status and material wealth, leading many individuals to engage in conspicuous consumption to convey their social standing. On the other hand, the lower class is often depicted negatively, perpetuating stereotypes of poverty, crime, and lack of education. These depictions contribute to the stigmatization of lower-class individuals, making it even more difficult for them to improve their quality of life.
The media's influence extends beyond perception, as it significantly impacts human behavior. Studies have shown that exposure to the glamorous lifestyles of the upper class can lead to feelings of dissatisfaction and a desire for consumption among lower-class individuals. This desire for material goods not only perpetuates economic inequality but also leads to excessive debt and financial instability for those who cannot afford such luxuries. Moreover, the constant exposure to negative portrayals of the lower class can reinforce prejudices and discrimination, hindering progress towards social mobility and equal opportunities.
The subsequent effects on the quality of life for lower-class individuals are profound. As the media idealizes wealth and luxury, it creates a culture of aspiration, where the pursuit of material possessions becomes the yardstick for success. This obsession with materialistic values can overshadow the importance of education, health, and social support systems that are crucial for improving the quality of life for lower-class individuals. Moreover, the media's portrayal of the lower class as inherently flawed and deviant contributes to social exclusion and perpetuates the cycle of poverty.
In conclusion, the media has a significant influence on the perception of social class and contributes to the legitimate inequality in society, as argued by Diana Kendall. The portrayal of the upper and lower classes in media perpetuates stereotypes, shapes human behavior, and has detrimental effects on the quality of life for lower-class individuals. Recognizing and challenging these representations is crucial for promoting a more equitable and inclusive society.
