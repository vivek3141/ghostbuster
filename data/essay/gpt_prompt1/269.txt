In Mary Shelley's iconic novel, Frankenstein, the theme of loneliness pervades the story, playing a crucial role in the development of the Monster's character. Throughout the narrative, the Monster experiences profound solitude, which engenders his monstrous behavior and drives his yearning for acceptance and companionship. This profound loneliness ultimately underscores the novel's exploration of the consequences of rejecting and neglecting others.
From the very moment of his creation, the Monster is thrust into a world that shuns and despises him. Dr. Victor Frankenstein, his creator, recoils in horror at the sight of his own creation, leaving the Monster abandoned and bereft. Devoid of guidance, the Monster must navigate the world alone, unable to make sense of his existence. This isolation sparks feelings of bitterness, vulnerability, and a deep yearning for acceptance that profoundly shape his character.
The Monster's experiences of solitude fuel his resentment towards his creator. He quickly realizes that he is fundamentally different from normal individuals and is thus condemned to be lonely. This knowledge leads him to seek validation and companionship from his creator, to whom he reaches out with desperation: "I am thy creature: I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel.” The use of biblical allusion emphasizes the Monster's longing for connection and his expectation of being accepted into society, much like Adam was accepted by God.
Furthermore, the Monster's forced isolation inevitably leads to his descent into evil. With no moral guidance or human interaction, the Monster resorts to destructive behavior as a means of coping with his loneliness. In one instance, to exact revenge on his creator for abandoning him, the Monster murders Victor's beloved brother, William. This act of violence, driven by the Monster's anguish and desire to elicit a response from Victor, demonstrates the toxic consequences of loneliness, as it blurs the boundaries between good and evil.
Paradoxically, the Monster's own appearance exacerbates his isolation. His grotesque physical features condemn him to everlasting solitude, as he is met with nothing but fear and repulsion from the human community. He reflects, "Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?” This perpetual exclusion from society reinforces the Monster's bitterness, sealing his fate as a lonely and misunderstood figure.
In conclusion, loneliness is a pervasive theme in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, significantly contributing to the development of the Monster's character. The Monster's profound isolation results in a complex range of emotions, leading to his bitter desire for acceptance and his ultimate descent into evil. Shelley's exploration of these themes serves as a stark warning about the devastating consequences of rejecting and neglecting others, reminding readers of the importance of empathy and connection in creating a more compassionate society.
