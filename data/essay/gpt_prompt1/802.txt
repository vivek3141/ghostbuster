Introduction:
In modern society, the portrayal of whiteness as the default in film, television, and media has played a significant role in shaping perceptions of race and identity. This essay will explore how the prevalence of whiteness as the norm has influenced cultural norms, stereotypes, and the construction of social hierarchies. By using Jordan Peele's critically acclaimed film, "Get Out," as well as other examples from the film industry, we will unveil the detrimental impact of such portrayals on marginalized communities. It is crucial to shed light on this issue, as it unveils the underlying biases ingrained in our media, which continually shape our understanding of race and identity.
The Prevalence of Whiteness as the Default:
One glaring issue within the film industry is the overrepresentation and privileging of white actors, characters, and storylines. Whiteness is often portrayed as the universal experience, relegating racial minorities to tokenized or stereotypical roles, thus reinforcing the idea of "otherness." In "Get Out," Peele masterfully explores these dynamics, foregrounding the way white characters casually dismiss and objectify the film's protagonist, Chris, underpinning the pervasive racial hierarchies so commonly seen. This portrayal also extends to other films, such as "The Help" and "Gone with the Wind," where white characters are positioned as saviors or drivers of change, while people of color are secondary characters, serving only to advance the white narrative.
Perpetuation of Stereotypes and Cultural Norms:
The portrayal of whiteness as the default in film and media has perpetuated deeply ingrained stereotypes about people of color, reinforcing harmful cultural norms. Take, for instance, the "gangster" stereotype commonly associated with African American males. Through repeated instances of depicting black characters as violent or dangerous, concepts of criminality and deviance become associated with racial minorities. This portrayal of stereotypes not only strips individuals of their complexity but also perpetuates systemic biases, leading to real-world implications, including racial profiling and the dehumanization of minority groups.
Furthermore, the portrayal of whiteness as the default normalizes Eurocentric features and beauty standards, implicitly suggesting that racial minorities are deviations from the ideal. Advertising and beauty industries often exclude or marginalize people of color, reinforcing the perception that their features are not the norm. This leads to a quest for assimilation and the erasure of cultural richness, as people of color are forced to conform to Eurocentric ideals in order to be accepted by mainstream society.
Impact on Perceptions of Race and Identity:
The depiction of whiteness as the default has profound consequences for how individuals perceive themselves and others. It perpetuates internalized racism, leading to identity crises and a struggle for self-acceptance among racial minorities. For example, the character of Chris in "Get Out" grapples with the tension between his black identity and the expectations imposed on him by white society. This struggle mirrors the experiences faced by many people of color who constantly face pressure to compromise or hide their cultural heritage in order to assimilate into predominantly white spaces.
Moreover, the default whiteness in film and media influences societal views on worth, intelligence, power dynamics, and success. It creates a hierarchy where whiteness is inherently associated with superiority and desirability, while racial minorities are often depicted as lesser or exotic. This perpetuates a subconscious bias that is challenging to overcome and perpetuates systemic inequalities in areas such as education, employment, and justice.
Conclusion:
The portrayal of whiteness as the default in film, television, and media has far-reaching consequences on perceptions of race and identity. By examining Jordan Peele's thought-provoking film, "Get Out," along with other examples from the film industry, we can begin to understand the detrimental impact that favoring whiteness has on marginalized communities. It is crucial to challenge and diversify these portrayals by advocating for more inclusive and authentic representations of racial minorities. Only through equitable and diverse storytelling can we strive towards a more inclusive and accepting society, dismantling the damaging hierarchies that whiteness as the default perpetuates.
