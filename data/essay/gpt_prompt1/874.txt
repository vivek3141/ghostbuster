Introduction (50 words): 
The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was a catastrophic event that influenced profound ethical evaluations of British Petroleum's (BP) spill management decisions. This essay will employ the ethical framework of utilitarianism to evaluate the overall outcome and benefits for all stakeholders involved. By assessing the consequences and looking at the greater good, this analysis will shed light on the ethical implications of BP's decisions.
BP's Decision-making Process (100 words): 
Utilitarianism suggests that ethical decisions should prioritize the greatest overall happiness for the largest number of individuals. In the case of BP's spill management, it is important to understand how their decision-making process aligned with these principles. Initially, BP's primary concern was mitigating financial losses and reputational damage. This short-term focus led to questionable decisions such as underestimating the spill magnitude and employing ineffective cleanup methods, which subsequently prolonged environmental and socioeconomic harm.
Assessing Overall Outcomes (100 words):
Utilitarianism evaluates the outcomes and weighs the consequences for all stakeholders involved. From a utilitarian standpoint, BP's decisions failed to prioritize the greatest overall happiness. The spill caused massive harm to the environment, destroying marine ecosystems, harming wildlife, and affecting countless communities reliant on tourism and fishing. Moreover, the spill exposed workers to hazardous conditions, resulting in injuries and fatalities. These severe consequences highlight the inadequacy of BP's spill management decisions according to the utilitarian perspective.
Considering Stakeholder Benefits (100 words):
Utilitarianism assigns moral significance to the benefits received by stakeholders. In the case of BP's spill management, stakeholders included the affected communities, BP shareholders, and the company's employees. By failing to implement effective measures promptly, BP prioritized short-term financial interests over the well-being of these stakeholders. The affected communities suffered significant economic losses, while shareholders also faced a decline in value. Additionally, BP employees were exposed to hazardous conditions, compromising their safety. Utilitarianism would suggest that BP's decisions failed to account for the greatest overall happiness of these stakeholders.
Conclusion (50 words):
Utilizing the framework of utilitarianism, BP's spill management decisions can be evaluated ethically. By prioritizing short-term financial gains over the well-being of stakeholders, BP's actions fell short of achieving the greatest overall happiness. The severe environmental, economic, and societal consequences of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill highlight the need for ethical decision-making that prioritizes the greater good.
