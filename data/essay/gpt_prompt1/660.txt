In addition to the hospital internship, I plan to intern at a private clinic specializing in a specific field of medicine, such as pediatrics. This internship will allow me to gain a deeper understanding of treating patients in a specialized setting. I will have the chance to work closely with a team of specialized medical assistants who are well-versed in pediatric care. This experience will enable me to develop a comprehensive understanding of the specific challenges and requirements involved in providing care to young patients, an essential skill for any medical assistant.
Furthermore, I intend to intern at a rehabilitation center, which will provide me with exposure to an entirely unique aspect of medical assistance. This internship will allow me to develop skills in working with patients undergoing recovery, such as physical therapy and occupational therapy. I will learn how to compassionately assist patients going through challenging rehabilitation processes, while supporting them in achieving their goals.
Each of these internships will contribute significantly to my professional development as a medical assistant. By exposing me to different medical settings, specialties, and patient populations, I will gain a well-rounded perspective on the field of medical assisting. These internships will enhance my clinical skills, strengthen my ability to work as a part of a medical team, and provide me with the essential real-world experience needed for success as a professional medical assistant.
