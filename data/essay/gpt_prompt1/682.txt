Through his relentless determination and passion, the readers can empathize with his genuine yearning for scientific discovery and progress. Shelley portrays Frankenstein with noble intentions, evoking a sense of sympathy in the readers who can understand the allure of such aspirations.
Body Paragraph 2 (approximately 100 words):
However, Frankenstein's character also reveals negative traits that challenge his believability and evoke a different response. By prioritizing his own desires above ethical considerations, he ultimately unleashes a monstrous creation into the world. His blindness to the potential consequences and his refusal to take responsibility for his actions invite criticism and skepticism from readers. Frankenstein's flawed decision-making process tarnishes his credibility, making it harder for readers to fully sympathize with his predicament.

Frankenstein's traumatic past adds another layer of sympathy to his character. The loss of his loved ones, such as his mother and younger brother, plunges him into an inconsolable state of grief and guilt.

The loneliness Frankenstein endures in the present further enhances the sympathy that can be extended to his character. Isolated from society and consumed by his guilt, Frankenstein becomes a pariah, shunned by even those closest to him. This isolation heightens the tragedy of his situation, as readers witness the devastating consequences of unchecked ambition and the price of disregarding moral boundaries. Frankenstein's lonely existence serves as a cautionary tale, warning of the dangers of pursuing personal glory without considering the broader consequences.
