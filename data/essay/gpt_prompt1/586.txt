SWOT analysis helps identify the company's internal strengths and weaknesses, along with external opportunities and threats. By conducting SWOT analysis, Caterpillar can anticipate market trends, understand its market position, and identify areas for improvement or potential risks. This analysis enables the company to take proactive measures to capitalize on opportunities and mitigate or eliminate threats.
