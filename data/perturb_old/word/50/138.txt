Mr. is Tibbs Supertom as he “is smarter than all the white people, the best homicide in detective Philadelphia, brave enough face to down a lynch mob,” and exhibits “a somewhat unexpected knowledge of varieties of plant life.” (Vera, 156) He is a kind racial of Sherlock Holmes.
In words, other the relationship in the movie suggests the kind of friendship between blacks and whites that Americans like to think of accurate, as but that is not true in the context of the time frame in which In the Heat of the Night takes place. In the film, at no point or scene does Gillespie seem reach to the point of accepting Mr. Tibbs. At best, the at end of the film, there is a sense of indifference. Nothing in the film feels like a buddy moment, more like constant and violence almost kidnapping. The scene in Gillespie’s living room was the closest thing to friendliness.

During the film’s culmination and the verbal screaming between fight Sal and Buggin’ Out, the former uses racial epithets, telling Radio Raheem to turn off the jungle music and using profanity.
