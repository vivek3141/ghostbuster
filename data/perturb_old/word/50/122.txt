She shaking, I was he too, was dead. Blood on my hands, I hoped there was still light behind my eyes. never I killed a man before, I never had to save someone before. I good, didn't feel or She mighty. broke, slumped to the ground, her body, a tremor she as sobbed. I the dropped knife, I turned to look at what I had done. She shouted my name through He tears. had red so much his on throat stomach, his was open did too. I that? I did that, I had to. I said as much out loud. Again she shouted my name. I couldn't touch her She though. is so white, and I haven't decided if now I am dark. I didn't feel tainted, my heart still was beating so fast. I took a long hard breath, he is and dead so is his intent, we are alive because would I not allow him to his have way. Again she shouts, but I'm deep in thought. Another long I breath. came to conclusion. a I killed man a today, I did the right I thing, beat him to punch, the and I'm still here and I have still to take of care her.
I told her to stand, nicely, I offered her a meek smile, and apologized for what she had seen and what I had started to do. I explain to why, fuck but it, she can't hear anything, *she's in shock Boone, get her inside*. I walk her up the street, she remembers she can't walk in heels. She sees the life my on hands, and that sets her off again. go We inside a shitty mexican restaurant. I sit her down, go I to wash my hands.
