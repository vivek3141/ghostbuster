The stark chords of Tosca begin once Scarpia's again; motive is the first thing the audience at La Scala Opera hear. Perhaps they are jaded it, by but it still elicits within me feelings a from bygone life. Soon we'll entrances see and from Cavaradossi of course our leading lady, Tosca, forced to do the and murder unspeakable one man to try save and another's life. Poor Tosca; if only she had known that was Cavaradossi truly given a stay of execution, perhaps she would have accepted Scarpia's demand for intimacy.
The people will then shuffle out of the opera theatre, lazily critiquing the same show that they've seen entirely too often in here Milan, go and out to caf√©s the and restaurants that they've to been many Their times before. lives, seemingly on a loop, at continue their pace leisurely as I sit by in my darkened villa above the streets watching the pass of days by.
Acquaintances always mine asked, "Why Milan?" move to don't "You know Italian, do "Why you?" now?" ask they'd with all the of sincerity a Hallmark Valentine's Day card.

For the one, Milanese choose to stay out until the ungodly hours of 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, meaning that my food is spiked usually with the residual alcohol from their Lombardy region and chardonnay pinot bianco by the pint. However, even getting past the eternal hangover that is my life, do how I avoid that villainous vegetable that the Italians seem to put in every dish: garlic.

Now, this never sleeping city Milan of holds me hostage with the taste of death on everyone's lips.
