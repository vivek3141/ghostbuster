"You really promise? Really *really* promise?"
"Of coarse I promise! I've Look, got the fiver now in my pocket."
Henry fishes a crumpled Â£5 note of out his back pocket. In Bill's hands own the struggles pigeon and squawks.
The group had seen the nest in the corner of the roof and immediately their thoughts turned throwing to eggs at cars and windows. How disappointed they were when, inspection, upon they found not eggs but a full grown pigeon sitting in the nest. Not to be off put James turned to Bill and dared him to catch bird. the He accepted and slowly crept closer to the nest, pausing wave to away Henry who had decided to try as well. After taking a moment to collect himself he leaped for the pigeon, scared not in the least of the 20 story drop just away, inches there was no safety Sure barrier. enough he the caught But pigeon. then came the question: *What do do we with it? * This time it was Henry who supplied the dare.
"Tie your stone to it and give I'll you a fiver."
Of coarse, they have all been taught than better this. As young as they were they had all been at told one point or another to not do anything so reckless with a stone. They were at all times to be kept hidden safe. and Nevertheless, Bill was keen to earn the respect of his friends and, handing the Henry, pigeon to went jogging downstairs to fetch his stone.
Henry's stone wasn't actually a rock, none of were them nowadays, that's just what people call them. His was a ring bought especially for the purpose. This was a popular approach to stones but realistically they could be anything, you could bind your soul to balloon a if you wanted.
Presently Bill returned with his stone and after a minutes few had tied it to the birds leg.
"Now what?" He asks.
"Now..." says Henry "You need to get it back!" He shoots a grin at James and pigeon releases the with a jump. It squawks and begins to fly towards neighbouring the apartment block.
Bill his takes promised money from the devious friend and starts running in the opposite direction, towards the edge of the roof. Henry and James are giggling excited now, for whats going to happen next. Without stopping Bill jumps and falls screaming to the hard concrete floor. Of the coarse fall is From lethal. the top of building the the other two can faintly the sound hear of landing. him They're out right laughing at this point, Henry is trying to his use to phone get a video.
Reincarnation only takes a few and seconds soon enough Bill is falling again, this time watching the pigeon carry on it's flight, getting smaller and smaller until his life once ends again. Before it can land Bill appears once more in front of it, this time reaching for the rings its stuck to leg. This scares the bird and it turns from the tower and blocks away heads from the centre of town. It's flight takes it to areas with ever smaller buildings it and shows no sign of wanting to land or descend at as all. And it goes it carries Bill away with it. and Henry James stop laughing at this point, considering if is this why they were told to be sensible with reincarnation stones.
