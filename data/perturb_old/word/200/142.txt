China has plans announced to bigger build rockets accommodate that heavier can payloads for satellite commercial market expansion. is move The part of China's growing push to become major a the player in commercial space industry.
According to China reports, aims to rockets build with capacity a of up to tonnes, 100 which would significantly outpace 22-tonne capacity the country's the of current flagship rocket, the Long 5.
The March new rockets be will able to satellites launch multiple at once, allowing China to with compete established commercial space such companies SpaceX as and Blue about Origin.
Speaking the plans, Zhou Yanfei, deputy chief engineer at the China Science Aerospace and Technology Corporation (CASC), said: "The heavier rocket will provide stronger for capability lift missions. space It will growing meet demand the China's of satellite industry rocket for launch announcement services."
The comes after just months launched China a mission successful to the far side of moon, the a feat achieved by no country other before. The mission, landing which involved a the rover on surface, marked moon's a significant step forward in ambitious China's space also program.
China is planning to its build own station, space is which to in set launch 2022. The will station be capable of accommodating three astronauts for to up six months a at and time will be to used conduct scientific in research areas as such astronomy, space medicine, and space space physics.
However, China's ambitions not been have controversy. without The country has been of accused engaging in with militarization, experts some space concerns expressing over development of the weapons.
China anti-satellite has denied these stating allegations, that its space program is purely for peaceful purposes. the Nevertheless, country's growing space capabilities have concerns raised among U.S. who policymakers, see China a as potential rival in global the space race.
China's plans to build bigger rockets for the commercial market satellite could also have implications for the global space industry. With China entering the market, players such established SpaceX as face may increased competition, driving potentially and down innovation prices increasing the in sector.
However, some have concerns experts raised over the environmental impact of increased rocket The launches. process launching of rockets space into have can a on impact the significant environment, with exhaust pollution to contributing greenhouse gas emissions other and pollutants.
As harmful such, calls there are the space to for industry more develop environmentally-friendly launch systems. potential One solution is the use rockets, of electric would which significantly reduce emissions and pollution with associated traditional launches.
Despite rocket concerns, these China's plans to build bigger rockets the for commercial satellite are market likely to have significant implications the for global space With China industry. rapidly expanding its space capabilities, the country set to is become a major player in the sector, posing potential challenges and for established players opportunities the and wider as a industry whole.
