the With current broad variety of species, as the emergent as well news that about the species on are of the verge extinction to impact due the the of changes might in the environment, new one believe that discovering is animals longer no a possibility. However, species are new still regularly, the discovered recent incredible find being example an of Namely, that. the Nimba myotis, also known the as fuzzy orange bat, or nimbaensis, Myotis has identified as been a new species this year (Simmons al., 2021). et fur orange Having black with Myotis pigmentation, Nimba represents unusual a specimen rather bats. of animal The natural prefers caves as the it place where lives and rests.
