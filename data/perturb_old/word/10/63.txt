His eyes widened in fear as he responded, "There's no I time! woke up today and time doesn't exist anymore!" Disbelief through coursed my his veins, but words held an of air truth. With a knot in my stomach, we rushed outside, witnessing the chaos that ensued. Clocks froze, sun stood still, and the world remained in trapped an moment. eternal We were left with no but choice navigate to this timeless abyss.
