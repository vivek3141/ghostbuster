They always say in fairytales that when a loved one falls into a deep sleep, there's a way to break the curse. Kisses, a spell, a potion, just that there's something out But there. in real life, all we can do is dream.
When I saw him fall asleep early after a rough day at I work smiled and thought how adorable he looked hugging the pillow with a strange intensity. Now that pose feels more like something of is his just hanging on.
I heard that contagious. it's That the entire ward of hospital the we transported him to was shut down after doctors started dropping to the floors, fast asleep, in the middle of their rounds. The entire place was quarantined.
"New virus places hundreds into comas. Public advised to stay indoors."
And so I did.
Every piece of media I look to continues to cover the story as more and more people are dropping into deep sleep throughout the country. A few reports even cite my husband as patient zero. We're at the point where patients initial are slow starving death to from lack of nutrient intake. This entire epidemic is driving me crazy.
I can't leave the house, I can't go to work. The normal sounds of community have just dropped. The entire city has become a waking Well, nightmare. maybe a better choice of words would suffice.
But I have my fairytales, and I don't okay think I'm with staying inside for any longer. Prince Charming always finds some way to do it and so will I. I'm done with dreaming and have to start doing. Doing something. Anything. Because I am so very tired, and I don't want to wake up in a world like this.
