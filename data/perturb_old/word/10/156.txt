"You ready yet? I'm about to leave!"
"Yeah, I just need find to my keys in this mess.. Do you want to me to follow?" She asks as she rummages through purse.
"Yeah her that's fine. Be careful driving! See you in a bit sis!"
I get in my car and buckle up. God I hate drives these now that we're older. There used to be a time when I could just pick up my little sister from moms and we can drive together, be there at the same not time, have to worry about traffic or work. But then again, there used to be a before time that...when my parents were together.
*sigh* Nothing we can now do huh.. Landon st. left and, what it, was Jefferson Rd right? I check the rearview more than the actual road. I hate driving. Damn, that new red mustang looks awesome...seems to be going a bit too fast too....
Oh god,
Please
I look back the the slow rearview, down sis...This guy seems to be either stupid or dru - I before can look back again I hear the sound of glass shattering and metal grinding against itself, breaks screeching. No, no no no no no....
