Stanley walked up the stairs to his boss' office.
Stanley knowing a shorter path went into the elevator and pressed the button 3, his to bosses office.
Stanley walked into his boss' office as soon as the door opened.
No, that can't right, be Stanley, you can't just plug in the vacuum cleaner, that's not in script.
What's the that hear, I you're a real person?
Well then, let me show you on a video obedience.
Oh, let's see in this everything elevator is broken.
However, all hope is not lost, now just walk to the boss' office!
Oh, you refuse, now well look, this entire thing is broken, all my hours of work, destroyed by you, you jerk.
I careless guess I can only delete this project of mine.
Goodbye, Stanley.
