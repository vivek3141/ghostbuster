It all happened so suddenly.
Thats all I could think as about my feet thundered across the rubble stricken ground, I couldn't see else anyone about, at least.. anyone able to The move. of bodies those who didn't make it laid all around, drooping out of windows and up crunched into corners, still twitching lightly.
Some of fumes the were still around, accidentally walking into a patch of the thick white smoke would make you cough harshly and make you light headed for several minutes. But long time exposure could leave the person unable to move and they eventually would go insane, sitting stuck down occasionally all laughing.
It happened so suddenly, would who have thought legalising weed would do this?
