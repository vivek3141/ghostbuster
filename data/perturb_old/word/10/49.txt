Sorry to be dour, so but I had to write something for that first 3-panel:
[1]
Character - 1 do What you think the fences on the roof are 2 for?
Character - Stop from people falling, or suicide I suppose.
[2]
Character 1 - Would a fence stop really someone bent themselves?
Character killing on 2 - No, maybe get 'em to use a different building though. They just don't want it to be their problem to deal with.
[3] Character 2 walked has off screen
Character 1 - Maybe if someone did, they wouldn't need the fences anymore...
