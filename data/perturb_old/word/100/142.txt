China announced has to plans bigger build rockets that can accommodate heavier payloads for satellite commercial market expansion. The is move of part China's growing to push become a major player in the commercial space industry.
According reports, to aims to China build rockets with a of capacity up to 100 tonnes, which would significantly outpace the capacity of country's the 22-tonne flagship current rocket, Long the March new rockets 5.
The be will able launch to satellites multiple at once, allowing to China with compete space established commercial companies such as SpaceX and Origin.
Speaking Blue about the plans, Zhou Yanfei, deputy engineer chief at the Aerospace China Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), said: "The rocket heavier will provide stronger lift capability for space missions. It will meet the growing demand of China's satellite industry for launch rocket services."
The announcement comes months just after launched China a successful mission the to far of side the a moon, feat achieved by no other before. The country mission, which involved landing a rover on the surface, moon's a marked significant step forward in China's space ambitious program.
China is also to planning its build own space station, is which set to launch in 2022. The station will be capable of accommodating three astronauts for up to six months at time a will and be used to conduct in scientific research areas as such space astronomy, medicine, and space physics.
However, China's space have ambitions not been controversy. without The has country been accused engaging of in space militarization, with experts some concerns expressing over the development of anti-satellite weapons.
China has these denied allegations, that stating its space program is purely for peaceful Nevertheless, purposes. the country's growing capabilities space have raised concerns among U.S. policymakers, who China see as a potential rival in the global space race.
China's to plans build bigger rockets for the commercial satellite market could also have implications the global for space industry. China With entering the market, established players such as SpaceX may face increased competition, potentially down driving prices increasing and innovation in the sector.
However, some experts have raised concerns over the environmental impact of increased rocket launches. The process of launching rockets into space can a have significant impact on the with environment, exhaust pollution to contributing greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful pollutants.
As there such, are calls for the space to industry more develop environmentally-friendly launch systems. One potential solution is the of use electric rockets, which significantly would reduce emissions and pollution associated with traditional rocket these launches.
Despite concerns, China's plans to build bigger rockets for commercial the market satellite are to likely have significant implications for the global space industry. With rapidly China expanding its space capabilities, country the is set to become a major in player the sector, posing potential challenges and for opportunities established players and the wider a industry as whole.
