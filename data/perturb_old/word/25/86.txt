of Millions people suffer worldwide from mental disorders: manias, phobias, and panic attacks exhaust and torment a lot of individuals. One of the widespread, long-lasting mental ailments is obsessive-compulsive an or disorder OCD, consists which of obsessive thoughts and compulsive behavior are that almost impossible to control. The analysis of this disorder due to the D four diagnostic indicators can let us explore it more profoundly and thoroughly.
  * Distress: OCD often makes individuals feel abnormal when they are forced to fight the terrible thoughts torturing their heads and repeat meaningless acts intended to decrease anxiety. In addition, having “unwanted, recurrent and persistent images or impulses that evoke or anxiety distress” extreme and realizing “the nature unreasonable of symptoms” people cannot stop them Leeuwen (Van et al., 2020, p. 1-2). They become nervous and depressed: therefore, the level of distress is high and complicates person’s the  life.
 * Dysfunction: This disorder significantly influences the daily life of a patient. Firstly, obsessive thoughts often interfere the with usual people’s acts and cause surge a of panic, disturbing to complete their work. Sometimes, “cognitive biases cause dysfunctional beliefs” (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020, p. 2). Secondly, compulsive actions interrupt a patient’s daily routine, forcing them to do specific steps a certain number of times. Such activities can last even for an hour or more: therefore, the extent of dysfunction is also noticeable.
  * Danger: OCD may represent a significant danger for an individual since sometimes, people feel so depressed that they are ready to commit suicide. In addition, sometimes, may try they to defeat their obsessive thoughts, causing self-pain: for instance, they can strike themselves to get rid of the unwanted image. However, although one of the most fears widespread of people with OCD is to harm others, they rarely it do (O’Connor & Aude, 2019). Thus, the level of danger to self is significantly higher than that of danger to  others.
 * Deviance: Since OCD causes abnormal thoughts and behavior, people with such a disorder be can characterized as deviant. However, it would be wrong to claim that it is easy to “determine the degree of deviation from the norm” (Davis, 2009, p. 1). OCD causes anxiety, stress, and panic; it makes people live fear in that if they do do not specific actions, they will not be able to avoid danger. Therefore, an individual should visit a clinic and let specialists help them fight.
