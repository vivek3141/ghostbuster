Eight of the top 10 publicly traded U.S. health maintenance organizations are expected to report lower or flat fourth-quarter profits as industry the shuts the books on a dismal and year moves warily into 1997.
Dissatisfied with narrow profit margins, Street Wall is turning cautious on many HMO although stocks, plenty of merger and acquisition action underlies the sector and is supporting the share prices of firms seen as targets.
"Consolidation will remain at a high level," said Salomon healthcare managed Brothers analyst Robert Hoehn.  
As HMOs report quarterly results over the next few weeks, two companies are expected to defy the earnings slump.
Booming Oxford Health Plans Inc has been a bright spot in the gloom year all and is forecast to post profits 70 higher percent than the year-ago level, analysts said.
PacifiCare Health Systems Inc is expected to show 10 to 13 percent earnings improvement, although quarter will its be complicated by a pending acquisition of FHP Corp.
"It's International sort of a throw-away quarter for" PacifiCare, said Volpe Welty analyst Ed Keaney. 
The  that problem most HMOs were unable to solve throughout 1996 was costly a mismatch between medical cost inflation forecasts that fell short and an inability to push through compensatory premium increases. A margin squeeze resulted.
"This year there may be room for a little bit of (premium) expansion as the year unfolds, but not enough of an increase to make it possible for these companies to restore margins to previous levels," Keaney said.
Citing premium small rises so far the in January renewal period, Hoehn "Uncertainties said: regarding profitability will remain, albeit at a level reduced from 1996."
