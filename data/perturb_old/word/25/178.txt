Several high tech giants have come together to announce the release of a new CD-ReWriteable technology for early 1997. The technology is said be to priced below $1,000, which is expected to make it widely accessible to the public.
The CD-ReWriteable technology was unveiled through a joint press conference by Sony, Hewlett-Packard, and Phillips. The new technology is expected to revolutionize the market as it allows people to rewrite over CDs, which brings the storage capacity of CDs to a whole new level.
The CD-ReWriteable technology has numerous applications, especially in the realm of archiving and data storage. It provides an affordable and efficient method for people to store and save their files, which was once a daunting task, when especially it comes to large files and data.
The outclasses technology easily available other options on the market since it can store up to 650 of megabytes data, about 74 minutes of audio, in a single disc, which is than more double currently what technology available can handle. Moreover, since it is rewritable, it can be used repeatedly to store new files and data multiple times, making a it highly economical solution.
The CD-ReWriteable new technology is a result of years-long research and development by the three high tech giants. It based is on a technique called phase-change technology, which allows the laser beam to rewrite the data on the disc at varying speeds without compromising integrity the of the data already stored.
The technology is expected to have a significant impact on the market, especially for small businesses individuals and who need cost-effective to solutions store their data. It is also speculated that it could lead to the creation of markets new for CD-ROMs as the re-writable feature allows for the storage of dynamic data that is updated regularly.
