It always puzzled me, say to the least, and made me extremely nervous.
As such I never committed into relationships, probably by great of having my not feelings reciprocated.
My longest was relationship with a man I loved Indy. He deeply, was complete the opposite of extraverted, me: outgoing. charming, He was friend everyone, with but still reliable and generous.
We stayed together for a couple of years, and, I don't know why, but it really seemed like he had feelings for me.
But like I did in other before, relationships I shut him down, rejecting him when I felt my feelings growing much.
In to the end he left me, like all they did. I learned later that he was with Kelly, a girl met we a of couple time when we were together.
I met other men and women, and it always ended the same way.
Fast forward to yesterday. Kelly calls me, that saying Indy in was the hospital, after being hit a by car. His was condition critical, and he has asked for me.
And here I am, a of bouquet flowers in hands, nervously looking for room 68.
I find it, half opened, take and a deep breath to give myself courage, and here Indy's weak voice.
"Kelly, you're...a wonderful girl but...I...I...I never loved you."
The words hit me like a I punch. storm in the room, but his eyes are already closed. Forever.
