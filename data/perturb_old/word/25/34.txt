The decision by the giant British Telecom Scheme Pension transfer to assets to the new Hermes Liberty Pensions International funds would the give venture new a boost.
"I would hope it gives some people feeling some of security that BT Pension Scheme, which is after all the biggest in the country, is willing to do this," he said.
Liberty plans to sell personal pensions its at regional shopping centres, which are held through a majority-owned subsidiary Capital Shopping Centres. These have more than 150 million customer visits a year, Liberty said.
