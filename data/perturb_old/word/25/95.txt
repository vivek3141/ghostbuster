With the current broad variety of species, as well the as emergent about news the species that are on the verge extinction due of to the impact of the changes in the environment, one might believe that discovering new animals is no longer a possibility. However, new species are still discovered regularly, the recent incredible find being an example that. of Namely, the myotis, Nimba also known as the fuzzy orange bat, or Myotis nimbaensis, has been identified a as species new this year (Simmons et 2021). al., Having orange fur with black pigmentation, Nimba Myotis represents a rather unusual specimen of bats. The animal prefers natural caves as the place where it lives and Like rests. other bats, Nimba Myotis uses laryngeal echolocation as means the of and identifying catching in prey the dark. However, due to the species in question under being researched, its is diet mostly unknown (Simmons et al., 2021). Overall, bat the represents a unique specimen in its class.
The species belongs to the animal kingdom, particularly, to mammals of the Chiroptera order and the Vespertilionidae family (Simmons et al., 2021). The main rationale for placing it in animal kingdom the is the fact that Nimba Myotis is a mammal. Additionally, the specified species reproduces sexually, unlike members of other kingdoms, and is multicellular (Simmons et al., 2021). Furthermore, the fact that cells in Nimba Myotis do not have cell walls, allows classifying with it other species in the Animal kingdom. Therefore, the should bat be defined as an animal, particularly, a mammal. Furthermore, one note should that, being a bat, Nimba Myotis the represents largest order in the mammal class rodents after (Simmons et al., 2021). Overall, the discovery of Nimba Myotis has shed a lot of light on the species of bats, in general.
