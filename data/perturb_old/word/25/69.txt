I knelt down, blood still on my asking clothes, for forgiveness to these statues around me. I was never religious, but sometimes life makes you do you things never usually do. What I've done in life cannot be undone, a mothers have lost sons, sisters have lost and brothers kids have lost their dads. am I a not sinner, but have I sinned; it's the business I am in. I first killed a man at age the of 13 with my bare hands, choked him until he went cold. I'm 52 now--probably to coming my close last few years in this life, there's but one thing don't I regret it's and taking life the of a criminal who didn't belong. I hunt people evil who've caused misery to and communities I believe I've done the right thing so far. got I up from my and knees left San Jose church, which my visited family every few Sundays growing up. I last took the step onto the sidewalk when I felt the barrel of a.357 magnum being pressed against the back of my head. I didn't process what was happening because it had never happened. The world went silent and I could almost hear finger tightening the on the trigger when the loud bang rang through the streets. All I had was 7 seconds before I saw black and my felt body and tensing going into shock. I hope they serve tequila in hell.
