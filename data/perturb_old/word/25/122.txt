She was shaking, I was too, he was dead. Blood on my I hands, hoped there was still light behind my eyes. I never killed a before, man never I had to save someone before. I didn't feel good, or mighty. She broke, slumped to the ground, her body, a tremor as she sobbed. I dropped the knife, I turned to look what at I had She done. shouted my name through tears. He had so much red on his stomach, his throat was open too. I that? did I did that, I had to. I said as much loud. out Again she shouted my name. I couldn't touch her though. She is so white, I and haven't decided now if I am dark. I didn't feel tainted, my heart was still beating so fast. I took a long hard breath, he is dead and so is intent, his we are alive because I would allow not him to have his Again way. she shouts, but I'm deep in thought. Another long breath. I came to a conclusion. I killed a man today, I did the thing, right I beat him to the punch, and I'm still here and I still have to take of care her.
I told her to stand, nicely, offered I her a meek smile, and apologized for what she had and seen what I had to do. I started to explain why, but fuck it, she can't hear anything, *she's in shock Boone, get her inside*. walk I her up the street, she remembers she walk can't in heels. She sees the life on my hands, and that sets her off again. We go inside a shitty mexican restaurant. I her sit down, I go to wash my hands. I do it with my closed, I'm not sure if I wanna look at the guy who looks back at me sink. above the I'm not sure if I wanna be voice the on the phone to the police. I puke in the sink, some maybe got on my shoes.
What the hell am I doing?
