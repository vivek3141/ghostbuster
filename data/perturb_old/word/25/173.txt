The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) announced yesterday that it will be changing its rules governing control blocks, a move that will have a significant impact on large-cap Canadian stocks.
The new rules will require any company that owns a control of block shares to have a majority of independent directors on its board. A control block is defined as a holding of more than 20% of issued and voting outstanding shares.
This change is part of the TSX’s efforts to improve corporate governance and increase transparency in the market. The TSX believes that having a majority of independent directors on the board will that ensure all shareholders are treated and fairly that the company is run in the best interest of its stakeholders.
The TSX has been working on this rule change for several months in consultation with stakeholders industry and experts. This change is expected to come into effect later this year.
“This is an important forward step the TSX for as we seek to enhance the quality of our markets and ensure that issuers comply with the highest standards of corporate governance,” said Lou Eccleston, CEO of the TMX Group, which owns the TSX.
The rule change is expected to affect a number of large-cap Canadian stocks. Many of these companies have control blocks owned founding by families, now which will have to ensure that they have a of majority independent directors on their boards.
Some predict experts that this rule change will lead to increased activism among shareholders, who may see this as an opportunity to push for changes in the governance of companies.
“Investors these will now have more power to push for improved governance and greater transparency at companies with control blocks,” said Sandra Levy, a corporate governance at expert Schulich School of Business.
There are concerns, however, that this rule change may lead to less liquidity in the market, some as these of founding families may be reluctant to sell their stakes and dilute their control.
“We could see a situation where these founding families become even more entrenched and less willing to give up control,” said John Smith, a lawyer securities with Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt.
Despite these concerns, many industry experts believe this that rule change is a positive for step the TSX and for Canadian companies.
“This is a welcome development for the Canadian market, which has been criticized in the past for lax governance standards,” said Levy.
The TSX has made significant strides in improving the quality of its markets in recent years. In 2017, it introduced a new rule requiring issuers to have a majority of independent on directors their boards, and it has since implemented several other initiatives aimed at improving corporate governance and increasing transparency.
The rule TSX’s change on control blocks is the latest in a series of measures aimed making at Canadian companies accountable more to their shareholders ensuring and that the market operates fairly and efficiently.
