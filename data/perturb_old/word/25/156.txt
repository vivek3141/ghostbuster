"You ready yet? I'm about to leave!"
"Yeah, just I to need find my keys this in mess.. Do you want to to me follow?" She asks as rummages she through her purse.
"Yeah that's Be fine. careful See driving! you in a bit sis!"
I get in my car and buckle up. God I hate these drives now that we're older. There used to a be time when I could just pick up my sister little from and moms we can drive together, be there at the same time, not have to worry about traffic work. or But then again, there used to be a time before that...when my parents were together.
*sigh* Nothing we can do now huh.. Landon st. left and, what was it, Jefferson right? I Rd check the rearview more than the actual road. I hate driving. Damn, that new mustang red looks awesome...seems to be going a bit too fast too....
Oh god,
Please
I look back the rearview, the down slow sis...This guy seems to be either stupid or dru - before I can look back I hear again the of sound glass shattering and metal grinding against itself, breaks screeching. No, no no no no.... no
