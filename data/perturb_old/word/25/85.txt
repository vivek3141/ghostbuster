It all so happened suddenly.
Thats all I could think about as my feet thundered the across rubble stricken ground, I see couldn't anyone about, else at least.. anyone able to move. The bodies of those didn't who make it laid all around, drooping of out windows and crunched into up still corners, lightly.
Some of twitching the were fumes still around, accidentally into walking a patch of the thick white smoke make would you cough harshly and you make headed light for several minutes. But time long could exposure leave the person unable to move and they would eventually go stuck insane, sitting laughing.
It down occasionally happened all so suddenly, who would have thought legalising weed would do this?
