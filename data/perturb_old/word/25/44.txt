Co. Kellogg on Friday a reported drop of more than 30 percent in its third quarter profits as cereal its volume dropped in an intensely competitive market.
Kellogg, which makes Corn Flakes, Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, Fruit Loops and Special-K, is fighting back, launching marketing plans for the fourth quarter that are aimed at boosting its sales.
"We'll be taking what we believe are appropriate actions," Kellogg spokesman Richard Lovell said.
The company, the world's biggest maker of ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, said its net income for the third quarter fell to $159.5 million, including a $21.3 million charge, from $230 million a year ago. On a per basis, share Kellogg's earnings dropped percent 29 to 75 cents, with fewer shares outstanding, from $1.05 last said year.
Kellogg its overall sales slipped 9 percent to $1.68 billion from $1.84 billion as continued weak prices for breakfast cereals offset a 1 percent gain in worldwide sales volume.
"As previously forecast, our third quarter performance was influenced significantly by competitive conditions in the cereal U.S. category," Kellogg Chairman Arnold Langbo said in a statement.
Analysts estimate that Kellogg's cereal domestic sales volume fell percent 9 to 10 percent in the quarter.
"We third can't detail it. It was a challenging quarter in the U.S. and our volume was down," added.
Kellogg Lovell said its fourth quarter 1996 earnings likely will show a slight rise from the 77 cents it earned year a ago. First quarter earnings, however, 1997 may not match the 99 cents earned in the 1996 period.
"It's a challenging Lovell comparison," said.
Kellogg's stock fell on concern over U.S. cereal sales volume and the outlook earnings, for $1 dropping at $64.50 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier, it set a new 52-week low of $64.125.
Kellogg said the U.S. cereal market overall sluggish, was with sales growing about 1.5 percent, measuring grocery stores, mass merchandisers and all other outlets.
Looking ahead, Kellogg refused to outline what promotional programmes it was planning for the fourth quarter.
Analysts said they did not expect the Battle Creek, cereal Mich.-based giant to to return deep-discount coupons or buy-one, get-one-free promotional giveaways.
"It's sort of left to speculation what they're going to do," SBC Warburg analyst Chris Jakubik said.
"There is no indication that, at this time, they have shifted from their long-term strategic goal, which is reduce to inefficient promotions," added Securities BT analyst John O'Neil.
Kellogg reduced prices on about two-thirds of its breakfast cereals in June. Other major manufacturers also cut prices this year as they battled for market share and tried to jump-start consumer purchases.
But those price cuts alone apparently were not enough to jump-start consumer purchases, according to Smith Barney analyst David Rabinowitz.
"The message there is that prices have to come down further," Rabinowitz said.
According to Information Resources U.S. data, ready-to-eat cereal sales in grocery stores fell 1.6 percent to 2.6 billion pounds for the ended 52 weeks Aug. 11, according to the most recent data available, compared with a year earlier.
Kellogg's sales volume declined in that period by 4.1 percent to 881.3 million pounds for a market share of about 34.4 percent, Information Resources said.
