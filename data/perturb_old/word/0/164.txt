In Adorno's concept of industrial culture, media products for children are seen as extensions of capitalist values. Adorno argues that these products, such as children's television shows and movies, are created with the sole purpose of generating profit for corporations. They promote consumerism and encourage children to become passive consumers in a capitalist society. This perspective aligns with the Marxist critique of capitalism.
A prominent example of media products reinforcing capitalist values can be seen in the vast amount of merchandise associated with popular children's franchises. For instance, the success of animated films like the "Frozen" series goes far beyond the box office revenue. It encompasses a wide range of merchandise, including toys, clothing, and accessories. These products are not just meant to entertain children, but also to create demand for consumer goods. The media plays a significant role in shaping children's desires and preferences, deliberately promoting consumer culture.
Contrasting Adorno's perspective, structural functionalism suggests that media products for children serve a more positive function in society. According to this approach, these products fulfill children's developmental and educational needs, providing them with entertaining and informative content. For instance, educational shows like "Sesame Street" have been praised for their ability to foster learning and social development among children. Moreover, the media also serves to unify society by providing cultural narratives and shared experiences.
While structural functionalism acknowledges the influence of capitalism in media production, it prioritizes the positive social contributions of these media products. This perspective tends to focus on the potential benefits for children's growth and the promotion of social cohesion.
In conclusion, media products for children do reinforce capitalist values to a significant extent, according to Adorno's concept of industrial culture. Examples like the promotional merchandise associated with popular children's franchises emphasize the materialistic nature underlying these products. However, the perspective of structural functionalism offers a more optimistic view, emphasizing the educational and unifying aspects of media products. While both perspectives recognize capitalist influences in media production, they differ in their evaluation of the overall impact on society and children.
