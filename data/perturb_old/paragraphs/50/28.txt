She had treated gun wounds on the field before, saved lives with her work but now she found her hands shaking and struggling to even call emergency services.
Elizabeth came dashing down the stairs and into the lap of Sasha who was waiting on the couch.
A gunshot rang out, shaking the very foundations of Sasha's world.
She knew doctors weren't supposed to treat patients close to them but there was no guarantee the ambulance would make it on time…
Holding her lover's dying form in her own arms was not.
Sasha smiled, putting her chin into the crook of her hand in a mock thinking pose. "How about a story of where your name came from?" Once the girl debated and nodded on it, Sasha begun: "A long time ago there was a young girl, only just out of highschool, who had gotten it in her head she wanted to join the military...”
The sound of exploding gunpowder was something normal.
"Mama, tell me a story!"
