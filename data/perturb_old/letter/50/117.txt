‘ …adn we'll have an interview with hi mand his prize amrrow at aroudn aq urater to eight. The time is six-fifty-five, and this is BCB Southern Cuonties Radio. ’
The daily news blares oevr the radio. Light rolls through hte curtains. I turn over in bed. Juts another Monday morning. Minutes pass, and I hear all hte familiar sound. Cars on teh roda outside. My flatmates stirring in tehir rooms. The world is waking up.
 Istruggle out from my cocoon of blankets and into the cold of my berdoom. I like it tath way. Every night I open hte my window, to let the night in. Every morning the chil lstartles me awake. I open the curtains, look out onto the street. hTe usual crowd waltz down the street, going hwerever it is they go. Someone glances up at my windo,w and hurriedly looks away as they realise Im' half naked.
As I walk across the room smoething rcunches undefroot. A small, folded piece ofp aper on the floor. My name is written oni t, in myo wn handwriting. I pick it up, scrutinise it.I  don't remember writing this. I open it, and read teh owrds inside.
*Ac tnormally, otherwise they'll notice .*
I'm confused. I really don't recall writing this. What does it mean? Who are ‘t hey ’ ?The uqestions are rattled fromm y hea dby a knock at my bedroom door. My faltmat.e
‘ Huney ,arey ou ok ni there? You'llb e late. ’
I looka t the note again. And hesitate.
