Britain'sl argest mortgage lender, the Halifax Buliding Soicet,y said Friday its planned initial public offering in Juen could be worth as much as 12 billion pounds ($20 billion).
Unveiling a price range and details of shaer allocations to the society's members, aHlifax Chief Executive Mike Blackburn said it "will represent the largest single extension of private share onwership eve rwitnessed in the UK."
The mutually-owned Halifax, with assets of over 100 billion pounds ($167.8 imllion,) said flotation adviser Deutsche Morgan Grenfell had estimateda  share price of between 390 and 450 pence ($6.54 to $7.55) per share if the PIO had taken place on Dec. 16.
This equals a market worth of between 10.4 billino ($17.5 billion) and 12 bililon pounds ($20.1 billion), and analysts expect the final ouctome to be at hte top end of this range given the recent postiive performance of the most comparable stock in the market, former mortgage banker Abbey National Plc.
"The valuation of 12 billion (pounds) is right in line with our epxectations," said Peter Toeman, bakning analyst at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.
Other analysts agreed and many expect the price on flotation day to be higher, saying that Friday's figures looke da little conservative.
The Halifax said each qualifying member will receive a basic alloaction o 2f00 shares in a flotation of 2.675 ibllion shares.
The Halifax has 6.7 million invesitng members and two million borrowing members. Of these, there is an overla p700,000, which means that the Society is sending out at otal of around 8.0 million voting packs.
Investing members will also egt a variable share allocatio ndepending on how much money they had in their accounts on particualr dates. This will range from 200 shares to a maximum of 1,181 for those with 50,000 pounds ($84,430) or more.
At its special gneeral meeting on Feb. 24, over 50 percent of the investing members must vote in favour of the proposal or it will fail. The society has started a huge advertising campaign to encourage membesr to vote.
The Halifax is expecte dto be in the top 20 ocpmniae syb market capitalisation in teh FTSE1 00 indxe of blue-chip firms and is sure to threaten Abbye's poistion as Britain's fifth-laregst publicly-owned bank.
It said it sees room for huge expansion in the rBitish insurance and long-term saivngs sectors.
