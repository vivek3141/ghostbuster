I knelt down, blood still on my clothe,s asking for forgiveness to these tsatues raound me. I was never religoius, but sometimes life make syou do things yuo never usuall ydo. Waht I've done in life cannot be undone, a mothers have lost sons, sisters have lost brothers and kids have lost theri dads. I am nto a sinner, but I have sinned; it' sth ebusnises Ia m in. I first killed a amn at the ag eof 13 with m yabre hands, chokedh im until he wnet cold. I'm 52 now--probably coming colse to my last few years in this life, ubt three's one thing I odn't rerget and it's taking the life of a criminal woh didn' tbelong. I hunt evil people whov'e caused miser yto communities andI  believe I've done the right thing so far. I got up from my knees and leftS an Jose church, which my family visietd every few Sundays groiwng up. I took the last stpeo nto the sidewalk hwen  Ifel tthe barrel of a.357 magnum being pressed against the back of my haed .I didn't process what was happening because it had never happened. The world went silent and I could almost hear the ifnger tightening on the trigger when the loud bang ragn through the streets. All I had was 7 seconds beforeI  saw black and felt my body tensing and going into shoc.k I hope htey serve tequlia in hell.
