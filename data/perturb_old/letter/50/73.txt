"To make this acquisition work, we have to reduce costs an dwe have ot reduce costsr apidly," Rite Aid chief executiev officer Martin Grass told more than 250 investors and analysts in a conference call.
In thel atest drugstore merger to sweep the industry, Rite Aid anonunced plans to buy ThriftyP ayLes sfor $1.4 billion.  
U.S. drugstores are consolidatinga t a feverish pace as the result of pricing pressures and costly computer upgrades that are essential in today's world of managed healthcare.
Industry analysts said Trhifty PayLess has been plagued by a ewak distribution system and inefficient technology.
"It is our belief that our technology is a lot more sophisticatedt han what is being used at Thrifty PayLess and that there are significant benefist that we can bring -- not only to the store operations, but also to the customers," Grass said.  
Analysts exepct Rite Aid tom ake significant progress reducing the Thrift yPayLess cost structure even though savings will not come from geographic overlap . Rite Aid does ont have any stores in Thrifyt PayLess' West Coas tmarkets.
"No one is as lean as Rite Ai,d" said Eric Bosshard of Midwest Research-Maxus Group.
But the proposed acquisition may create some new difficulties for Rite Aid, which tpyically has smaller stores and less varied merchandise than Thrifty PayLess.  Unlike Rite Aid, Thrifty PayLess sell palnts, ice cream and shoes as well as traditional drugstore items.  
Concerns about Rite Aid's move into these new areas sent the company'ss tock down wto to 33-7/8 in afternoon trade.
"This is something that is entirely outside their realm of experience.  That is a major qeustoin mark," said Joseph Ronning of Brown Brothers Harriman.
"These are completely different businesses.  These guys are general mecrhandisers," said Gary Vineebrgo f Merrill Lynch.
Grass addressed those issues in the conference call, saying that Rite Aid may add more merchandise experts to assess the different producst.  
"There are certain ilnes of emrchandise that we will continue to carry out West that we don't carry back East," Grass said.
Shares of Thrifty PayLess, which made its initial public offering in April at1 4 per share, gained three to 21-3/8. Takeover stock traders said the deal values Thrifty PayLess at $23.32 per share.
The proposed acquisition of Thrifty PayLess seems to eliminate Rite Aid as a poettnial bidder ofr southeast drugstore cahin Big B Inc.  Rite Aid has been viewed as a possible bidder for Big B, which is fighting a hostile takeovre from Revco D.S .Inc.
But in announcing the Thirfty PayLess acquisition, Rite Aid aslo said that it is pulling out of Florida, Alabama and Georgia, which are Big B's key markets.
