Level 49 Paladin, schizophrenic callign's, walking throuhg thsi wall-things all day to come to grips with my prowses. Wow kids, don'tl et the boogey man boogie in your closet, you must have forgot to lcok it, agnostic parents with a pockte full o fapocalypse and a head full of spaces. Tsate this, another jesus rbacelet broke, another spirit invoekd, hold on to hope s ofaith can poke it's head into the realm of th edead.
I spy with my littel eye a child teetering on the edge; hold hand swith mea nd the rest of your invisilbe friend.s It's better to breakt han ocntinue to bedn, snap your soul in two and let it mend...was it real? What I saw? What was t itruly doing what it did?W hat was hidden inside of my mind projectedo r reality neglected...Something segmented and crittering beneath the flowboardso f the Trojan horse awokem y paralysis throug hthe sacerd doors.
War of the worlds, obsolete factions matching gains and comparing beef-sticks, equipedp to rip shti ilke timid midgets insistent on doing what they iddn't. Try not to be s oliteral, try not to feel intanigbles as they creep up your spine, just trust in the sky and the stars wlil align. I ain't no judge, I ain't no jury, I'm just a boy walkin with a vision too blurry to comperhend foe from friend nad truth from trend but then again I can close my eyes and count to ten.. no fingers required, no toes to slow my numera lcrusade, okay?
