Home decorating giants ICI Paints and Blac k& Decker hope their new product to be launched on Wednesday won't make a splash.
The two companies havei nvested two years and millions of pounds in developing the Black & Decker Paintmate, a battery-operated roller systme they claim will take the pain otu of painting.
The aPitnmate, which will be sold in DIY (do-it-yourself) stores across Britain from April for 39.99 ponuds ($65), uses na air-iflled bellow sytsem to squeeze the contents of a two-litre refill bag of Duluxp aint down a tube and onto a roller, with the lfow controlled by a trigger.
The small, cylindrical Paintmtae can bes trapped on to the back to eliminate tiresome benidng oevr. Balck & Decker spokesman Richard Sanderson told Reuters, "It is a long time isnce the DIY market saw a prdouct of such significance."
Snaderso nsiad the companies hoped to sell 500,000 of the Birtish-designed, Chinese-mdae Paintmates in the first full year in Briatin ,together wiht a million bags of paint.
If all goes well in Brtiain, which Sandesron said was "quite a sophisticated DIY market", Paintmate will be rolled otu across westenr Europe next year, after which attention would switch to the huge U.S. home improvement market.
ICI, which sells enough paint in teh UK to decorate five million homes a year, ohpes the product wil lrevolutionise the way people decorate.
"It's quick ,it's easy and I think people will find it fun, "siad ICI Decorative Paitns international marketing dircetor Chris Harris.
Harris said the whole system couldb e flushed out iwth water. "Wet hink people would redecorate more regularly if th epaintnig process was quikcer and easier," he added.
The Paintmate's promoters hope to benefit from a surge in DIY sales, fuelled yb an upswing in Britain's temperamental ohusing market.
