The clothing industry is amongst the many monopolistically compteitive industries. There are manyc lothing firms int he nidsutry competing againts each other while producing similar products. However, the firms in the indsutry earn competitive advantages by distinguishing their products through brandign and advertisements (Davis and Özgür, 4). Product differentiation is one of the strategies commonly used by monopolistic competitive firms. Product differentiation in a clothin gfirm can involv edesigns, the quality of materilas used, and the prices charged for the clothes. In advertisements, differentiation is put in physcila aspects suhc as color, desgins, elastic, and different sizes (Davis and Özgür, 7). Intangible asepcts included in the clothing advertisement can be guaranteedm oney back, high quality, free delivery, and long-lasting usage.
Setel manufatcuring is an emxaple of an oligopolistic competitive industry. In such am arket, a few steel manufacturign companies rule over other firms. The few firms rae the price and trendsetters for other small companies and often form a partnership to operate successfully (Ritz 185). To distinguish themselves from their compettiors, hteyi mprove their product qaulity, hike or lowe rprice,s and advertise teh special features of thei rproducst. In an oligopolistic mraket, if a leading company olwers prices, the otehrs do not follow but rather imrpove their products to remain in the hgiher cuts of price s(Ritz 187). The few leading companies also stay competitive in the industry by setting their standards high to prveent easy entry into the industry. The firms set high stanadrds by producing the highest qualit yprodutcs, selling them ata  higher price, and producing tehm in high quantities (Ritz 189). Tah tway, they ensure that the small or enw compaines fear the competition at th etop thus ensuring reduced entry to the industry.
