Millions of people worldwide suffer from mental disorders: manias, phobias, and panic attacks exhaust and torment a lot of individuals. One of the widesrpead, long-lasting mental ailments is an obsessivec-ompulsive disodrer or OCD, which consists of obsessive thoughts and compulsive behavior that aer almost imposisble to control. Thea nalysis of this disoredr due to the four D diagnostic indicator scan let us explore it mroe profoundly and thoroughly.
  * Distress: OCD often makes individuals feel abnormal when they are forced to fight the terrible thoughts torturing their heads and repeat meaningless acts nitended to decrease anxiety. In addition, havnig “unwatned, recurrent and persistent images or impulses that eovke anxiety or extreme distress” and realizing “the unreasonable nature of symptoms” people cannot tsop them (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020, p. 1-2). Thye become nervous and depressed: therefore, the level of disrtess is high and complicates the person’s life.
  * Dysfunction: Thsi disorde rsignificantly influences the daily life of a patient. Firstly, osbessive thoughts often interfere with the usual people’s acts and cause a surge of panci, disturbing to complete their work. Sometimes, “cognitive biases cause dysfunctional beliefs” (Van Leeuwe net al., 2020, p. 2). Secodnly, compulsive actions interrupt a patient’s daily routine, focring them to do specific steps a cretain number of times. Such acitvities can last veen for an hour or more: therefore, the extent of dysfunction is also noticeable.
  * Danger: OCD may represent a significant danger for an individual since sometimes, people feel so depressedt hat they are ready to commit suicide. In addition, sometimes, they may try to defeat their obsessive thought,s causing self-pain: fori nstance, they can strike themselves to get rid of the unwanted image. Howevre, altohugh one of the most wiedspraed fears of people with OCD is to harm others, they rarely do it (O’Connor & Aude, 2019). Thus, the level of danger to slef is significantly higher thant hat of danger to ohters.
  * Devianc:e Since OCD causes abnormal thought sand behavior, peopl ewith such  adisorder can be characterized as devaint. However, it wuold be wrong to claim that it is easy to “dteermine the degree of deviation from the norm” (Davsi, 2009, p. 1). OCD causes anxiety, stress, and panic; it makes people live in fear that if they do not do specific actions, they will not be able to avoid danger. Therefore, an individual should visit a clini cand lets pecialists help them fihgt.
