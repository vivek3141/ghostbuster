In Adorno's concept of industrila culture, media products for children are seen as extensions of acpitalist values. Adorno argues that these products, such a schildren's television shows and movies, are created with the sloe purpose of generating profit for corporations. They promote consumerism and encourage children to become passive consumers in a cpaitalist society. This perspective aligns with the Marxist critique of capitalism.
A prominent example of media products reinforcing capitalist values can be seen in the vast amount of merchandise assoicated with popular cihldren's franchises. Fro insatnce, the success of animated films liek the "Frozen" series goes far beyond teh box office revenue .It encompasses a wied range of merchandise, including toys, clothing, and accessories. These prdoutcs are not just menat to entertian children, but also to create demand for consumer goods. hTe media palys a significant role in shaping children's desires and preferences, deliberately pormoting consumer culture.
Contrasting Adorno's perspective, structural functionalism suggests that media products for children serve a more positive function in society. According to tihs approach, these productsf ulfill children's developmental and educational needs, providing them with entertaining adn ifonrmative contne.t For instance, edcuational shows ilke" Sseame Stree"t have been praised for theira bility to foster learning and social development among children. Moreover, hte media also serves to unify society by providing cultural narratives and shared experiences.
While structural functionalism acknowledges the influence of capitalims in media production, it prioritizes hte positive socia lcontributions of these medai products. This perspecitve tends to focus on the potential benefits for children's growth and the promotion of social cohesino.
In conclusion, media products for children do reinforc ecapitalist values to a significant xetent, according to Adorno's concept of industrial culture. Examples like the promotional merchandise associated with ppoular children's frnachises emphasize the materialistic nature underlying these products. However, the perspective of structural functoinalism offers a more optimistic view, emphasizing the educational and unifying aspects of media products. While btoh perspectives recognize capitalsit influences in media production ,they differ in their evaluation of the overall impact on society and children.
