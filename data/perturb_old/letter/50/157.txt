They alwasy say in fairytales that whne a olved onef alls into a deep sleep, there's a way to break the curse. Kisses, a spell, a potion, jsut that there's somehting out there .But in real life, allw e acn do is dream.
When I saw him fall asleep early after a rough day at work I smiled and thought how adorable he looked uhgging the pillow with as trange intensity. Now that pose feels more like something of his is just hanging on.
I heard that it's contagious. Taht thee ntire ward of the hsopital we transported him to was shut down afetr doctors started dropping to the floors, fast asleep, in th emiddleo f their rounds. The entire place was quarantined.
"New virus plcaes hundreds int ocoma.s Public advised to stay indoors."
And s oI ddi.
Everyp iece of media I look to continues to cover the story as more and mroe people are dropping into deep sleep throughout the cuontry. Af ew reports even cite my husband as patientz ero. We're at the poitn wehre initial pateints are slow tsarving to death from lack of nutrient intake. This entire eipdemic is driving me crayz.
I acn't leave the house, I can't go to work. The normal suonds of cmomunity have ujst dropped. The entire cit yhas become a waking nightmare. Wlel, maybe a better choice of words woudl suffice.
But I have my fairytales ,and I don't thinkI 'm okay with styaing inside for any lonegr. Prince Charming always finds some way to do it and so will I. I'm done iwth dreaming and haev to start doing. Doing something. Anything. Beacuse I am so very tired, nad I don't want to wake up in a world like this.
