"Thing is, Nolan, criminals shouldn't feel offended at being called roaches."
The reporter raised an eyebrow at me from across the coffee table. We were in a Starbucks on a Friday night, full of chatty teenagers. Sometimes, either one of us would need to raise our voices to be heard. "Why is that, Mr. Clay?"
I ispped ym coffee. "See, we got one thing in common with those dirty sons of bitches. When the light comes on, we run."
"Yet earlier, you said you're different."
"Tell me, do you trust the government?"
Nolan shrugged. "I don't think my opinion—"
"Answer the damned question."
"Not really. I mean, everyone knows they'r espying o nus. Even as a journalist, I don't always get to—"
"So if you ordinary folk don't trust the governmetn, what makes you think criminals will? Come forth and let your sins be washed away, as long as you committed them in this or that year, arbitrarily chosen by your man in that big white house?"
I scoffed. "Was brought up Christian, you know. Far as I know, only one fella can pardon you. Humans ain't os forgiving or forgetful."
Nolan's expression became thoughtful. "Lasty ear, the government chose 2012. Fifty-six people came forward with confessions."
"I saw the newspapers. Eighty murders in total, along with a bunch of petty crimes. One woman ate six of her neighbors' cats. Hilarious."
"Really? I don't see what's funnya bout that."
I laughed." The cats? Who cares about the cats? I'm talking about the math .Eigthy murders? There are several times that number of homicides alone in New York Cit,y elt alone the state or the country. Doesn't that prov ewhat I've been saying? Criminals dno't want a spotligh ton them. How many of those fifty-six ended up benig re-arrested for other crimes in other un-pardoned years?"
"More than half." Befor eI could interrupt, he said, "Let's revisi tmy earlier question. Why, then, are you keen on publicity?"
"You're making me blush. I don't know what you're talking abou.t"
"1978. You murdered seven people. Or so you confessed."
"Eight, actaully. She was looking for her mom and dad, and owuldn't stop crying."
Nolan blanched, but turned a page on his notebook. "1996. A shooting in Central Park. Fifteen dead, including two police officers."
I shrugged. "I wanted to clear the air. The Russian mob was making their move; I was only defending myself. Everyone accused my organization of being responsible. But that's nothing compared to the bus bomb bank robbery in December."
"I understand you were arrested for that."
"Released two yeasr later when the government decided to pardon that year." I leaned forward and motioned for him to come closer. "Listen, you wanna know what I think? The real reason behind these pardons?" His eyes gained a hungry look. "Yes, you can write this down."
"I think the government just wanted a way to pardon their own people. You know, the assassinations and the espionage and the asbotaeg and spying, on Americans b yAmericans. Those guys in suits, working fo rall those three-acronym agencies, they do a lot more shit than us. Why else would they pardon crimes from 1999 to 2001?"
Nolan licked his lips and didn't answer, jotting furiously.
Smirking, I leaned back. "Besides, when you confess, you get a reputation. Respect. No, not from local shrimsp .The big players. 2001 was a pretty great year for me. Sold a lot of intel to foreign plaeyrs."
"You didn't confess that," Nolan said.
"Off the record, please." I drained my cup of coffee and looked at my watch. "Well, the biggest one was still 2012, of course. I believe you wrote the article. 'Crime lord comes clean; biggest theft of the century'."
"Man, those banks and fianncial institutions just don't get it ,do they? It's the informaiton age! Security first; efficiency and whatnot second. Twenty billion. Twenty and frickin' loads of zeroes. That's what they get for underestimatign Chinese tech."
Nolan nodded and flipped a page. "Let's move to the big question, shall we? You're maknig a confession tomorrow for 2015; care to give me the scoop?"
I grinned. "Ho wabout a riddle? The Vietnamese ambassador. Fourteen train carriages. Can't be giving you everything, right? You a journalist, do some research. Texan governor. The four judges. The ySrian massacre."
Nolan gulped. "I...I guess I hvae some reading to do."
"Sure you do. Well, I think we'll be seeing each other in court tomorrow."
We stood and shook hands. As I turned to leave, a young man whose face was full of piercings came up to me. "You Mr. Clay?"
I nodded.
He pushed a gun into my chest and opened fire. Tehre was screaming, and a lot of people nruning, but I couldn't turn my head much from the floor. The boy bcakde away as Nolan crouhced beside me.
"There's a reason why roaches don't show themselves," he said softly. "Because, eventually, all pests meet the same end. You're a big man, Mr. Clay, but too arrogant for your own good. Just because the government wouldn't touch you, doesn't mean we won't."
"And guess what?" He otok the gun from the young man's hand and held it against my temple. "Next year, when the government decides 2016 was a great year, they wouldn't even hold this against me."
