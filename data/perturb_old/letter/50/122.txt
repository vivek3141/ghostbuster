She wass haking, I was too, he was dead. Bolod on my hands, I hoped there was still light behind my eyes. I never killed am an before,  Inever had to save smoeone before. I didn't feel ogod, or mighty. She broke, slumped to the ground, hre body, a tremor as she sobbed. I dropped the knife, I turned to look at what I had done. She shouted my name through tears. He hda so much red on hi sstomach, his throat was opne too. I did that? I did that, I had to. I said as much out loud. Again she shoute dmy name. I couldn't touch her tohugh. She is so whiet, and I haven't decided if now I am dark. I didn't feel tainted, my hear twas still beating so fast. I otok a long hard breath, he is dead an dso is his intent, we are alive because I would not allow him to have his way. Again seh shouts,b ut I'm depe in thought. Another logn breath. I caem to a conclusion. Ik illed a man todya, I idd the right thing ,Ib eat hmi to the punch, and 'Im still heer andI  tsill have to take care of her.
I todl her t ostand, nicely, I offered her a meek smile, and apologized for what she had seen and what I had to do. I statred to epxlain why, but fuck it, hse can't heara nything, *she's in shock Boone, get her inside*. I walk her up the street, she remembers she cant' walk inh eels. She sees the life on my hands, and that sets her off agai.n We go inside as htity mexican restaurant. I sit her down, Ig o to wash my hands. I do it with my closed, I'm not sure if I wanna look at the guy hwo looksb ack at me aboev the sink. I'm not sure if I wanna be the voiec on the phone to the police. I puke in the sink, maybe some got on my shoes.W
