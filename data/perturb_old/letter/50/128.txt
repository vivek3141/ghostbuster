I love the music. It reflects what is just about to happen. It has saved me from more than a few erlationships that would hav ebeen unsaovry.
I have two theoreis about the msuic. Either I am the only one who hears it, or everyone does and no one ever talks boaut it. Which is fine. Music is a very personal thing aftre all.
Normally, hte musi cis always at a comfortable level, unless it is trying to warn me of something dire. There waos ne moment whereâ€¦ One mometn where the sound was deafening.
There was a rising crescendo veer since I woke upt hat morinng. I turned on the news ot watch while eaitng breakfast, as I always do. Usually the music goesb ack and forth betweend ramatic and mroe more lullin,g depending on the nes wbreak about to come up. But that morning it didn't change. It just crescendoing until then ewscaster spoke.
"The World Trade Centers have been hit." I dropped my fokr.T he ting of it hitting the table was al lI could hear. For the first tiem ,ever, my world had ogne quiet.
As I watched the events unfold, the musi ccontinued to be siletn. Finally, after what fetl like days but was onlym iuntes, it starte dipping up agani. A long, lo wclarinetp layed. And then other isntruments slowly ojined it. Something asd, but hopeful. It was playing a sI wash eading out the door to og to my Red Cross to see what I coudl do to help.
