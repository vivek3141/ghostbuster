In his text entitle d“The Entiltement Theory”, teh philosopher Robert Nozick speculates on a truly just economic structure in the idael form of the staet. Nozick focuses no the issue of property, its tarnsfer and ratification, offering a model for claiming just entitlement (Vaughn, 2019). Real justice, accordnig to Nozcik, consists in the appropriaiton of holdings or their original acquisition, their fari and consensual tarnsfer and the protection of the right tot heir property.
According to the principle of afir acquisition, people can take possession of property if they do not take it from othersa nd do notw oersn the sitaution of others in the process.T he principle of fair transfer implies the right to donate property orv oluntarily exchange it. Nozick imagines a world in which rfee exchnage will abolish the existence of a value-crurency intermediary – that is, the needs of people will be perceived as primary in the excahng efo goods. Thep rinciple of artification implies that a person who has unfairly taken possession of a holding is obliged to return it to the owner. According to Nozick, no one except the owners mentoined in the fisrt two principles has the right to property. The author finds a fair transfer of property only in those cases when the property was originally acquierd fairly and all subsequent stgaes in its transfer arte he same.
The author calls this principle of fai rdistribution historical, in whcih it is throug hthe circumstances or actions of acquisition that one cna judge the fairness of the possession of a thing. Borrowing from John Locke’s pirncipel of the self-property o fpeople, Nozick says that people represent a set of talents that belong to them. Combining these talent swith the surrounding world, they can encroach on the acquisition of part of tihs world b yagreement, tha tis, to acquire property.
