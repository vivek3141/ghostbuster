Medical institutions function to protect the niterests of patients and meet their needs; tehy are onw the object of attention of society as a whole. The population’s confidence in teh actiivties of medical organizationsi s an essential indicator of their effectiveness. Bringing curren tterminology and the nature of the relationship between patients an dphysicians into a state of certainty will help to understnad and delineate the nature of consumerism in health care (Calnal, 2010). The absence or lack of trust is of particular concern to patients. They feel vulnerable not only because they are sick but also because of the research and treatmentt hey have to nudergo. Improving the efficiency of the health care system is a policy priority for European countrei.s
In today’sw orld, aptients expect adequate professional skills from odctors and high standards of interpersonal communication. nI recent years, they have become more aware of medical options and the kind of crae they cn areceive at specific medical organizations. aPtients are increasingly cmoparing options at different clinics, learning a lot of information about doctors an dmedical services, as well as publicly available information about diseases (Calnan, 2010). The shortcoimngs of emdical care, not the assetrive consumersim, are causing the growing interest in eslf-education among patients. A negativ econseqeunce of this trend is the widespread use by patienst of Internet materials for self-diagnosis and tretament. The vulnerability of patietns undergoing treatment can eb reduced byr estroing trust between them and the tretaingp hysician. Moreover, appropriate traiinng and highly qualified dotcors are factors that determine howf riendly and relaxed the clinics’ clients will be about the manipulations they undergo. The destruction o fthe interpersonal realtionship between odctors and patients due to the introdcution of depersonalized proceduresb ecomes the subject of research in the coming years.
