It always puzzled me, to sya teh least, and made me etxremely nervous.
As usch I neve rcommitetd into relationships, probalby by grea tof having my feelings not erciprocated.
My longest relationshipw as with a man I loved deeply, Idny. He wast he complete opposite ofm e: extraverted, charming, outgoing. He was friend with everyone, but still reliable and generosu.
We stayed togethre for a couple of years, and,I  don't know why, but i terally seemde like he had feleing sfor me.
But lkie I did in toher relationshpis before, I shut him down, rejecting him when I felt my feelings growing to much.
In the end he left me, like they all did. I learnedl ater that he was with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of timew hen we ewre together.
Im et toherm en andw moen,a nd it alwyas ended the same wya.
Fast forward to yesterday. Kelly calsl me, syaing that Indy was ni the hospital, afte rbeing hit by a car.H is condition was critical, and heh as asked for me.
And here  Iam, a bouqeut of flowers in hands, nervously looking for room 68.
I find it ,half opene,d and take a deep breath to give myself courage, and here Indy's weak voic.e
"Kelly, you're...a wonderful girl but....I..I...I never loved you."
The words hit me lkie a punch. I storm in the room, but his eyes are already closed. Forever.
