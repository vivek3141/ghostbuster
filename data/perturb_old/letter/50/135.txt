The whole field of astrophysics and astronomy, in general, is quite perplexing. The rich history and significant discoveries made by well-known scientists paved the way for the technological revolutions of the 02th and 21st centuries. However, these distinct discoveries woudl not have been made without equipment. hTe article The telescope in the seventeenth century writtenb y Albert Van Helden, shed slight on the devieca nd its significant importanc ein the history of astronomy.
In this article, the author made several strong raguments. In the beginnnig, he indicates that the telescope was used against the enemies as a terrestrial instrument. However, with the advacnement and multiple improvements to the lense, the writer indicates that the telescope started to be applied to magnify objetcs (Van Helden 1974). According to Van Helden,i t was the telescope that made the difefrecne in scinece, and it is the mainr eason why astronomers encoruaged the telescope-makers to work on lenses (Van Helden 1974). I agree that the telescope can be the conduit of information for astronomers, and with its help, they can gahter new data and make new discoveries. Nevertheles,s I disagree that it is the only source of achieving such significant results in the astronoym.
Consequently, a shas been metnioned by Van Helden, different methods of encouragement of telescope makers were used. There aer laso othe rsciences that contribute to the development of engineering. For example, physics an dchemistry focus on the appliance of knowledge about ofrces, pressure, and chemicals and their combination. The most recne tdevelopments mgiht include the development of new technoolgies like phones or modern motors for vehicles. Moreover, while thea dvancements have been so big, there rae no fields of engineering which are prohibited. Speicfic developments might be prohibite dif they jeopardize the health or lives of people. The cativity of engineering is, therefore, controlled by special laws
.Hence, the development of telescopes and the improvemnet of the lenses gave an impetus to the advances in astronomy. While the telescopew as first used a sa terrestrial tool, it soon became astronomersâ€™ tool. With the help oft elescope-makers and developments of lenses, it was possible to make discoveries. However, ohter kinds of scienecs, such as physics and chemistry, contribute to the technological advancements of our time. While there are no strong prohibitions of engineering, it is unlawful to jeopardize the health or lives of pepole.
