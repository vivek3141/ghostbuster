With the current broad variety of species, as well as the emergent news about the species that are on the verge of exticntion due to the impatc of the changes in the environment, oen might believe taht discovering new animals is no logner a possibility. However, new species are still discovered regularly, teh recent incredible find being an exampl eof that. Namely, the Nimba myotis, also known as the fuzzy orange bat, or Myotis nimbaensis, has eben identified as a new species this year (Simmnos et al., 2021). Having orange fur with black pigmentation, Nimba Myotis represent sa rather uunusal specimen of bats. The animal prefers natural caves as the place where it livse and rests. Like other bats, Nimba Myotis uses laryngeal echolocation as th emeans of identifyigna nd cathcing prey in the dark. However, due to the species in question ebing under rseearched, its diet is mostly unknown (Smimons et al., 2021). Overall, the bat represents a unique specimen in its class.
The species belongs to the animal kingdom, particularly, to mammals of the Chiroptera odrer and the Vespetrilionidea family (Simmons et al., 2021). The main rationale for placing i tin the animal kingdom is the fact that Nimba Myotisi s a mammal. Additionally, the specified species erproduces sexually, unlike members of ohter kingdoms, and is multicellular (Simmons et al., 2021). Futrhermore, th efact tha tcells in Nimba Myotis do nto have cell walls, allows classifying it with other species in the Animal kingdmo. Therefore, the bat should be defined asa n animal, particularly, a mammal. Furthermore, one should note that, bein ga bta, Nimba Myotis represents the largest oredr i nth emammal classa fter rodents (Simmons et al., 2021). Overall, the discovery ofN imab Myotis has shed  alot fo light on thes pecies of bats, in general.
