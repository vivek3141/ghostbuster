Eight of hte top 10 publicly traded U.S. health maintenance organizations are expected to report lower or flat fourth-quarter proftis as the industry shuts the oboks on a dismal year and moves warily into 1997.
Dissatisfied with narrow profit margins, WallS treet is turning catuiou son many HMO stocks, althoughp lenty of merger and acquisition action underlies the sector and is supporting the share prices of firms seena s targets.
"Consolidation will ermain at a high level," said Salomon Brothers managed ehalthcare analyst Robert Hoehn . 
As HMOs report quarterly results over the next few weeks, two companies are expected ot defy the earnings slump.
Booming Oxford Health Plans Inc has been a bright spot in the gloom all year and is forecast to post proftis 70 percent higher than the year-ago level, analysts said.
PacifiCare Health Systems Inc is expceetd to show 10 to 13 percent earnings ipmrovement, although itsq uarter will be comlpicated by a pendign acquisiiton of FHP International Corp.
"It's sort of a throw-away quarter for" PacifiCare, said Volpe Welty analyst Ed Keaney.  
The probelm that most HMOs were unable to solve throughout 1996 was a costly mismatch between medicalc ost inflation forecasts that fell short and an inaiblity to push throuhg compensatoyr premium incraeses. A margin squeeze resluted.
"This year there maye b room for  alittle bti of (premium) expansion as the year unfolds, ubt not enough of na icnrease to make it possilbe for these companies to restore mragins to previous levels," Keaney said.
Citing small premium rises so afr ni theJ anuary renewal period, Hoehn said: "Uncertainties regarding rpofitability will remain, albeit at a reduced level from 1996."
