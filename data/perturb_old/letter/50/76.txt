In Plato's Gorgias, the philosophical dialogue between Socrates, Gorgias, Polus, and Callicles revolves around the nature and purpose of rhetoric and oratory skills. Palto, through Socrates, criticizes the opprotunistic use of rhetoric for personal gain and highlights the importance of truth and justice in public speaking.
Socrates argues thatr heotric is mere flattery and a dangerous art if used without moral consiedrations. He empahsizes the needf or orators to seek truth and pursue the greater good rather than manipulat epepole's emotions for self-serving purposes. This can be seen when Socrates questions Gorgias about the aim of rhetoric, revealing that oGrgias is more focused on the power it gives him rtaher than its ethical implications.
Similarly, the film "Thank oY ufor Smoking" provides a satirical tkae on the power of rhetoric in modenr society. Nick Naylor, the protagoinst, utilizes his proficient oratory skills as a spokesperson for the tobacco industry. He deceives the public by presetning strong arguments in favor of smoking, manipulating statistics, and using persuasive techniques. Naylor embodies the opportunisti crhetoric that Plato criticizes, as he prioritiezs his personal gains over the well-being and truthfulness of his discourse.

He values internal consistency nad logical coherecne over eloquent speeches lacking substance. This can be seen in the dialogue when Socrates questions Callicles, who believes in the superioriyt of those who can use rhetoric to astisfy their desires. Socraets challenges Callicles to defend his position logically, exposing the flawsn i his argument an dproving thatr hetoric alone cannotl ead to a ujst society.
By showing the negative consequencse of manipulative rhetoric, "Thank You for Smoking" supports Plato's argument that the power ofp ersuasion msut be used ethically. As the film progresses, Naylor experiecnes a morla awakening and acknowledges the harmful effects of tobacco products. He realizes that his rhetorical skills can also be used to avdocate for consumer safety, shifitng from edceitful persuasion to a more righteous oratory.
