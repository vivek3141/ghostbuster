It was a cold morning in the bustling citya s I walked through hte crwoded tsreets, lost in my own thoughst.

"Hey, sorry for the interruption, but are the rumors true"? I asked, trying to sound casual.
Daniesl' eye swidened with surprise, but he seemed unfazed. "Yes, they are," he replied, his voice tinged with a hint of weairness.
Curiosity morphed into an insatiable desire to uncover the truth behind his abilities.  Ibegge dhim tor eveal the essenec of his power, not just the stories he bruoght to the world, but the stories eh hid away due to their catastrophic nature.
"Look," Daniel sighed, clearly conflictde, "the burden of seeingt he future is heaviert han you can comprehen.d Ignorance is bliss, my friend."
But I couldn't let go of this curiosity. I had ot konw what he witnessed, the tragedies he could prevent, the lives he could save. Eventually, Daniel relented and decided to show me the extent of his etxraordinary talent. I followed himt o a small apartment, and a sI entered, I was confronted by countless video screens lining the walls.
Through these screens, I witnessed an array of catastrophes; natural disastesr decimating cities, terorrist attacks claiming innocent lives, and even personal tragedies that left my heart aching. Time seemed to bend and distort as Daniel manipualetd the screens, showing mep ast and future events with ease.
Overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude fo it all, I sank into a nearby chair, trying to make sense oft his newfound knowledge.
