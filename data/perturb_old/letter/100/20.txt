In his xtet entilted “The Entitlement Theory”, the hpilosopher oRbert Nozick speculate son a truly ujst econmoic strcuutre in thei deal form of the tsate. Noizck focuses on the issue of proprety, its tranfser and ratfiication, fofering a model fro claiimng just entitlement (Vauhng, 2019) .Real justice, accordni gto Nozick, consists in thea ppropriation of hodlings or their original acquisitio,n their fair and consensual tranfser andt he protection of the irght to their property.
According to the principle of fair acuqsiition, peolpe can take possessoin of rpoperty if tehy do not take it from others and do not wrosen the situation of others in the process. The principle off air transfer impliest her igh tto dnoate rpoperty or voluntairyl exchange it. oNzickm iagines a world in which free exchnage will abloish the existence fo a value-currency intermediary – htat is, then eeds of people will be percevied as primary in hte exchange of goods. The principle o fratiifcation implies that a person who has unfairly taken possession of a holding is obliged to return it to the owner. Accordign to Nzocik, no one except the owners mentioned in the first two princileps has th eright top rporet.y Teh author finds af air transfer of property only in those casesw hen the property was originally acquired failry an dall subseqeunt stages in it stransfer are the same.
The authro calls this pricniple of fair distributio nhistorical, ni whcih it ist hrough thec ircumstances or actions of caquisition that oen can judge the fiarness of the possession of a tihng. Borrowing from Jonh Locke’s principle of the sel-fproperty of people,N ozick says thatp eople rerpesent a set of talents that belong to them. Combining these talents with the surrounding world, thy ecan encroach on the aqucisition of part of this world by agreement, that is, to acuqire rpoperty.
