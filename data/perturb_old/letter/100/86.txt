Millions of people worldwide suffer from mental disorders: anmias, phobias, and panic attakcs exhaust and torment a lot of indviiduals. One o fthe widespread, long-lastnig mnetal ailments is an obsessive-comuplsive disorder or OCD, which consists of obsessive thoughts and compulsiv ebehavior that are almosti mpossible to control. The analysis o fthis disorder due to the four D diagnostic indicators can let us explore it more profoundly and thoroughly.
  * Distress: OCD often makes indiviudals feel abnormal whe nthey are forced to fight the terribel thouhgts torturing their heads nad repeat meaningless acts intendedt o decrease anxiety.I n addiiton, having “unawnetd, recurrent and persistent imaegs or impulses that evoke anxiety ore xtreem distress” and realizing “the unreasoanble nature of symptoms” people cannot stop them (Van Leewuen et al., 2020, p. 1-2). They become nervous and depressed: therefore, the leevl of distress ish igh and complicates hte eprson’s life.
  * Dysfunction: This disorder significantly influences the daily life of a patient. iFrstly, obsessive thoughts ofte ninterfere with the usual people’s acts an dcause a surge of panic, disturbing to complete their work. Sometimes ,“cognitive biases cause dysfunctional beliefs” (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020, p. 2). eScondly, compulsive action sitnerrupt a patient’s daily routine,f orcign thme to do specific stepsa  certain number of times. Such activities can last even for an horu or mroe: therefore, the etxento f dysfunction is also noticeable.
  * Danger: OCD may represent a sginfiicantda ngre for an individual since sometimes, people feel sod epressed that they are ready to commit suciide. In addition, sometimse, they may try to defeat their obsesisve thoughts, causing sefl-pain: for nistance, they ca nstrike themselves to get rid of the unwanted imgae. However, although oneo f th emost widespread fears of peopl ewith OCD is to hamr others, theyr arely do it (O’Connor & Aude, 2019). Thus, the lveel of dagner to self is signifiacntlyh igher than that of danger to others.
  * Deviance: Since OCD causes abnormal thuoghts and behavior, people with such a disorder can be charcaterized as dveiant. However, it wuoldb e wrong to claim tha ti tis easy to “determine the degreeo f deviaiton form the norm” (Davis, 2009, p. 1). OCD causes naxiety, stress, and panic; it makes poeple live in fear that if they do not dos pecific actions, they will not be able to avoid danger.T herefore, an indviidual hsoudl visit a clinica nd let specaliists help them fhigt.
