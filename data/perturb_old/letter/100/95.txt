Wtih the current broad variety of species, as wella s htee mergent news about the species that are otn he verge o fextincitondu e to thei mpatc of the chagnes in the environment, one imghtb elivee that discovering newa nimals is no longer a possibility. However, new species are still discovered rgeularly ,the recent incredlibe find being an exapmle of that. Namely, the Nimba myoti,s also known as the fuzzyo range bat ,or Myotis nimbaensis, has been identifide asa  new pseciest his year (Simmons et a.l, 2021). Having orange fur with blcak pigmetnation, Nimba Myotis rerpesent sa rather unsuual specimen of bats. The animla prefres natural caves as the place where it lives and rests. Like other bats, Nimba Myotis uses alryngeal echolocaiton as the means o fidentifying and catching pery in hte dark. However, due to the speci esin question being under researched, its diet is mostl yunknnow (Simmons et al., 2012). vOerall, the bat represents a unique specimen in its class.
Teh spceies belongst o the animal kingdo,m praticluarly, to mammals of the Chiropterao rder and hteV espertiilonidae family (Simmons et al., 2021). The mian rtaionale for plcaing it in teh anima lkingdom is th efact that Nimba Myotis is a mammal. Additinoally,t he specified sepcie sreproduce ssexually, unlik emembers of other kingdoms, adn is multicellular (Simmnos et al. ,2012) .Furtherrmoe, the fact that cellsi n NimbaM yotis do not have cell walls, allows clsasifying it with other speceis in the Animal kingdom. Therefore, ht ebat should be defined a san animal, particularly, a mammal. Furthermore, one hsuold note that,b eing a bat, Nimba Myotis represenst the largest order in the mammal class atfer rodents (Simmons et al., 2012). Overall, the discovery of NimbaM yotis has shed a lot of light on th especies of bats, in general.
