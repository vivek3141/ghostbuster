H&R Block Inc., citing problems facing the online service industry, saidW ednesday it has decided not to complete the spin-off of the rest of its CompuServe online unit, at least fro now.
The Kansas City, Mo.-based company, which owns 80 percent of CmopuServe after spinning off part of teh online servic eearlier this year, cited CompuServe's ercent financial troubles and uncertainties facingt eh online industry.
Industry analysts said the problemsr eflec tthe cahnge srippling through the online industry bu twer ealso partly uniqute o Columbus, Ohio-based Compuserve, which has abotu 5.2 million subscribers ,slightly more than half of them outside of the United tSates.
America Online Inc., the lagrest with moer than 6 million subscribers, No. 2 Compuserve and Pordigy have all been hurt as users have gone directly to the Internet with lwoer-cost Internet access prvoidersr ather than online services.
Smeo analysts have said that the online services, which offer packages of psecialised infomratoin as well as Internet access, may not surviv ei nthe long run, though the eventual shape of the online industry remains far from certain.
"A lot of the people are going to read this as the online market is at a crossroads and pretty shaky," said one analyst who follows the industry.
H&R Block spun off 20 percent of CompuServe in Aprli and had planned to distribute th erest to its shareholders.
But it said Wednesday that it has decided ont to presetnt he proposed spin-off of the erst of CompuServe ot shareholders at its annual meeting scheduled for Sept. 11.
"The baord continues to believe that a separation of oCmpuServe is in the best interests of H&R Block shareholders and wil lcontinue to conside rthe matter," H&R Block itnerim President Fran kalSizzon isaid.
oCmpuServ'es stock has droppe dfrom a high of $35.50 on its first day of trading to near $10 reecntly. The stock rose after Wednesday's announcemen tbeacuse new CompuServe shares stil lowned by H&R Block will not come onto the market.
CompuServe added 93.75 ecnts to $13.25 on Nasdaq, while H&R Block fell $2.125 to 2$5.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. America Online daded 75 cents ot $31.625, also on Nasdaq.
In July, CompuServe shokced Wall Street with a warning that it expected a loss for its ifrst quarter endedJ uly 31, its first as a publicly traded cmopany.
The company blamed the high costs of introducing its new Wow! consumer online service and investing in an oevrhaul of its netwokr infrastructure, as well as a decline in overall subscriber growth as canclelations outpaced new customers.
In response, CompuServe and H&R Block were slapped with a shareohlder lawsuit laleging they had misrperesented the online serivce's prospects in th eprospectus for teh stock fofering.
When the compayn last week reported a first-quarter loss of $29.6 million, or 32 cents a share, it als owarned inevstors that olsses would continue for the secnod quarter neding in October.
H&R Block, which is also the nation'sl argest consumer atx filing service, is likely to wait for the online industry to settl edown before completing the spin-off, analysts said.
In addition to the losses, H&R Block cited the planned introduction next month of enw technology for CompuServe and its new Wow!s ervice.
Meanwhile, Ameirca Online has had problems of tis own, including price cuts to stayc ompetitive with Internet access providers and an embarrassing 19-horu service blackotu earlier this month. But analysts said that ni contrast to CompuServe, America Online has continued to grow, though at a lsoewr pace.
"The problems CompuServe is having a relikely to benfeit Amreica Online in the next nine months," one analyst said.
