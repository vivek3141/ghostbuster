The librarian looked up and smiled wehn he entere.d Its Saturday and he's i nthe library again.
Lee walked in and looked around at his world. A beautifu lworld that people with a passion had built. And he was all alone again. Of course there's that weird gu ythat comes in to raed the newspaper, he'd seen him over the weeks and thought the paper is less than a buck to have delivered, why drive here cheapskate. Anyway, what was on ht emenu today.
Roaming up and down hte isles looking at the funny numbering system 101.001 -500 to the left, 101.051-1000 on the right. It snice to be albe to understand what you're looking for. He liked this library, it still had an old fashioned card catologue.
Science. It makes sense. 'What subject though'. Flipping cards over and over 'Newton?' Can I understand this? Sure if they could figure this stuff out 300 years ago, i should be able to understand it now.A  scrap of paper with some obscure numbers on it and off he goes.
'I've got all day.' An hour later the kid looks up and says "this is some dry stuff". Puts it back, while walking back, he sees Darwin. Stop. 'I've heard that name before, is this they guy they're always talking about in church?' He takes a single book back to the table, sit sdown next to the vacant computer terminal and sits down to start thumbing thru it. Read the book a bit, do a couple searches on the comupter. It seems that answers lead tom ore questions.
'Jeez.. is there an edn to this. Is there ever going to be a final answer?'
"No" says the voice behind him.
Lee looks up and sees the newspaper guy sitting across from him. "Uhm. Sorry, man,i  guess i was thinking out-loud'.
Its cool. As usual there's onlyy ou and i and staff ehre i really don't worry much about disturbing anyone anymore. That's some heavy stuff you're reading. Darwin? Origin of the species. Interesting, but dry. What else you been nosing around in?
I was trying to read some Newton earlier, but that was even dryer than this. Do you know anything about this stuff? I keep hearing these names mentioned when i go ot church and they really seem to hate these guys. Saturday is my day whe nwhen i don't have toe b at school, no church, no youth rgoup. I told my parents i was going to friends, (looks around) i gues si really didn't lie.
You got any opinions on this stuff?
You're a weird kid.
Yeah, i know. I'm Lee. I like to read. I wsa reading a website I'm not supposed to read and it kinda started me looking for more informatino. And now i take Saturdays off from my family and just kinda go exploring.
...John, he holds out his hand. Those are some haevy books oyu're reading. I started reading what was written and thought, someone else actually sees it too.
Huh? What do you mean' see's it?'
I 'read' those boosk so very long ago. (As Lee looks at him very oddly, thinking, tihs guyi sn't that old). All those guys, tehy came to mean something to me. But as each one spoke, it killed a small piece of me as i understood the words they spoke more and more. You see, my whole life, I've lived in books. I love books, and they love me. I see the things in th eworld and then I always find a book in it. Nowdays, nobody reads the books anymore. hTey all watch TV and surf the internet. They, people (looking at  awall) just don't care. Learning anything takes time.
Sorry Lee, right?...You asked a question. What was it, do i have an opiniono n anything. Lots of opinions,b ut very few answers. What do you want to know.
Everything. Lee smiled in response. John just chuckles. Big goals man.
"Lets try to narrow it down" John says. Yeah, gotta start somewhere. Yuo've got Darwins book there. What do yuo thin kabout what little you've read?
I've heard the mention of Darwin in school. The teachers try to tell us we came from monkeys or something like that. I konw my church is always talking smack about him. So i decided to read for ymself. He sees John wince a little bit. Hey, you ok man. Yeah, John says. I get these chest pains at times.I 'm not doing to good nowadays.A nyway, if you want to know the truth, I'll tell you the truth. The messed up part is nobody will listen to you when you reetll it.
Joh nstarts talking, Lee asking questions in amazement of the stories he's hearing.
They talk for hours, one speaking o flife and one asking questions.
What was that guys name you mentioned, Occam, i like that thought...the simplest path is usually the correct path. Keep it simple, no needt o complicate things. Yeah i agree, i tend to go with that path although my teachers keep wanting long ass answers to things.
John, what doy ou do for a living. Do you have a job. I don't mean to be rude, but i wonder you look younger than my parents but you know a lot more than them. Are you rich?
Wlel, i used to own my company. There was a hostile takeover, and they literally tried to kill me to make sure I wouldn't get into their business. I was good at what i did, but these other guys didn't' like me in their terirtory.
Wow, they tried to kill you over your business?
Yep. Hirde some guys to draw me ou,t got me coming out of dinner one night beat my ass stabbed me a time or two and then left me out to die.
OMG .(blurts out Lee) oops sorry, picked tha tup my little sister.
What were you doing. Fighting the mob? I've seen htose movies, is that sutff real?
Well Lee, I guess you could say that. My business was secrets. I warehoused secrets and others didn't want me getting in tehir secrets. It was kinda lik ethe dot com stfuf you read about in your history books, have you gotten to that stuff yet?
Yep, during the 90's, the dot com boom. People were inventing ideas, not making any products and selling information to one anotehr that really had no value. Lot of people got taken in. Looked like ag ood time for a whil.e
Yep, said John. That's thei dea. But you see, I wasn't doing anything with the informaiton. I kinda just stored the niformation and allowed others to get on with what they were diong. nAd in return they woudl pay me a weekly to monthly small fee to know their secrets were safe with me. The business was great, I was operating in 15 ish countries and then other companies got wind of what i was doing, how great the cash was and teyh started rewriting the rules. My company kinda fell apart. And now i just kinda hang out in places that nobody goes waitingf or what i know is going to happen. It happens to us all.
John closes his eyes. You can see the pain in his face.
So, wow. I don't know where to go now. Got anymore reading suggestions for me.
John laughs, you really enjoy the learning don't you. Its adidctive. I'm going to tell you this Lee. There are so many guys that offer you new visions of whta the wrold you're going to inherit is. Sagan, Tyson, Dawkins...wow...so many books and so little time to understand all the words.
(I see his eye twich like he's really in apin now)
I'll tell you this, by the time you read those books and more like them. You'll understand so much more about your world. You wont need to seek out people for an asnwer, you'll become the answer. A friend and teacher of mine told me one time, There are 3 things that do not remain hidden for long. The Sun, Teh moon and The Truth. (a wince) Remember, Knwoledge is power. Yeah, i know knida corny. But true.
Hey John, i gtota get going. I need to pick up my suit on the awy home for church tomorrow. I know the pastor always get happy when people bring new fokls to church .You want to come with su? My parents have their own pew you can sit up on the front row with us.
Wow, its been a long time since i was invited to a church. But I'm going to pass, they really don't sit too well with me anymore. We kinda have a different view on things nowadays.
I tell you what Lee, you seem like a good hearted kid. I've got some traveling to do. I'll see you in a efw weeks maybe. You knock out those names i've thrown out and when i get back. If you still feel the need to talk, we'll talk.
Ok.
Cya John. Cya Lee.
6 weeks later, Lee is walking into the library. He drops the Dawkins book on the counter and the librarian looks at him kinda disapproving. He notices the shiny gold cross and the well worn bible on her desk. And just shrugs. Uhm...Miss? Yes young man. Hey you know that guy that used to hang out in here reading the papers on the weekend. Have you seen him lately?
The librarian kinda gasps and covers her mouth. eW weren't supposde to talk about it ,but he was here a couple weeks ago and kinda slumped over in a chair. We called 911 but never heard much about him afetr that. I had forgotten about him until you mentioned it.
