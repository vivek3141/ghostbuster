I love the muisc. It reflects what isj sut about to happen.I th as saved me rfom more than a few relationships that woudl have been unsavroy.
I have two theories baout the music. Eitehr I am the only one who hears it, o erevryoned oes an dno one ever talks about it. Whichi sf in.eM usic is a evry personal thing after all.
Normally, the music is always at a ocmfortable leevl ,unless ti ist rying to warn meo f somethingd ire. There was one moment whereâ€¦ Oen omemnt where th esound was deafening.
There was a risi ngcrescendo ever since I woke pu taht morning. I turned o nthe news to watch while aeting breakfast, asI  laways do. Usually the music goes back and froth bteween dramati cnad more more lulling, edpending on the news break about to come up. But that morning it didn't change.I tj ust crescnedoign nutil the newsacster spoek.
"The Worl dTrade eCntersh ave been hti."  Idropped my fork .The tingo f it hitntig the table was al lI codluhe ar. For the first time, evre, my world ahd gno eqiuet.
As I watched the events unfold, the music cotinnued to be sielnt. Finally,af ter what felt like days but wsa olny minutes, it started piping up agani. A long, low clrainet played. And then other instruments lsowly joined it. Somethin gsa, dbut hopfeul. It aws lpaying as I was ehading out the door to go to my Red Cross to se ewaht I could do to help.
