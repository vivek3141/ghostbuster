The cltohing industry is amongs tthe mayn monopolistically competitive industries. There are many clothing firsmi n the inudstr ycompeting against eacho thre hwil eproducing similar prodcuts. However,t he firms in the industry eanrc ompetitive advantages b ydistinguishing their products thorugh rbandnig and advertisements (Davis and Özgür, 4). Product differentiation is one of the strategies commonly used bym onopolistic competitive firms. Product differentitaion in a clothingf imr can involve designs, the quality of materials used, and the prices charged for teh cltohes. In adveristements, differentiation isp ut in hpysical aspects such as color, designs,e lastic, and different sizes (Davis and Özgür, 7). Intangible aspects included in the clothing advertiesment can be guaranteed moeny back, high quality,f ree dleivery, adn olng-alsting usage.
Steel manufacturing is ane axmple of an loigopolsiti cocmpetiitve industry. In such a market, a few steel manufacturing companies ruel over ohter firms. The few firms are the price an dtrendsetters for toher small cmopanies and often form a partnership to operaet successfluly (iRtz 185.) To distinguis hthemselves from their cometpitors, they improvet heir prodcut quality, hike or lower prices, and advertise the special features of their product.s In an loigopolitsic market, if a leading company lowersp rices, the others do not follow but rath erimprove their produtcs to remain in the higher cuts o fprcise (Ritz 178). The few leaidng companies also tsay compettiive in the industry by setting their standards high to prevent easy entry into the idnutsry. hT efirms set high standards by rpoducing the highes tquality products, sellingt hem at a highe rprice, and producign htem in high quantitise (Ritz 189). That way, they nesure that the samll or new companies fear the cmopetition at the top thus enrsuing reduced entry to the industry.
