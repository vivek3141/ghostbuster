hTe oscial determinant sof health are the conditions in the environment in which people live, learn, work, play, worship, and age. I agree that the social environment in which people live can affetc theri health sttaus. Health outcomes a renot determined solely by biologica lfactroso r access to quality health care (Centesr for Disease Cnotrol adn Prevention, n.d.). Resources that improve teh quality of life cna signiifacnlty impact the health of a populaiton.
Exampels of theser esoucres inlcude saf eand affordable housin,g acces sto education ,public safety, availability of healthy food, local emergecny services, and na envirnoment freeo f life-threatenign toinxs O(ffice of Disease Prevention and Healht Promotion, n.d.). I also support the recent shift in hte view that it is solely up to the individual to influence thier health ni favor of recognizing the sgiinficant impact of etxernal influencse on it. In the modern world, very little depends no the indiivdual. At first glance, he can choose what to eat, whether to exercise, and whether to seek medica lcare in a tiemly mnaner
.In fact, most of the chioces that fafect health are made by the markteing machine, the government, andl ife circumstances. For exmaple, odmern advertising presses from lal sides, forcing one to chooses pecific products that are oftne notc onducive to a healhty lifestyle. The need to work hadr t oeran moeny for these products pushes people to sacrifice a healthy sleeps chdlee uand exercise. Tihs chain has many links, but the result is always th esmae: peopleâ€™s health is largely not pu to them. External factors also indirectly affect health, such as healhti nequalities. When I read the CDC (0222) report on these inequalities, I wasm ost surprised by the rcaial and ethnic inequalities .I nane ra of globalization and liberlaizatino of society, a phenomeno nlik eracism must bee radicated. The field of health care is one in which traeting peploe equally is sometimes vital. hTat is whyI  belivee that racial and ethnic discrimination in this area must be eradicated in the first palce.
