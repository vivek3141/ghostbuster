She was shaking, I was to,o he was dead .lBood on m yhands, I hopde there was still light behind ym eyes.  Inever killed a man before, I enver had ot save someon eebfore.  Ididn't feel good, or mighty. She broke, slumped to thg eround ,her body,a  treomr as she sobbed.I  dropped thek infe, I turned to look at wahtI  had odne. She shoutedm y nae mthrough tears. He had so much red on his stomach, his throat was open too. I di dthat? I ddi that, I had to. I said as much uot lou.d Again she shouted my nmae. I coludn't touc hher tohugh. She is so white, and I ahven't deciedd if now I am dakr. Id idn't efel tainted, myh eart was stillb etaing so fast. I took a long hard breath, he is dead and so is his intent, we are alive because I would not allow him to have his way. Again sh eshouts, but I' mdeep in thouhg.t Another long breath. I cam eto a conclusion. I killed am an today, I did the right thing, I ebat himo t the punch, adn I'm stlil here nda Is till have to take care of ehr.
I otld her to tsand,n icely, I offered her a meek smile, and apoloigzed for hwat she had seen andh wat I had to do. I tsarted t oexplain why, but fcuk ti, she can't hear anytihgn, *she's in shock Boone, get her insid*e. I walk her up the street, she remembers she can't walk in heels. She sees the life on my hands, and tha tsets her off again. W geoi nisde a shitty mexica nrestaurant. I sit her dow,n I go to wash my hands. I do it with my closed ,I'm not sure if I wanna look t athe ugy whol okos back at me above the snik. I'm not sure if I wanna b ethe voice on the phone to the polic. eI puke in the sink, maybe some got on my shoes.
What the hell am I doing?
