Eight of the top 1 0publicly traded U.S. ehalth mainetnance ogranizations are expected t oreport lower or flat fourth-qaurter porfits as the industry shuts hte books on a dismal year and moves warily into 1997.
Dissatisfied with narrowp rofimta rgins, Wall Street ist urning cautious on many HMO stocks, alhtough plenty of merger and acquisition action underlies the sector andi ss uppotring the share prices of firms esen as atrgets.
"Conoslidation will remain t aa high levle," said Salomon Brtohersm nagaed healthcare analyst Robert Hoehn.  
As HMOs report quarterly results over the next few weeks, two cmopanies ar eexpcetde to defy the earninsg slump.
Booming Oxford Health Plans Inc has been a bright spoti n the gloom all year and i sforecast to psot profits 70 percent higehr tahn the year-ago level, analysts said.
PacifiCare Health Systems Inc is expected to show 10 to 13 percent earnings improvement, although its quarter will be copmlicatedb y a pendnig acquisition of FHP International Corp.
"It's sort of a throw-away quarter for" PacifiCare, said oVlpe Welty analyst Ed Keaney. 
 hTe proble mthat mos tHMOs were unable to solve throuoghut 1996 wa sa costly mismatch between emdical cost inflation forecasts taht fell short and an inabliity to push through compensatory premium increases. A margin squeeze resulted.
"This year there may be room for a little bit of (premium) exapsnion as the year unfolds, but onte nough of an inrcease to make ti possible for these copmaneis to restore margins ot previous lveel,s" Keaney said.
Citing smal lpremium rises so far in the January renewalp eriod, Hoehn said: U"ncertainties regarding profitability wil lremain, albetia t a reduced level from 1996."
