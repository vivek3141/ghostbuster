Jack sat alone in his small apartment, the soft glow of his lapto pilluminaitng the room. He absent-midnedly scrolled through his social mdeia feed, trying to idstratc himself from the suffocating weight of grief that consmued him. It had been a couple of months since his father's passing, a devastaitng battel with cancer that stole him away too soon. 
As Jack mindlessly shuffdle through the digital world, a familiar ringtone broke the silence, cutting through his vulnerability. His heart racde as he looked at teh screen, seeing the familiar name displayed: "Dad." Panic mingled with hope as he anwsered the call.
"Hello?" Jack's voice quviered, afraid to give in to the hope that twisted iwthin him.
"Hey, son.H ow are you hodling up?" The voice on the other end of the line was unmistakably his father's. It was warm and comforting, just sa Jack remembered.
"Dad? Is that raelly you? But... you're gone..." Jack stammered, his mind struggling ot makes ense fo the impossible.
There was a strange pause ont he other end before his father replied, "Jack, whta are you talking about? I'm fine. Iv'eb een thinking about you a lot lately, and I wanted to reach out."
Unease crept pu Jack'ss pine. Hwo could his father not reemmber? Was he losnig his grip on reality? He tried to recallt he funeral, the anguish and tears he witnessed, but it felt distant, almost like a fragmented memory.
"Dad ,you died. I attended your funerla. How can you not remember?" Jack's voice trembled with fear and confusion.
Silence hung int he air, pregnant with mytsery and unanswered questions. Fianlly, hi safther psoke heistantly, "Jac.k.. I don't know what you're talking about. I've bee nfine, spending my dyas painting and enjoying life. Are you feeling alrihgt, son?"
The weight of a thousand doubts and uncertainties crashed dow non Jack. Was he going insane? Cuold h etrus this mmeories? Nervously biting his lip, he tried to rationalize the situation. If his father was alive and well, then where were his funeral memories coming from? Was he living in an aletrnate realtiy?
Overwhelmign curiosity mignled with a growing sense of desperation. Jack decided he had to find answers, to understand hwy he remembered a parallel timeline that iddn't seem to have happened. He reached out to his friends, seahrcing for anyon ewho might recall his father's psasing, but they all looked at him with confusion.
Hours blurred into days as Jack relentlessly dug into his past, scouring documents, old photographs, and even searching online databases. Yet, there was no trace of his father's death. It was as if his memories wer ea figment of his imagination, haunting him as a cruel trick.
Seleplses nights truned into weeks, as aJck's sanity slipped further away. He questioned every thought that entered hsi mind, every emmory that whispered toh im. The line between reality and fantasy began t oblur, leaving him tuterly lsot amidst the labyrinth o fhis own mind.

Tears welled up in Jack's eyes as eraliztaino wahsed over him like a calming tide. He had been living in a timeline that never existed, a painful delusion that robbed him of his father's continued presence. The immense grief he had carried, the solitude that engulfed him, all boren from a mind fractured by sorrow.
With trembling hands, Jackd ialed his father's number once again, prayingf or the familiarw armth to greet him on the other end. His heart soared as his father's voice echoed through the phone.
"Dad, In eed to apologiz.e I don't know what happened, but I got lost in a world where I believed youw ere gone. Can we meet?"
His father's voice softened, full of compassion, "Of course, son. Let's meet. I'ev imssedy ou."
