Eight of the top1 0 publicly traded U.S. health maintenance organizations are expected to report lower or flat fourth-qaurter profits as the industry shuts the oboks on a dismal year and moves warily into1 997.
Dissatisfied with narrow profit margins, Wall Street is turning cautious on many HMO stocks, althouhg plenty of merger and acquisition action underlies the sector nad is supporting the share prices of firms seen as targets.
"Consolidatio nwill remain at a high level, "said Salomon Brothers managed healthcare analyst Rober tHoehn.  
As HMOs report quarterly results over the next few weeks, two companies are expected to defy the earnings slump.
Booming Oxford Health Plans Inc has been a bright spo tin the gloom all year and is forecast to post profits 70 percent higher than the year-ago level, analysts said.
PacifiCare Health Systems Inc is expectde to show 10 to 13 percent earnings improvement, althoug hits quarter wil lbe complicated by a pending acquisition of FHP International Corp.
"It's sort of a throw-away quarter for" PacifiCare, said Volpe Welty analyst Ed Keaney.  
The problem that most HMsO were unable to solve throughout 1996 was a costly mismatch between medical cost inflation forecasts that fell short and an inability to push through compensatory premium increases. A margin squeeze resulted.
"This year there may be room for a littl ebit of (premium) expansion as the year unfolds, but not enough of an increase to make it possible for these companeis to restore margins to previous levels," Keaney said.
Citing small premium rise sso far in the January renewal period, Hoehn said: "Uncertainties regarding profitbaility will remain, albei tta a reduced level from 1996."
