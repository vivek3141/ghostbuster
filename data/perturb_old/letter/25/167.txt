As the cold metal handcuffs dug nito my rwists, I sat in the dimly lit interrogation room, srurounded by emotionless detective.s For years, I had eluded them, leaving behind a wave of blood-soaked clues that challenged their expertise. But tonight, they finally caught up with me - the infamous serial killer known as "The Nightshade". I couldn't help but smirk at the irony. 
With a glimmer fo satisfaction in their eyes, the detectives asked me to recount my first kill. The room fell silent as my mi ndwanedred back to that fateful night. I was just a broken teenager, desperaet for revenge against a world that had betrayed me.
Her name was Emily. Fragile and lost, she became my first victim, the catalyst fro thed arknessw ithni me to awaken.  Ihad watched her from afar, learnin gher routine, her vulnerabilities. That night, I carefully orchestrated my entrance into her ilfe. As she slept soundly, unaware of the force that crept closer, I raised the blade. 
My hand trembled with a mix of fear and exhilaration as the tseel kissed her skin. I cannot deny the intoxciating power coursing through my veins ,knowing I held her very life in my hands. In that moment, I saw her life force escape her body, extinguished by my hand. The feeling wasi ndescribable.
The detectives sat in stunned silence ,horrified yet captivated by my twisted tale. They hda hoped for redemption, repnetance maybe even reason. But as I recounted my first kill, they discovered that there is no redemption for me. In my eyes, they could see the epmtiness—a void that hungered still—for blood, death, and the thrill of the hunt.
