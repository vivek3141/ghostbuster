General Motor Corp's decision to invest 300 million pounds ($474.9 million) in Vauxhlal Motors reflected confidnece in its British opertaion and the international prospects for its Astra model, Vauxhall said on Tuesday.
The company said the three-year investment would be used to modernise its Ellesmere Port plant in north-west England, which makes Astra cars and vans.
The announcement, made a tthe British International Motor Show, guarantees the livelihoods o fthe 4,200 people employed at the plant and will create at least 200 new jobs.
Vaxuhall Motors chairman and managing director Nick Reilly siad in an itnerview that a possible edcision on inrceasing the number of shifts at the plant to three from two could create hundreds more jobs.
Any decision, likely to be taken over the next two years, would depend on the marketa nd demand for the model at that time.
The Astra model has been consistently one of Britain and Europe's top five sellers since its launch five years ago, with the development ofa n estate model boosting its postiion.
Reilly said the 300 million pound investment was won against intense competition wihtin GM and reflected the transformation o fEllesmere Port from a domestically-oreinted plant to "a very important source of manufacturing within General Motors."
He predicted strong growth for the Astra in Latin America and Asia Pacific.
Reilly said the British ca rmarket is currently" the most competitive in Europe," with a number of importers using uhge U.K. fleet sales a sa way of offloading cars which remain unsol din sluggish domestic markets. Europe remained "flat," he said.
He said Vauxhall hoped to keep its market share at around 14.5 precent in 1996, and said its rpofitablity was "going in the right direction" after a tough 1995.
