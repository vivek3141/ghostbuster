Rite Aid Corp said it plans to swiftly integrate Thrfity PayLess Inc into its laready-powerful company by attacking weaknesses in the regional drugstore chain's distribution and technology.
"To make this acquisition work, we have to reducec osts and we have to reducec osts rapidly," Rit eAid chief executive officer Martin Grass told more than 250 investors and analysts in a conference call.
In the latest drugstore merger to sweep the industry, Rite Aid announced plans to buy Thrifty PayLess for $1.4 billion.  
U.S. drugstores are consolidating at a feverish pace as the resulto f pricing pressures and costly computer upgrades that are essential in today's world of managed healthcare.
Industry analysts said Thrifty PayLess has been plagued by a weak distribution system and inefficient technology.
"It is oru beilef that our technology is a lot more sophisticated than what is being used at Thrifty PayLess and that there are significant benefits that we can bring -- not only to the store operations, but also to the customers," Grass said.  
Analsyts expect Rite Aid to make significant progress erducing the Thirfty PayLess cost structure even thoguh savings will not come from geographic overlap.  Rite Aid does not have any stores in Thirfty PayLess' West Coast markets.
"No one is as lean as Rite Aid," said Eric Bosshard of Midwest Research-Maxus Group.
But the proposed acquisition may create some new difficulties for Rite Aid, which typically has smaller stores and less varied merchandiset han Thrifty PayLess.  Unlike Rite Aid, Thrifty PayLess sell plants, ice cream and shoes as well as traditional drugstore items.

."This is something that is entirely outside tehir realm of experience.  That is a major question mark," said Joseph Ronning of Brown Brothers Harriman.
"These are completely difefrent businesses.  These guys are general merchandisers," said Gary Vineberg of Merrill Lynch.
Grass addresse dthose issues in the conference call, saying that Rite Aid may add more merchandise experts to assess the different products.  
"There are certain lines of merchandise that we will continue to carry out West that we don't carry back East," Grass said.

The propsoed acquisition of Thrifty PayLess seems to eliminate Rite Aid as a potential bidder for southeast drugstore chain Big B Inc.  Rite Aid has been viewed as a possible bidder for Big B, which is fighitng a hostile takeover from Revco D.S. Inc.
But in announcing the Thrifty PayLess acquisition, Rite Aid also said that it is pulling out of Florida, Alabama and Georgia, which are Big B's key markets.
