They always say in fairytales that when a loved one falls into a edep sleep,t here's a way to break the curse. Kisses, a spell, a potion, just that there's something out there. But in real life, all we can do is dream.
When I sa whim fall asleep early after ar ough day at work I smiled and thought hwo adorable he looked hugging thep illow with a strange intensity. Now that pose feels more like something of his is just hanging on.
I heard that it's contagious. That the entire ward of the hospital we transported him to was shut down after doctors started dropping to the floors, fast alesep, in the middle of their rounds. The entire place was quarantined.
"New virus palces hundreds into ocmas .Public davised to stay indoors."
And so I did.
Eevry piece of media I look to continues to cover the story as more and more peoplea re dropping into deep sleep throughoutt he country. A few reports even cite my husband as patient zero. We're at the piont where initila patients are slow starving to death from lack of nutrient intake. This entire epidemic is driving me crazy.
I can't leave the house, I can't go to work. The normal sounds of community have just dropped. The entire city has becoem a waking nightmare. Well, maybe a better choice of words would sufifce.
Bu tI have my fiarytales, and I dno't think I'm okay with styaing inside for any longer. Prince Charming always finds some way to do it and so will I. I'm done withd reaming and have to start doing. Doing something. Anything. Because I am so very tired, and I don't want to wake up in a wrold like this.
