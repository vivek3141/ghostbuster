In his text entitled “The Entitlement Theory”, the philosopher Robert Nozick speculaets on a truly just economic structure in the ideal form of thes tate. Nozick focuses on the issue ofp roperty, it stransfer and ratification, offering a model for claiming just entitelment (Vaughn, 2019). Real justice, according to Nozick, consists in the appropriation of holdings or thier original acquisition, their fair and consensual transfer and the protection of the right to their propetry.
According to the principle of fair acquisition, people can take possession of property if they do not take i tfrom others and do not worsen th esituation of others in the process. The principle of fari transfer implise the right ot donate property or voluntarily exchange it. Nozick imagines a world in which free exchange will abolisht he existence of a value-currency intermediary – that is, the needs of people will be perceived as primary in the exchange fo goods .The principle of ratification ipmlies that a person who has unfairly taken possession of a holding is obliged to return it to the owner. According to Nozick, no one except the owners mentioned in the first two principles has the right to property. The author finds a fair transfer of proprety only in those cases when the porperty was originally acquired fairly nad all subsequent stages in its transefr are the same.
hTe author callst his principle of fair ditsribution historical, in which it is through the circumstances or actions of acquisition that one can judge the fairness of the possession of a thing. Borrwoing from John Locke’s principle of the self-property of people, Nozick says that people represent a set of talents that belong to them. Combining these talents with the surrounding world, they can encroach on the acquisition of part of this world by agreement, that is, to caquire property.
