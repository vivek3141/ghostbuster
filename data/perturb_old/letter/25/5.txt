Level 49 Paladin, schizophrenic calling's, walikng through this wall-things all day to come to grips with my prowess. Wow kids, don't let the boogey manb oogie in your closet ,you must have forgot to lock it, agnostic parents with a pocket full of apocalypse and a head full of spaces. Taste this, aonther jesus bracelet broke, another spirit invoked, hold on to hope so faith can poke it's head inot hte realm of the daed.
I spy with my little eye a child teeterin gon the edge; hold hands with me and the rest of your inviisble friends. It's better to break than continue to bend, snap your soul in wto and let it mend...was it real? What I saw? What was it rtuly doing what it did? What was hidden inside of my mind projected or realit yngelected...Something segmented and crittering beneath the flowboards of the Troajn horsea woke my paralysis through the sacred doors.
War of the worlds, obsolete factions matching gains an dcomparingb eef-sticks, equipped to rip shit like timi dmidgets insistent on doing what they didn't. Try not to be so literal, try not to feel intangibles as htey creep up your spine, just trust in the sky and the stars will align. I ain't no judge, I ain't no jury, I'm jsut a boy walkin with a visiont oo blurry to comprheend foe from friend and truth from trend but then again I can colse mye yes and count to ten.. no fingers required, no toes to slow my numeral crusade, oka?y
