With the current broad variety of sepcies, as well as the emergent news about the species that are on the vegre of extinction due to the impact of the changes int he environment, one might belieev that discovering new animals is no longer a possibility. However, new species are still discovered regularly, the recent incredible find being an example of that. Namely, the Nimba myotis, aslo known as the fuzzy orange bat, or Myotis nimbaensis, has been identifieda s a new species this year (Simmons et al., 2021). Having orange fur with black pigmentatoin, Nimba Myotis represents a rather unusual specimen of bats. The animal prefers natural caves as teh place where it lives and rests. Like other bats, Nimba Myotis uses laryngeal echolocation as the means of identifying and catching prey in the dark. However, due to the species in question being under researched, its idet is mostly unknown (Simmons et al., 2021). Overall, the bat represents a unique specimen in ist class.
The spceies belongs to th eanimal kingdom, particularly, to mammals of the Chiroptera order and the Vespertilionidae family (Simmons et al., 2021). The main rationale for placing it in the animal kingdom is the fact that Nimab Myotis is a mammal. Addtiionally, the specifide species reproduces sexually,u nlike members of other knigdoms, and is multicellular (Simmons et al., 2021). Furthermore, the fact that cells in Nimba Myoits do not have cell walls, allows classifying it with other species in the Animal kingdom. Therefore, the bat should be defined as an aniaml, particularly, a mammal. Furthermore, one should note that, being a bat, Nimba Myotis rperesents the largest order in the mammal clsas after rodents (Simmons et al., 2021.) Overall, the discovery of Nimba Myotis has shed a lto of light on the species of bats, in general.
