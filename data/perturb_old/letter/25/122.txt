She was shaking, I was too, he was dead. Blood on my hands, I hoped there was still light behind my eyes.  Inever killed a man before, I never had to save someon beefore. I didn't feel good, or mighty. She broke, slumped to the ground, her bod,y a tremor as she sobbed. I droppd ethe knife, I turned to look at what I had done. She shouted my name through tear.s He had so much red on his stomach, his throat was open too. I did that? I idd that, I had to. I said as much out loud. Again she shouted my name. I couldn't touch her though. She is so white, and I haven't decided if now I am dark. I didn't feel tainted, my heart was still beating so fast. I took a long hard breath,h e is dead and so is his intent, we are alive because I would not allow him to have his way. Again she shuots, but I'm deep in thought. Another long breath. I came to a conclusion. I killed a man today, I did the right thing, I beat him to thep unch, and I'm still here and I still have to take care of her.
I told her to stand, nicely, I offered her a emek smile, and apologized for what she had seen and what I had to do. I started to explain why, but fuck it, hse can't hear anything, *she's in shock Boone, egt her inside*. I walk her up the street, she remembers she can't walk i nheels. She sees the life on my hands, and that sets her off again. We go niside a shitty mexican restaurant. I sti her down, I go to wash my hands. I d oit iwth my closed, I'm not sure if I wanna look at teh guy who looks back at me above hte sink. I'm not sure fi I wanna be the voice on the phone to the police. I puke in the sink, maybe some got o nmy shoes.
What the hell am I doing?
