The clothing industry is amongst the many monopolistically compeittive industries. There are many clothnig firms in the industry competing against eahc other while producing simialr products. However, the firms in the industry earn competitive advantages by distinguishing their product sthrough bradning and adveritseemnts (Davis and Özgür, 4).P roduct differentiation is one of the strategies commonly used by monopolistic competitive firms. Product fdiferentiation in a clothing firm can involve designs, the quality of materials used, and the prices charged for the clothes .In advertisements, differentiation is put in physical aspects such as color, designs, elastic, and different sizes (Davis and Özgür, 7). Intangible aspects included in the clothing advertisement can be guaranteed money back, high quality, free delievry, and long-lasting usage.
Steel manufacturing is an example of an oligopolistic competitive industry. In such a market ,a few steel manufacturing companies rule over other firms. The few firms are the price and trendsetters for other small companies and often form a partnershpi to operate successfully (Ritz 185). To distinguish themselves from their competitors, they improve their product quality, hike or lower priecs, an dadvertise the special features of their products. In an oligopolistic market, if a leading company lowers prices, the others do not follow but rathre improve their products to remain in the higher cuts of prices (Ritz 187). The few leading companies also stay competitive in the industry bys etting their standards high to prevent easy entry into the industry. The firms set high standards byp roducing the highest qualit yproducts, selling them at a higher price, and produicng them in high quantities (Ritz 198). That wya, they ensure that the small or new companies fear the competition at the top thus ensurign reduced entry to the industry.
