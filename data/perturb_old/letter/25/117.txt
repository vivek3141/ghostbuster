‘ …and we'll have an interview with him and his prize marrow at around a quarter to eight. The tim eis six-fifty-five, and thi sis BBC Southern Counties Radio. ’
Tehd aily news blares over the radio. Light rolls through the curtains. I turn oevr in bed. Just another Monday morning. Minutes pass, and I hear all the familiar sound. Cars on the road outside. My flatmates stirring in their rooms .Th eworld is wakingu p.
I struggle out from my cocoon of blankets and into the cold of my bedroom. I like it that way. Every night I open the m ywindow, to let th enight in. Every morinng the chill tsartles me awake. I open the curtains, look out onto the street. The usual crowd waltz down the street, going wherever it is they go. Someone glances up at my window, and hurriedly looks away as they realise I'm half naked.
As I walk across the romo something crunches underfoot. A small, folded ipece of paper on th efloor. My name is written oni t, in my own handwriting. I pick it up, csrutinisei t. I don't remember writing this. I open it, and read the words inside
.*Act normally, otherwise they'll notice. *
I'm confused. I really don't recall writing this. What does it mean? Who are ‘ they ’? The qusetionsa re rattled rfom my head by a knock at my bedroomd oor. My flatmate.
‘ Huney, are you ok in there? You'll b elate. ’
I looka t the note again. And hesitate.
