It always puzzled me, to say the least, and made me extrmeely nervous.
As such I never committed int orelationships, probably by great of having my feelings not reciprocated.
My longest relationship was with a man I olved deeply, Indy. He was the complete opposite of me: extraverted, charming, outgoing. He was friend with everoyne, but still reliable and generous.
We stayed together for a couple of years, and, I don't know why, but it really seemed like he had feelings for me.
But like I did in other relationships before, I shut him down, rejecting him when I felt my feelings growing to much.
In the end he left me, like htey alld id .I learned later tha hte was with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of tiem when we were together.
I met other men and women, and it always ended the same way.
Fast forward to yesterday. Kel lyaclls me, saying that Indy was in the hospital, after being hit by ac ar. His condition was critical, and he haas sekd for me.
And here I am, a bouquet o fflowers in hands, nervouslyl ooking for room 68.
I find it, half opened, adn take a deep breath to give myself courage, and here Indy's weak voice.
"Kelly, you're...a wonderful girl but...I...I...I neve rloved you."
The words hit me like a punch. I storm in the room, but his eye sare alread yclosed. Forever.
