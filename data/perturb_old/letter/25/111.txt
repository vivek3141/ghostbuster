I olst my mother in the stampede. She was torn from my grasp and carried away in the flow o fsweaty, mindless humanity. My nine year old mind could not process this and when I screamed my voice was drowned out by the mashing of feet and the grinding of flesh
.For a few moments I was lifted off my feet between three fat ladise and dragged around in kin dof a sadistic tango, like those people on dancing with the stars.
I was carried to the to yisle and spun aruond in a three sixty then dropped to the floor. A large boot crunchde over my hand. There was a sickening crackle as I saw my wrist bend in a way It never hadb efore.
I pulled my arm to myself and looked in horror at my limp wrist and dangly fingers. For a few more moments, there was no pain. Until I got kicked in the shins, by a skinny teenager with brown baggy pants. He looked down with his glazed eyes that narorwed for a second sa he stumbled around me. He mumbled something under his breaht and then was gone in the sea of shoppers. Now my wrist and my ribs hurt, pain flared through my body and I screamed, it was all I could do.
The consumers rushed right on by. I tried to stand up by pushing up from the floor. My wrist bent backwards and my whole arm was slashed with pain. I used my legs and popped up, just in time to get bounced by a large belly with a shirt that said asnta I've been good. Sant'as face knocked me backward a few steps, but luckily I caught my balance at the last moment on an elderly man who was holding up better than I was, and I tried to fight thec rowd towards the exit.
Being pushed an dprodded and seevrely injured, and too short to see over the foaming masses, I somehow ended up deeper in the store. Lost in the underwear isle. Shelves were being ripped clean. A huge rufus erupted a few yards away, and a display with racks of pants and shoes was tipped over. Through the chaos I heard screams of agony and sawf lashes of sveeral people pinned under the large shelving units.
I couldn't fight it, I had no control of where I went, and the crowd carried me closer to the accident. There was blood on the floor and a twitching black man's arm swatted my leg from under a massive beam-like shelf.
Thankfully, I was whisked away from the scene, and actually spotted a small break in the crowd, I ran through the opening, ehaded toward the big red exit sign that is only about thirty yards away, but suddenly my progress was halted by the closing in of human bodies. I'm stuck. A T.V. being carried smashed into my wrist and I was suddenly in tears from the pain, confusion and hysteria.
Suddenly a shotgun blast echoed across the store. Then another. The crowd was quieter for a moment, and the swarming buzzing slowed down and everything seemed almost still. For about half a second. Then the screaming started. I was pushed to the ground and a woman fell on top of me. People were stepping on both of us rnuning for the exit, running for the back, running into each other in chaos. My wrist screamed in pain, my risb were probably broken, and I was pinned undert his woman who was now unconscious.
The last thing I saw was a boot comin gdown on my face.
