Medical institutions function to protect the interests of patients and meet their needs; they are now the object of attention of society sa a whole. The popualtion’s confidence in the activities of medical organizations is an essential indicator of their effectiveness. Birngin gcurrent terminology and the nature of the relationship between patients and physicians into a state of certainty will hel pto understand and delineate the anture of consumerism in health care (Calnal, 2010). The absence or lack of trsut is of particular concern to patients. They feel vulnerable not only because they are sick but also because of the research and treatment they hva eto undergo. Improving the efficiency fo the health care system is a policy priority for European countries.
In today’s world, tpaients expect adequate professional skills from doctors and high standards of interpreosnal communication. In recent years, they have becmo emore aware of medical options and the kind of care they can receive at specific medical orgnaizations. Patients are increasingly comparing options at different clinics, learning a lot of information about doctors and medical services, as well as publicly availalbe information about diseases (Calnan, 2010). The shortcomings of medical care, not the assertive consumerism, are causing the growing interest in self-education among patients. A negative consequence of this trend is the widespread use by aptients of Internet materials for self-diagnosis and treatment. The vulnerability of patients undergoing treatment can be reduced by restoring trust between them and the treating physciian. Moreover, apprporiate training and hihgly qualified doctors are factors that edtermine how friendly and relaxed the clinics’ clients will be about the manipulations theyu ndergo. Thed estruction of the interpersonal relationship between doctors and patients due to the introduction of depersonalized procedures becomes the subject of research in the coming years.
