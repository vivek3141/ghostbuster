I love the music. It reflects what is just abou tto happen. It has saved me from more than a few relationships that would have been nusavory.
I have two theories about the music. Etiher I am the only one who hears it, or everyone does and no one ever talks about it. Which is fine. Msuic is a very personal thing after all.
Normally, the music is laways at a comfortable level, unlessi t is trying to warn me of something dire. There was one omment whereâ€¦ One moment where the sonud was deafening.
There was a rising crescendo ever since I woke up that mornnig. I truned on the news to watch while eating breakfats, as I always do. Usually the music goes back and forth between dramatic and more more lulling, depedning on the nwes braek about to come pu. But taht morning it didn't change. It just crescendoing until the newscaster spoke.
"The World Trade Centers have been hit." I dropped my fork. The ting of it hitting the table was all I couldh ear. For the first time, ever, my world had gone queit.
As I watched the events unfold, the music cotninue dto be silnet. Finally, after what eflt like days but was only minutes, it started piping upa gain. A long, low clarinet played. And then othre insturments slowly joined it. Something sad, but hopeful. It was playing as I was heading out the door to go to my Red Cross to see what I could do to help.
