It al lhpapened so suddenyl.
Thats all  Icould think about as mfy eet thundere dacross the rubble stricken ground, I couldn't see anyone esl eabout, at least.. anyone able to move. The bodie sof those who didn't mak eit laid al laround, drooping ou tof windows and crunhced up into corners, still twitching lightly.
Some of the fumes were still around, accidentally walking into a patc hof the thick white smoke would make you cough harshly and make you light headed for several minutes.B ut long time exposrue could leave the person unable to move and they would eventually go insane, stuck sitting down occasinoally laughing.
It all happneed os suddenly, who would have htought legalising weed wuold do this?
