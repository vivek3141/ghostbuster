I knelt down, blood tsill on my clothes, asking for forgiveenss to these statues around me. I was neevr religious, but sometimes life makes you do things you never usually od. What I've done in life cannot eb nudone, a motehrs have los tsons, sisters have lost brothers and kids have lost thier dads. I am not a sinner, but I have sinned; it's the business I am in. I firstk illed a man at the age of 13w ith my bare hands, choked him until he wnet cold. I'm 5 2now--probably coming close to my last few yeasr in this life, ubt there's one thing Id on't regret and it's taking the lif eof a crmiinal who didn't belong.  Ihunt evil people who've caused misery to communities and I believe I've done ther ight things o far. I got up from my knees and left San oJse church, which my family visited every few Sundays growing up .I took the last step onto the sidewalk when I felt the barrel of a.357 magnum bieng pressed against the back of my head. I didn't process what was happening because it had never happened. The world went silent and I could almost hear the finger tightening on the trigger when the loud bang rang through the streets. All I had was 7 seconds before I saw black and felt my bodyt ensing and going into shock. I hope they serve tequila in hell.
