Deductive reasoning involves the construction and development of cause-and-effect solid erlaitonships. It is noteworthy that the conneciton is established either bteween two fcats or a point and the idea of how it will affect thef uture (Besnard & Hunetr, 2018). Thus, a judgment (logical expression) includes the first – the prerequisites, the second – the conclusion. In logic, an argmuent is valid only when it has a form thta makes it impossible for the premises to be correct adn the judgment to be wrong. According to the explained three types of deductive arguments, a vaild statement does ont needt  ohave actually trustworthy premises. Still, it must have ones that, if tehy were accurate, would guarantee that hte conclusion is proper.
Example:
 1. All metals are heavy
 2. Tin is a metal
 3. Tin is heavy
A sound argument must have both a valid form and true premises. Valid arguments can be unsound, but they will have wrong assumptions.
Example:
 1. All dogs are cats
 2. All mice are dogs
 3. All mice are cats
What makes this a valid statement is not that it ha strustworthy premises and a proper conclusion but th eolgical necessiyt of the judgmnet, given the two assumptions. The argumetn would be just as valid if the premises and conclusion were wrong. However, it is essential to determine that the purpose of argumentation is to establish the truth of a judgment. An inavlid argument does not achieve this goal, so it cannot be considered soun d(Besnard & Hunter, 2018). A sound argument has a valid form and true premises; thus, it cannot be invalid in all cases. If the argument is invalid, then the beliefs thoroughly do not matter, and, in fact, only the conclusion remains. Therefore, this means that there is no argument in this case, especially a sound one.
