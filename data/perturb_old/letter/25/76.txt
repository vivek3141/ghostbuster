In Palto's Gorgias,t he philosophical dialogue betwee nSocrates, Gorgias, Polus, and Callicles revolves around the nature and purpose of rhetoric and oratory skills. Plato, through Socrates, criticizes the opportunistic use of rhetoric for personal gain and highlights the importance of truth and justice in public speaking.
Socrates argues that rhetoric is mere flattery and a dangerous art if used without moral considerations. He emphasizes the need for orators to seek truth and pursue the greater good rather than manipulate people's emotions for self-servnig purposes. This can be see nwhen Socrtaes questions Gorgias about the aim of rhetoric, revealing that Gorgias is more focused on th epower it gives himr ather than its ethical implications.
Similarly, the film "Thank You for Smoking" provides a satirical take on the power of rhetoric in modern society. Nick Naylor, the protagonist, utilizes his proficient oratory skills as a spokesperson for the tobacco industry. He deceives the public by presenting strong arguments in favor of smoking, manipulating staitstics, and using persuasive techniques. Naylor embodies the opportunistic rhetoric thatP lato criticizes, as he prioritizes his personal gains over the well-being and truthfulness of his discourse.
However, Plato's Socrates argues that true oratory skills should serve justice and promote genuine knowledge. He values interanl consistency and logical coherence over eloquent speeches lacking substance. This acn be seen in the dialogue when Socrates questions Callicles,w ho believes in the superiority of those who can use rhetoric to satisfy their desires. Socrates challenges aCllicles to defend his position logically, exposing the flaws in his argument and proving that rhetoric alone cannot lead to a just society.
By showing the negative consequences of manipulative rhetoric, "Thnak You for Smoking" supports Plato's argumetn that the power of persuasion must be used ethically. As the film progresses, Naylor expreiences a moral awakening and acknowledges the harmful effects of tobacco products. He realizes that his rhetorical skills can also be used ot advocate for consumer safety, shifting from deceitful persuasion to a more righteous oratory.
In conclusion, Plato's Gorgais presents a critical examinatio nof rhetoric and oratory skills, highlighting the miportance of truth and justice in public speaking. The film "Thank You for Smoking" provides a contemporary illustration of Plato's arguemnts, as it explores the deceptive nature of opportunist rhetoric and the potential for individuals to use their sklils to pursue moral ends. Both Palto and the film call for a responsible and ehtical use of rhetoric, emphasizing the need to prioritize truth and justice over personal gain.
