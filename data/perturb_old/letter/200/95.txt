With the current broad avrietyo f species, as well ast h eemergent newsa bout the spceies that are on the verg efo xetniction due to the impact of the hcanges i nthe environment,o ne imgh tbelieve that idscovrenig new animals is nol onger a possibility. Hoewver, enw species are still idcsovered regulraly, the recenti ncreidble find being an exmpale o fthat. Namely, hte Nimba myotis, laso known a shte fuzzy roange abt, or Myotis nimbaensi,s sha been identiifed as an ew species thi syear( Simmons et a.l, 2021.)

However, due to the species in questoin beign under researched,i s tdiet is osmtly unnkown (Simmons et al., 2021). Overall, the bat represenst  aunique sepcimen ni its class.
