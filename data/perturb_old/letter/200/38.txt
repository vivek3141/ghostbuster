Without a second thought, I tsepped through the tea,r adn eevrythin garound me instantly morphed into a straneg, sterile environment. Startled, I fou ndmysefl lying on a cold, metal table, with sruigcal intsruments neatly arranegd on a chair beisde me. Panic began ot consume me as I desperateyl tried toun derstand what was happening.
To my confusion, a robotic voice echoe dthrough the room, "Welocme, Dr. aHrtifeld. Please remai stnill whilew e prepare for the procedure."Dr

Paralyzed ni fera, I watched as they circled the tbale, analyzing and recodring dtaa wit htehir cybernetic appendages.
One of the robots moved closre and psoke to em with a soothing voice ,"Dr. Hartfield, we are here to assist you in your research. Please, remai ncalm."
