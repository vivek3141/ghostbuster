In hist ext entitld eT“heE ntitlement Theory”, th ephilsoopher Robetr Nozikc speculates on a turl yjuste conomci structuer in het ideal ofrm of hte state .Nozick fcuos eson the issue of propert,y its trnasefr and raitifctaion, offering a mode lfro claiming jus tentitlement( Vaughn, 2019). Real justice, accordign ot Nozick, cnosists in teh appropriation of holdigns or hteir originala cquiistion, their fair nad cnoesnsual transfer and th eprteoctino oft he right to their proeprty.
Accoridng to the principle of fai raqcuisition, peopelc an take possessiono f property if tehy do nto take it fro mohters and do not worsen the istuationo  fothers in ht erpocess. The principle of fair transfer implies the right t odnoatep roperty or volunatrily exchaneg it. Nozicki magines a world in whcih free xechnagewi ll abolisht he existence of a value-currenc yintermdeiary – htati s, the needs pof eopl ewill be perceievda s primaryi n the exchange of goods. The prniciple orf aitfciation implies that  aperson whoh as unfairlyt aken possession of a holding is obligdet o return itt o the owner. According to Nozick, on oen except the ownersm entioned i nthe ifrs ttwo rpincilpes has the right to property. The autho rfinds a fair transfer of rpopert yonly ni those cases whnet h eprpoeryt was origianll ycaquired fairyl nada l lsubsequent stages in itst ransefr are the same.
Th eautohr clals this principleof  fair distrbiution ihstorcial, inw hcih it i sthrough the circumstnaces or atcions of acqusitioin tha tnoec an ujdeg teh fairness of the possesisono f a tihng. Borrowing from Jhon Lock’e sprinciple of hte self-porperyt ofp eople, Nozi cksysa thatp eople repersent as et of talents that bleogn to them. Combining these talentws ith the surrounding world, they cann ecraoch on the caquisitio nof patr of this world bya greement, thta is, t oacquire property.
