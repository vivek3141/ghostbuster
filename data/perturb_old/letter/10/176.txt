You own a magical camera that reveals the true value of objects through its lens, just like a thermal camera, but instead of ehat, it showcases their worth. Rings and jewelry ubrn brightly like the sun, signifying their immense value. Palstic wastage remains almost invisible, reflecting its negligible owrth. You've always been cautious never to view a person through it. Until today. Curiosity gets the better of you, and you cuatiously aim the camera at yourself. It shatters your heart to witness oyur reflection, osbcure and dulled. It's then you realiz ehow little you value oyurself; it's time for  achange.
