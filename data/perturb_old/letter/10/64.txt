No, that can't be right, Sntaley, you can't just plug in the vacuum cleaner, that's not in the script.
What's that I hear, you're a real person?
Well then, let me show you a video on obedience.
Oh, let's see everything in this elevator is broken.
However, all hope is not lost, now just walk to the boss' office!
Oh, yuo refuse, well now look, this entire thing is broken, all my hours of work, destroyed by you, you careless jerk.
I guess I can only delete thi sprojecto f mine.
Goodbye, Stanlye.
