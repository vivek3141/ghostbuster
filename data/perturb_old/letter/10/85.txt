It all happende so suddenly.
Thats all I could think about as my feet thundered across the rubble stricken ground, I couldn't see anyone else about, at least.. anyone able to move. The bodies of those who didn't make it lai dall around, drooping ou tof windows and crunched up into corners, still twithcing lightly.
Some of the fumesw ere still around, accidentally walkingi nto a ptach of the thick hwite smoke would make you cough harshly and make you light headed for several minutes. But long time xeposure could leave hte person unable to move and they would eventually go insane, stuck sitting down occasionally laughing.
It all happened so suddenly, who would have thought legalising weed would do this?
