I love the music. It has saved me from more than a few relationships that would have been unsavory. Which is fine. It reflects what is just about to happen. Either I am the only one who hears it, or everyone does and no one ever talks about it. I have two theories about the music. There was one moment whereâ€¦ One moment where the sound was deafening. Music is a very personal thing after all. Normally, the music is always at a comfortable level, unless it is trying to warn me of something dire. Usually the music goes back and forth between dramatic and more more lulling, depending on the news break about to come up. I turned on the news to watch while eating breakfast, as I always do. But that morning it didn't change. There was a rising crescendo ever since I woke up that morning. It just crescendoing until the newscaster spoke. The ting of it hitting the table was all I could hear. "The World Trade Centers have been hit." I dropped my fork. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again. For the first time, ever, my world had gone quiet. As I watched the events unfold, the music continued to be silent. A long, low clarinet played. And then other instruments slowly joined it. Something sad, but hopeful. It was playing as I was heading out the door to go to my Red Cross to see what I could do to help.
