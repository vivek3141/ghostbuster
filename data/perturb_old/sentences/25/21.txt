This act ensured fair treatment of immigrants and promoted equality. President Franklin Roosevelt’s acts and laws played a crucial role in ending the Great Depression and significantly improving the situation for certain marginalized groups of the population, including immigrants, African Americans, and workers. During the Great Depression, immigrants faced immense hardships and discrimination. Moreover, the creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) within the New Deal aimed to provide work opportunities, housing, and education for millions of young unemployed men, many of whom were immigrants. To address this issue, President Roosevelt signed the National Origins Act of 1934, which abolished discriminatory quotas based on nationality. The CCC not only put food on their tables but also gave them a sense of belonging and hope for a better future. In addition, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) employed thousands of African American workers, allowing them to contribute to the nation's infrastructure while earning a living. Through his New Deal programs and policies, Roosevelt brought about social and economic change that helped restore the nation’s stability and spurred progress. His administration established the National Youth Administration (NYA), which provided jobs and educational opportunities for young African Americans. African Americans, who were disproportionately affected by economic disparities and racial discrimination, also benefited from Roosevelt’s policies. Roosevelt understood the importance of economic opportunities for African Americans and actively supported the establishment of fair labor practices, ensuring that they were included in the New Deal programs. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) introduced minimum wage laws and set limits on working hours, consequently improving the quality of life for workers across the nation. Workers, who were at the epicenter of the economic crisis, witnessed significant improvements due to Roosevelt’s intervention. In conclusion, President Franklin Roosevelt’s acts and laws had a transformative impact on the nation’s recovery from the Great Depression. He passed the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), which guaranteed workers the right to join unions and engage in collective bargaining. These initiatives played a crucial role in improving the lives of immigrants, African Americans, and workers, ultimately bringing about a significant societal change and setting the foundation for a more inclusive and prosperous America. His New Deal programs, including the National Origins Act, CCC, NYA, WPA, NIRA, and FLSA, were instrumental in providing relief, economic opportunities, and social reforms.
