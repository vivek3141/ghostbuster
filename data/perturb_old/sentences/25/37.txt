I blinked groggily as I awoke to the faint sound of city traffic. Rubbing my eyes, I realized I was no longer in the cozy comfort of my self-driving car. Determined to figure out my current whereabouts, I ventured out of the vehicle. The last thing I remembered was programming my destination on the car's console and activating the auto-darkening windows, hoping to catch some sleep during the long journey. Confused and disoriented, I peered out of the window, only to find myself surrounded by towering skyscrapers and bustling streets I had never seen before. The air was filled with unfamiliar scents and the language spoken around me was foreign. Panicking, I desperately attempted to recall how I ended up here. Where was I? But something had clearly gone wrong. My mind raced with questions. As I wandered among the crowds, I noticed the futuristic architecture and advanced technologies that seemed centuries ahead of my time. How had I ended up in a time so distant from my own? Feeling lost and alone, I thought of my loved ones, their faces fading as I traveled further away from home. With no way back, I resolved to adapt, learn, and perhaps, leave a mark on this astonishing future that had inadvertently become my destination. But amid the chaos, a glimmer of curiosity sparked within me. Embracing this new reality, I decided to make the most of my unexpected journey. Tears welled in my eyes as I yearned for familiarity.
