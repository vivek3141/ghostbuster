I groggily sat up as my roommate shook me awake, panic etched across his face. "There's no time! We have to go!" His eyes widened in fear as he responded, "There's no time! Confused, I pleaded for clarification. he exclaimed urgently. Disbelief coursed through my veins, but his words held an air of truth. Clocks froze, sun stood still, and the world remained trapped in an eternal moment. I woke up today and time doesn't exist anymore!" With a knot in my stomach, we rushed outside, witnessing the chaos that ensued. We were left with no choice but to navigate this timeless abyss.
