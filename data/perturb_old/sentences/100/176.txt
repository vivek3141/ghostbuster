Curiosity gets the better of you, and you cautiously aim the camera at yourself. Plastic wastage remains almost invisible, reflecting its negligible worth. Rings and jewelry burn brightly like the sun, signifying their immense value. You've always been cautious never to view a person through it. It's then you realize how little you value yourself; it's time for a change. It shatters your heart to witness your reflection, obscure and dulled. You own a magical camera that reveals the true value of objects through its lens, just like a thermal camera, but instead of heat, it showcases their worth. Until today.
