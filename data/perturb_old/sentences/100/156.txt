"You ready yet? She asks as she rummages through her purse. I'm about to leave!" "Yeah, I just need to find my keys in this mess.. Do you want to me to follow?" See you in a bit sis!" I get in my car and buckle up. I hate driving. "Yeah that's fine. God I hate these drives now that we're older. But then again, there used to be a time before that...when my parents were together. Be careful driving! Damn, that new red mustang looks awesome...seems to be going a bit too fast too....
Oh god,
Please
I look back the the rearview, slow down sis...This guy seems to be either stupid or dru - before I can look back again I hear the sound of glass shattering and metal grinding against itself, breaks screeching. *sigh* Nothing we can do now huh.. Landon st. left and, what was it, Jefferson Rd right? I check the rearview more than the actual road. No, no no no no no.... There used to be a time when I could just pick up my little sister from moms and we can drive together, be there at the same time, not have to worry about traffic or work.
