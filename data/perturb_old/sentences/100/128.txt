I love the music. It has saved me from more than a few relationships that would have been unsavory. It reflects what is just about to happen. There was one moment whereâ€¦ One moment where the sound was deafening. Which is fine. Either I am the only one who hears it, or everyone does and no one ever talks about it. It just crescendoing until the newscaster spoke. Normally, the music is always at a comfortable level, unless it is trying to warn me of something dire. Music is a very personal thing after all. But that morning it didn't change. I have two theories about the music. Usually the music goes back and forth between dramatic and more more lulling, depending on the news break about to come up. I turned on the news to watch while eating breakfast, as I always do. There was a rising crescendo ever since I woke up that morning. "The World Trade Centers have been hit." The ting of it hitting the table was all I could hear. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again. I dropped my fork. A long, low clarinet played. As I watched the events unfold, the music continued to be silent. And then other instruments slowly joined it. For the first time, ever, my world had gone quiet. Something sad, but hopeful. It was playing as I was heading out the door to go to my Red Cross to see what I could do to help.
