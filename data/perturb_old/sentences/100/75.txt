It always puzzled me, to say the least, and made me extremely nervous. He was friend with everyone, but still reliable and generous. I learned later that he was with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of time when we were together. As such I never committed into relationships, probably by great of having my feelings not reciprocated. We stayed together for a couple of years, and, I don't know why, but it really seemed like he had feelings for me. My longest relationship was with a man I loved deeply, Indy. But like I did in other relationships before, I shut him down, rejecting him when I felt my feelings growing to much. And here I am, a bouquet of flowers in hands, nervously looking for room 68. He was the complete opposite of me: extraverted, charming, outgoing. His condition was critical, and he has asked for me. Kelly calls me, saying that Indy was in the hospital, after being hit by a car. I met other men and women, and it always ended the same way. In the end he left me, like they all did. I find it, half opened, and take a deep breath to give myself courage, and here Indy's weak voice. "Kelly, you're...a wonderful girl but...I...I...I never loved you." The words hit me like a punch. I storm in the room, but his eyes are already closed. Fast forward to yesterday. Forever.
