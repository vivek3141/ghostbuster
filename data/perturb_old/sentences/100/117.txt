The daily news blares over the radio. ‘ …and we'll have an interview with him and his prize marrow at around a quarter to eight. The time is six-fifty-five, and this is BBC Southern Counties Radio. The world is waking up. Light rolls through the curtains. I turn over in bed. I struggle out from my cocoon of blankets and into the cold of my bedroom. Cars on the road outside. Minutes pass, and I hear all the familiar sound. Just another Monday morning. I like it that way. I open the curtains, look out onto the street. My flatmates stirring in their rooms. Every morning the chill startles me awake. Every night I open the my window, to let the night in. My name is written on it, in my own handwriting. A small, folded piece of paper on the floor. The usual crowd waltz down the street, going wherever it is they go. Someone glances up at my window, and hurriedly looks away as they realise I'm half naked. I pick it up, scrutinise it. I don't remember writing this. I really don't recall writing this. I open it, and read the words inside. As I walk across the room something crunches underfoot. Who are ‘ they ’? The questions are rattled from my head by a knock at my bedroom door. What does it mean? *Act normally, otherwise they'll notice. And hesitate. *
I'm confused. My flatmate. ‘ Huney, are you ok in there? ’
I look at the note again. You'll be late.
