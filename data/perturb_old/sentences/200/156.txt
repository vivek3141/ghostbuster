I'm about to leave!" She asks as she rummages through her purse. There used to be a time when I could just pick up my little sister from moms and we can drive together, be there at the same time, not have to worry about traffic or work. But then again, there used to be a time before that...when my parents were together. "Yeah that's fine. "Yeah, I just need to find my keys in this mess.. Do you want to me to follow?" I get in my car and buckle up. "You ready yet? Be careful driving! God I hate these drives now that we're older. Damn, that new red mustang looks awesome...seems to be going a bit too fast too....
Oh god,
Please
I look back the the rearview, slow down sis...This guy seems to be either stupid or dru - before I can look back again I hear the sound of glass shattering and metal grinding against itself, breaks screeching. See you in a bit sis!" I hate driving. No, no no no no no.... *sigh* Nothing we can do now huh.. Landon st. left and, what was it, Jefferson Rd right? I check the rearview more than the actual road.
