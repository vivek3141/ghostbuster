Panic mingled with hope as he answered the call. As Jack mindlessly shuffled through the digital world, a familiar ringtone broke the silence, cutting through his vulnerability. He absent-mindedly scrolled through his social media feed, trying to distract himself from the suffocating weight of grief that consumed him. Jack sat alone in his small apartment, the soft glow of his laptop illuminating the room. His heart raced as he looked at the screen, seeing the familiar name displayed: "Dad." "Hey, son. Jack's voice quivered, afraid to give in to the hope that twisted within him. It had been a couple of months since his father's passing, a devastating battle with cancer that stole him away too soon. "Dad? But... you're gone..." Jack stammered, his mind struggling to make sense of the impossible. "Hello?" It was warm and comforting, just as Jack remembered. The voice on the other end of the line was unmistakably his father's. I'm fine. Is that really you? There was a strange pause on the other end before his father replied, "Jack, what are you talking about? How could his father not remember? How are you holding up?" I've been thinking about you a lot lately, and I wanted to reach out." Was he losing his grip on reality? Unease crept up Jack's spine. He tried to recall the funeral, the anguish and tears he witnessed, but it felt distant, almost like a fragmented memory. I attended your funeral. How can you not remember?" Jack's voice trembled with fear and confusion. I don't know what you're talking about. "Dad, you died. Finally, his father spoke hesitantly, "Jack... Are you feeling alright, son?" Silence hung in the air, pregnant with mystery and unanswered questions. The weight of a thousand doubts and uncertainties crashed down on Jack. Overwhelming curiosity mingled with a growing sense of desperation. Was he going insane? I've been fine, spending my days painting and enjoying life. If his father was alive and well, then where were his funeral memories coming from? Nervously biting his lip, he tried to rationalize the situation. Jack decided he had to find answers, to understand why he remembered a parallel timeline that didn't seem to have happened. Yet, there was no trace of his father's death. Was he living in an alternate reality? Could he trust his memories? Hours blurred into days as Jack relentlessly dug into his past, scouring documents, old photographs, and even searching online databases. He reached out to his friends, searching for anyone who might recall his father's passing, but they all looked at him with confusion. Sleepless nights turned into weeks, as Jack's sanity slipped further away. It was as if his memories were a figment of his imagination, haunting him as a cruel trick. The line between reality and fantasy began to blur, leaving him utterly lost amidst the labyrinth of his own mind. He questioned every thought that entered his mind, every memory that whispered to him. Finally, Jack stumbled upon a faded newspaper article, buried deep within an archive. With trembling hands, Jack dialed his father's number once again, praying for the familiar warmth to greet him on the other end. Tears welled up in Jack's eyes as realization washed over him like a calming tide. The immense grief he had carried, the solitude that engulfed him, all borne from a mind fractured by sorrow. He had been living in a timeline that never existed, a painful delusion that robbed him of his father's continued presence. It was dated years before his father's supposed death, recounting a miraculous recovery from terminal cancer. The article featured his father's beaming face, defying the odds and the grasp of death. "Dad, I need to apologize. I don't know what happened, but I got lost in a world where I believed you were gone. Let's meet. Can we meet?" His heart soared as his father's voice echoed through the phone. His father's voice softened, full of compassion, "Of course, son. I've missed you." In that moment, Jack found solace in the truth and the love that existed beyond the constraints of his fractured mind. The journey to rediscover himself was far from over, but with newfound clarity and the warmth of his father's love, he knew he could face anything that lay ahead.
