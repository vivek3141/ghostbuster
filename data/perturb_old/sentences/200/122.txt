I did that? ...
...
She was shaking, I was too, he was dead. Blood on my hands, I hoped there was still light behind my eyes. She broke, slumped to the ground, her body, a tremor as she sobbed. He had so much red on his stomach, his throat was open too. I didn't feel good, or mighty. She shouted my name through tears. I never killed a man before, I never had to save someone before. I didn't feel tainted, my heart was still beating so fast. I couldn't touch her though. She is so white, and I haven't decided if now I am dark. I dropped the knife, I turned to look at what I had done. Again she shouted my name. I killed a man today, I did the right thing, I beat him to the punch, and I'm still here and I still have to take care of her. Again she shouts, but I'm deep in thought. Another long breath. I said as much out loud. I took a long hard breath, he is dead and so is his intent, we are alive because I would not allow him to have his way. I did that, I had to. I'm not sure if I wanna be the voice on the phone to the police. She sees the life on my hands, and that sets her off again. I came to a conclusion. We go inside a shitty mexican restaurant. I sit her down, I go to wash my hands. I walk her up the street, she remembers she can't walk in heels. I started to explain why, but fuck it, she can't hear anything, *she's in shock Boone, get her inside*. What the hell am I doing? I told her to stand, nicely, I offered her a meek smile, and apologized for what she had seen and what I had to do. I puke in the sink, maybe some got on my shoes. I do it with my closed, I'm not sure if I wanna look at the guy who looks back at me above the sink.
