‘ …and we'll have an interview with him and his prize marrow at around a quarter to eight. ’
The daily news blares over the radio. Just another Monday morning. I turn over in bed. The time is six-fifty-five, and this is BBC Southern Counties Radio. Light rolls through the curtains. The world is waking up. I like it that way. My flatmates stirring in their rooms. Minutes pass, and I hear all the familiar sound. Cars on the road outside. Every morning the chill startles me awake. I open the curtains, look out onto the street. I pick it up, scrutinise it. I struggle out from my cocoon of blankets and into the cold of my bedroom. Someone glances up at my window, and hurriedly looks away as they realise I'm half naked. Every night I open the my window, to let the night in. The usual crowd waltz down the street, going wherever it is they go. I don't remember writing this. My name is written on it, in my own handwriting. I open it, and read the words inside. A small, folded piece of paper on the floor. What does it mean? As I walk across the room something crunches underfoot. *Act normally, otherwise they'll notice. *
I'm confused. ‘ Huney, are you ok in there? I really don't recall writing this. My flatmate. ’
I look at the note again. And hesitate. Who are ‘ they ’? The questions are rattled from my head by a knock at my bedroom door. You'll be late.
