My longest relationship was with a man I loved deeply, Indy. He was the complete opposite of me: extraverted, charming, outgoing. It always puzzled me, to say the least, and made me extremely nervous. We stayed together for a couple of years, and, I don't know why, but it really seemed like he had feelings for me. In the end he left me, like they all did. But like I did in other relationships before, I shut him down, rejecting him when I felt my feelings growing to much. Fast forward to yesterday. He was friend with everyone, but still reliable and generous. His condition was critical, and he has asked for me. As such I never committed into relationships, probably by great of having my feelings not reciprocated. I learned later that he was with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of time when we were together. And here I am, a bouquet of flowers in hands, nervously looking for room 68. Kelly calls me, saying that Indy was in the hospital, after being hit by a car. I met other men and women, and it always ended the same way. "Kelly, you're...a wonderful girl but...I...I...I never loved you." I storm in the room, but his eyes are already closed. Forever. I find it, half opened, and take a deep breath to give myself courage, and here Indy's weak voice. The words hit me like a punch.
