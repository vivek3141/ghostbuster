He consistently prioritizes personal pleasure over others' needs, leading to numerous consequences. This essay aims to explore Ignatius' traits of self-indulgence, arrogance, and deceit, while analyzing their impact on his ability to fit into his community. Ignatius exhibits various telltale signs, making the argument plausible. Clear examples of this can be found in his constant consumption of hot dogs or his refusal to engage in productive employment. Arrogance:
Arrogance serves as a prominent feature of Ignatius J. Reilly's character. Self-Indulgence:
 
Ignatius J. Reilly is notorious for indulging in his own desires and disregarding societal norms or expectations. His arrogance is evident in his interactions with his mother, his colleagues, and even the police officer named Patrolman Mancuso. Ignatius' excessive eating habits, his disgust towards work, and his resistance to conforming to society's expectations exemplify his self-indulgence. Ignatius' dishonesty is exemplified through his interactions with his mother, Irene, as he endeavors to con her into supporting his extravagant lifestyle. His inflated sense of superiority and intellectualism often leads him to look down upon others. III. He consistently manipulates others to serve his own interests, displaying a lack of regard for their well-being or feelings. Ignatius believes himself to be a misunderstood genius, dismissing the intellectual capacities of those around him. Deceit:
Ignatius' character demonstrates profound deceitfulness, manifesting in various forms. His self-indulgence, arrogance, and deceitfulness contribute to his isolation and inability to form meaningful connections with others. His unwillingness to conform to societal norms and expectations exacerbates his struggles. Such behavior alienates Ignatius from his community and perpetuates his difficulties in fitting in. IV. His deceitful actions lead to strained relationships, broken trust, and further isolation from the community that surrounds him. Other Factors at Play:

However, it is important to remember that Ignatius is a fictional character and that additional factors contribute to his distinctive portrayal. VI. His indulgence in personal desires, arrogance, and deceitful behavior consistently isolate him from his community, hindering his ability to fit in. As a result, Ignatius becomes a loner, detached from the vibrant community of New Orleans that he inhabits. The novel's exaggerated comedic style and satirical commentary further complicate Ignatius' portrayal, potentially misleading a purely clinical interpretation. Conclusion:
In A Confederacy of Dunces, Ignatius J. Reilly epitomizes a character with antisocial personality disorder. Ignatius' own mental health issues, such as his extreme introversion and his failure to adapt to change, contribute to his social difficulties.
