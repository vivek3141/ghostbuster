It reflects what is just about to happen. Either I am the only one who hears it, or everyone does and no one ever talks about it. I love the music. It has saved me from more than a few relationships that would have been unsavory. I have two theories about the music. There was one moment whereâ€¦ One moment where the sound was deafening. Music is a very personal thing after all. I turned on the news to watch while eating breakfast, as I always do. Normally, the music is always at a comfortable level, unless it is trying to warn me of something dire. Which is fine. "The World Trade Centers have been hit." It just crescendoing until the newscaster spoke. But that morning it didn't change. There was a rising crescendo ever since I woke up that morning. Usually the music goes back and forth between dramatic and more more lulling, depending on the news break about to come up. I dropped my fork. The ting of it hitting the table was all I could hear. For the first time, ever, my world had gone quiet. A long, low clarinet played. As I watched the events unfold, the music continued to be silent. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again. Something sad, but hopeful. And then other instruments slowly joined it. It was playing as I was heading out the door to go to my Red Cross to see what I could do to help.
