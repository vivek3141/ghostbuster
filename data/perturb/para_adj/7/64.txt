Stanley walked up the stairs to his boss' office.
Stanley walked into his boss' office as soon as the door opened.
Stanley knowing a shorter path went into the elevator and pressed the button 3, to his bosses office.
Well then, let me show you a video on obedience.
No, that can't be right, Stanley, you can't just plug in the vacuum cleaner, that's not in the script.
However, all hope is not lost, now just walk to the boss' office!
What's that I hear, you're a real person?
Oh, let's see everything in this elevator is broken.
I guess I can only delete this project of mine.
Goodbye, Stanley.
Oh, you refuse, well now look, this entire thing is broken, all my hours of work, destroyed by you, you careless jerk.
