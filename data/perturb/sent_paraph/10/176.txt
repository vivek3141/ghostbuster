You own a magical camera that reveals the true value of objects through its lens, just like a thermal camera, but instead of heat, it showcases their worth. Rings and jewelry burn bright, signifying their immense value. Plastic waste is hard to see. You've always been cautious never to view a person through it. Until today. Curiosity gets the better of you, and you cautiously aim the camera at yourself. It makes you sad to see your reflection. It's time for a change when you realize how little you value yourself.
