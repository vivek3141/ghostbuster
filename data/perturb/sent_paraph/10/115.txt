The clothing industry is amongst the many monopolistically competitive industries. Many clothing firms are competing. Firms in the industry earn competitive advantages by differentiating their products. Product differentiation is one of the strategies commonly used by monopolistic competitive firms. Product differentiation in a clothing firm can involve designs, the quality of materials used, and the prices charged for the clothes. In advertisements, there are physical aspects such as color, designs, elastic, and different sizes. Money back, high quality, free delivery, and long- lasting usage are some of the intangible aspects included in the clothing advertisement. Steel manufacturing is an example of an oligopolistic competitive industry. A few steel manufacturing companies rule in the market. The few firms are the price and trendsetters for other small companies and often form a partnership to operate successfully (Ritz 185). To differentiate themselves from their competitors, they improve their product quality, hike or lower prices, and advertise their special features. In an oligopolistic market, if a leading company lowers prices, the others do not follow but rather improve their products to remain in the higher cuts of prices (Ritz 187). The leading companies set high standards to prevent easy entry into the industry. The firms set high standards by producing the highest quality products, selling them at a higher price, and producing them in high quantities (Ritz 189). They ensure that the small or new companies fear the competition at the top so they don't enter the industry.
