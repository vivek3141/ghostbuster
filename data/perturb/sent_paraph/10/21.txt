The end of the Great Depression was helped by the acts and laws of President Franklin Roosevelt. Roosevelt brought about social and economic change that helped restore the nation's stability. Immigrants faced discrimination during the Great Depression. To address this issue, President Roosevelt signed the National Origins Act of 1934, which abolished discriminatory quotas based on nationality. This act ensured fair treatment of immigrants and promoted equality. The New Deal intended to provide work opportunities, housing, and education for millions of young unemployed men, many of whom were immigrants. The CCC gave them a sense of belonging and hope for a better future by putting food on their tables. African Americans, who were disproportionately affected by economic disparities and racial discrimination, also benefited from Roosevelt’s policies. His administration established the National Youth Administration (NYA), which provided jobs and educational opportunities for young African Americans. In addition, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) employed thousands of African American workers, allowing them to contribute to the nation's infrastructure while earning a living. Roosevelt supported the establishment of fair labor practices and ensured that they were included in the New Deal programs. Workers, who were at the epicenter of the economic crisis, witnessed significant improvements due to Roosevelt’s intervention. He passed the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), which guaranteed workers the right to join unions and engage in collective bargaining. Minimum wage laws and limits on working hours were introduced by the Fair Labor Standards Act. In conclusion, President Franklin Roosevelt’s acts and laws had a transformative impact on the nation’s recovery from the Great Depression. His New Deal programs, including the National Origins Act, CCC, NYA, WPA, NIRA, and FLSA, were instrumental in providing relief, economic opportunities, and social reforms. The initiatives played a crucial role in improving the lives of immigrants, African Americans, and workers, ultimately bringing about a significant societal change and setting the foundation for a more inclusive and prosperous America.
