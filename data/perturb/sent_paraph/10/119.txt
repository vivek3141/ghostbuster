Deductive reasoning involves the construction and development of cause-and-effect solid relationships. The idea of how a point will affect the future is connected to two facts. The first, the second, and the conclusion are included in a judgment. In logic, an argument is valid only when it has a form that makes it impossible for the premises to be correct and the judgment to be wrong. According to the explained three types of deductive arguments, a valid statement does not need to have actually trustworthy premises. It needs to have those that will guarantee that the conclusion is correct. Example:
 1. All metals are heavy
 2. Tin is a metal
 3. Tin is heavy
A sound argument must have both a valid form and true premises. Valid arguments can be unsound, but they will have wrong assumptions. 1 is an example. Dogs and cats are the same species. The mice are not dogs. All mice are cats
What makes this a valid statement is not that it has trustworthy premises and a proper conclusion but the logical necessity of the judgment, given the two assumptions. The argument would be just as valid if the premises and conclusion were wrong. The purpose of argument is to establish the truth of a judgement. An invalid argument does not achieve this goal, so it cannot be considered sound (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). A sound argument can be valid in all cases. If the argument is invalid, then the beliefs thoroughly do not matter, and, in fact, only the conclusion remains. Therefore, this means that there is no argument in this case, especially a sound one.
