I asked for forgiveness from the statues. Sometimes life makes you do things you wouldn't normally do. What I've done in life cannot be undone, a mothers have lost sons, sisters have lost brothers and kids have lost their dads. I am not a bad person, but I have made a mistake. I MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE I don't regret taking the life of a criminal who didn't belong, I'm 52 now and coming close to my last few years in this life. I hunt evil people who've caused misery to communities and I believe I've done the right thing so far. I got up from my knees and left my family's church. When I took the last step onto the sidewalk, I felt the barrel of the gun being pressed against the back of my head. I didn't process what was happening because it had never happened. When the loud bang rang through the streets, I almost heard the finger on the gun tighten. All I had was 7 seconds before I saw black and felt my body tensing and going into shock. I hope they serve tequila in hell.
