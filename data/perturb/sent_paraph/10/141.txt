Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada ended their earnings season on Thursday with record profits. The six banks made a combined profit of $6.26 billion in the fiscal year that ended in October. Growing public anger over high service charges and credit card rates led to a third straight year of record profits. Bank officials defended the group's performance, saying that millions of Canadians owned bank shares through mutual funds and pension plans. Shareholders of four of the six banks were rewarded with healthy dividend hikes this year. "Our activities mean jobs, investment, tax revenue, dividend payments and foreign income for Canada's economy," Al Flood said after the bank reported a 35 percent jump in net income on Thursday. CIBC, Canada's second-largest bank, said net income climbed to C$1.36 billion ($1 billion) in fiscal 1996 from C$1.01 billion ($743 million) in 1995. The second increase in 1996, CIBC boosted its quarterly dividend by C5 cents to C50 cents. Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Royal Bank of Canada raised their payouts. Royal Bank, Canada's largest bank, reported the highest corporate profit in Canadian history on Wednesday, with 1996 net income rising 13 percent to C$1.43 billion ($1.05 billion). Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal cracked the billion-dollar barrier this year, joining CIBC and Royal Bank, which crossed the threshold in 1995 and 1994 respectively. National Bank had a 30 percent jump in net income to C$318 million this year. The banks attributed their performances to lower credit losses and healthy commercial and personal banking. Financial markets soared in 1996 as investment banking, brokerage and mutual fund businesses enjoyed a banner year. Earnings at CIBC's Wood Gundy Inc. investment arm skyrocketed 122 percent to C$528 million ($389 million) in 1996. The group's earnings and dividend hikes were in line or slightly better than analysts' forecasts. Hugh Brown, a banking analyst with Nesbitt Burns Inc., said he had a more positive outlook for bank earnings in 1997, saying Big Six profits may grow between 9 and 10 percent next. Bank stocks, which have led the Toronto Stock Exchange to new heights since September, fell on Thursday in tandem with the rest of the market. CIBC led the decline, dropping C$2.50 ($1.84) to close at C$57 ($42) in brisk trading.
