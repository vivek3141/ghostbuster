The Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System is expected to vote early Friday on expanding banks' non-banking activities. The Fed is expected to vote to allow banks' section 20 subsidiaries to derive 25 percent of their revenue from non-banking activities such as securities underwriting, up from the current 10 percent ceiling. The section 20 proposal was released for comment in July, but since then another bank regulator has stolen some of the Fed's thunder. Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig said his office will begin approving bank affiliates moving into an assortment of non-banking businesses. The Fed's proposal and the Comptroller's actions will increase the pressure on Congress to scrap the Glass-Steagall Act. Banks used to lead the charge to change the law because they wanted to get into other businesses. The banks were opposed by insurance companies and securities firms. The tables have been turned. "But it's not a two-way street. Other industries want to level the playing field. Current market realities are reflected in both moves. The financial services industry is merging. Mutual funds already offer checking account-like money market funds and some of the leading stock and bond underwriters are commercial banks. In the words of one top regulator, the Fed's move from 10 to 25 percent, "is not material." To prevent problems in the subsidiaries from affecting the bank itself, the Fed requires banks to take certain steps. Competitors in other fields fret that the banks insured deposits are a form of government subsidy giving the banks an unfair advantage when they venture into other fields. Comptroller Ludwig disagreed. Speaking to reporters after delivering a speech here Thursday, Ludwig said that walling off the subsidiary "basically eliminates any subsidization." He opposes efforts by some in Congress to keep banks out of certain fields, such as real estate or merchant banking, entirely. He said it was a mistake to set product limits in this day and age.
