I blinked groggily as I awoke to the faint sound of city traffic. Rubbing my eyes, I realized I was no longer in the cozy comfort of my self-driving car. I looked out the window and found myself surrounded by skyscrapers and bustling streets I had never seen before. Panicking, I desperately attempted to recall how I ended up here. Programming my destination on the car's console was the last thing I remembered. But something had clearly gone wrong. I left the vehicle to figure out my current location. The air was filled with unfamiliar scents and the language spoken around me was foreign. I noticed that the futuristic architecture and advanced technologies were centuries ahead of my time. My mind was racing with questions. Where was I? How had I ended up in a time so distant from my own? I thought of my loved ones as I traveled further away from home. Tears welled in my eyes as I yearned for familiarity. There was a glimpse of curiosity within me. I decided to make the most of my journey. With no way back, I resolved to adapt, learn, and perhaps, leave a mark on this astonishing future that had inadvertently become my destination.
