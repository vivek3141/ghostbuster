A new national broadcasting network will be launched by Silver King Communications. The announcement came on the heels of Silver King's acquisition of the Home Shopping Network, a move that will provide the funding necessary to support the company's ambitious plans. Silver King has a network of television stations. However, Diller believes that the time is ripe for a new national broadcasting outlet that will be geared toward a younger, more tech-savvy audience. The new network will feature a mix of original programming and content from other media companies, as well as live events and interactive elements that will be designed to engage viewers in new and exciting ways. As a result of the acquisition of HSN, Silver King will have the financial clout necessary to make its new network a reality. HSN, which is a popular home shopping channel, generates revenue of over $2.5 billion per year. Diller believes that the company can leverage HSN's existing customer base to help promote its new network, which he hopes will be available to viewers across a variety of platforms, including traditional television, streaming services, and social media. "We see a huge opportunity in creating a new type of broadcasting network that is truly designed for the 21st century," Diller said in a statement. "The acquisition of HSN gives us the resources we need to make this vision a reality, and we're excited to get to work building something truly special for viewers across the country." The new network will focus on lifestyle and entertainment content, with an emphasis on technology and innovation. With the acquisition of HSN, Silver King is poised to make a big splash in the world of media and entertainment in the years to come.
