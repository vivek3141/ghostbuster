Stanley walked up the stairs to his boss' office. Stanley went into the elevator and pressed the button to get to his office. Stanley was in his boss' office as soon as the door opened. Stanley, you can't just plug in the vacuum cleaner, that's not in the script. You're a real person, what's that? Let me show you a video about obeying. Oh, let's see everything in this elevator is broken. Go to the boss' office. Oh, you refuse, well now look, this entire thing is broken, all my hours of work, destroyed by you, you careless jerk. I guess I can only delete this project of mine. Stanley, farewell.
