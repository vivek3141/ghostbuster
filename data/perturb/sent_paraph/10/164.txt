Adorno sees media products for children as extensions of capitalist values. Adorno argues that these products, such as children's television shows and movies, are created with the sole purpose of generating profit for corporations. They promote consumerism and encourage children to become passive consumers in a capitalist society. The Marxist critique of capitalism is aligned with this perspective. A prominent example of media products reinforcing capitalist values can be seen in the vast amount of merchandise associated with popular children's franchises. For instance, the success of animated films like the "Frozen" series goes far beyond the box office revenue. It encompasses a wide range of merchandise, including toys, clothing, and accessories. These products are not just meant to entertain children, but also to create demand for consumer goods. Children's desires and preferences are shaped by the media. Contrasting Adorno's perspective, structural functionalism suggests that media products for children serve a more positive function in society. These products fulfill children's educational and development needs, providing them with entertaining and informative content. For instance, educational shows like "Sesame Street" have been praised for their ability to foster learning and social development among children. Moreover, the media also serves to unify society by providing cultural narratives and shared experiences. Positive social contributions of media products are prioritized. The potential benefits for children's growth are the focus of this perspective. According to Adorno's concept of industrial culture, media products for children reinforce capitalist values. The promotional merchandise associated with popular children's franchises emphasize the materialistic nature of the products. However, the perspective of structural functionalism offers a more optimistic view, emphasizing the educational and unifying aspects of media products. While both perspectives recognize capitalist influences in media production, they differ in their evaluation of the overall impact on society and children.
