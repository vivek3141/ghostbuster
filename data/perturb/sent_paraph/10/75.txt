It always puzzled me, to say the least, and made me extremely nervous. As such I never committed into relationships, probably by great of having my feelings not reciprocated. The man I loved the most was Indy. He was the complete opposite of me: extraverted, charming, outgoing. He was friend with everyone, but still reliable and generous. We stayed together for a couple of years, and, I don't know why, but it really seemed like he had feelings for me. I reject him when I feel like I'm in a relationship. In the end he left me, like they all did. He was with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of times when we were together. When I met other men and women, it ended the same way. Fast forward to yesterday. Kelly calls me, saying that Indy was in the hospital, after being hit by a car. He asked for me because his condition was critical. And here I am, a bouquet of flowers in hands, nervously looking for room 68. I find it, half opened, and take a deep breath, and here Indy's weak voice. "Kelly, you're a wonderful girl, but I never loved you." The words hit me like a punch. His eyes are closed as I storm in the room. Forever.
