Finding new animals is no longer possible due to the wide variety of species and the news about the species that are on the verge of extinction due to the impact of the changes in the environment. However, new species are still discovered regularly, the recent incredible find being an example of that. The fuzzy orange bat is a new species this year. Having orange fur with black pigmentation, Nimba Myotis represents a rather unusual specimen of bats. The animal prefers natural caves as the place where it lives and rests. Like other bats, Nimba Myotis uses laryngeal echolocation as the means of identifying and catching prey in the dark. The diet of the species is mostly unknown due to being under researched. The bat is a unique specimen. The species belongs to the animal kingdom, particularly, to mammals of the Chiroptera order and the Vespertilionidae family (Simmons et al., 2021). The main rationale for placing it in the animal kingdom is the fact that Nimba Myotis is a mammal. Additionally, the specified species reproduces sexually, unlike members of other kingdoms, and is multicellular (Simmons et al., 2021). The fact that cells in Nimba Myotis do not have cell walls allows it to be classified as an animal kingdom species. Therefore, the bat should be defined as an animal, particularly, a mammal. Being a bat, Nimba Myotis is the largest order in the mammal class after rodents. The discovery of Nimba Myotis has shed a lot of light on the species of bats.
