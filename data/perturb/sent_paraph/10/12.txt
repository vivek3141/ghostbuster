An overview of other literature on methodologies and criteria used in supplier evaluation and selection process is one of the vital components of a successful operation of a manufacturing company. In particular, the paper emphasized the industry’s change in this field – from focusing primarily on operational efficiency to embracing the potential of strategic partnerships. According to the article, the right approach to supplier assessment is the key to a company's progress. The paper starts with various ways to address the issues related to MCDM of suppliers’ selection. The most common ones are stated to be mathematical models, Simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART), analytic network process (ANP), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), data envelopment analysis (DEA), linear programming, and some others. For example, DEA is a methodology focused on a supplier system and classifies it either as efficient or inefficient based on selecting particular criteria. One can use mathematical programming models to compare suppliers and identify the most optimal in terms of cost and other criteria. The popularity of methodologies in the literature is compared by the article. DEA is the most common approach with 30% mentions, followed by mathematical programming, AHP, and case-based reasoning. The largest share of MCDM approaches are those methodologies. The importance of knowing this distribution is highlighted in the article, which can build an idea of the most prominent ways to address the issues with suppliers assessment and selection. It is also stated that suppliers should be evaluated based on “the inputs of the strategic, functional and operational levels” (Agarwal et al., 2011). The most optimal suppliers can be identified with the use of Methodologies such as DEA, mathematical programming, or AHP.
