Foreign companies will be allowed to play a bigger role in the country's power sector. This move is part of the government's ongoing efforts to open up its economy to foreign investment. The State Council, China's cabinet, has approved a draft policy that would allow foreign companies to operate and own a majority stake in power transmission and distribution projects in the country. The current policy limits foreign ownership to a maximum of 49%. Foreign companies will also be allowed to invest in and operate power generation projects in the country, which was previously restricted to domestic firms. Foreign firms want to invest in China's energy sector because of the country's rapid economic development. Tensions are growing between China and the US. The Trump administration wants China to open up its markets to US companies and address issues such as intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer. China has been taking steps to address these concerns, including announcing plans to lift restrictions on foreign ownership in a number of sectors, including finance, automotive, and telecommunications. The move to allow foreign firms to take a bigger role in the power sector is seen as a continuation of these efforts. The policy change is also in line with China's long-term goal of reducing its dependence on fossil fuels and increasing investment in renewable energy. The country is already the world's largest market for solar and wind power, and the new policy is expected to further boost investment in these areas. China is likely to oppose the move to allow more foreign investment in the power sector. Some domestic firms argue that this could lead to increased competition, while others worry about national security. Nevertheless, the move is seen as a positive development for foreign companies seeking to invest in China. It is also seen as a signal that China is committed to opening up its economy and playing a more active role in the global market.
