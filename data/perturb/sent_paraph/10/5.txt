Level 49 Paladin was walking through this wall-things all day to get to grips with his prowess. Wow kids, don't let the boogey man boogie in your closet, you must have forgot to lock it, parents with a pocket full of apocalypse and a head full of spaces. Another jesus bracelet broke, another spirit invoked, hold on to hope so faith can poke it's head into the realm of the dead. I watch a child teeter on the edge, hold hands with me and the rest of your invisible friends. It's better to break than continue to bend, snap your soul in two and let it heal. What did I see? What was it truly doing what it did? What was hidden inside of my mind projected or reality neglected...Something segmented and crittering beneath the flowboards of the Trojan horse awoke my paralysis through the sacred doors. War of the world's, obsolete factions matching gains and comparing beef-sticks, equipped to rip shit like weaklings. Trust in the sky and the stars will align as you try not to feel intangibles. I ain't no judge, I ain't no jury, I'm just a boy walkin with a vision too blurry to comprehend foe from friend and trend but I can close my eyes and count to ten.
