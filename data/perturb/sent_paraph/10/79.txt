The course of history was changed by the self-immolation of Thich Quang Duc on June 11, 1963. The Burning Monk has become a universal symbol of rebellion and the fight against injustice. His death was reduced to a symbol. It was an act of defiance against a corrupt government that had killed its citizens. It sparked a revolution, overthrew the regime, and may even have caused the Americans to enter the Vietnam War. However, the monk himself most likely did not die for revolutionary ideas. He self-immolated because he couldn't deal with injustice and rejection of the system. Tunisian street vendor Mohammed Bouazizi set himself on fire in protest against harassment by local officials. The desperate act of the young man caused mass street protests in the city. The rioters demanded the resignation of President Ben Ali. His political regime faced long-term economic and social problems, resulting in unemployment, mostly among young people. Mohammed Bouazizi became a symbol of the Arab Spring when he gained followers in Tunisia and other countries. Some of the self-immolations played an important role in the political events of the country in which they took place. The actions of both men can hardly be called a specific call for revolution. The cases are considered to be an extreme measure of disagreement with injustice. It seems that the men have no other means left for the official authorities to hear them. Both events had a significant impact on the course of history.
