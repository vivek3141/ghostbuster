I have to write something for the first 3-panel, Character 1 - what do you think about the fence on the roof? The second character is supposed to stop people from falling. [2]
Character 1 - Would a fence really stop someone bent on killing themselves? Maybe they can use a different building. They don't want it to be their problem. Maybe they wouldn't need the fence anymore if someone did that.
