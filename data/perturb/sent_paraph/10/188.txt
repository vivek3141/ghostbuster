Digital forensics tools make it easy to conduct the necessary technical analyses. One of the most famous software programs for digital forensics is Autopsy, a toolkit that examines the images present on a deviceâ€™s hard drive. Capable of interacting with personal computers and smartphones, Autopsy is highly versatile and contains several functions for properly investigating the image files present on the storage unit ( Autopsy , n.d.). Specifically, Autopsy allows viewing graphical information stored on the device, searching the repository for specific items, or extracting the data ( Autopsy , n.d.). Although this software is distributed freely, it remains an excellent tool for forensic analysis and is continuously updated to follow technological advances. Digital forensics software is created to look at a particular system. The Windows operating system and its registry are explored in the instrument. A lot of information about the applications installed and data processed can be found in a Windows registry. However, this software is produced commercially, it cannot be obtained free of charge, and $65 a month or $756 a year must be paid to receive access. Finally, unique programs are required when working with a smartphone system. Cellebrite UFED is a method used to retrieve data from mobile devices. Cellebrite UFED has a range of functions to remove the phone's security measures and access the information stored in the internal storage or on external cards. Nevertheless, the software can only be purchased for particular purposes, with prices starting at $2499.
