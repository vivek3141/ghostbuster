It all happened so suddenly. I couldn't see anyone else as my feet hit the rubble. The bodies of the people who didn't make it were crunched up into corners. It would make you cough and make you light headed if you accidentally walked into a patch of thick white smoke. But long time exposure could leave the person unable to move and they would eventually go insane, stuck sitting down occasionally laughing. Who thought legalising weed would do this?
