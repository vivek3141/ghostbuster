The initial public offering of the Halifax Building Society could be worth as much as 20 billion pounds. It will be the largest extension of private share ownership ever witnessed in the UK, according to the chief executive of the society. If the IPO had taken place on December 16, the share price would have been between 490 and 450 pence. Analysts expect the final outcome to be at the top end of the range given the recent positive performance of the most comparable stock in the market. "The valuation of 12 billion (pounds) is right in line with our expectations," said Peter Toeman, banking analyst at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett. Friday's figures looked conservative, but other analysts think the price will go up. The Halifax said each qualifying member will receive a basic allocation of 200 shares in a flotation of 2.675 billion shares. The Halifax has 6.7 million investing members and two million borrowing members. The Society is sending out a total of around 8.0 million voting packs. Investing members will also get a variable share allocation depending on how much money they had in their accounts on particular dates. The maximum number of shares will be between 200 and 1,181 for those with more than 50,000 pounds. If less than half of the investing members vote in favor of the proposal, it will fail. The society has started a huge advertising campaign to encourage members to vote. The Halifax is expected to be in the top 20 companies by market capitalisation in the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip firms and is sure to threaten Abbey's position as Britain's fifth-largest publicly-owned bank. It said it sees room for huge expansion in the British insurance and long-term savings sectors.
