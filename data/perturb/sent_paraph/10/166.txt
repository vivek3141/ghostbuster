Lear Corp. has announced the acquisition of Borealis Industrier AB, a Swedish automotive interior systems provider, to create a truly comprehensive offering for automakers worldwide. The deal, which is expected to close within the next few months, will see Lear Corp. take full control of the privately-held company, adding to its already impressive portfolio of automotive components and electronics. With the acquisition of Borealis, the company wants to provide a complete solution for automakers, including everything from seating systems and electronics to complete interior solutions. This move follows a successful year for Lear Corp., who have enjoyed solid demand across all of their product categories. Over the years, Borealis has been an excellent partner for Lear Corp., working closely together to provide innovative interior solutions that meet the unique needs of each automotive customer. A streamlined and efficient experience will be created by the integration of Borealis' design, engineering, and manufacturing capabilities into its own operations. The acquisition of Borealis also means that Lear Corp. will be able to offer customers a wider range of colors, materials, and finishes for their automotive interiors. The company has already indicated that it will be investing heavily in its manufacturing facilities in Sweden, giving it access to state-of-the-art equipment and processes that will further streamline its operations and improve output quality. In announcing the acquisition, Ray Scott said that the move would grow the company's presence in the automotive interiors market and support its ongoing efforts to provide customers with innovative products that are safe, sustainable, and affordable. The quality, reliability, and innovation that they demand are what Lear Corp. is well-equipped to deliver.
