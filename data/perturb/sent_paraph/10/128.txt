I enjoy the music. It reflects what is just about to happen. It has saved me from more than a few relationships that would have been unsavory. There are two theories about the music. Either I am the only one who hears it, or everyone does and no one ever talks about it. Which is fine. Music is a very personal thing. Unless it is trying to warn me of something dire, the music is usually at a comfortable level. There was one moment whereâ€¦ One moment where the sound was deafening. There was a rising crescendo ever since I woke up that morning. I always watch the news while eating breakfast. Usually the music goes back and forth between dramatic and more more lulling, depending on the news break about to come up. But that morning it didn't change. It just crescendoing until the newscaster spoke. The World Trade Centers have been hit. I dropped my fork. The ting of it hitting the table was all I could hear. For the first time, my world went quiet. As I watched the events unfold, the music continued to be silent. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again. A clarinet is played. And then other instruments slowly joined it. Something sad, but hopeful. It was playing as I was heading out the door to go to my Red Cross to see what I could do to help.
