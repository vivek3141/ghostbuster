China is planning to build bigger rockets that can accommodate heavier satellites. The move is part of China's growing push to become a major player in the commercial space industry. The country's current flagship rocket, the Long March 5, has a 22-tonne capacity. The new rockets will be able to launch multiple satellites at once, allowing China to compete with established commercial space companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. Speaking about the plans, Zhou Yanfei, deputy chief engineer at the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), said: "The heavier rocket will provide stronger lift capability for space missions. The demand for rocket launch services in China is growing. The announcement comes just months after China launched a successful mission to the far side of the moon, a feat achieved by no other country before. The mission, which involved landing a rover on the moon's surface, marked a significant step forward in China's ambitious space program. China is also planning to build its own space station, which is set to launch in 2022. The station will be capable of accommodating three astronauts for up to six months at a time and will be used to conduct scientific research in areas such as astronomy, space medicine, and space physics. However, China's space ambitions have not been without controversy. The country has been accused of engaging in space militarization, with some experts expressing concerns over the development of anti-satellite weapons. China has denied these allegations, stating that its space program is purely for peaceful purposes. Nevertheless, the country's growing space capabilities have raised concerns among U.S. policymakers, who see China as a potential rival in the global space race. China's plans to build bigger rockets could affect the global space industry. With China entering the market, established players may face increased competition, potentially driving down prices and increasing innovation in the sector. However, some experts have raised concerns over the environmental impact of increased rocket launches. The process of launching rockets into space can have a significant impact on the environment, with exhaust pollution contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful pollutants. There are calls for the space industry to develop more eco-friendly launch systems. One potential solution is the use of electric rockets, which would significantly reduce emissions and pollution associated with traditional rocket launches. Despite these concerns, China's plans to build bigger rockets for the commercial satellite market are likely to have significant implications for the global space industry. With China rapidly expanding its space capabilities, the country is set to become a major player in the sector, posing potential challenges and opportunities for established players and the wider industry as a whole.
