I sat in the dimly lit interrogation room, surrounded by detectives, as the cold metal handcuffs dug into my wrists. For years, I had eluded them, leaving behind a wave of blood-soaked clues that challenged their expertise. But tonight, they finally caught up with me - the infamous serial killer known as "The Nightshade". I couldn't help but smirk at the irony. With a glimmer of satisfaction in their eyes, the detectives asked me to recount my first kill. The room fell silent as my mind wandered back to that fateful night. I was desperate for revenge against the world that had betrayed me. Her name was Emily. She was my first victim and the catalyst for the darkness within me to awaken. I had watched her from afar, learning her routine, her vulnerabilities. That night, I carefully orchestrated my entrance into her life. As she slept, I raised the blade. My hand trembled with a mix of fear and exhilaration as the steel kissed her skin. I know I held her life in my hands because of the power in my veins. In that moment, I saw her life force escape her body, extinguished by my hand. The feeling was overwhelming. The detectives were horrified by my twisted tale. They had hoped for redemption, repentance maybe even reason. They discovered that there is no redemption for me when I recounted my first kill. In my eyes, they could see the emptiness—a void that hungered still—for blood, death, and the thrill of the hunt.
