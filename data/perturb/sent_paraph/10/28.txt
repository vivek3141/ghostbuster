A gunshot rang out, shaking the very foundations of Sasha's world. The sound of exploding gunpowder was something normal. She didn't hold her lover's dying form in her own arms. She had treated gun wounds on the field before, saved lives with her work but now she found her hands shaking and struggling to even call emergency services. It was not certain that the ambulance would make it to the hospital on time. Tell me a story! She put her chin into the crook of her hand. Do you have a story about where your name came from? A long time ago there was a young girl, only just out of high school, who had gotten it in her head that she wanted to join the military.
