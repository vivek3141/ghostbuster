I have to write something for the first 3-panel, Character 1 - what do you think about the fence on the roof? Character 2 - Stop people from falling, or suicide I suppose. [2]
Character 1 - Would a fence really stop someone bent on killing themselves? Character 2 - No, maybe get 'em to use a different building though. They just don't want it to be their problem to deal with. Maybe if someone did, they wouldn't need the fences anymore.
