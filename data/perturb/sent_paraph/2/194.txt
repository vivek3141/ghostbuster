According to industry analysts, semiconductor stocks are set for a comeback as double-digit growth returns. After a slump earlier this year, semiconductor companies have shown strong gains in Q3, with stocks like NVIDIA and Intel seeing huge jumps. With high demand for electronics, this growth is expected to continue into the end of the year. Increased use of chips in automobiles and the growth of 5G technology are some of the factors contributing to the growth. Investors are urged to keep an eye on the sector and consider investing in semiconductor stocks.
