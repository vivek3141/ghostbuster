I have to write something for the first 3-panel, Character 1 - what do you think about the fence on the roof? People are supposed to be stopped from falling by the second character. Would a fence stop someone from committing suicide? Maybe get them to use a different building. They don't want it to be their problem. [3] Character 2 has walked off screen
Character 1 - Maybe if someone did, they wouldn't need the fences anymore...
