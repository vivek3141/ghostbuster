President Franklin Roosevelt’s acts and laws played a crucial role in ending the Great Depression and significantly improving the situation for certain marginalized groups of the population, including immigrants, African Americans, and workers. Roosevelt brought about social and economic change that helped restore the nation's stability and spurred progress. During the Great Depression, immigrants faced immense hardships and discrimination. The National Origins Act of 1934 was signed by President Roosevelt to address this issue. This act ensured fair treatment of immigrants and promoted equality. The New Deal intended to provide work opportunities, housing, and education for millions of young unemployed men, many of whom were immigrants. The CCC not only put food on their tables but also gave them a sense of belonging and hope for a better future. Roosevelt's policies helped African Americans who were disproportionately affected by economic disparity and racial discrimination. The National Youth Administration was established to give jobs and educational opportunities to young African Americans. In addition, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) employed thousands of African American workers, allowing them to contribute to the nation's infrastructure while earning a living. Roosevelt understood the importance of economic opportunities for African Americans and actively supported the establishment of fair labor practices, ensuring that they were included in the New Deal programs. Workers, who were at the epicenter of the economic crisis, witnessed significant improvements due to Roosevelt’s intervention. He passed the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), which guaranteed workers the right to join unions and engage in collective bargaining. Minimum wage laws and limits on working hours were introduced by the Fair Labor Standards Act. The nation's recovery from the Great Depression was impacted by President Franklin Roosevelt's acts and laws. His New Deal programs, including the National Origins Act, CCC, NYA, WPA, NIRA, and FLSA, were instrumental in providing relief, economic opportunities, and social reforms. The initiatives played a crucial role in improving the lives of immigrants, African Americans, and workers, ultimately bringing about a significant societal change and setting the foundation for a more inclusive and prosperous America.
