I was terrified as my roommate shook me awake. "There's no time! We have to go!" He exclaimed quickly. I was confused and asked for clarification. His eyes widened in fear as he responded, "There's no time! I woke up today and time doesn't exist anymore!" His words held an air of truth despite my disbelief. With a knot in my stomach, we rushed outside. The world was trapped in an eternal moment. We had no choice but to leave.
