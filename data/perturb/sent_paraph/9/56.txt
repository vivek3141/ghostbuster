Colombia has long been a hub for drug trafficking, but the country is taking steps to crack down on the issue by overturning its extradition ban. The move is facing backlash from drug traffickers who are seeking to prevent the extradition of their associates. The ban was put in place in the 1990s as a way to protect the country's sovereignty. However, it has since become a roadblock in the fight against drug trafficking. Colombian authorities have found it difficult to prosecute drug traffickers who flee the country when they are under investigation. The current administration led by President Ivan Duque has been pushing for the ban to be overturned. The country's top court approved the move to extradite people who are wanted in other countries for drug dealing. Drug trafficking organizations in the country have responded with force. Just this week, a car bomb exploded in the capital of Bogota, killing several people and injuring dozens more. The attack has been linked to a group known as the National Liberation Army, which is believed to have ties to drug trafficking. Colombia has long struggled with drug trafficking, which has fueled violence and corruption in the country. The government has made strides in recent years to combat the issue, but it is an ongoing battle. It is seen as a crucial step in the fight against drug traffickers. The government hopes it will encourage drug traffickers to think twice before engaging in illegal activities. The move is controversial. Some critics argue that it could lead to a destabilization of the country. They say that drug traffickers will seek revenge on those who cooperate with authorities, and that it could lead to an escalation of violence. President Duque has made it clear that he is not backing down. He sees the move as a way to send a message to drug traffickers that their reign of terror is over. He said that drug traffickers will not be allowed to operate with impunity. "This is a critical step in our fight against drug trafficking, and we will do whatever it takes to bring those responsible to justice." Many in the international community see the move as a bold step in the fight against drug traffickers. The United States has provided funding and resources to help fight the issue. Colombia is making progress in its fight against drug trafficking, but it is clear that there is still a long way to go. The government's decision to lift the extradition ban is a positive step, but it is also one that comes with risks. The country will need to remain vigilant as it takes on this difficult task.
