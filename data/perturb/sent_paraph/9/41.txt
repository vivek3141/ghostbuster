Budgetary control can be made effective with an organizational structure. Permanent specific concerns, such as a finance committee and a budget director, should be established. To avoid bottlenecks, budget planning must be well integrated. Budgets for individuals should be harmonized with each other. Budgets must be reviewed on a regular basis to make sure they don't end up with a license to spend the entire authorized amount. According to Dauda (2019), “business organizations of all types must engage in financial planning at whatever level to ensure judicious deployment of resources for achieving organisational goals.” Workers should be appropriately compensated for performance in accordance with the budget. Sloppy staff, on the other hand, should not go condemned. Behavioral Aspects of Budgetary Control
Budgetary control is a crucial instrument for performance evaluation. It takes time for findings to appear. The person in charge of fiscal control should have a lot of knowledge. Workers are modifying their working practices, routines, and even their inter-relationships based on finances. As a result, workers may exhibit reluctance to change. The creation of each budget is supported by top leadership. There is a formal structure for each employee's requirements. If this is the case, they will be aware of their power and responsibilities, which will be valuable for budgetary management. The organization's objectives determine the effectiveness of a financial management program. Management should exercise caution when setting targets. Furthermore, the aims are explicit.
