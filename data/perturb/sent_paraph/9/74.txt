"Breaking news! 84 people were killed in an attack on a British police station. It's not known if there are any survivors, but it's known that several of the dead were killed by their own leader, Nailuch uc. He turned off the television as the newsman talked about the many he had killed. He was not a normal human. He was a powerful figure, practically a God, able to kill practically anyone, but he could not control himself. He had killed 20 of his best men because there were only 64 cops in that Northern Irish station. "Oh well" he said to himself as he approached the doorway, "It doesn't matter how many I killed, what matters is that no one sees the true point of today." he knocked on the door as he made sure the silencer was fastened firmly on his 1895 Nagant revolver, he'd need to be quiet. Hello, Mr. Barmington!" He asked, "Who are you?" the MP replied
"That's not important" He raised his weapon and fired two shots into the MP's chest, the once into his head for good measure. "If only you could have lived to see how important your death is for our people's freedom"
