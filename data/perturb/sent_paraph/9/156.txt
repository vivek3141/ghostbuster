Are you ready yet? I'm about to leave!" "Yeah, I just need to find my keys in this mess.. Do you want to me to follow?" She asks as she rummages through her purse. That's fine. It's important to be careful behind the wheel. See you in a bit sis!" I get in my car and buckle up. We're older and I don't like these drives. There used to be a time when I could just pick up my little sister from moms and we can drive together, be there at the same time, not have to worry about traffic or work. But then again, there used to be a time before that...when my parents were together. *sigh* Nothing we can do now huh.. Landon st. left and, what was it, Jefferson Rd right? I look at the rearview more than the road. I don't like driving. Damn, that new red mustang looks awesome...seems to be going a bit too fast too....
Oh god,
Please
I look back the the rearview, slow down sis...This guy seems to be either stupid or dru - before I can look back again I hear the sound of glass shattering and metal grinding against itself, breaks screeching. No, no, no...
