In Adorno's concept of industrial culture, media products for children are seen as extensions of capitalist values. Children's television shows and movies are created with the sole purpose of generating profit for corporations according to Adorno. Children are encouraged to become passive consumers in a capitalist society. This perspective aligns with the Marxist critique of capitalism. A prominent example of media products reinforcing capitalist values can be seen in the vast amount of merchandise associated with popular children's franchises. The success of animated films like the "Frozen" series goes far beyond box office revenue. It encompasses a wide range of merchandise, including toys, clothing, and accessories. The purpose of these products is to create demand for consumer goods. The media plays a significant role in shaping children's desires and preferences, deliberately promoting consumer culture. Contrasting Adorno's perspective, structural functionalism suggests that media products for children serve a more positive function in society. These products fulfill children's educational and development needs, providing them with entertaining and informative content. For instance, educational shows like "Sesame Street" have been praised for their ability to foster learning and social development among children. Cultural narratives and shared experiences are provided by the media. The positive social contributions of media products are prioritized by structural functionalism. This perspective tends to focus on the potential benefits for children's growth and the promotion of social cohesion. According to Adorno's concept of industrial culture, media products for children reinforce capitalist values. Examples like the promotional merchandise associated with popular children's franchises emphasize the materialistic nature underlying these products. However, the perspective of structural functionalism offers a more optimistic view, emphasizing the educational and unifying aspects of media products. Both perspectives see capitalist influences in media production, but they don't agree on the impact on society and children.
