She was shaking, I was too, he was dead. I hoped the light was still behind my eyes. I never killed a man before, I never had to save someone before. I didn't feel good, or mighty. She broke, slumped to the ground, her body, a tremor as she sobbed. I dropped the knife, I turned to look at what I had done. She shouted my name through tears. He had so much red on his stomach, his throat was open too. I did that? I did that, I had to. I said as much out loud. Again she shouted my name. I couldn't touch her though. She is so white, and I haven't decided if now I am dark. I didn't feel tainted, my heart was still beating so fast. I took a long hard breath, he is dead and so is his intent, we are alive because I would not allow him to have his way. Again she shouts, but I'm deep in thought. Another long breath. I came to a conclusion. I killed a man today, I beat him to the punch, and I still have to take care of her. I told her to stand, nicely, I offered her a meek smile, and apologized for what she had seen and what I had to do. I started to explain why, but she can't hear anything, so I have to get her inside. I walk her up the street, she remembers she can't walk in heels. She sees the life on my hands, and that sets her off again. We go inside a shitty mexican restaurant. I wash my hands after sitting her down. I do it with my closed, I'm not sure if I wanna look at the guy who looks back at me above the sink. I'm not sure if I wanna be the voice on the phone to the police. I puked in the sink and some may have gotten on my shoes. What am I doing?
