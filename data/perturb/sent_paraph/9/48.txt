General Motor Corp's decision to invest 300 million pounds ($474.9 million) in Vauxhall Motors reflected confidence in its British operation and the international prospects for its Astra model, Vauxhall said on Tuesday. The company said the three-year investment would be used to modernise its Ellesmere Port plant in north-west England, which makes Astra cars and vans. 200 new jobs will be created as a result of the announcement made at the British International Motor Show. Nick Reilly said in an interview that increasing the number of shifts at the plant to three from two could create hundreds more jobs. Any decision, likely to be taken over the next two years, would depend on the market and demand for the model at that time. The Astra model has been consistently one of Britain and Europe's top five sellers since its launch five years ago, with the development of an estate model boosting its position. The 300 million pound investment reflected the transformation of the plant from a domestically oriented plant to a very important source of manufacturing. He predicted strong growth for the Astra in Latin America and Asia Pacific. The British car market is currently the most competitive in Europe, with a number of importers using huge U.K. fleet sales as a way of offloading cars which remain unsold in sluggish domestic markets. Europe remained "flat," he said. He said that the profitablity of the company was going in the right direction after a tough 1995.
