With the current broad variety of species, as well as the emergent news about the species that are on the verge of extinction due to the impact of the changes in the environment, one might believe that discovering new animals is no longer a possibility. The recent incredible find is an example of that. The fuzzy orange bat, also known as the Nimba myotis, is a new species this year. Nimba Myotis is an unusual specimen of bats. The animal prefers natural caves as the place where it lives and rests. Laryngeal echolocation is used by Nimba Myotis to identify and catch prey in the dark. Due to the species being under researched, its diet is mostly unknown. Overall, the bat represents a unique specimen in its class. The species belongs to the animal kingdom, particularly, to mammals of the Chiroptera order and the Vespertilionidae family (Simmons et al., 2021). The main rationale for placing it in the animal kingdom is the fact that Nimba Myotis is a mammal. Additionally, the specified species reproduces sexually, unlike members of other kingdoms, and is multicellular (Simmons et al., 2021). The fact that cells in Nimba Myotis do not have cell walls allows it to be classified as an animal kingdom species. Therefore, the bat should be defined as an animal, particularly, a mammal. Being a bat, Nimba Myotis is the largest order in the mammal class after rodents. The discovery of Nimba Myotis has shed a lot of light on the species of bats.
