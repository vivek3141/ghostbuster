It always puzzled me, to say the least, and made me extremely nervous. As such I never committed into relationships, probably by great of having my feelings not reciprocated. My longest relationship was with a man I loved deeply, Indy. He was the complete opposite of me: extraverted, charming, outgoing. He was friend with everyone, but still reliable and generous. I don't know why we stayed together for a couple of years, but it seemed like he had feelings for me. I reject him when I feel my feelings growing, like I did in other relationships. In the end he left me, like they all did. I learned later that he was with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of time when we were together. It ended the same way when I met other men and women. Fast forward to yesterday. Indy was in the hospital after being hit by a car, according to Kelly. His condition was critical, and he has asked for me. And here I am, a bouquet of flowers in hands, nervously looking for room 68. I find it, half opened, and take a deep breath, and here Indy's weak voice. "Kelly, you're a wonderful girl, but I never loved you." I felt the words hit me. I storm in the room, but his eyes are already closed. It will be forever.
