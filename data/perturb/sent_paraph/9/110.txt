Dyslexia affects children with normal eyesight and intellect in different ways, such as an inability to read or acquire words. Coaching or a specialized educational intervention may help most children with Dyslexia to perform better in school. According to the article, Learning difficulties are one of the many consequences of Dyslexia. A youngster with Dyslexia will have difficulty keeping up with their classmates in most classrooms since reading is such a fundamental ability in so many areas. In the absence of treatment, Dyslexia may lead to poor self-esteem, behavioral issues such as anxiety or anger, as well as separation from peers and teachers. When Dyslexia is not diagnosed and addressed throughout the childhood, it may lead to long-term issues in adulthood. Children who can't read and comprehend are less likely to succeed. According to the author, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder may make it more difficult to cure Dyslexia. Children with Dyslexia are more likely to experience learning challenges if their siblings and parents suffer from the same condition. Furthermore, men are more likely than females to suffer from Dyslexia; however, the disorder affects people of all ages, socioeconomic, and ethnic backgrounds. Children born with dyslexia struggle with reading, understanding, and spelling. The article has expanded my understanding of the topic. I learned that Dyslexic children are great empathizers; many people with Dyslexia have a real personality. The writing and reading difficulties might help children empathize with those struggling. The articleâ€™s strength is that it has discussed the causes and effects of Dyslexia with the right age bracket consideration, that is, from age 4 to 10. The weakness of the article is that it generalized the genders without being specific, and that it only mentioned that Dyslexia is more experienced in males than females. Concerning race, there is a sparse number of research papers regarding Dyslexia among black children and its consequences. Dyslexia mainly affects white children than black children, and thus the article addresses white children widely. I will use this article as part of my capstone project by generating public health education proposal on Dyslexia to prevent the public from viewing Dyslexia as a curse.
