The article comprehensively describes the definition of an introvert, the features of his behavior, and personal attitudes in the modern model of society. In a world focused on mostly intense people, this category of people is often misinterpreted. The goal of the author is to convey to society the goals and wishes of introverts, who often go unrecognized or neglected. A superficial analysis of the text captures a vivid personal appeal of the author and intensely expresses subjective sentiments due to individual experience. A large number of rhetorical questions at the beginning of the message immediately attract the reader’s attention. The article is written in a journalistic style and has a bright emotional coloring with a hint of a pronounced rejection of the global focus on extraversion. The text analysis allows the reader to better understand the author's message. General questions about the life and worldview of introverts are included in the article. The text is characterized by a high degree of subjectivism and a pronounced bias towards the category of extrovert readers. The author compares extroverts with “puppy dogs” who can listen to a person for a minute and then start “barking” again. Such a comparison is pejorative and may cause an ambiguous reaction in the reader (Rauch 133). According to the author, people who are intelligent, reflective, and sensitive are called introverts. Every conclusion has the right to be presented in a way that is accepted, but a tone of indifference towards the crowd may cause the message to be rejected. The author's position has the potential to find a reader and supporter. However, the aftertaste from its reading is rather ambiguous and makes one think about the excessive tendentiousness of the writer. The text does not compare two different categories of people but vigorously downplays the principal personality traits of extroverts. The author says that the world would be much calmer and saner under the guidance of introverts. This theory may well be valid; however, perhaps the world should not be so sharply divided into “white” and “black,” “extroverts,” and “introverts.” This article does a good job of its central purpose: to illustrate an alternative radical vision of the modern model of society separated mainly between extroverts and introverts.
