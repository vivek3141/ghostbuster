You own a camera that reveals the true value of objects through its lens, just like a thermal camera, but instead of heat, it showcases their worth. Rings and jewelry burn brightly like the sun, signifying their immense value. Plastic wastage remains almost invisible, reflecting its negligible worth. Never to view a person through it is what you've always been cautious about. Until today. You cautiously aim the camera at yourself, because curiosity gets the better of you. It shatters your heart to witness your reflection, obscure and dulled. It's time for a change when you realize how little you value yourself.
