As the cold metal handcuffs dug into my wrists, I sat in the dimly lit interrogation room, surrounded by emotionless detectives. I had left behind a wave of blood-soaked clues that challenged their expertise. They finally caught up with me, the notorious serial killer known as "The Nightshade". I smirked at the irony. I was asked to recount my first kill by the detectives. The room fell silent as my mind wandered back to that fateful night. I was desperate for revenge against the world that had betrayed me. Her name was Emily. She was my first victim and the catalyst for the darkness within me to awaken. I had watched her from afar, learning her routine, her vulnerabilities. I carefully entered her life that night. As she slept soundly, unaware of the force that crept closer, I raised the blade. My hand trembled with a mix of fear and exhilaration as the steel kissed her skin. I cannot deny the intoxicating power coursing through my veins, knowing I held her very life in my hands. In that moment, I saw her life force escape her body, extinguished by my hand. The feeling was indescribable. The detectives sat in stunned silence, horrified yet captivated by my twisted tale. They had hoped for redemption. They discovered that there is no redemption for me when I recounted my first kill. In my eyes, they could see the emptiness—a void that hungered still—for blood, death, and the thrill of the hunt.
