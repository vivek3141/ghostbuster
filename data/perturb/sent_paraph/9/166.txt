Lear Corp. has announced the acquisition of Borealis Industrier AB, a Swedish automotive interior systems provider, to create a truly comprehensive offering for automakers worldwide. The deal is expected to close within the next few months and will allow Lear to take full control of the company. With the acquisition of Borealis, the company wants to provide a complete solution for automakers, including everything from seating systems and electronics to complete interior solutions. This move follows a successful year for Lear Corp., who have enjoyed solid demand across all of their product categories.
