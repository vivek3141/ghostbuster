Stanley walked up the stairs to his boss' office. Stanley went into the elevator and pressed the button to get to his office. Stanley was in his boss' office as soon as the door opened. No, that can't be right, Stanley, you can't just plug in the vacuum cleaner, that's not in the script. You're a real person, what is that? Let me show you a video about obeying. Oh, let's see everything in this elevator is broken. All hope is not lost, just walk to the boss' office. This entire thing is broken and destroyed by you, you careless jerk. I guess I can only delete this project of mine. Stanley, goodbye.
