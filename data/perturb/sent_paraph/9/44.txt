Kellogg Co. on Friday reported a drop of more than 30 percent in its third quarter profits as its cereal volume dropped in an intensely competitive market. Kellogg, which makes Corn Flakes, Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, Fruit Loops and Special-K, is fighting back, launching marketing plans for the fourth quarter that are aimed at boosting its sales. "We'll be taking what we believe are appropriate actions," Kellogg spokesman Richard Lovell said. The company, the world's biggest maker of ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, said its net income for the third quarter fell to $159.5 million, including a $21.3 million charge, from $230 million a year ago. The company's earnings dropped 29 percent to 75 cents per share, with fewer shares outstanding, compared to last year. Kellogg said its overall sales slipped 9 percent to $1.68 billion from $1.84 billion as continued weak prices for breakfast cereals offset a 1 percent gain in worldwide sales volume. "As previously forecast, our third quarter performance was influenced significantly by competitive conditions in the U.S. cereal category," Arnold Langbo said in a statement. In the third quarter, analysts estimate that the domestic cereal sales volume fell between 9 and 10 percent. "We can't detail it. It was a challenging quarter in the U.S. and our volume was down. Kellogg said its fourth quarter 1996 earnings likely will show a slight rise from the 77 cents it earned a year ago. First quarter 1997 earnings, however, may not match the 99 cents earned in the 1996 period. "It's a challenging comparison," Lovell said. Kellogg's stock fell on concern over U.S. cereal sales volume and the outlook for earnings, dropping $1 at $64.50 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier, it set a new 52-week low of $64.125. Kellogg said the U.S. cereal market overall was sluggish, with sales growing about 1.5 percent, measuring grocery stores, mass merchandisers and all other outlets. Looking ahead, Kellogg refused to outline what promotional programmes it was planning for the fourth quarter. Analysts said they did not expect the Battle Creek, Mich.-based cereal giant to return to deep-discount coupons or buy-one, get-one-free promotional giveaways. "It's sort of left to speculation what they're going to do," SBC Warburg analyst Chris Jakubik said. "There is no indication that, at this time, they have shifted from their long-term strategic goal, which is to reduce inefficient promotions," added BT Securities analyst John O'Neil. Kellogg reduced prices on about two-thirds of its breakfast cereals in June. Major manufacturers slashed prices this year as they battled for market share. But those price cuts alone apparently were not enough to jump-start consumer purchases, according to Smith Barney analyst David Rabinowitz. "The message there is that prices have to come down further," Rabinowitz said. US ready-to- eat cereals sales in grocery stores fell in the 52 weeks ended August 11, according to the most recent data. Information Resources said that Kellogg's sales volume declined by 4.1 percent to 881.3 million pounds for a market share of about 34.4%.
