I have to write something for the first 3-panel, Character 1 - what do you think about the fence on the roof? I suppose the second character is to stop people from falling. Would a fence stop someone from killing themselves? Character 2 - No, maybe get 'em to use a different building though. They just don't want it to be their problem to deal with. [3] Character 2 has walked off screen
Character 1 - Maybe if someone did, they wouldn't need the fences anymore...
