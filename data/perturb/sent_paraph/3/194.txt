Semiconductor stocks are set for a comeback as double-digit growth returns. Semiconductor companies have shown strong gains in the third quarter, with stocks like Intel seeing huge jumps. This growth is expected to continue into the end of the year, with high demand for electronics driving sales. Increased use of chips in automobiles and the growth of 5G technology are some of the factors contributing to the growth. Investors are urged to keep an eye on the sector and consider investing in semiconductor stocks.
