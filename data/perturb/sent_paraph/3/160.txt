Hong Kong's air cargo handling rose by 6.7% in August compared to the same month last year. This is despite the ongoing trade tension between China and the US that has affected the global economy. According to the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA), the increase in air cargo volume was mainly due to a growth in exports. The increase in transshipment volume indicates that the airport is still an important hub for trade between Asia and the rest of the world. The airport handled a total of 434,000 tonnes of cargo in August. The growth was seen primarily in exports to Europe, North America, and Southeast Asia. The increase in volume suggests that Hong Kong remains a vital link in global supply chains. Despite the ongoing trade war, HKIA continues to be competitive, offering airlines and shippers access to extensive air and sea networks. The airport is preparing for future growth by constructing a third runway to handle more traffic and expanding its cargo terminal facilities. Despite the uncertain global economic environment, HKIA is still optimistic about future growth. The airport's ability to handle large volumes of cargo and serve as a crucial logistics hub positions it well for continued success.
