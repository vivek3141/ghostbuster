In recent years, the rapid transition to online business and the increasing utilization of new media platforms have greatly changed advertising and consumer behavior. Traditional methods of advertising and marketing are no longer as effective as they once were, as the landscape of consumer habits and preferences has dramatically changed. The rise of online business has disrupted the traditional brick-and-mortar businesses, causing companies to rethink their advertising strategies. With the advent of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, businesses now have the opportunity to reach a broader and more diverse audience. Businesses can tailor their advertisements based on users' interests on these platforms. Consequently, businesses can now reach the right consumers with the right message at the right time, resulting in more effective and efficient marketing campaigns. Moreover, the emergence of new media platforms has also transformed consumer behavior. Traditional advertising methods like television, radio, and print are no longer sufficient for information. They now turn to the internet and social media platforms for product reviews, recommendations, and comparisons. The accessibility and convenience of online shopping have enabled consumers to make more informed decisions, as they can easily research and compare prices, read customer reviews, and have a wider range of options at their fingertips. Consequently, consumer behavior has shifted towards being more discerning and selective, favoring products and services that align with their personal values and needs. The rise of influencer marketing is one aspect of the online business transition. Powerful advertising tools can be found in individuals with a large following on social media. Influencers are seen as relatable and trustworthy, making their endorsements highly influential for their followers. Businesses can use this form of advertising to build a loyal and engaged customer base. In conclusion, the transition to online business and the use of new media platforms have revolutionized advertising and consumer behavior. Businesses now have the ability to target specific audiences and create more tailored advertisements, resulting in more effective marketing campaigns. Consumers rely on online platforms for information and guidance. Additionally, the rise of influencers has further changed the dynamics of advertising, giving businesses the opportunity to connect with niche markets. As technology continues to advance, it is crucial for both businesses and consumers to adapt and utilize these new platforms to stay relevant in today's digital age.
