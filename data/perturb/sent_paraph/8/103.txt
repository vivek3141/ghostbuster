As he wandered deeper into the enchanting forest, the watch slipped from his hands unnoticed. Suddenly, a thunderous roar echoed through the trees, predicting an imminent rainstorm. Panic set in as he realized he had misplaced his only lifeline. Barely escaping the sudden downpour, Oliver found shelter in an ancient, dilapidated stone tower. The watch was nowhere to be found, and as darkness consumed the surroundings, he took refuge inside a dusty chamber. Hours turned into days, and days into weeks.

Just when his spirit was fading, a blinding light filled the chamber, and he found himself once again standing in front of the pocket watch. Ecstatic, he hastily pocketed it, and reality shifted.
