Borealis Industrier is a Swedish supplier of automotive interior systems. The deal, which is expected to close within the next few months, will see Lear Corp. take full control of the privately-held company, adding to its already impressive portfolio of automotive components and electronics. With the acquisition of Borealis, the company wants to provide a complete solution for automakers, including everything from seating systems and electronics to complete interior solutions. This move follows a successful year for Lear Corp., who have enjoyed solid demand across all of their product categories. Over the years, Borealis has been an excellent partner for Lear Corp., working closely together to provide innovative interior solutions that meet the unique needs of each automotive customer. This acquisition will allow Lear Corp. to integrate Borealis’ design, engineering, and manufacturing capabilities directly into its own operations, creating a truly streamlined and efficient experience for automakers. The acquisition of Borealis also means that Lear Corp. will be able to offer customers a wider range of colors, materials, and finishes for their automotive interiors. The company has already indicated that it will be investing heavily in Borealis’ manufacturing facilities in Sweden, giving it access to state-of-the-art equipment and processes that will further streamline its operations and improve output quality. In announcing the acquisition, Ray Scott said that the move would grow the company's presence in the automotive interiors market and support its ongoing efforts to provide customers with innovative products that are safe, sustainable, and affordable. The quality, reliability, and innovation that they demand are what the company is well-equipped to deliver.
