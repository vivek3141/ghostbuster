Macau International Airport â€“ Air Macau, the flag carrier airline of Macau, is expecting a substantial increase in belly cargo as it plans to introduce new aircraft and routes to China. Air Macau has announced the acquisition of two new Airbus A321neo aircraft, which will join its fleet from December 2021. The new aircraft will help expand the airline's network, increase frequencies and improve connectivity between Macau and China. With the addition of new aircraft and routes, Air Macau is also expecting a significant increase in belly cargo. The introduction of the new aircraft and routes will open up new opportunities for cargo growth, according to Chen Hong, the airline's Chief Executive Officer. Belly cargo refers to the cargo carried in the cargo hold of the aircraft, beneath the passengers' cabin. Air Macau will be able to increase its cargo capacity and take advantage of the growing demand for air cargo transportation between China and Macau with the new aircraft's larger cargo hold. The airline's cargo department has already been in talks with logistics companies and shippers to explore new cargo opportunities. "We have identified several sectors for growth, including mail, fresh produce, and e-commerce," said Air Macau's Chief Commercial Officer, Liu Cheng. The airline has partnerships with several firms in China to offer seamless cargo services. Medical supplies and equipment will be supported by Air Macau's cargo capacity. Air Macau's plans to expand its network and cargo operations come at a time when the air cargo industry's demand has been on the rise. The need for faster, more efficient cargo transportation has been boosted by the COVID-19 Pandemic. In 2020, Air Macau's cargo operations contributed significantly to the airline's revenue, making up nearly 20% of its total revenue. The airline is optimistic that with the expansion of its cargo operations, it will continue to see growth in its financial results. With the introduction of new aircraft and routes, Air Macau is positioning itself to take advantage of the growing demand for air cargo transportation in the region while providing more cargo transportation options for its customers.
