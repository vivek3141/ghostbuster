It made me very nervous and puzzled me. As such I never committed into relationships, probably by great of having my feelings not reciprocated. The man I loved the most was Indy. He was the complete opposite of me: extraverted, charming, outgoing. He was reliable and generous. We stayed together for a couple of years, and, I don't know why, but it really seemed like he had feelings for me. But like I did in other relationships before, I shut him down, rejecting him when I felt my feelings growing to much. Like they all did, he left me. I learned later that he was with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of time when we were together. It ended the same way when I met other men and women. Fast forward to yesterday. Indy was in the hospital after being hit by a car, according to Kelly. He asked for me because his condition was critical. And here I am, a bouquet of flowers in hands, nervously looking for room 68. I find it, half opened, and take a deep breath to give myself courage, and here Indy's weak voice. "Kelly, you're...a wonderful girl but...I...I...I never loved you." The words hit me like a punch. His eyes are closed as I storm in the room. Forever.
