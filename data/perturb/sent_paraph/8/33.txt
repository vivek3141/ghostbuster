The doctor’s job is to follow ethical standards, including loyalty to patients and respect for their choice. The profession concentrates on religious traditions and beliefs. Voluntary death can be seen as physician-assisted suicide. The patient's wishes are given to the doctor by the patient. However, such cooperation on the part of a doctor cannot be ethically conditioned. Euthanasia can cause harm to the patient if done wrong. Thus, a person can be left without the possibility of a habitual existence. The doctor can't help patients who choose to die from diseases they don't want to die from. In this case, the moral commandment that a person cannot take someone else’s life is violated (Clarke et al., 2021). Moreover, doctor-assisted suicide is wholly opposed to the definition of a profession aimed at helping people. The doctor is seen as a healer, while physician-assisted suicide does not seem to control and calculate the risks, which can be a threat to many patients. The dilemma lies in the Hippocratic oath given by all doctors, one of the points of which is not to harm. Thus, helping a patient with a death wish can be seen as a deliberate wish to injure the person. Since taking a life cannot be ethically justified, the level of trust between patients and medical staff may be reduced. In addition, the religious view forbids doctors to help patients at the end of life, referring to the commandment not to kill a person. Furthermore, killing may be considered offensive due to society’s moral attitude. The patient's pain can be alleviated with the help of available medicines, while the loss of life is irreversible.
