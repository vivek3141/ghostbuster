I have to write something for the first 3-panel, Character 1 - what do you think about the fence on the roof? Character 2 - Stop people from falling, or suicide I suppose. Would a fence stop someone from killing themselves? Character 2 - No, maybe get 'em to use a different building though. They don't want it to be their problem. If someone did that, they might not need the fence anymore.
