A special bonus for life insurance policies was declared on Tuesday by Britain's Britannic Assurance. All "with profits" policies will have aPayout in force on February 17, 1997. The 1996 bonus will be announced next month. The company said last year it discussing with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) ownership of long-term assets, and a way to distribute the surplus to policyholders and shareholders. Britannic has now agreed with the DTI that 902 million pounds of the excess assets within the long term fund can be attributable to shareholders. Britannic also said it intended to increase its dividend for the year by 82 percent to 23 pence per share following an increase in life profits. The company's progressive dividend policy would continue based on this. The news boosted Britannic shares, which jumped 71 pence, or nearly nine percent, at one stage before settling for a rise of 29 pence at 832.5. At the end of 1995 the total assets of the life funds were over 5 billion pounds. Those assets were estimated to have risen by the end of 1996, Britannic chief executive Brian Shaw said, and updated figures would be released on March 18. Britannic also announced a restructuring of its long-term funds and the results of a strategic review of its business. The review will lead to new sales management and premium collection systems, streamlining of head office and investment in market analysis and product research. The initiatives are expected to cut operating costs by around 25 million pounds, based on 1995 figures. Britannic said it planned to build on its brand, investment management and distribution skills, financial strength and product development abilities to strengthen its position and improve value to policy and shareholders. The long-term fund will be restructured into two funds, one for its industrial branch and the other for the ordinary branch. In future at least 90 percent of the surplus in the with profits funds will be allocated each year to with profits policies. The shareholders' profit will be transferred to the profit and loss account. Two separate non-profit sub funds have been created, one for life and the other for pensions, which will be owned by shareholders. The shareholder transfer for 1996 will be increased by 23 million pounds following the declaration of the 209 million pound special bonus. ($ = 0.621 British Pounds)
