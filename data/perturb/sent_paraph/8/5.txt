Level 49 Paladin was walking through this wall-things all day to come to grips with his prowess. Wow kids, don't let the boogey man boogie in your closet, you must have forgot to lock it, agnostic parents with a pocket full of apocalypse and a head full of spaces. Another jesus bracelet broke, another spirit invoked, hold on to hope so faith can poke it's head into the realm of the dead. I watch a child teeter on the edge, hold hands with me and the rest of your invisible friends. It's better to break than continue to bend, snap your soul in two and let it heal. What I saw? What was it truly doing what it did? There was something in my mind that woke me up. War of the worlds, obsolete factions matching gains and comparing beef-sticks, equipped to rip shit like timid midgets insistent on doing what they didn't. Try not to be so literal, try not to feel intangibles as they creep up your spine, just trust in the sky and the stars will align. I ain't no judge, I ain't no jury, I'm just a boy walkin with a vision too blurry to comprehend foe from friend and trend but I can close my eyes and count to ten.
