In Plato's Gorgias, the philosophical dialogue between Socrates, Gorgias, Polus, and Callicles revolves around the nature and purpose of rhetoric and oratory skills. Plato, through Socrates, criticizes the opportunistic use of rhetoric for personal gain and highlights the importance of truth and justice in public speaking. Socrates argues that rhetoric is mere flattery and a dangerous art if used without moral considerations. The need for orators to seek truth and pursue the greater good is emphasized by him. This can be seen when Socrates questions Gorgias about the aim of rhetoric, revealing that Gorgias is more focused on the power it gives him rather than its ethical implications. Similarly, the film "Thank You for Smoking" provides a satirical take on the power of rhetoric in modern society. Nick Naylor, the protagonist, utilizes his proficient oratory skills as a spokesperson for the tobacco industry. He deceives the public by presenting strong arguments in favor of smoking, manipulating statistics, and using persuasive techniques. Naylor embodies the opportunistic rhetoric that Plato criticizes, as he prioritizes his personal gains over the well-being and truthfulness of his discourse. According to Plato, true oratory skills should serve justice and promote genuine knowledge. Over eloquent speeches lacking substance, he values internal consistency and logical coherence. This can be seen in the dialogue when Socrates questions Callicles, who believes in the superiority of those who can use rhetoric to satisfy their desires. Callicles is challenged to prove that rhetoric alone cannot lead to a just society by exposing the flaws in his argument. "Thank You for Smoking" supports Plato's argument that the power of persuasion must be used ethically. Naylor acknowledges the harmful effects of tobacco products as the film progresses. He realized that he can use his rhetorical skills to advocate for consumer safety. In conclusion, Plato's Gorgias presents a critical examination of rhetoric and oratory skills, highlighting the importance of truth and justice in public speaking. The film "Thank You for Smoking" provides a contemporary illustration of Plato's arguments, as it explores the deceptive nature of opportunist rhetoric and the potential for individuals to use their skills to pursue moral ends. Both Plato and the film call for a responsible and ethical use of rhetoric, emphasizing the need to prioritize truth and justice over personal gain.
