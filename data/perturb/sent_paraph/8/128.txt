I enjoy the music. It reflects what is just about to happen. It has saved me from more than a few relationships that would have been unsavory. I have two theories about the music. Either I am the only one who hears it, or everyone does and no one ever talks about it. Which is fine. Music is a very personal thing after all. Unless it is trying to warn me of something dire, the music is usually at a comfortable level. There was one moment whereâ€¦ One moment where the sound was deafening. There was a rising crescendo ever since I woke up that morning. I turned on the news to watch while eating breakfast, as I always do. Usually the music goes back and forth between dramatic and more more lulling, depending on the news break about to come up. But that morning it didn't change. It just crescendoing until the newscaster spoke. The World Trade Centers have been hit. I dropped my fork. The ting of it hitting the table was all I could hear. My world had gone quiet for the first time. The music was silent as I watched the events unfold. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again. A long, low clarinet played. And then other instruments slowly joined it. Something sad, but hopeful. I was going to the Red Cross to see what I could do to help when it was playing.
