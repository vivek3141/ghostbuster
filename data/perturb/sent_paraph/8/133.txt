The modern world is currently facing a significant change under globalization trends that shape economies, politics, the workplace, education, and even everyday behavior. Culture is changing due to the active exchange of information. Researchers try to understand whether the culture will be further homogenized in globalization or diversified. The introduction of multiple cultural elements into societies will lead to a more diverse culture. The latest processes in cultural change show that both sides of the argument have reasonable grounds. In a globalized society where a dominant culture prevails, diversity will be replaced with the culture that is imposed on others through such means as cinema, according to Cowen. Indeed, Hollywood promotes American codes around the world because the US cinema market is the largest in the world. Thus, globalization allows Hollywood to reach all parts of the world, integrating the same culture codes everywhere. However, the other side of the argument is more compelling because it considers the strengths of local cultures. An example of sushi's popularity in American society and cultures of other nations demonstrates that people adopt new cultural phenomena with acknowledgment of their origin. According to Bestor (2010), “Japan remains the world’s primary market for fresh tuna for sushi and sashimi” (p. 110). Thus, having integrated its product into the cultures of other countries, Japan has expanded its market share. In such a manner, with the ease of transportation and communication enabled by globalization, there is a merge of cultures around the world. The host cultures know about the origins of the cultural clusters. Therefore, to summarize the discussion, one might state that culture will not be homogenized in globalization but rather diversified with credit given to each cultural component.
