Digital forensics tools are highly popular among digital investigators, as they allow easily conducting of the necessary technical analyses. One of the most famous software programs for digital forensics is Autopsy, a toolkit that examines the images present on a device's hard drive. Capable of interacting with personal computers and smartphones, Autopsy is highly versatile and contains several functions for properly investigating the image files present on the storage unit. Specifically, Autopsy allows viewing graphical information stored on the device, searching the repository for specific items, or extracting the data ( Autopsy , n.d.). Although the software is free, it is still an excellent tool for forensic analysis. Some digital forensics software is incredibly specific, created to examine a particular system. As such, Arsenal Recon is an instrument constructed to explore the Windows operating system and its registry, thus accessing information about the deviceâ€™s configuration specifics. When conducting a digital forensic investigation, it's important to consider that a Windows registry contains a lot of information about the applications installed and data processed. However, this software is produced commercially, it cannot be obtained free of charge, and $65 a month or $756 a year must be paid to receive access. When working with a mobile device, unique programs are required. Cellebrite UFED is one of the methods used to retrieve data from various types of mobile devices. Cellebrite UFED has a range of functions to remove the phone's security measures and access the information stored in the internal storage or on external cards. The software can only be purchased for specific purposes.
