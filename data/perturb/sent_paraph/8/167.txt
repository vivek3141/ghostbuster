As the cold metal handcuffs dug into my wrists, I sat in the dimly lit interrogation room, surrounded by emotionless detectives. For years, I had eluded them, leaving behind a wave of blood-soaked clues that challenged their expertise. But tonight, they finally caught up with me - the infamous serial killer known as "The Nightshade". I smirked at the irony. With a glimmer of satisfaction in their eyes, the detectives asked me to recount my first kill. My mind was wandering back to that fateful night as the room fell silent. I was desperate for revenge against the world that had betrayed me. Her name was Emily. Fragile and lost, she became my first victim, the catalyst for the darkness within me to awaken. I had watched her from afar and learned about her vulnerabilities. That night, I carefully orchestrated my entrance into her life. As she slept soundly, unaware of the force that crept closer, I raised the blade. My hand trembled with a mix of fear and exhilaration as the steel kissed her skin. I know I held her life in my hands because of the power in my veins. In that moment, I saw her life force escape her body, extinguished by my hand. The feeling was indescribable. The detectives sat in stunned silence, horrified yet captivated by my twisted tale. They had hoped for redemption. But as I recounted my first kill, they discovered that there is no redemption for me. In my eyes, they could see the emptiness—a void that hungered still—for blood, death, and the thrill of the hunt.
