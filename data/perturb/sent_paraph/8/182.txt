It is important to note that the bag market is a large one, where customers are highly segmented, and products significantly vary in both quality and purpose. To ensure that profits are maximized on the basis of collected data, the bag price needs to be adjusted. The previously selected price was $250, which was based on high-end tote bag analysis findings of $65-$250. The price of the product is $36 per unit. The initial price choice was motivated by profit maximization, but it did not account for price's influence on supply-demand. The new price is $65, which is almost twice as high as the cost per unit, and the expected profit from each bag is $29. tote bags are the fastest-growing handbag styles. Many low-end bags have prices below $65, but the selected product is made from leather and can be categorized as a mid-range, and thus, it cannot be lower than $65. The target audience is middle-class and higher-class mothers, but the brand is still unknown and requires proper marketing to build brand image. Thus, it is unjustified to select a high price range and risk lowering the demand, and it cannot compete with high-end bags and is not recognized as such.
