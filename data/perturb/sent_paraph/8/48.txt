General Motor Corp's decision to invest 300 million pounds ($474.9 million) in Vauxhall Motors reflected confidence in its British operation and the international prospects for its Astra model, Vauxhall said on Tuesday. The company said the three-year investment would be used to modernise its Ellesmere Port plant in north-west England, which makes Astra cars and vans. The announcement, made at the British International Motor Show, guarantees the livelihoods of the 4,200 people employed at the plant and will create at least 200 new jobs. Nick Reilly said in an interview that increasing the number of shifts at the plant to three from two could create hundreds more jobs. Depending on the market and demand for the model at that time, a decision would likely be taken over the next two years. The Astra model has been consistently one of Britain and Europe's top five sellers since its launch five years ago, with the development of an estate model boosting its position. The 300 million pound investment was won against intense competition within GM and reflected the transformation of the plant from a domestically oriented plant to a very important source of manufacturing. He predicted strong growth for the Astra in Latin America and Asia Pacific. The British car market is currently the most competitive in Europe, with a number of importers using huge U.K. fleet sales as a way of offloading cars which remain unsold in sluggish domestic markets. Europe was flat, he said. After a tough 1995 the profitablity of the company is going in the right direction.
