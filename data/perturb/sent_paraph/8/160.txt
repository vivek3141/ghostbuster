Hong Kong's air cargo handling rose by 6.7% in August compared to the same month last year. The trade tension between China and the US has affected the global economy. Air cargo volume increased due to a growth in exports. The transshipment volume also increased, indicating that the airport remains an important hub for trade between Asia and the rest of the world. In August, the airport handled 434,000 tonnes of cargo. The growth was seen primarily in exports to Europe, North America, and Southeast Asia. Hong Kong is a vital link in global supply chains. Despite the ongoing trade war, HKIA continues to be competitive, offering airlines and shippers access to extensive air and sea networks and a logistics industry hub. The airport is preparing for future growth by constructing a third runway to handle more traffic and expanding its cargo terminal facilities. Despite the uncertain global economic environment, HKIA is still optimistic about future growth. The airport's ability to handle large volumes of cargo and serve as a crucial logistics hub positions it well for continued success.
