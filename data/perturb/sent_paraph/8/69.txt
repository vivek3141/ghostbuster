I knelt down, blood still on my clothes, asking for forgiveness to these statues around me. I was never religious, but sometimes life makes you do things you never usually do. What I've done in life cannot be undone, a mothers have lost sons, sisters have lost brothers and kids have lost their dads. I am not a sinner, but I have sinned; it's the business I am in. I MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE MzE I don't regret taking the life of a criminal who didn't belong, I'm 52 now and coming close to my last few years in this life. I believe I've done the right thing by hunting evil people who have caused misery to communities. I got up from my knees and left my family's church. The gun was pressed against the back of my head when I took the last step onto the sidewalk. I didn't process what was happening because it had never happened. The world went silent and I could almost hear the finger tightening on the trigger when the loud bang rang through the streets. All I had was 7 seconds before I saw black and felt my body tensing and going into shock. I hope they serve booze in hell.
