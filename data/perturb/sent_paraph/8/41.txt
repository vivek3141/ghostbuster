Making Budgetary Control Effective
A robust organizational structure is required for budgetary effectiveness. There should be a finance committee and a budget director. Budget planning needs to be well integrated. Budgets for individuals should be harmonized with each other. Budgets must be reviewed on a regular basis to make sure they don't end up with a license to spend the entire authorized amount. According to Dauda (2019), “business organizations of all types must engage in financial planning at whatever level to ensure judicious deployment of resources for achieving organisational goals.” Workers should be appropriately compensated for performance in accordance with the budget. The staff should not be condemned. Behavioral Aspects of Budgetary Control
Budgetary control is a crucial instrument for performance evaluation. It takes time for findings to appear. Those in charge of fiscal control should have extensive knowledge and expertise in the subject. Workers are changing their working practices and routines because of their finances. Workers may be reluctant to change. The creation of each budget is supported by top leadership. Each employee’s requirements are fully described and distributed in a formal structure. If this is the case, they will be aware of their power and responsibilities, which will be valuable for budgetary management. A financial management program’s effectiveness depends on the organization’s defined objectives. As a result, when establishing targets, management should exercise caution. Furthermore, the aims are explicit.
