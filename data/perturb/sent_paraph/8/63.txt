As my roommate shook me awake, I was terrified. "There's no time! We have to go!" he exclaimed urgently. I was confused and asked for clarification. He looked frightened as he said, "There's no time!" After I woke up today, time no longer exists. His words held an air of truth despite my disbelief. With a knot in my stomach, we rushed outside. Clocks froze, sun stood still, and the world remained trapped in an eternal moment. We were left with no choice but to navigate this timeless abyss.
