The course of history was changed by the self-immolation of Thich Quang Duc on June 11, 1963. Today, the photograph of Thich Quang Ducâ€™s death, The Burning Monk, has become a universal symbol of rebellion and the fight against injustice. His death was reduced to a symbol, but it was much more than that (Sinzelle, 22). It was an act of defiance against a corrupt government that had killed its citizens. It may have caused the Americans to enter the Vietnam War, as it sparked a revolution and overthrew the regime. However, the monk himself most likely did not die for revolutionary ideas. His self-immolation was an act of rejection of the system and the inability to deal with injustice. Tunisian street vendor Mohammed Bouazizi set himself on fire in protest against harassment by local officials. The desperate act of the young man caused mass street protests in the city. The rioters demanded the resignation of President Ben Ali. Unemployment among young people was the result of long-term economic and social problems. Mohammed Bouazizi became a symbol of the Arab Spring when he gained followers in Tunisia and other countries. Most of the self-immolations did not impact the current situation; however, some of them played an important role in the political events in the country in which they took place. The actions of both men can hardly be called a specific call for revolution. The cases are considered to be extreme in their disagreement with injustice. It seems that the men have no other means left for the official authorities to hear them. The course of history was impacted by both events.
