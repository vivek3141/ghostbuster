The recent sentencing of a Chinese dissident has caused concern among Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists. Many fear that this move may be an indication of the Chinese government's increasing efforts to curb freedoms in Hong Kong post-handover. A prominent activist and former editor at the banned Chinese newspaper, the Southern Weekly, was convicted of subverting state power. Critics of the Chinese government are often charged with this charge. Many Hong Kong activists spoke out against what they saw as a violation of basic human rights and a move towards authoritarianism after his sentencing. Democracy activist, Joshua Wong, tweeted that "Beijing's crackdown in Hong Kong is increasingly brazenâ€¦ officials are now going after mainland dissidents." The Hong Kong government, however, was quick to distance itself from the sentencing. In a statement, the government said that "Mr. Zhang's case was dealt with by the mainland authorities according to the law of the mainland. The judicial proceedings of the central authorities would not be interfered with by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government. Regardless of the government's stance, many are unconvinced that the incident is an isolated one. Critics argue that Hong Kong's freedoms have been steadily eroded in recent years, with the government taking an increasingly hardline stance against dissent. This sentiment was echoed in a recent report by the United States' Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which highlighted "grave concern" over the Chinese government's manipulation of Hong Kong's legal system and the erasure of the city's autonomy. The report called on the US government to consider actions to help protect Hong Kong's democratic system, including sanctions on individuals responsible for undermining the city's freedoms. Zhang's sentencing also comes less than a year after China imposed a controversial national security law on Hong Kong. The law criminalizes dissent and gives the Chinese government new powers to police Hong Kong's political system. These developments are seen as a major blow to Hong Kong's autonomy, which was promised when the city was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997. Many Hong Kong activists want the international community to speak out and protect the city's democratic system.
