Stanley walked up the stairs to his boss' office. Stanley knowing a shorter path went into the elevator and pressed the button 3, to his bosses office. Stanley was in his boss' office when the door opened. No, that can't be right, Stanley, you can't just plug in the vacuum cleaner, that's not in the script. What's that I hear, you're a real person? Well then, let me show you a video on obedience. Oh, let's see everything in this elevator is broken. All hope is not lost, just walk to the boss' office. This entire thing is broken and destroyed by you, you careless jerk. I guess I can only delete this project of mine. Goodbye, Stanley.
