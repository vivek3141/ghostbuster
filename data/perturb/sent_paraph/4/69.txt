I knelt down, blood still on my clothes, asking for forgiveness to these statues around me. I was never religious, but sometimes life makes you do things you never usually do. What I've done in life can't be undone, mothers have lost sons, sisters have lost brothers and kids have lost their dads. I am not a bad person, but I have made a mistake. I first killed a man at the age of 13 with my bare hands, choked him until he went cold. I'm 52 now--probably coming close to my last few years in this life, but there's one thing I don't regret and it's taking the life of a criminal who didn't belong. I hunt evil people who've caused misery to communities and I believe I've done the right thing so far. I got up from my knees and left my family's church. I took the last step onto the sidewalk when I felt the barrel of a.357 magnum being pressed against the back of my head. I didn't process what was happening because it had never happened. When the loud bang rang through the streets, I almost heard the finger on the gun tighten. All I had was 7 seconds before I saw black and felt my body tensing and going into shock. I hope they serve tequila in hell.
