Hong Kong's air cargo handling rose by 6.7% in August compared to the same month last year. This is despite the ongoing trade tension between China and the US that has affected the global economy. Air cargo volume increased due to a growth in exports according to the Hong Kong International Airport. The transshipment volume also increased, indicating that the airport remains an important hub for trade between Asia and the rest of the world. The airport handled a total of 434,000 tonnes of cargo in August. The growth was seen primarily in exports to Europe, North America, and Southeast Asia. Hong Kong is a vital link in global supply chains. Despite the ongoing trade war, HKIA continues to be competitive, offering airlines and shippers access to extensive air and sea networks and a logistics industry hub. Expansion of its cargo terminal facilities and the construction of a third runway will help the airport handle more traffic in the future. Despite the uncertain global economic environment, HKIA is still optimistic about future growth. The airport's ability to handle large volumes of cargo and serve as a crucial logistics hub positions it well for continued success.
