You own a magical camera that reveals the true value of objects through its lens, just like a thermal camera, but instead of heat, it showcases their worth. Rings and jewelry burn brightly like the sun, signifying their immense value. Plastic wastage remains almost invisible, reflecting its negligible worth. You've always been cautious never to view a person through it. Until today. curiosity gets the better of you if you aim the camera at yourself. It makes you sad to see your reflection, obscure and dull. It's time for a change when you realize how little you value yourself.
