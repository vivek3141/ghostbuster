Sorry to be so dour, but I had to write something for that first 3-panel:
[1]
Character 1 - What do you think the fences on the roof are for? Character 2 - Stop people from falling, or suicide I suppose. Would a fence stop someone from killing themselves? Maybe they can use a different building. They don't want it to be their problem. [3] Character 2 has walked off screen
Character 1 - Maybe if someone did, they wouldn't need the fences anymore...
