You own a camera that reveals the true value of objects through its lens, just like a thermal camera, but instead of heat, it showcases their worth. Rings and jewelry burn bright, signifying their immense value. Plastic wastage remains almost invisible, reflecting its negligible worth. Never to view a person through it is what you've always been cautious about. Until today. Curiosity gets the better of you, and you cautiously aim the camera at yourself. It shatters your heart to witness your reflection, obscure and dulled. It's then you realize how little you value yourself; it's time for a change.
