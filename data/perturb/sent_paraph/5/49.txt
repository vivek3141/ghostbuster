Sorry to be so dour, but I had to write something for that first 3-panel:
[1]
Character 1 - What do you think the fences on the roof are for? Character 2 - Stop people from falling, or suicide I suppose. Would a fence stop someone from committing suicide? Character 2 - No, maybe get 'em to use a different building though. They don't want it to be their problem. Maybe they wouldn't need the fence anymore if someone did that.
