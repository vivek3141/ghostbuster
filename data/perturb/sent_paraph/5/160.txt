Hong Kong's air cargo handling rose by 6.7% in August compared to the same month last year. This is despite the ongoing trade tension between China and the US that has affected the global economy. Air cargo volume increased due to a growth in exports according to the Hong Kong International Airport. The increase in transshipment volume indicates that the airport is still an important hub for trade between Asia and the rest of the world. In August, the airport handled 434,000 tonnes of cargo. Growth was seen in exports to Europe, North America, and Southeast Asia. Hong Kong is a vital link in global supply chains. Despite the ongoing trade war, HKIA continues to be competitive, offering airlines and shippers access to extensive air and sea networks and a logistics industry hub. The airport is preparing for future growth by constructing a third runway to handle more traffic and expanding its cargo terminal facilities. HKIA remains optimistic about future growth, despite the uncertain global economic environment. The airport's ability to handle large volumes of cargo and serve as a crucial logistics hub positions it well for continued success.
