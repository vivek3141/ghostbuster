It always puzzled me, to say the least, and made me extremely nervous. As such I never committed into relationships, probably by great of having my feelings not reciprocated. My longest relationship was with a man I loved deeply, Indy. He was the opposite of me. He was friend with everyone, but still reliable and generous. We stayed together for a couple of years, and, I don't know why, but it really seemed like he had feelings for me. I reject him when I feel my feelings growing, like I did in other relationships. In the end he left me, like they all did. I learned later that he was with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of time when we were together. I met other men and women, and it always ended the same way. Fast forward to yesterday. Kelly calls me, saying that Indy was in the hospital, after being hit by a car. His condition was critical, and he has asked for me. I am holding a bouquet of flowers and nervously looking for room 68. I find it, half opened, and take a deep breath to give myself courage, and here Indy's weak voice. "Kelly, you're a wonderful girl, but I never loved you." The words hit me like a punch. I storm in the room, but his eyes are already closed. Forever.
