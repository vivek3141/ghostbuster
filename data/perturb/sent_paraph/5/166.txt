With the acquisition of Borealis, Lear Corp. is looking to provide a total solution for automakers, including everything from seating systems and electronics to complete interior solutions. This move follows a successful year for Lear Corp., who have enjoyed solid demand across all of their product categories. Over the years, Borealis has been an excellent partner for Lear Corp., working closely together to provide innovative interior solutions that meet the unique needs of each automotive customer.

In announcing the acquisition, Lear Corp. CEO Ray Scott said that the move would “grow our presence in the automotive interiors market and support our ongoing efforts to provide customers with innovative products that are safe, sustainable, and affordable.” He added that building on the strengths of the two companies would help Lear Corp. “adapt to the evolving market conditions and position our business for long-term growth.”
The acquisition of Borealis marks a significant step forward for Lear Corp. in its mission to build the most comprehensive range of automotive interior components and systems in the world. As automakers look to differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive market, Lear Corp. is well-positioned to deliver the quality, reliability, and innovation that they demand.
