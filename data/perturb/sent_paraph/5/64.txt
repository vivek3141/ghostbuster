Stanley walked up the stairs to his boss' office. Stanley went into the elevator and pressed the button to get to his office. Stanley walked into his boss' office as soon as the door opened. No, that can't be right, Stanley, you can't just plug in the vacuum cleaner, that's not in the script. You're a real person, what's that? Let me show you a video about obeying. Everything in this elevator is broken. However, all hope is not lost, now just walk to the boss' office! Oh, you refuse, well now look, this entire thing is broken, all my hours of work, destroyed by you, you careless jerk. I can only remove this project from my computer. Goodbye, Stanley.
