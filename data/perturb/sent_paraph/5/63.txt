I groggily sat up as my roommate shook me awake, panic etched across his face. There's no time! We have to go!" he exclaimed urgently. Confused, I pleaded for clarification. He looked frightened as he said, "There's no time!" Time doesn't exist anymore after I woke up today. Disbelief coursed through my veins, but his words held an air of truth. With a knot in my stomach, we rushed outside. Clocks froze, sun stood still, and the world remained trapped in an eternal moment. We were left with no choice but to go.
