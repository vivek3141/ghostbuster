I knelt down, blood still on my clothes, asking for forgiveness to these statues around me. Sometimes life makes you do things you wouldn't normally do. What I've done in life can't be undone, mothers have lost sons, sisters have lost brothers and kids have lost their dads. I am not a sinner, but I have sinned; it's the business I am in. I first killed a man at the age of 13 with my bare hands, choked him until he went cold. I'm 52 now--probably coming close to my last few years in this life, but there's one thing I don't regret and it's taking the life of a criminal who didn't belong. I believe I've done the right thing by hunting evil people who have caused misery to communities. I got up from my knees and left my family's church. I took the last step onto the sidewalk when I felt the barrel of a.357 magnum being pressed against the back of my head. I didn't process what was happening because it had never happened. The world went silent and I could almost hear the finger tightening on the trigger when the loud bang rang through the streets. I felt a sensation of shock after 7 seconds. I hope they serve tequila in hell.
