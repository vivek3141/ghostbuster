In recent years, the rapid transition to online business and the increasing utilization of new media platforms have greatly changed advertising and consumer behavior. Traditional methods of advertising and marketing are no longer as effective as they once were, as the landscape of consumer habits and preferences has dramatically changed. The rise of online business has disrupted the traditional brick-and-mortar businesses, causing companies to rethink their advertising strategies. With the advent of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, businesses now have the opportunity to reach a broader and more diverse audience. These platforms allow for targeted advertising, where businesses can tailor their advertisements based on users' interests, demographics, and behavior. Consequently, businesses can now reach the right consumers with the right message at the right time, resulting in more effective and efficient marketing campaigns. Moreover, the emergence of new media platforms has also transformed consumer behavior. Consumers no longer rely solely on traditional advertising mediums like television, radio, or print media for information. They now turn to the internet and social media platforms for product reviews, recommendations, and comparisons. The accessibility and convenience of online shopping have enabled consumers to make more informed decisions, as they can easily research and compare prices, read customer reviews, and have a wider range of options at their fingertips. Consumer behavior has shifted towards favoring products and services that align with their personal values and needs. Another significant aspect of the online business transition is the rise of influencer marketing. Influencers, individuals with a significant following on social media, have become powerful advertising tools. Influencers are seen as relatable and trustworthy, making their endorsements highly influential for their followers. This form of advertising allows businesses to tap into niche markets and build a more loyal and engaged customer base. Advertising and consumer behavior have been changed by the use of new media platforms. Businesses can now target specific audiences and create more tailored advertisements, resulting in more effective marketing campaigns. Consumers, on the other hand, have become more knowledgeable and selective, relying on online platforms for information and guidance. The rise of influencers has changed the dynamics of advertising, giving businesses the chance to connect with niche markets. Businesses and consumers need to adapt and use new platforms in order to stay relevant in today's digital age.
