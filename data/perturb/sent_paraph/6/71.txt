Lear Corp., furthering its quest to supply complete car interiors, said Friday it agreed to buy the instrument panel and trim parts unit of Denmark-based Borealis Holding AB. The deal was signed for undisclosed terms. Borealis Industrier is a Swedish company that makes components for the European car and truck industry. Borealis Industrier had 1995 sales of about $230 million and owns five plants in Sweden that employ about 1,800 people. Primary customers for the business include Swedish carmakers AB Volvo and Saab Automobile AB and truckmaker Scania AB. Borealis Holding is owned by Finnish state-controlled oil and energy group Neste Oy  and Norwegian state-owned oil group Statoil AS. Completion of the transaction is subject to approval by the Swedish competition authority and other conditions. The strategy of having in-house capability to provide total automotive interior systems, including instrument panels is supported by the acquisition. "Not only does this acquisition strengthen relations with our European customers, but it positions Lear as the only independent automotive supplier in the world with in-house capabilities in all five interior systems -- broadening the appeal of our already strong one-stop-shopping competitive advantage," Lear Chairman Kenneth Way said in a statement. The deal is the latest of a series of consolidation moves in the automotive interior market. Lear earlier this year purchased carpet and floor-mat maker Masland Corp. for $384 million, and last year bought door panel and console maker Automotive Industries Inc for $626 million. Lear's U.S. operations include the manufacturing of a wide range of automotive interior components. The company's stock was unchanged Friday at $38 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. The same acquisition strategy is being pursued by Lear's competitors. The interior parts maker Prince automotive, based in Holland Mich., was acquired by Johnson Controls for over $1 billion in cash. Canada's Magna International Inc., one of the "Big Three" automotive interior firms along with Lear and Johnson Controls, recently acquired seat maker Douglas & Lomason Co. for $135 million.
