Sorry to be so dour, but I had to write something for that first 3-panel:
[1]
Character 1 - What do you think the fences on the roof are for? I suppose the second character is to stop people from falling. Would a fence stop someone from committing suicide? Maybe get them to use a different building. They don't want it to be their problem. Maybe if someone did, they wouldn't need the fences anymore.
