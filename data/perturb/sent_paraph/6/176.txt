You own a magical camera that reveals the true value of objects through its lens, just like a thermal camera, but instead of heat, it showcases their worth. Rings and jewelry burn bright, signifying their immense value. Plastic waste is almost invisible. You've always been cautious never to view a person through it. Until today. curiosity gets the better of you if you aim the camera at yourself. It shatters your heart to witness your reflection, obscure and dulled. It's then you realize how little you value yourself; it's time for a change.
