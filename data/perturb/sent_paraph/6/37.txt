I blinked groggily as I awoke to the faint sound of city traffic. I realized I was no longer in the comfort of my self-driving car when I rubbed my eyes. Confused and disoriented, I peered out of the window, only to find myself surrounded by towering skyscrapers and bustling streets I had never seen before. Panicking, I desperately attempted to recall how I ended up here. The last thing I remembered was programming my destination on the car's console, hoping to get some sleep during the long journey. But something had clearly gone wrong. Determined to figure out my current whereabouts, I ventured out of the vehicle. The air was filled with unfamiliar scents and the language spoken around me was foreign. I noticed that the futuristic architecture and advanced technologies were centuries ahead of my time. My mind raced with questions. Where was I? How had I ended up in a time so distant from my own? Feeling lost and alone, I thought of my loved ones, their faces fading as I traveled further away from home. As I hoped for familiarity, I had tears in my eyes. But amid the chaos, a glimmer of curiosity sparked within me. I decided to make the most of my journey. With no way back, I resolved to adapt, learn, and perhaps, leave a mark on this astonishing future that had inadvertently become my destination.
