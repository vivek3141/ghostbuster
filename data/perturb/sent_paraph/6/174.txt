Bringing current terminology and the nature of the relationship between patients and physicians into a state of certainty will help to understand and illuminate the nature of consumerism in health care. The absence or lack of trust is of particular concern to patients. They feel vulnerable because of the research and treatment they have to go through. Improving the efficiency of the health care system is a priority for European countries. In today’s world, patients expect adequate professional skills from doctors and high standards of interpersonal communication. In recent years, they have become more aware of medical options and the kind of care they can receive at specific medical organizations. Patients are increasingly comparing options at different clinics, learning a lot of information about doctors and medical services, as well as publicly available information about diseases.

A negative consequence of this trend is the widespread use by patients of Internet materials for self-diagnosis and treatment.

Proper training and highly qualified doctors are some of the factors that determine how friendly and relaxed the clinics' clients will be. The destruction of the interpersonal relationship between doctors and patients due to the introduction of depersonalized procedures becomes the subject of research in the coming years.
