The social determinants of health are the conditions in the environment in which people live, learn, work, play, worship, and age. I agree that the social environment in which people live can affect their health status. Health outcomes are not determined solely by biological factors or access to quality health care (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, n.d.). Resources that improve the quality of life can significantly impact the health of a population. Examples of these resources include safe and affordable housing, access to education, public safety, availability of healthy food, local emergency services, and an environment free of life-threatening toxins (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, n.d.). I also support the recent shift in the view that it is solely up to the individual to influence their health in favor of recognizing the significant impact of external influences on it. The modern world is not dependent on one person. At first glance, he can choose what to eat, whether to exercise, and whether to seek medical care in a timely manner. In fact, most of the choices that affect health are made by the marketing machine, the government, and life circumstances. Modern advertising presses one to choose products that are not in keeping with a healthy lifestyle. People sacrifice a healthy sleep schedule and exercise in order to earn money for these products. This chain has many links, but the result is always the same: peopleâ€™s health is largely not up to them. External factors also indirectly affect health, such as health inequalities. When I read the CDC (2022) report on these inequalities, I was most surprised by the racial and ethnic inequalities. In an era of globalization and liberalization of society, a phenomenon like racism must be eradicated. Sometimes it's important to treat people equally in the field of health care. I believe that racial and ethnic discrimination must be eliminated in this area.
