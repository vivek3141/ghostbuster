The doctor’s job is to follow ethical standards, including loyalty to patients and respect for their choice. However, the profession concentrates on philosophical, religious, and cultural traditions and beliefs. Physician-assisted suicide can be seen as voluntary death by a medical professional. At the same time, the doctor provides all the necessary means and information regarding the patient’s desires for the end of life. The doctor's cooperation cannot be conditioned. Euthanasia can cause harm to the patient if done wrong. Thus, a person can be left without the possibility of a habitual existence. Patients who don't want to die from diseases can't be helped by the doctor. In this case, the moral commandment that a person cannot take someone else’s life is violated (Clarke et al., 2021). Moreover, doctor-assisted suicide is wholly opposed to the definition of a profession aimed at helping people. Physician-assisted suicide does not seem to control and calculate the risks, which can be a threat to many patients, while the doctor is seen as a healer. The dilemma lies in the Hippocratic oath given by all doctors, one of the points of which is not to harm. Thus, helping a patient with a death wish can be seen as a deliberate wish to injure the person. Since taking a life cannot be ethically justified, the level of trust between patients and medical staff may be reduced. In addition, the religious view forbids doctors to help patients at the end of life, referring to the commandment not to kill a person. Furthermore, killing may be considered offensive due to society’s moral attitude. The patient’s pain can be alleviated with the help of available medicines, while the loss of life is an irreversible action.
