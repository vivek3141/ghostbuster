Thich Quang Duc committed self-immolation on the streets of Saigon on June 11, 1963, and it changed the course of history. The photograph of Thich Quang Duc's death, The Burning Monk, has become a universal symbol of rebellion and the fight against injustice. His death was reduced to a symbol, but it was much more than that (Sinzelle, 22). It was an act of defiance against a corrupt government that had killed its citizens. It may have caused the Americans to enter the Vietnam War, as it sparked a revolution and overthrew the regime. The monk probably didn't die for revolutionary ideas. His self-immolation was an act of rejection of the system and the inability to deal with injustice. Tunisian street vendor Mohammed Bouazizi set himself on fire in protest against harassment by local officials. The desperate act of the young man caused mass street protests in the city. The rioters demanded the resignation of President Ben Ali. Unemployment among young people was the result of long-term economic and social problems. Mohammed Bouazizi became a symbol of the Arab Spring; he gained followers in Tunisia and other Arab countries, which also led to mass protests. Most of the self-immolations did not impact the current situation; however, some of them played an important role in the political events in the country in which they took place. The actions of both men can hardly be called a specific call for revolution. The cases are considered to be an extreme measure of disagreement with injustice. The official authorities have no other means to hear the men. In one way or another, both events significantly influenced the course of history.
