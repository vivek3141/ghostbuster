I knelt down, blood still on my clothes, asking for forgiveness to these statues around me. I was never religious, but sometimes life makes you do things you never usually do. What I've done in life cannot be undone, a mothers have lost sons, sisters have lost brothers and kids have lost their dads. I am not a bad person, but I have made a mistake. I killed a man at the age of 13 with my bare hands. I'm 52 now--probably coming close to my last few years in this life, but there's one thing I don't regret and it's taking the life of a criminal who didn't belong. I believe I've done the right thing by hunting evil people who have caused misery to communities. I got up from my knees and left San Jose church, which my family visited every few Sundays growing up. I took the last step onto the sidewalk when I felt the barrel of a.357 magnum being pressed against the back of my head. I didn't process what was happening because it hadn't happened before. The world went silent and I could almost hear the finger tightening on the trigger when the loud bang rang through the streets. I felt a sensation of shock after 7 seconds. I hope they serve booze in hell.
