I groggily sat up as my roommate shook me awake, panic etched across his face. "There's no time! We have to go!" he exclaimed urgently. I was confused and asked for clarification. He looked frightened as he said, "There's no time!" I woke up today and time doesn't exist anymore!" His words held an air of truth despite my disbelief. With a knot in my stomach, we rushed outside. Clocks froze, sun stood still, and the world remained trapped in an eternal moment. We had no choice but to leave.
