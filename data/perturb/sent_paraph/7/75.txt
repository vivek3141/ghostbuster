It always puzzled me, to say the least, and made me extremely nervous. As such I never committed into relationships, probably by great of having my feelings not reciprocated. The man I loved the most was Indy. He was the complete opposite of me: extraverted, charming, outgoing. He was friend with everyone, but still reliable and generous. We stayed together for a couple of years, and, I don't know why, but it really seemed like he had feelings for me. I reject him when I feel my feelings growing, like I did in other relationships. He did the same thing as they all did. I learned later that he was with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of time when we were together. I met other men and women, and it always ended the same way. Fast forward to yesterday. Kelly calls me, saying that Indy was in the hospital, after being hit by a car. His condition was critical, and he has asked for me. And here I am, a bouquet of flowers in hands, nervously looking for room 68. I find it, half opened, and take a deep breath to give myself courage, and here Indy's weak voice. "Kelly, you're...a wonderful girl but...I...I...I never loved you." I felt the words hit me. His eyes are closed as I storm in the room. Forever.
