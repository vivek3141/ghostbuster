"Breaking news! the dangerous offshoot of the IRA, known as the 'Kings of Ulster' claimed 84 victims today in a brutal attack against a British police station. It's not known if there are any survivors, but it's known that several of the dead were killed by their own leader, Nailuch uc. He turned off the television as the newsman began to drone on and on about the many he had killed. He was not a normal human. He was a powerful figure, able to kill anyone, but he could not control himself. He had gone over the plans enough times to know that there were only 64 cops in that Northern Irish station, meaning that he had killed 20 of his best men. "Oh well" he said to himself as he approached the doorway, "It doesn't matter how many I killed, what matters is that no one sees the true point of today." He knocked on the door because he needed to be quiet. Hello, Mr. Barmington!" he said cheerily
"Who are you?" the MP replied
"That's not important" He raised his weapon and fired two shots into the MP's chest, the once into his head for good measure. Wouldn't it be great if you could have seen how important freedom is to our people?
