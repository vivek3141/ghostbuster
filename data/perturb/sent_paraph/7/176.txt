You own a camera that reveals the true value of objects through its lens, just like a thermal camera, but instead of heat, it showcases their worth. Rings and jewelry burn bright, signifying their immense value. Plastic waste is hard to see. You've always been cautious never to view a person through it. Until today. You cautiously aim the camera at yourself, because curiosity gets the better of you. It makes you sad to see your reflection, obscure and dull. It's then you realize how little you value yourself; it's time for a change.
