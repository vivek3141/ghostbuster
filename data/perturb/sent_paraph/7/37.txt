I blinked groggily as I awoke to the faint sound of city traffic. Rubbing my eyes, I realized I was no longer in the cozy comfort of my self-driving car. I looked out the window and found myself surrounded by skyscrapers and bustling streets I had never seen before. Panicking, I desperately attempted to recall how I ended up here. The last thing I remembered was programming my destination on the car's console and activating the auto-darkening windows, hoping to catch some sleep during the long journey. But something had clearly gone wrong. I left the vehicle to figure out my current location. The air was filled with unfamiliar scents and the language spoken around me was foreign. As I wandered among the crowds, I noticed the futuristic architecture and advanced technologies that seemed centuries ahead of my time. My mind raced with questions. Where was I? How had I ended up in a time so distant from my own? I thought of my loved ones as I traveled further away from home. I had tears in my eyes as I hoped for familiarity. There was a glimpse of curiosity within me. Embracing this new reality, I decided to make the most of my unexpected journey. I wanted to leave a mark on the future that had become my destination.
