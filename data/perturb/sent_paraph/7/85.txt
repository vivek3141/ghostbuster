It all happened so fast. Thats all I could think about as my feet thundered across the rubble stricken ground, I couldn't see anyone else about, at least.. anyone able to move. The bodies of the people who didn't make it were crunched up into corners. If you accidentally walked into a patch of the thick white smoke, it would make you cough and make you light headed for a while. But long time exposure could leave the person unable to move and they would eventually go insane, stuck sitting down occasionally laughing. Who thought legalising weed would do this?
