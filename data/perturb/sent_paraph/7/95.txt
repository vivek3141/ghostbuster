With the current broad variety of species, as well as the emergent news about the species that are on the verge of extinction due to the impact of the changes in the environment, one might believe that discovering new animals is no longer a possibility. However, new species are still discovered regularly, the recent incredible find being an example of that. The fuzzy orange bat, also known as the Nimba myotis, has been identified as a new species this year. Having orange fur with black pigmentation, Nimba Myotis represents a rather unusual specimen of bats. The animal prefers natural caves as the place where it lives and rests. Laryngeal echolocation is used by Nimba Myotis to identify and catch prey in the dark. Due to the species being under researched, its diet is mostly unknown. Overall, the bat represents a unique specimen in its class. The species belongs to the animal kingdom, particularly, to mammals of the Chiroptera order and the Vespertilionidae family (Simmons et al., 2021). The fact that Nimba Myotis is a mammal is the main reason for placing it in the animal kingdom. The species reproduces sexually, unlike members of other kingdoms, and is multicellular. Furthermore, the fact that cells in Nimba Myotis do not have cell walls, allows classifying it with other species in the Animal kingdom. The bat should be defined as a mammal. Furthermore, one should note that, being a bat, Nimba Myotis represents the largest order in the mammal class after rodents (Simmons et al., 2021). The discovery of Nimba Myotis has shed a lot of light on the species of bats.
