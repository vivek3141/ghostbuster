Level 49 Paladin, schizophrenic calling's, walking through this wall-things all day to come to grips with my prowess. Parents with a pocket full of apocalypse and a head full of spaces, please don't let the boogey man boogie in your closet, you must have forgot to lock it. Another jesus bracelet broke, another spirit invoked, hold on to hope so faith can poke it's head into the realm of the dead. I watch a child teeter on the edge, hold hands with me and the rest of your invisible friends. It's better to break than continue to bend, snap your soul in two and let it heal. What I saw? What was it truly doing what it did? There was something hidden inside of my mind and it woke me up. War of the world's, obsolete factions matching gains and comparing beef-sticks, equipped to rip shit like weaklings. Try not to be so literal, try not to feel intangibles as they creep up your spine, just trust in the sky and the stars will align. I ain't no judge, I ain't no jury, I'm just a boy walkin with a vision too blurry to comprehend foe from friend and truth from trend but then again I can close my eyes and count to ten.. no fingers required, no toes to slow my numeral crusade, okay?
