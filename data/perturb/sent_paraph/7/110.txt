Dyslexia affects children with normal eyesight and intellect in different ways, such as an inability to read or acquire words. Coaching or a specialized educational intervention may help most children with Dyslexia to perform better in school. According to the article, Learning difficulties are one of the many consequences of Dyslexia. Since reading is a fundamental ability in so many areas, a kid with a learning disability will have a hard time keeping up with their classmates. In the absence of treatment, Dyslexia may lead to poor self-esteem, behavioral issues such as anxiety or anger, as well as detachment from peers and teachers, and parents. When Dyslexia is not diagnosed and addressed throughout the childhood, it may lead to long-term issues in adulthood. The chances of children succeeding in life are reduced if they cannot learn to read and comprehend. The author explains that Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) may make Dyslexia more difficult to cure by causing difficulties in maintaining focus, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. If siblings and parents suffer from the same condition, children with Dyslexia are more likely to experience learning challenges. Furthermore, men are more likely than females to suffer from Dyslexia; however, the disorder affects people of all ages, socioeconomic, and ethnic backgrounds. Children born with dyslexia struggle with reading, understanding, and spelling. The article expands my topic understanding in several ways. People with Dyslexia have a real personality and are great empaths. Children might be able to empathise with those struggling with writing and reading difficulties. The articleâ€™s strength is that it has discussed the causes and effects of Dyslexia with the right age bracket consideration, that is, from age 4 to 10. The weakness of the article is that it generalized the genders without being specific, and that it only mentioned that Dyslexia is more experienced in males than females. Concerning race, there is a sparse number of research papers regarding Dyslexia among black children and its consequences. Dyslexia mainly affects white children than black children, and thus the article addresses white children widely. I will use this article as part of my capstone project by generating public health education proposal on Dyslexia to prevent the public from viewing Dyslexia as a curse.
