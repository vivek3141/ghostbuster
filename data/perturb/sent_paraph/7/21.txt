The end of the Great Depression was helped by the acts and laws of President Franklin Roosevelt. Through his New Deal programs and policies, Roosevelt brought about social and economic change that helped restore the nation’s stability and spurred progress. Immigrants faced discrimination during the Great Depression. The National Origins Act of 1934 was signed by President Roosevelt. This act ensured fair treatment of immigrants and promoted equality. Moreover, the creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) within the New Deal aimed to provide work opportunities, housing, and education for millions of young unemployed men, many of whom were immigrants. The CCC not only put food on their tables but also gave them a sense of belonging and hope for a better future. African Americans, who were disproportionately affected by economic disparities and racial discrimination, also benefited from Roosevelt’s policies. His administration established the National Youth Administration (NYA), which provided jobs and educational opportunities for young African Americans. In addition, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) employed thousands of African American workers, allowing them to contribute to the nation's infrastructure while earning a living. Roosevelt understood the importance of economic opportunities for African Americans and actively supported the establishment of fair labor practices, ensuring that they were included in the New Deal programs. Workers, who were at the epicenter of the economic crisis, witnessed significant improvements due to Roosevelt’s intervention. Workers were guaranteed the right to join unions under the National Industrial Recovery Act. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) introduced minimum wage laws and set limits on working hours, consequently improving the quality of life for workers across the nation. In conclusion, President Franklin Roosevelt’s acts and laws had a transformative impact on the nation’s recovery from the Great Depression. His New Deal programs, including the National Origins Act, CCC, NYA, WPA, NIRA, and FLSA, were instrumental in providing relief, economic opportunities, and social reforms. The initiatives played a crucial role in improving the lives of immigrants, African Americans, and workers, ultimately bringing about a significant societal change and setting the foundation for a more inclusive and prosperous America.
