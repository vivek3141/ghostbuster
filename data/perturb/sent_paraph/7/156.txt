"You ready yet? I'm about to leave!" "Yeah, I just need to find my keys in this mess.. Do you want to me to follow?" She asks as she rummages through her purse. "Yeah that's fine. Being careful behind the wheel is important. See you soon! I get in my car and buckle up. God I hate these drives now that we're older. When I was younger, I used to be able to pick up my sister from my mom at the same time and not have to worry about traffic or work. But then again, there used to be a time before that...when my parents were together. *sigh* Nothing we can do now huh.. Landon st. left and, what was it, Jefferson Rd right? I check the rearview more than the actual road. I don't like driving. Damn, that new red mustang looks awesome...seems to be going a bit too fast too....
Oh god,
Please
I look back the the rearview, slow down sis...This guy seems to be either stupid or dru - before I can look back again I hear the sound of glass shattering and metal grinding against itself, breaks screeching. No, no no no no no....
