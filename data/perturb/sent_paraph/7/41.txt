Budgetary control can be made effective with an organizational structure. Permanent specific concerns, such as a finance committee and a budget director, should be established. To avoid bottlenecks, budget planning must be well integrated. Budgets for individuals should be harmonized with each other. Budgets must be reviewed on a regular basis to avoid them from devolving into a license to spend the entire authorized amount even when it is not necessary. According to Dauda (2019), “business organizations of all types must engage in financial planning at whatever level to ensure judicious deployment of resources for achieving organisational goals.” Workers should be appropriately compensated for performance in accordance with the budget. Sloppy staff, on the other hand, should not go condemned. Behavioral Aspects of Budgetary Control
Budgetary control is a crucial instrument for performance evaluation. Nevertheless, findings take time to appear. Those in charge of fiscal control should have extensive knowledge and expertise in the subject. Workers are changing their working practices because of their finances. Workers may be reluctant to change. The creation of each budget is supported by top leadership. Each employee’s requirements are fully described and distributed in a formal structure. They will be aware of their power and responsibilities if this is the case. A financial management program’s effectiveness depends on the organization’s defined objectives. As a result, when establishing targets, management should exercise caution. Furthermore, the aims are explicit.
