What do you think about the fence on the roof? Character 2 - Stop people from falling, or suicide I suppose. Would a fence stop someone from committing suicide? Maybe get them to use a different building. They don't want it to be their problem. Maybe if someone did, they wouldn't need the fences anymore.
