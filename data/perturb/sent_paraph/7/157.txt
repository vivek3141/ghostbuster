They always say in fairytales that when a loved one falls into a deep sleep, there's a way to break the curse. Kisses, a spell, a potion, just that there's something out there. But in real life, all we can do is dream. When I saw him fall asleep early after a rough day at work I smiled and thought how adorable he looked hugging the pillow with a strange intensity. It feels like something is holding on to that pose. I heard that it's contagious. That the entire ward of the hospital we transported him to was shut down after doctors started dropping to the floors, fast asleep, in the middle of their rounds. The entire place was locked down. There are hundreds of people in comas. Public advised to stay indoors." And so I did. Every piece of media I look to continues to cover the story as more and more people are dropping into deep sleep throughout the country. My husband is listed as patient zero in a few reports. Initial patients are slow to die from lack of food and water. This entire epidemic is driving me crazy. I can't leave the house, I can't go to work. The normal sounds of community have just dropped. The entire city has become a waking nightmare. Well, maybe a better choice of words would suffice. But I have my fairytales, and I don't think I'm okay with staying inside for any longer. Prince Charming will always find a way to do it. Doing something. Anything. Because I am so very tired, and I don't want to wake up in a world like this.
