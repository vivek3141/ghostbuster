In order to crack down on drug traffickers, the country has decided to overturn its ban on extradited people. The move is facing backlash from drug traffickers who are seeking to prevent the extradition of their associates. The ban was put in place in the 1990s as a way to protect the country's sovereignty. However, it has since become a roadblock in the fight against drug trafficking. Colombian authorities have found it difficult to prosecute drug traffickers who flee the country when they are under investigation. The current administration is pushing for the ban to be overturned. The country's top court has now approved the move, allowing for the extradition of Colombian nationals who are wanted by foreign countries for drug trafficking. Drug trafficking organizations in the country have responded with force. Just this week, a car bomb exploded in the capital of Bogota, killing several people and injuring dozens more. The National Liberation Army is believed to have ties to drug traffickers. Colombia has long struggled with drug trafficking, which has fueled violence and corruption in the country. The government has made strides in recent years to combat the issue, but it is an ongoing battle. It is seen as a crucial step in the fight against drug traffickers. The government hopes it will encourage drug traffickers to think twice before engaging in illegal activities. However, the move is not without controversy. Some critics argue that it could lead to a destabilization of the country. They say that drug traffickers will seek revenge on those who cooperate with authorities, and that it could lead to an escalation of violence. President Duque made it clear that he was not going to back down. He thinks the move will send a message to drug traffickers that their reign of terror is over. "We will not allow drug traffickers to continue to operate with impunity in our country," he said in a statement. "This is a critical step in our fight against drug trafficking, and we will do whatever it takes to bring those responsible to justice." The move has been lauded by many in the international community, who see it as a bold step in the fight against drug trafficking. The United States has provided funding and resources to help fight the issue. Colombia is making progress in its fight against drug trafficking, but it is clear that there is still a long way to go. The government's decision to lift the extradition ban is a positive step, but it is also one that comes with risks. The country will need to remain vigilant as it takes on this difficult task.
