Home decorating giants ICI Paints and Black & Decker hope their new product to be launched on Wednesday won't make a splash. The two companies have invested two years and millions of pounds in developing the Black & Decker Paintmate, a battery-operated roller system they claim will take the pain out of painting. The Paintmate, which will be sold in do-it-yourself stores across Britain from April, uses an air-filled bellow system to squeeze the contents of a two-litre refill bag of Dulux paint down a tube and onto a roller. The Paintmate can be strapped on to the back to eliminate bending over. Black & Decker spokesman Richard Sanderson told Reuters, "It is a long time since the DIY market saw a product of such significance." Sanderson said the companies hoped to sell 500,000 of the British-designed, Chinese-made Paintmates in the first full year in Britain, together with a million bags of paint. Paintmate will be rolled out across western Europe next year, after which attention will switch to the huge U.S. home improvement market. ICI, which sells enough paint in the UK to decorate five million homes a year, hopes the product will revolutionise the way people decorate. Chris Harris, ICI Decorative Paints international marketing director, said that people will find it fun. The whole system could be flushed out. "We think people would redecorate more regularly if the painting process was quicker and easier," he added. The Paintmate's promoter is hoping for an increase in Britain's housing market.
