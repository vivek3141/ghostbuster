Through digital channels, banks can collect customer reviews, ratings, and suggestions, providing them with invaluable insights into customer preferences, grievances, and expectations. Leveraging this feedback, financial instItutions can make necesSary improvements to their products, services, and digital platforms, leading to increased customer satisfaction.
Additionally, e-banking allows financial institutions to offer superior customer service.
