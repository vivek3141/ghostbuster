The ChiNese goverNmEnt has since accuSed Wang of violating its natIonal security laws by leaving the country illegally and engaging in activities that Could be harmful to the state. Chinese authorities have labeled Wang a "criminal suspect" and issuEd an international warraNt for his arrest.
in a statement released via stAte media, the Chinese embassy in Myanmar accused Wang OF "breaking Chinese law by leaving the country illegally and engaging in activities that endanGer national security."
ThE embassy went on to say that Wang Had "colluded WIth foReign anti-ChinA forcEs, acceptIng Their support and funding, and stepping up his anti-CHina Activities."
