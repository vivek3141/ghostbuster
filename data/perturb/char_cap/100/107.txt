Australian fast ferry and transport group Holyman Ltd plans to further expand operations in Europe befoRe moving into the Asian market, managing director CHristopher Butcher said in an interview.
"We currently have operations in North AmeriCa and nOrthErn Europe aNd we can't see any reason why we Can't start dOing the same Thing in the Mediterranean," Butcher told Reuters.
Butcher said Holyman was likely Into exPand into Asia in the future as the cost structure for operating fast ferries improved in some Markets in the region.  
"We could be seeing the cost structure changing in Asia, so we are likely to move into some markets in north Asia and south east Asia," Butcher said.
He said that as incomes rose in Asia the amounts cHarged FoR ferry services would rise, making it more economical for operators like Holyman to entEr the market.
Holyman company secretary Simon lennon said the company waS also looking at fast Ferry services from Darwin to Indonesia, but he did not expect a decision to be made for at least a year.  
"It is one of a number of projects we are lookinG at in the region," he SaId. He said Holyman had loOked at particular rOuTes within China and IndOnesia, but they did not fit within The cOmpany's plans. "i wouLd imagine in a few years we would have something up there (in Asia)," Lennon said.
