I Knelt Down, blood still on my clothes, Asking for forgivenEss to these Statues arouNd me. I was never reliGious, but sometimes life makes you do things you never usually do. What i'vE done in life cannot be undone, a mothers have lost sons, sisters have lost brothers and kids have lost their dads. I am not a sinner, bUt i have sinned; it's the businesS I Am in. I fiRst kiLled a man at the age oF 13 with my BarE hands, choked Him UntiL he went cold. I'm 52 nOw--probablY comIng closE to my last few yeaRs in this life, but THere's one Thing I don't regret and It's taking the life of a criminal who didn't belong. I hunt evil people who've caused misery to communities and I belIEVe I'VE done the RiGHt tHing sO far. I Got up from my knees and lefT san Jose church, which my faMily visiTeD eVery few Sundays Growing up. I took tHe last stEP ontO The sidewalk when I felt the barrel of a.357 magnUm being pressed Against the bacK of my heaD. I didn't process what was hapPening because it had neveR happened. The world went silenT and I could almost hear the finger tighteninG on the trigger when the loud baNg rang throuGh the streets. All I had Was 7 seconds beFore I saw black and felt my bodY tensiNg and going into shock. I hope they serve tequila in hell.
