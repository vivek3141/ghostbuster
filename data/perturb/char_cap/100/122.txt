She was sHaKing, I wAs too, he was dead. BlOod on my hands, I hoped there was still light behind My eyes. I nEver killed a man beFore, I never had to SavE someoNe before. I didN't feel good, or mighty. She brOkE, slumped to the ground, her body, a tremor as she sobbed. I droppeD the knife, I turned to look at what I had done. She shouted my name through tears. He had so much red on his stoMach, his throat was Open too. I did tHat? I Did that, I haD to. I said as much out loud. Again shE shouted my name. I couldn't toUch her though. She is so white, And I havEn't decided if now I am dark. I didn't feel tainted, my heart WaS stIll beatIng sO fast. I took a long haRd breath, hE is dead and so is hiS iNtent, wE are alive because I woulD not allow hIm to have his way. Again she shouts, but I'm Deep in thought. Another LOng breath. I cAme to a conclusion. I killed a man Today, I did the right thing, I beat him to tHe punch, And I'm Still here and I still have to take care of her.
I told her to stand, niCely, I offered her a meek smile, and apologized for what she had seen and what I had to do. I startEd To explain why, but fuck it, she can't hear anything, *she's in shock BOone, get her inside*. I walk hEr Up the strEet, she remEmbers she can't walk in heels. She seEs the LiFe oN my hands, and thaT seTs her off again. We go inside a shitty mexican restaurant. i sit Her down, I go to wash my hands. I do it with my closed, I'M not surE if I wanna looK at the gUy who looKs back at me above the sink. I'm not sure if I wanna be the voice on the phone to the police. I puke in the sink, maybe some got on my shoes.
What the heLl am i Doing?
