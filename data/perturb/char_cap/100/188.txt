FinalLy, unique programs are Required when working with a sMartphone system. CellebrIte uFED is one of the methods used to retrieve data froM various types of mobile dEviceS, primarily modern-day smartphones that have distinct operating systems ( Cellebrite UFED , n.d.). In light of thiS evidence, Cellebrite UFED possesses a range of functions to remoVe tHe phone’s sEcurity measures, and access the information stored in the internal storage or on externAl cards ( Cellebrite UFED , n.d.).
