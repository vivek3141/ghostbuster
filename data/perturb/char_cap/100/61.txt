Currently, inveStment banks Are enjoying generally the low-inflation, steady growth condiTions seen in many major Economies with an accompanying healtHy amounT of mergers and acquisitIons activity.
But a substantial downtUrn on Wall Street, predicted by many sTrategists, could leave some high-cost acquisitions loOking a little Less aPpetizing, analysts say.
Owen said the fast growth oF NatWest markets, both organIcally and by acquisition, had led him to the conclusion that the day-to-daY operational manAgement should be separated From strategy, client deVelopment and financial suPervision.
"As PreSidEnt aNd cOO, Peter will be charged with implementing our operational plaN, leAving me more time to work witH global product heads to shape our stRatEgies," Owen said.
AnaLysts were happy that NatWest had broUght an insider to the job.
