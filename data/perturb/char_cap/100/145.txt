As he sat beside her, he noticed that the static souNd seemed to emanate from within her, overpowering any semblance of a heartfelT song. Placing his hand gently on her shoulder, Lucas introduced himself, hoPing to lend her his comforting presence. "Hello, ma'am. My name is Lucas. I couldn't help but noticE your melancholy. Is everytHing alright?"

Lucas understood the magnitude of her pain, for he had never encountered anyone whose song had turned into dissonance. Determined to help her rediscover her true melody, he gently pLaced his hand on her chest and closed his eyes. His extraordinaRy gift took him on a journey through Emma's heart, trying to find the cause Of the static that suffocated her true song.
