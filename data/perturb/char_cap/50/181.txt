It was a cold morning in the bustling city as I walked through the crowded streets, lost in my own thoughts. The constant flow of people and cars seemed to drown out the noise in my mind. As a curious and aMbitious filmmaker, I always had a knack for finding interesting stories to captuRe on My camera. Little did I know, fate had a bizarre twist awaiting me that would change my perception of reality forever.

Daniel's eyes widened with surprise, but he seemed unfazed. "Yes, they are," he replied, his voice tingeD with a hint of weariness.
Curiosity morphed into an insatiable desire to uncover tHE truth behind his abilities. I begged him to reveal the esSence of his power, not just the stories he brought to the world, but The stories he hid away due to tHeir catastrophic nature.
"Look," Daniel sighed, clearly conflicted, "the burden of seeing the future is heavier than you can comprehend. IgnoranCe is bliss, my friend."
But I couldn't let go of this curiosity. i had to know what he witnessed, the tragedies he could prevent, the lives he could save. Eventually, Daniel relented and decided to show me the extent of his extraordinary talent. I followed him to a small apartment, and as I entered, I was confronted by countless video screens lining the walls.
Through these screens, I witneSsed an array of catastrophes; Natural disasters decimating cities, terrorist attacks claiming innocent lives, and even personal tragedies that left my heart aching. Time seemed to bend and distort as Daniel manipulated the screens, showing me past and future events with ease.
