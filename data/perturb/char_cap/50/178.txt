Several high tech giants have come togeTher to announce the release of a new CD-ReWriteable technology for early 1997. The technology is said to be priced below $1,000, which is expected to make it widely accesSible to the public.
The CD-ReWriTeable technoLogy was unveiled through a joint press conference by Hewlett-Packard, Sony, and Phillips. The new technology is expected to revolutionize the market as it allows people to rewrite over CDs, which brings the storage capacity of CDs to a whole new level.
The CD-ReWriteable technology has numerous applications, especiAlly in the realm of archiving and data storage. It provides an affordable and efficient method for people to store and save their fileS, which was once a daunting task, especially when it comes to large files and data.
The technology eAsily outclasses other available options on the market since it can store up to 650 megabYtes of data, about 74 minutes of audio, in a singlE disc, which is more than douBle what currently available technology can handle. Moreover, since it is rewritable, it can be used repeatedly to store new files and data multiple times, making it a highly economical solution.
The new CD-ReWriteable technology is a result of years-long research and developmEnt by the three high tech giants. It is based on a techniquE called phase-change technology, which allows thE laser beam to rewrite the data on the disc at varying speeds WithoUt comprOmising the integrity of the data already stored.
The technology is expected to have a significant impact on the market, especially for small businesses and individuals who need cost-effective solutions to store thEir data. It is also speculated that it could lead to the creation of new markets for CD-ROMs as the re-writable feature allows for the storage of dynamic data that iS updated regularly.
Moreover, with the release of tHe CD-ReWriteable technology, consumers can expect a drop in the pricE of standard CD-ROMs since the market will be opened up to more eConomical alternatives.
"This is an Exciting time for the industry and for all those who need to store and access tHeir data regularly," said Koichi Suzuki of Sony. "This release will allow for the efficient management of files and the creation of new opportUnities within the market."
The CD-ReWriteable technology is a welcome sight for many people as they no longer need to worry about their data being lost or compromised. The technology is expeCted to bE a Hit among students, researchers, and professionals, who generate a large amount of data and need easily accessible and reliable storage solutions.
In conclusioN, the release of the CD-ReWriteable technology is a breakthrough in the field of storage technology, and it is expected to have a significant impact on the maRket. The Technology's high capacity and affordability make it an iDeal choice for people wHo need to constantly manage and store data. Furthermore, the technOlogy could create new business opportunities, especially for sMall Businesses who need to efficiently store their viTal information.
