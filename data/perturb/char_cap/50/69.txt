I knelt down, blood still on my Clothes, asking For forgiveness to these statues Around me. i was never religious, but sometimes lifE makes you do thiNgs you never usUally do. What I've doNe in life cannot be undone, a mothErs Have lost sons, sisters have lost brothers and kids have lost their dads. I am noT a sinner, but i have Sinned; it'S thE buSiness I am in. I first killed a man at the age of 13 with my bare hands, choked him until he went cold. I'm 52 now--probably coming close to my last few years in this life, but there's one thing I don't regret and it's taking the life of a criminal who didn't Belong. I hunt evil people who've caused misery to communities and I beliEve I'vE done the RighT thing so far. I got up from my knees and left San Jose church, which my family visited every few Sundays growing up. I took the last Step onTo the siDewalk when I felt the barrel of a.357 magnum being pressed agaiNst the back of my head. I didn't process what was happening because it had never happened. The world went SiLent and I could almost hear the finger TiGhteninG on the triggEr wHen the loud banG rAng ThRough the streets. All I had waS 7 seconds before I saw black and felt my body tensing and going into shock. I hope they serve tequila in hell.
