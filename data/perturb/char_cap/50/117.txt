‘ …and we'll have an interView witH him and his priZe marrow at around a quarter to eight. The time is six-fifty-five, and this is BBC Southern Counties RaDio. ’
The daiLy news blares over the radio. Light rolls thRough the curTains. I turn over in bed. Just another Monday moRning. Minutes pass, and I hear all the familiar sound. Cars on the road outside. My Flatmates stirring in their rooMs. The world is waking up.
I struggle out from my cocoon of blankets and Into the cold of my bEdroom. I like it that way. Every night I open the my window, to Let the night in. Every morning the chill startles me awake. I open tHe curtains, look out onto tHe street. The usual crowd waltz down the street, GoinG wHerever it is they go. Someone glances up at my window, and hurriedly looks away as they realise I'm half naked.
As I walk across the room something cRunches unDerfoot. A smaLl, folded piece of paper on the floor. My naMe is Written on it, in my Own handwriting. I Pick it Up, sCrutinise it. I don't remember writing this. I oPen it, and read tHe words inside.
*Act normally, otheRwise they'll notice. *
I'm confused. I really don't recall writing this. What does it mean? Who are ‘ tHey ’? the questions are rattled from my head bY a knock at my bedroom door. My flatmAtE.
‘ Huney, are you ok in there? YOu'll be laTe. ’
I look at the note again. And heSitate.
