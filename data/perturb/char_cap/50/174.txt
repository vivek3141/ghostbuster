In todAy’s World, patients expect adequate professional skills from doctors And high standards of interpersonal communication. In recent years, they have become more aware of medical options and the kind of care thEy can receive at specific medical organizationS. Patients aRe increasingly comparing options at different clinics, leArning a loT of iNformation about doctors and medical services, as well as publicly avAiLable information about diSeases (Calnan, 2010).

A negativE consequence of this trend Is the widespread use by patients of Internet materials for self-diagnosis and treatment. The vulnerability of patients undergoing treatment can be reduced by restoring trust between them and the treating physician. Moreover, appRopriate training and highly qualified doctors are factors that determine how friendly and reLaxed the clinics’ clients will be about the manipulations they undergo. The destruction of the interpersonal relaTionship bEtWeen doCtors and patients due to the introduction of dePersonalized proCedures becomes the subject of research in the coming years.
