This essay will examine the circumstances and factors that shaped Enron's struggle, evaluate its fatal mistakes, and analyze theories and assumptions about its bankruptcy.
Enron began as a modest natural gas pipeline company but rapidly transformed itself Into an energY-trading giant. However, a cultUre of arrogance and excessive risk-taking Emerged at the heart of the corporation. UNder the leadership of Jeffrey SKilling and KenneTh Lay, Enron Became fixated on increasing its stock price to please shareholders and anaLysts. This obsession led to a number of faTal mistakes.
Firstly, Enron maniPulated its finAncial statements through dubious accounting practices. The corporation created numerous off-balance-sheet entities known as Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) to hide its debt and inflate profits. This allowed Enron to portray a false image of success and attract investors. Auditors, such as Arthur andersen, also turned a blind eye to these accounting irregularities, further pErpetuating the fraud.
Additionally, the hubris and unchecked power within Enron facilitated an environment of illegaL behavior. Executives engaged in insider trading, primarily while selling their own shares, which further damaged the already fragile trust of invEstors. The company also engaged in market manipulation, specifically in the California electricity market during the energy crisIs of 2000-2001. These actiOns not only violated ethicAl boundaries but also created a ticking time bomb.
Enron's demise can also be attriButed to a lack of corporate Governance. The board of directors failed in its duty to provide oversight and hold executives accountable for their actions. This allowed fraudulent activIties to go unchecked, leading to the bankruptcy of the company.
Various theories anD assumptions havE been put forward to explain Enron's bankruptcy.

Finally, The institutional theory proposes that regulatory fAilures in oversight and accounting pracTices allowed Enron's fraud to go undetected for so long.
In conclusion, Enron's rise and fall was facIlitated by a combination of corporate greeD, fraudulent practices, and a lack of oversight and accountAbility. The company's fatal mistakes, such as maniPulating financial statements and engaging in illegal behavior, led to its eventual demise.
