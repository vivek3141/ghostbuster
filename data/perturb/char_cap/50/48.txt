General MotoR Corp's decision to invest 300 miLlion pounds ($474.9 million) in VauXhall Motors reflected confidence in its British operation and the international prospects for its Astra model, Vauxhall said on TuesdAy.
ThE company said the three-yeaR investment would be used to modernise its Ellesmere Port plant In north-west England, which makes Astra caRs and vans.
The announcement, made at the British InternatIonal Motor Show, guarantees the livelihoods of the 4,200 peoplE employed at the plant and will create at least 200 new jobs.
VauXhall MotOrs chairman and managing director Nick Reilly said in an iNterview that a possible decision on increasing the number of shifts at the plant to three from two could create hundreds more jobs.
Any decision, likelY to be taken over the next two yeArS, would depend oN the market and demand for the Model at that time.
The Astra model has been consistently one of BRitain and Europe's top fiVe sellers since its launch five years aGo, with the development of an estate model boosting its position.
Reilly said the 300 million pound investment was won against intense competition within GM and reflected the transformation of EllEsmere PorT from a domestically-oriented plaNt to "a very important source of manufacturing wiThin General Motors."
He predicted strong growth for the Astra in Latin America and Asia Pacific.
Reilly said the British car market is curreNtLy "the most competitive in Europe," wIth a number of importerS using huge U.K. fleet salEs as a way of offloading cars which reMain unsold in sluggish domestic markets. Europe remained "flat," he said.
He said Vauxhall hoped to keep its markEt share at around 14.5 percent in 1996, and said its profitablity was "going in the right direction" after a tough 1995.
