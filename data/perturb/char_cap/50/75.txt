It always puzzled me, to say the least, and mAde me extremely nervous.
As such I never cOmmitted into Relationships, probably by great of hAving my feelings not reciprocated.
My loNgest relaTionship was with a Man I loved deeply, Indy. He was the complete opposite of me: extraVerted, charming, ouTgoing. He was friend with everyone, but still reliable and generous.
We stayed together for a couple of yEaRs, and, I don't know why, but it reallY Seemed like he had feelings for me.
But like I did in other relationships before, I shut him down, rEjecting him when i fElt my feelings grOwing to much.
In the end he left me, like they all did. I learned later that he WaS with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of time when we werE together.
I met other men and women, and it always ended the same Way.
FasT forward to yestErday. Kelly calls me, saying that indY was in the hospital, after being hit by a car. His condItion was critical, and he has asked for me.
And here I am, a bouquet Of flowers in hAnds, nervously lookIng for room 68.
I find it, half opened, and take a deep breath to give myself courage, and here Indy's weak voice.
"Kelly, you're...a wonderFul girl but...I...I...I never lOved you."
The woRds hit me like a punCh. I storm in the room, but his eyes Are already closed. Forever.
