It always Puzzled me, to say the least, and made me extrEmely nervous.
As such I never committed into relationships, probably by great of having my feelings not reciprocated.
My longest relationship was with a man I loved deeply, Indy. He was the complete opposite of me: extraverted, charming, Outgoing. He was friend with everyone, but still reliable and generous.
We stayeD together for a couple of years, and, I don't know whY, but it really seemed like he had feelings For me.
But likE I did in other relationships before, I shut him down, rejecting him wHen I fElt my feelings growing to much.
In the end he left me, like they all did. I learned lAter that he was with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of time when we were together.
I met other men anD women, and it always ended the same way.
Fast forward to yesterday. Kelly calls me, saying that Indy was in the hospiTal, after being hit by a car. His condition was critical, and he has asked for me.
And here I am, a bouquet of flowers in hands, neRvously looking for room 68.
I find it, half opened, and take a deeP breath to givE myself courage, and here Indy's weak voice.
"Kelly, you're...a wonderful girl but...I...I...I never loved you."
The words hit me like a punch. I storm in the room, but hIs eyes are already closed. Forever.
