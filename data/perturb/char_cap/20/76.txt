In Plato's Gorgias, the philosophical dialogue between Socrates, Gorgias, Polus, and Callicles revolves around the nature and purpose of rhetoric and Oratory skills. Plato, through Socrates, criticizes the opportunistic Use of rhetoric for personal gain and highlights the importance of truth and jUstice in public speaking.
Socrates argues that rhetoric is mere flattery and a dangerous art if used without moral considerations. He emphasizes the need for orators to seek truth and pursue the greater good rather than manipulate people's emotions For self-serving purposes. This can be seen when Socrates questions Gorgias about the aim of rhetoric, revealing that Gorgias is more focused on the power it gives him rather than its ethical implications.
Similarly, tHe film "Thank You for Smoking" provides a satirical take on the power of rhetoric in modern society. Nick Naylor, the protagonist, utilizes his proficient oratory skills as a spokesperson for the tobacco industry. He deceives the public by presenting strong arguments in favor of smoking, manipulating statistics, and using persuasive techniques. NaylOr embodies the Opportunistic rhetoric that Plato criticizes, as he prioritizes His personal gains over the well-being and truthfulness of his discOurse.
However, Plato's Socrates argues that true oratory skills should serve justice and promote genuine knowLedge. He values internal coNsistency and logical coherence over eloquent speeches lacking substance. This can be seen in the dialogue when Socrates questions Callicles, who believes in the superiority of those who can use rhetoric to satisfy their desires. Socrates challenges Callicles to defend his position logically, exposing the flaws in his argument and proving that rhetoric aloNe cannot lead to a just society.
By showing the negative consequences of manipulative rhetoric, "Thank You for Smoking" supports Plato's argument that the power of persuasion must be used ethically. As the film progresses, Naylor experiences a moral awakening and acknowledges thE harmful effects of tobacco products. He realizes that his rhetorical skills can also be used to advocate for consumer safety, shifting from deceitful persuasion to a more righteous oratory.
In conclusion, Plato's Gorgias presents a critical examination of rhetoric and oratory skills, highlighting the importance of truth and justice in public speaking. The film "Thank You for Smoking" provides a contemporary illustration of Plato's arguments, as it explores the deceptive nature of opportunist rhetoric and the potential for individuals to use their skills to pursue moral ends. Both Plato and the film call for a responsible and ethical use of rhetoric, emphaSizing the need to prioritize truth and justice over personal gain.
