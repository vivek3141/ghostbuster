During the Great Depression, immigrants faced immense hardships and discriminatiOn. To address this issue, President RoOsevelt signed the National Origins Act of 1934, which abolished discriminatory quotas based on nationality. This act ensured fair treatmeNt of immigrants and promoted equality. Moreover, the creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) within the New Deal aimed to provide work opportunities, housing, and education for millions of young uneMployed men, many of whom were immigrants. The CCC not only put food on their tables but also gave them a sense of belonging and hope for a better future.
African Americans, who werE disproportionately affected by economic disparities and racial discrimination, also benefited from Roosevelt’s poliCies. His administration established the National YoutH Administration (NYA), which provided jobs and educational opportunities for young African Americans. In addition, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) employed thousands of African American workers, allowing them to contribute to The nation's infrastructure while earning a living. Roosevelt understood the importance of economic opportunities for African Americans and actively supported the establishment of fair labor practices, ensuring that they wEre included in the New DeAl programs.
Workers, who were at the epicenter of the economic crisis, witnessed significant improvements due to Roosevelt’s intervention. He passed the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), which guaranteed workers the right to join unions and engage in collective bargaining. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) inTroduced minimum wage laws and set limits on working hours, consequently improving the quality of life for workers across the nation.
In conclusion, President Franklin Roosevelt’s acts and laws had a transformative impact on the nation’s recovery from the Great Depression.
