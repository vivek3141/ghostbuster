General Motor Corp's decision to invest 300 million pounds ($474.9 million) in Vauxhall Motors reflected confidence in Its British operation and the international prospects for its Astra model, Vauxhall said on Tuesday.
The compAny said the three-year investment would be used to modernise its Ellesmere Port plant in north-west EnglAnd, which makes Astra cars and vans.
The announcement, made at the BrItish International Motor Show, guarantEes tHe livelihoods of the 4,200 people employed at the plant and will create at least 200 new jobs.

Any decision, likely to be taken over the next twO years, would depend on the market and demand for the model at that time.
The Astra model has been consistently one of Britain and Europe's top five sellers since its launch five years ago, with the development Of an estate model boosting its position.
Reilly said the 300 million pound investment was won against intense competition within GM and reflected the transformation of EllEsmere Port from a domestically-oriented plant to "a very important source of manufacturing within General Motors."
He predicted strong growth for the Astra in Latin America and Asia Pacific.
