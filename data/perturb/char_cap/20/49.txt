Sorry to be so dOur, but I had to wRite something for that first 3-panel:
[1]
Character 1 - What do you think the fences On The roof are For?
Character 2 - StoP peOpLe from falling, or suicide I suppose.
[2]
ChAracter 1 - Would a fence rEally stop someone bent on killing themselves?
Character 2 - No, maybe get 'em to use a different building tHoUgh. They just don't want it to be thEir problem to Deal with.
[3] Character 2 has walked off screen
Character 1 - Maybe if someone did, they wouldn't need the fences anymore...
