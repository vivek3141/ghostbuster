she waS shaKing, i was too, he was dead. Blood on my hanDs, I hoped therE was STill light behind my eyes. I NevEr killed a Man before, I neVer had to save somEone bEfore. I didN't feel good, or mighty. She broke, slumped to thE gRound, her body, a tremOr as SHe soBbed. i Dropped the knIfe, I turnEd to loOk at what I had done. She shouted My namE through tearS. He haD so mUch red on his stomach, his throat was open too. I did that? I did ThaT, i had tO. I Said aS Much out loud. Again she shouted my Name. I couldn't toUcH her though. SHe Is so white, aNd I haven't decided if now I am dark. I didn't feel Tainted, my heart Was sTIlL beaTing so fast. I TOok a long hard breath, he is dead and sO is his intent, we arE alivE beCAUse I Would not allow Him to have hiS way. again she shoutS, But I'm deep in thought. Another LoNg breaTh. I came to a cOnclusIon. I killed a man today, I did the riGht thing, I beat him to the punch, and I'm stilL Here and I stIll have to take care of Her.
I told her to sTand, nICelY, i offered her a meek smile, And Apologized for what sHe had seen anD what I had tO dO. I started to expLain wHy, but fuck it, she can't heAr anything, *she's IN SHock Boone, get her inside*. I walk her up the street, she remEMbers she cAn't walk in heels. SHe sees the life on my hands, and that sets her off again. We go inside a ShitTy meXican restaurant. I siT Her down, I go to Wash my hands. i do it wIth my cLosEd, I'm not surE if I WannA look at the Guy who Looks bacK at me Above the sink. I'm not surE if I wAnna be the voIce on the phone to the police. I puke iN the sink, mAybe some got on my shoEs.
what the hell am I DoinG?
