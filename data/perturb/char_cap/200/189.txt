The move into bankiNg is a major straTegic shift for SaInsbury's, whIch has beeN steadily expandiNG its financial services offErIng over the pasT decade.

industry exPeRts have praised SainsBury's for beinG the first of the big four suPermarKets to launch its Own fulL-service bank.

Its established customer base gives it an advantage over other new entrants, and the partnership wIth BAnk of SCOtland should ensure a smOoth launch." 
However, others have warned that Sainsbury's may strugglE to compeTe with the big banks, which have much larger customer bases and more resources. David WatTS, a banking consultaNt at Mckinsey, said: "Sainsbury'S will need to offer something truly unIque to entice customers away from the established banks. It will also need to invest heavily in customer service and technology to stay competitive." 
despite the challenges, SainsBury's is opTimistIc about the potential of its banking offering. According to a recent survey by the superMarket, nearly half of its customers saId they woUld be interested in using iTs banking services. SainsburY's Bank CEO Cathy Smith said: "We belieVE there is a huge opportunity to expand our financial serVices offering and become a major player in the banking market. With our stRong brand and tHe support of Bank of ScotlanD, we are confident oF sucCess."

With its EstaBlished customer base and innovatiVe prOducts, Sainsbury's looks set to shake up the market and give the big bAnks a run for thEir money.
