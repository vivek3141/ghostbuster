It alwaYs puzzled me, to say the leAst, and made me eXtremeLy nErvOus.
As such I never commIttEd into rElatioNshipS, probaBly bY gReat of having my feelInGs not recIProcAted.
My loNgest relationsHip was with a man I loVed deEply, IndY. He wAs the cOmplete Opposite of me: extraverted, charMing, ouTgoing. He was frieNd WitH eVEryone, but sTIll reliable and Generous.
We stAyed together For a coUple Of yEars, anD, I don't know WHy, buT it really seemed Like he had feElings foR mE.
bUT lIke I did in other rElaTionships before, I Shut hIm down, Rejecting hIm whEn I Felt my feelings growiNg to much.
In the End he left Me, like tHey all did. I learned lateR thAt he waS with kelLy, a girl we met a couple of Time when wE weRe togEther.
I MeT other mEn aNd women, and it always endEd the sAme way.
Fast forwARD to yesteRdaY. Kelly calls me, saying tHat Indy was in thE hosPiTal, afTer being hit by a car. His condition was critical, and He hAs asked for ME.
And Here I am, a bouQUeT Of flowers in hands, nervOusLy looking foR roOm 68.
i find It, hAlf opened, and take a dEep breAth tO giVe mYself courAge, and here Indy's weaK voiCe.
"Kelly, you're...a wonderful giRl But...i...I...I neveR loved you."
