China is seT to allow foreign companies to have an expandEd role in thE couNtry's key power sector. This move is part of the gOverNmenT's ongoIng efforts to open up its economy to foreign investment.
the State Council, ChinA'S Cabinet, has approved a draft poliCy tHat would allow foreign companies tO operate anD own a majority stake in power transmission and distribution pRojects in tHe country. This markS a SignIficaNT changE fRom the current PoLicy which Limits foreign ownership to a maximuM of 49%.
Foreign companies will also be allowed to invest in and operate power geneRation projects IN THe country, which was previousLy restricted to domestic fIrms. This is a maJor boost for fOreign fiRms seeking to invest In ChiNa's energy sector, which haS huge growth potential due to thE country's rapid economic deVelopment.

CHina has been TakIng sTeps tO address thesE concerns, includIng announcing plans to lift Restrictions on foreiGn ownership iN A numBer of sectors, including finance, AuTomoTive, and telecOMmunicATions. the Move to allow ForeigN firms to take a biGger role in the power sectoR is seen as a continuation of these efforts.
