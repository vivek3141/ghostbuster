Once upon a tiMe, in a cozy suburban neighborhood, theRe livEd a young family. The parents, Jonathan and Sarah, had recently Welcomed theIr first child, Lucas, into their lives. Alongside them Was their lOyal and playful companion, RuSty, a lively gOlden retriever.
Ever since Lucas was born, Rusty had exhIbited an unCanny level of attAchment to the little boy. They were inseparable, spEnding hours EXploring the bacKYArd, playing fetch, and lauGhing together. However, as Lucas grew oLDer, a peculiar behavior began to emerge. Much to Jonathan and SaraH's surprise, Lucas had deVeloped a fasCinatiOn with thE tOilet and an unsettling haBit of humping objects.
