IN the lateSt drugstore merger to sweep the industry, Rite Aid annouNceD plans to buy ThRifty PayLess for $1.4 billion.

"It IS our belief ThaT our technolOgy is a lot more sophisticatEd Than what is beIng used at Thrifty PayLess and thaT there are significant benefits tHat we can bring -- not only to the store operations, but also to the Customers," Grass said.  
Analysts expect Rite AiD to make signiFiCAnt progresS reduCing the ThRifty PayLess cost struCture even though savings will not come from geographic overlap.  Rite Aid does not have any stoRes in Thirfty PayLess' West Coast markeTs.
"No one is as lean as Rite Aid," said EriC Bosshard of MidWest Research-MAxus group.

Grass addressed thoSe issUes in the conference call, sAying that Rite Aid may add more merchandiSE eXpeRts to assess the DiffErent prodUcts.  
"There are certain linEs of mercHandise thaT we will continue to carry out West that we Don't carry back East," Grass said.
