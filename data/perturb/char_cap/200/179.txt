The book reveals the issue of iNequality frOm multiple angles, and It is demanding to pick Out a few leading ideas, as Tatum tries to cover distinct topics iN a certain number of pages. She staRts with a definition of racism and explains thaT it is challenging to have an honest conversation about race due to iTs negative stigmA. Furthermore, the author’s point is to define the state of dIscrIMination in the couNtry and the world nowadays aNd explore whaT steps need to be takEn to develop identity. The book educates readers on how black people perform in white society and how white ones act iN their community, noting the various subtLeties and characteristics of security and privilege.
Moreover, one of the central themes is the conceRn of patience and silence. People need to understand that black children sit together because theY feel understoOd anD can develop a Part oF their identity that remains unformed without these connecTionS. They think that other individuals are incapable of sharing their vaLues, and therefore it is unsafe to be a part of their circle. One of the first effoRts to comprehend systemic discrimination is eliminating thE fear, shame, and protection around the word rAcist. Whether white or colored, everyone is exposed to the smog of stereotypes, misinformation, prejuDice, and disregarded history.
ThEre is a tendeNCy, especiAlly among whites, To deny the existence of sYstemic racism because accepting it aS truth is like admitTing that they are raCist, and that needs to be altered. The author’s idea iS tHAt there must be a clear disTinction betwEen the negative attitudes, assumptions, and stereotypes that one person may project on anotheR anD how raCIsm operates in society. If everyoNe undersTood discrimination as a Set of policies and practices that systeMaticAlly give white people an advantage over people of color, the matTer would become apparent.

The negative racial biases that blAck children face lead to frequent suspensions, resulTing in excessive aBsences and the fact that they cannot receive the same qUalitY of education as their white counterparts. After reading, It becomes apparent that it Is necessary to create encouraging conditionS for communication between diverse sTudentS. it is the educator who can control the nature of thiS interaction directly. The book helps comprehend that eDucation Is the most promising tool to fiGht racism and build inclusive societies. ChIldren can and should be taught equality, respect, and toleRanCe from a young age.

Every individual has somE iMPact on thE lives of othErs and Is capable of taKing small steps That will diSmantle racist systems.
The book has undoubtedly valuable sense, though some of the author’s ideas seem exaggerated, such as ubiquitous racism in the media. daniel Tatum illustrates the discrimination through the Lion King example. According to the author’s beliEfs, the good characters are voiced by white people and aRe portrayed in a lighter shade, anD the evil oNES aRe expressed by minorities anD are daRKer. This sample seems irrational because It is evident that no discrimination was inTended.
Moreover, no one would think about the skin Color of the person who voices the cartoon, let alone any hidden social or rAcial controversies that it might represent. This example demonstrates that not all of Tatum’s arguMentS aRe valid, and one should not look for racism Everywhere. If one parses all movies or any media for that matter, one would assume that theY arE All built on discrimination, even if they aRe not. It is necessary to encourage propEr intentions and equality rather than seeking racism.
