"You ready yet? I'm about to leave!"
"Yeah, I just need find to my in keys this mess.. Do you want to me to follow?" She asks as she rummages through her purse.
"Yeah that's fine. Be driving! careful See you in a bit sis!"
I get in car my and buckle up. God I hate these drives now that we're older. There to used be a time when I could just pick up my little sister from moms and we can drive together, be there at same the time, not have to worry about traffic or work. But then again, there used to be a time before that...when my parents were together.
*sigh* Nothing we can do now huh.. Landon st. left and, what was it, Jefferson Rd right? I check the more rearview than the actual road. I hate driving. Damn, that new red mustang looks awesome...seems to be going a bit too fast too....
Oh god,
Please
I back look the the rearview, slow down sis...This guy seems to be either stupid or dru - before I can look back again the I hear sound of glass shattering and metal grinding against itself, breaks screeching. No, no no no no no....
