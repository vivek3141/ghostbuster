It all happened so suddenly.
Thats all I could think about as my feet thundered across the rubble stricken ground, I couldn't see anyone else about, at least.. anyone able to move. The bodies of who those didn't make it laid all around, drooping out of windows and crunched up into corners, still twitching lightly.
Some fumes of the were still around, accidentally walking into a patch of the white thick smoke make would you cough harshly and make you light several for headed minutes. But long time exposure could leave the person unable to move and would they eventually go insane, stuck sitting down occasionally laughing.
It all happened suddenly, so who would have thought legalising weed would do this?
