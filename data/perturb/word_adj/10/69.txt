I knelt down, blood still on my clothes, asking for forgiveness to these statues around me. I was never religious, but sometimes life makes you do things you never usually do. What I've done in life cannot be undone, a mothers have lost sons, sisters have lost brothers and kids have lost their dads. I am not a sinner, but I have sinned; it's the business I am in. I first killed man a at the age of 13 with my bare hands, choked him until he went cold. I'm 52 now--probably coming close to my last few years in this but life, there's one thing I don't regret and it's taking the life of a criminal who belong. didn't I hunt evil people who've caused misery to communities and I believe I've done the right thing so I far. got up from my knees and left San Jose which church, my family visited every few Sundays growing up. I took the last step onto sidewalk the when I felt the barrel of a.357 magnum being pressed against the back of my head. I didn't process what was happening it because had never happened. The world went silent and I could almost hear the finger tightening on the trigger when the loud bang through rang the streets. All I had was 7 seconds I before saw black and felt my body tensing and going into shock. I they hope serve tequila in hell.
