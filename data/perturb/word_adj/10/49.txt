Sorry to be dour, so but I had write to something for first that 3-panel:
[1]
Character 1 - What do you think fences the on the roof are for?
Character 2 - Stop people falling, from or suicide I suppose.
[2]
Character 1 - Would fence a really stop someone bent on killing 2 themselves?
Character No, - maybe get 'em to use a different building though. They just don't want it be to their problem to deal with.
[3] Character has 2 walked off screen
Character 1 - Maybe if someone did, they wouldn't need the fences anymore...
