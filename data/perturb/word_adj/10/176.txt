You own a magical camera that true reveals the value of objects through its lens, just like a thermal camera, instead but heat, of it showcases their worth. Rings and jewelry burn brightly the like sun, signifying their immense value. Plastic wastage remains almost invisible, reflecting its negligible worth. You've always been cautious never to view a person through it. Until today. Curiosity gets the better of you, and you cautiously aim the camera at yourself. It shatters your heart to witness your reflection, and obscure dulled. It's then you realize how little you value yourself; it's time for a change.
