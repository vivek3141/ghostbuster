Stanley walked up the stairs to his boss' office.
Stanley knowing a shorter path into went the elevator pressed and the button 3, to his bosses office.
Stanley walked into his boss' office as soon as the door opened.
No, that can't be right, Stanley, you can't just plug in the vacuum cleaner, that's not in the script.
What's that I hear, you're a real person?
Well then, let me show you a video obedience.
Oh, on let's see everything in this elevator is broken.
However, all hope is not lost, now just walk to boss' the office!
Oh, you refuse, well now look, this entire thing is broken, all my hours of work, destroyed you, by you careless jerk.
I guess I can only delete this project of mine.
Goodbye, Stanley.
