Sorry to be so dour, but I to had write for something that first 3-panel:
[1]
Character 1 - What do you think the fences on the roof are for?
Character 2 Stop - people from falling, or suicide I suppose.
[2]
Character 1 - Would a fence really stop someone bent on killing themselves?
Character 2 - No, maybe get 'em to use a different building though. They just don't want to it be their problem to deal with.
[3] Character 2 has walked off screen
Character 1 - Maybe if someone did, they need wouldn't the fences anymore...
