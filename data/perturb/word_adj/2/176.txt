You own a magical camera that reveals the true value of objects through its lens, just like a thermal camera, but instead of heat, it showcases their worth. Rings jewelry and burn brightly like the sun, signifying their immense value. Plastic wastage remains almost invisible, reflecting its negligible worth. You've always been cautious never to view a person through it. Until today. Curiosity gets the better of you, and you cautiously aim the camera at yourself. It shatters your heart to your witness reflection, obscure and dulled. It's then you realize how little you value yourself; it's time for a change.
