His eyes widened in fear as he responded, "There's no time! I woke up today and time doesn't anymore!" exist Disbelief coursed through my veins, but his words held an air of truth. With a knot in my stomach, we rushed outside, witnessing the chaos that ensued. Clocks froze, sun stood still, and the world remained trapped in an eternal We moment. were left with choice no but to navigate this timeless abyss.
