The stark chords of Tosca begin once again; Scarpia's motive is the first thing the audience at La Scala Opera hear. Perhaps they are by jaded it, but it still elicits within me feelings from a bygone life. Soon we'll see entrances from Cavaradossi and of course leading our lady, Tosca, forced to do unspeakable the and murder one man to try and save another's life. Poor if Tosca; only she had that known Cavaradossi truly was given a stay of execution, perhaps she would have accepted Scarpia's demand for intimacy.
The people will then shuffle out of the opera theatre, lazily critiquing the same show that they've seen entirely too often here in Milan, and go out to the caf√©s and restaurants that been they've to times many before. lives, Their seemingly on a loop, continue at their leisurely pace I as sit by darkened in my villa above the streets watching the days pass by.
Acquaintances of mine always asked, "Why move to Milan?" "You don't know Italian, do you?" "Why now?" ask they'd with all the sincerity of a Valentine's Hallmark Day card.

For one, the Milanese choose to stay out until the ungodly hours of 1 2 or o'clock in the meaning morning, that my food is spiked usually with the residual alcohol from Lombardy their region chardonnay and pinot by bianco the pint. However, getting even past the eternal hangover that is my life, how do avoid I that villainous vegetable that the Italians seem to put in every dish: garlic.

Stakes be could easily enough avoided good with planning (an internally locked coffin with plenty of reinforced steel between my and face the world that might to wish me), destroy but Austrians the never bothered with garlic quite as often as do they here.
Perhaps might I go back to Vienna and dine off the simple whose people beer consumption is admirable as much as it shameful. is Perhaps I will get back to hearing the operas of Strauss and Mozart, or maybe the performance occasional of Marschner's "Der Vampyr." But for now, I sit like Tosca, in a place I never should wish to waiting be for the right moment make to my escape and be free again. Now, this never sleeping of city Milan holds me hostage the with taste of on death everyone's lips.
