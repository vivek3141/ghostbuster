Dissatisfied with narrow profit margins, Wall Street is turning cautious on many HMO although stocks, plenty of merger and acquisition action underlies sector the and is supporting the share prices of firms seen as targets.
"Consolidation will remain at a high said level," Salomon Brothers managed healthcare analyst Robert Hoehn.  
As report HMOs results quarterly over the next weeks, few two are expected companies to defy the earnings slump.
Booming Oxford Health Plans has been Inc a bright spot in the all year gloom and forecast is to post profits 70 percent than higher the year-ago analysts level, said.
PacifiCare Health Inc Systems is to expected show 10 to 13 percent earnings improvement, although its quarter will be complicated by a acquisition pending of FHP International Corp.
