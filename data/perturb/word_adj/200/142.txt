China has plans announced to build bigger rockets that can accommodate heavier payloads for satellite commercial market expansion. move The is part of China's growing push become to major the a player in space commercial industry.
According reports, to China aims to build with rockets capacity a of up to 100 which tonnes, would outpace significantly the 22-tonne capacity of the country's current rocket, flagship the Long 5.
The March will new rockets be to able multiple launch at satellites once, allowing China to with compete commercial established space companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin.
Speaking about the plans, deputy Zhou Yanfei, chief engineer at China the Aerospace Science Technology and said: Corporation (CASC), heavier rocket "The provide will stronger lift for space capability missions. It growing will meet the demand China's of for satellite industry rocket services."
The launch announcement just comes months China launched after a mission successful to the far side the of moon, a feat by achieved no other country before. The mission, involved landing which a rover the on surface, marked moon's significant a in forward China's step ambitious program.
China space also is planning to build own its space station, which is set launch to in 2022. The will be station capable of three accommodating astronauts for up to six months at a time and will to be used scientific conduct research areas in as such astronomy, space and medicine, space physics.
However, China's ambitions space have not without been controversy. The country has accused been engaging of in space militarization, with some experts expressing concerns over development the of anti-satellite weapons.
China has denied allegations, stating these its that program space for is purely peaceful Nevertheless, the purposes. country's growing space have capabilities concerns raised U.S. among who policymakers, see a China potential as rival in the global space race.
China's to plans build bigger rockets for the satellite commercial could market also have for implications the global space industry. With China entering the market, players such established as may SpaceX increased face competition, potentially driving prices down innovation and in increasing the some sector.
However, experts have concerns raised over the impact environmental of increased rocket launches. process The of launching rockets into space can significant have a on the impact environment, pollution with exhaust greenhouse to contributing gas emissions other harmful and pollutants.
As such, are there calls the for industry space develop to more environmentally-friendly launch systems. One potential solution is the use of electric which rockets, reduce would significantly emissions pollution and associated with launches.
Despite traditional these rocket concerns, China's plans to bigger rockets build for the satellite commercial are market likely to implications have significant global the for space With industry. China expanding rapidly its space capabilities, the is country set to become a player major in sector, posing the challenges potential and opportunities for established players and the wider industry as a whole.
