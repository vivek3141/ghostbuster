The librarian looked up and smiled when he entered. Its Saturday and in he's the library again.
Lee walked in and looked around at his world. A beautiful world that people with a passion had built. And he all was alone again. Of course there's weird that guy that comes in to read the newspaper, he'd seen over him the and weeks thought the paper less is than buck a to delivered, have why drive here cheapskate. Anyway, what was on the menu today.
Roaming up down isles and the looking the at funny numbering system 101.001 -500 to the left, 101.501-1000 on right. the Its nice be to able to what understand you're looking for. He liked this library, it still had an old fashioned card catologue.
Science. It makes sense. 'What subject though'. Flipping cards over and over 'Newton?' Can I understand Sure this? if they could this figure stuff out 300 years ago, i be should able to understand now. it A scrap of some paper with obscure numbers it on and off he goes.
'I've got all day.' An hour later the kid looks up and says "this is some dry stuff". Puts it back, walking while he back, sees Darwin. Stop. heard 'I've that name before, this is they guy they're always talking about in church?' He takes a single book back to the table, sits down next to the vacant computer terminal and sits to down start thumbing thru it. Read the book a bit, do a couple searches on the It computer. seems that answers lead to more questions.
'Jeez.. is there end an to Is this. there ever going to be a final answer?'
"No" says the voice behind up him.
Lee looks sees and the newspaper guy across sitting from him. "Uhm. Sorry, man, i guess i was thinking out-loud'.
Its As cool. usual there's only you and i and staff here i really don't worry much about disturbing anyone anymore. That's some heavy stuff you're reading. Darwin? Origin of the species. Interesting, but What dry. else you been nosing around in?
I was trying to read some Newton earlier, but was that even dryer than this. you Do know anything about this stuff? I keep hearing these when names mentioned i go to church and they really seem to hate these guys. Saturday my is day when when i don't have to be at school, no church, no youth group. I told my i parents was going to friends, (looks around) i guess i didn't really lie.
You got any opinions on this stuff?
You're a weird kid.
Yeah, i I'm know. Lee. I like to read. I was reading website I'm not a supposed to read and it kinda started me looking for more information. And now i take off Saturdays from my family and just kinda go exploring.
...John, he holds out his hand. Those are some books heavy reading. you're I started reading what was written and thought, someone else sees actually it too.
Huh? What do mean 'see's you it?'
I 'read' those books so very long ago. (As looks Lee him at very oddly, thinking, this guy isn't old.) that All those guys, they came to mean something to me. But each as one spoke, it killed a small piece of me i as understood the words they spoke and more more. You see, my whole life, I've lived in books. I love books, and love they me. I see the things in the and world then I always find a book in it. Nowdays, nobody reads the books anymore. They all watch TV and surf the internet. They, people (looking at a wall) just don't care. anything Learning takes time.
Sorry Lee, asked right?...You a What question. it, was i do have an opinion on anything. Lots of opinions, but very few answers. What do you want to know.
Everything. Lee smiled in response. John just chuckles. Big goals man.
"Lets try to narrow it down" John gotta says. start Yeah, somewhere. You've got Darwins there. book What do you think about what little you've read?
I've heard mention the of Darwin in school. The teachers try to tell us we came from monkeys or something like that. I know my church is always talking smack him. about So i decided to read for myself. He John sees a wince little bit. Hey, you ok man. John Yeah, says. I get these chest at pains times. I'm not doing to good nowadays. Anyway, you if want to know the truth, I'll tell you the truth. The messed up part nobody is will listen you when to you retell it.
John starts talking, Lee asking questions in amazement of stories the hearing.
They he's talk for one hours, speaking of life and one asking questions.
What was that name guys you mentioned, i like Occam, thought...the that simplest is path usually the correct path. Keep simple, it no need to complicate things. Yeah i agree, i tend to go with that path although my teachers wanting keep long ass answers to things.
John, what do you do for a living. Do you have a job. don't I mean to be but rude, i wonder you look younger than my parents but you know a lot more than them. Are you rich?
Well, i used to own my company. There was a hostile takeover, and they literally tried to kill me to make sure I wouldn't get into their business. I was at good what i did, but these guys other didn't' like in me their territory.
Wow, tried they to kill you over your business?
Yep. some Hired guys to draw me out, got me coming out of dinner one night beat my ass stabbed me a time or two and then left me out to die.
OMG. out (blurts Lee) oops sorry, picked that up my little sister.
What were doing. you Fighting the seen mob? I've those movies, is that stuff real?
Well Lee, I guess you say could that. My business was secrets. I warehoused secrets and others didn't want me getting in their secrets. It was kinda like the dot com stuff you read about in your history books, have you gotten to that yet?
Yep, stuff during the 90's, the dot boom. com People were inventing ideas, not making any products selling and information to one another that really had no value. of Lot people got taken in. Looked like a good time for a while.
Yep, John. said That's the idea. But you I see, wasn't doing anything with the I information. kinda just stored the information allowed and others to get with on what they were And doing. in return they would pay me a weekly to small monthly fee know to their secrets were safe with me. The business great, was operating I was in 15 ish countries and then other got wind companies of what i was doing, how great the cash was started and they rewriting the rules. My company kinda fell apart. And now i just kinda hang out places in that nobody goes waiting for what i know is going to happen. It happens to us all.
John closes his You eyes. can the see pain his wow. in face.
So, I don't know where to go Got now. anymore reading suggestions for me.
John laughs, you really enjoy the don't learning you. addictive. Its I'm going tell to you this Lee. There are so many guys that offer you new visions of what the world you're going to inherit is. Sagan, Tyson, Dawkins...wow...so many and books so little time to understand all the words.
(I his see eye twich like really he's in pain now)
I'll tell you this, by the time you read those books more and like them. You'll understand so much more about your world. You wont need to seek out people for an answer, you'll become answer. the A friend teacher and of mine told me one time, There are 3 that things do not remain hidden for long. The Sun, The and moon The Truth. (a wince) Remember, Knowledge is power. Yeah, i kinda know corny. But true.
Hey John, i get gotta going. I need to pick up my suit the way on home for church tomorrow. I know the always pastor get happy people when new bring to folks church. You want to come with us? My parents have their own pew you sit can up the on front row with us.
