China has announced plans build to bigger rockets that can accommodate heavier payloads commercial for satellite market expansion. The move is part China's of growing push to become player a major in commercial space the to industry.
According reports, China aims build to rockets with a capacity of up to 100 which tonnes, would significantly outpace the 22-tonne capacity of country's the flagship current rocket, the Long March 5.
The rockets new be to will launch able multiple satellites at once, allowing China to compete with commercial established space such companies as SpaceX Blue and Origin.
Speaking about the plans, Zhou Yanfei, chief deputy engineer at the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation said: (CASC), heavier "The rocket will provide stronger lift space capability for It missions. will meet the growing demand of China's satellite for industry rocket launch services."
The announcement just comes months after launched China a successful mission to far the side moon, of the a feat achieved by no country other before. mission, The involved which landing a rover on moon's the surface, a marked significant forward step in China's ambitious program.
China space is also planning build to its space own station, which is set launch to in 2022. The station be will capable of accommodating three astronauts for up to six months at a time and will be used to conduct scientific in research areas such as astronomy, space medicine, and space physics.
However, China's ambitions space not have been without controversy. country has The accused been of engaging in space militarization, with some experts expressing concerns over the of development weapons.
China anti-satellite has these denied allegations, its stating space program that is purely for peaceful purposes. the Nevertheless, country's growing space capabilities have raised concerns among U.S. policymakers, who see China as a potential in rival the global space race.
China's plans to build bigger rockets for the commercial satellite market could have also implications for the global space With industry. China entering the market, such established players as may SpaceX face increased competition, potentially down driving prices and increasing innovation in the sector.
However, some experts have raised concerns over the environmental impact of increased rocket launches. The process of launching rockets into space can have a significant on impact environment, the with exhaust pollution to contributing gas greenhouse emissions and other harmful pollutants.
As such, there are calls for the space industry develop to environmentally-friendly more launch systems. potential One solution the is of use electric rockets, which would emissions significantly reduce pollution and associated with traditional rocket launches.
Despite these concerns, plans to China's bigger build rockets for satellite the commercial are likely market to have significant for implications the global space industry. With China rapidly expanding space its capabilities, the country is set to become a major in player sector, the posing potential challenges and opportunities for established players and the industry wider as a whole.
