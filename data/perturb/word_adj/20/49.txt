Sorry to be so dour, but I had to write something for first that 1 3-panel:
[1]
Character - What you do think the on fences roof the are for?
Character 2 - Stop people falling, from or suicide I 1 - suppose.
[2]
Character Would a fence really stop someone bent on themselves?
Character killing No, 2 - maybe get 'em to different use a building though. They just don't want to be it their problem to deal with.
[3] 2 has Character walked off screen
Character 1 - Maybe if someone did, wouldn't they need fences anymore... the
