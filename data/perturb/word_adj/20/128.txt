I love music. the It reflects what is just about to happen. It has me saved from more than a few relationships would have that been unsavory.
I have two theories about the music. Either I am the only one hears who it, or everyone does and no one ever talks about it. Which is fine. Music is a very personal thing after all.
Normally, the music is always at a comfortable level, unless it is trying to warn me of something dire. There was one moment whereâ€¦ One moment where sound the was deafening.
There was a rising crescendo ever since I woke up that morning. I turned on the news to watch while eating breakfast, as I always do. Usually music the goes back and forth between dramatic more more and lulling, depending on the news break about to come up. But that morning it change. didn't It just crescendoing until the newscaster spoke.
"The World Trade Centers have been hit." dropped I my fork. The ting of it hitting the table all was I could hear. For the first time, ever, my world had gone quiet.
As watched I the unfold, events the music continued to be silent. Finally, after what felt like but days was only minutes, it started piping up again. A long, low clarinet played. And other then instruments joined slowly it. Something sad, but hopeful. It was playing as I was heading out the door to go to Red my Cross see to what I could to do help.
