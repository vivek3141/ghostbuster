I knelt down, blood on still my clothes, asking for forgiveness to statues these around me. I was never religious, but sometimes life makes you do things you never usually do. What I've done life in cannot be undone, a mothers have lost sons, sisters have lost brothers and kids have lost their dads. I am not a sinner, but I have sinned; it's business I the am in. I first killed a man at the of age 13 with my bare hands, choked him until he went cold. I'm 52 now--probably coming close last to my years few in this life, but there's one thing I don't regret and taking it's the life of a who criminal didn't belong. I hunt evil people who've caused misery to communities and I believe I've done the right thing so far. I got up from my knees and left San Jose which church, my visited family every few Sundays growing up. I took the last step onto the sidewalk when I felt the barrel of a.357 magnum being pressed against the back of my head. I didn't process what was happening because it had never happened. The world went and silent I could almost hear the finger tightening on the trigger when loud the bang rang through the streets. All I had 7 was seconds before I saw and black felt my body tensing and going into shock. I they hope serve tequila in hell.
