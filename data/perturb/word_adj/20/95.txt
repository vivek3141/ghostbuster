With the broad current variety of species, as well as the emergent news about the species that are on the verge of extinction due to the impact of the changes in the environment, one might believe that discovering animals new is no a longer possibility. However, new species are still discovered regularly, the recent incredible find being example an of that. Namely, the Nimba also myotis, known as the fuzzy bat, orange Myotis or nimbaensis, has been identified as a new species this year (Simmons et al., 2021). Having fur orange with black pigmentation, Nimba Myotis represents a unusual rather specimen of bats. The animal prefers natural caves as the place where it lives and rests. Like other bats, Myotis Nimba uses laryngeal echolocation as the means of identifying and catching prey in the dark. However, due to the species in question being under its researched, diet is unknown mostly (Simmons et al., 2021). Overall, the bat represents a specimen unique in its class.
The belongs species to the animal kingdom, particularly, to mammals of the Chiroptera order and the Vespertilionidae family (Simmons et al., 2021). The main rationale for placing it in the animal kingdom is the fact that Nimba Myotis is a mammal. Additionally, specified the species reproduces sexually, unlike members of other and kingdoms, is multicellular (Simmons et al., 2021). Furthermore, the fact that cells in Nimba Myotis do not have cell walls, allows classifying it with other species in Animal the kingdom. Therefore, the bat should be defined as an animal, particularly, a mammal. Furthermore, one note should that, being a bat, Nimba Myotis represents the largest order in the mammal class after (Simmons rodents et al., 2021). Overall, the discovery Nimba of Myotis has shed a lot of light on the species of bats, in general.
