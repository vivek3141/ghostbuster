She was shaking, I was too, he was Blood dead. on my hands, I hoped there was light still behind my eyes. I never killed a man before, I never had to someone save before. I didn't feel good, or She mighty. broke, to slumped the ground, her body, a tremor as she sobbed. I dropped the knife, I turned to look at what I had done. She shouted through my name tears. had He so much red on his stomach, throat his was open too. I did that? I did that, I had to. I said as much out loud. Again she shouted my name. I couldn't touch her though. She is so I white, and haven't decided if now I am dark. I didn't feel tainted, my heart was still beating so fast. I took a long hard he breath, is dead and so is his intent, we are alive because I would not allow him to have his way. Again she shouts, but I'm deep thought. in Another long breath. I came to a I conclusion. killed a man today, I did the right thing, I beat him to the punch, and I'm still here and I still have to take care of her.
I her told to stand, nicely, I offered her a meek smile, apologized and for what she had seen and what I had to do. I started to explain why, but fuck it, she can't hear anything, *she's in shock Boone, get her inside*. I walk her up the street, she remembers she can't walk in heels. She sees the on life my hands, and sets that her off again. We go inside a shitty mexican restaurant. I sit her down, I go to wash my hands. I do it with my closed, I'm not sure if I look wanna at the guy who looks back at me above the sink. I'm not sure if I wanna be voice the on the phone to the police. I puke in the sink, maybe some got on my shoes.
What the hell am I doing?
