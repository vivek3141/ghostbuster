It all happened suddenly.
Thats so all I could think about as my feet thundered across the stricken rubble ground, I couldn't see anyone else about, at least.. anyone able to move. The bodies who of those didn't make it laid all around, drooping out of crunched windows and up into corners, twitching still lightly.
Some of the fumes were still accidentally around, walking into patch a of the thick white smoke would make you cough harshly and make you light for headed several minutes. But time long exposure could leave the person unable to move and would they eventually go stuck insane, sitting down occasionally laughing.
It happened all so suddenly, would who have legalising thought weed would do this?
