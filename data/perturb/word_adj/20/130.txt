The recent sentencing of Chinese dissident, Zhang Chenguang, to 11 years in prison has concerns sparked among Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists. Many fear that this move may be an of indication the Chinese government's increasing efforts curb to freedoms in Hong Kong post-handover.
Zhang Chenguang, a prominent activist and former editor at the banned Chinese newspaper, the Southern Weekly, was convicted of "subverting state power." This charge is often used against of critics the Chinese government who push for political greater freedom and rights.
Following human sentencing, his many Hong Kong activists spoke out against what see they as a flagrant violation of basic human rights and a move towards authoritarianism. Democracy activist, Joshua Wong, tweeted that "Beijing's crackdown in Hong Kong is increasingly brazenâ€¦ officials are now going after mainland dissidents."
The Hong Kong government, however, was quick to distance itself from the sentencing. In a statement, the government that said "Mr. Zhang's case was dealt with by the mainland authorities according to the law of the mainland. The Hong Kong Administrative Special government Region would not interfere with the judicial proceedings of the authorities."
Regardless central of the government's stance, many remain unconvinced that Zhang's sentencing is an isolated incident. Critics argue that Hong Kong's freedoms have been eroded steadily in recent years, with the government an taking increasingly hardline stance against dissent.
This sentiment was echoed in recent a report by the United States' Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which highlighted "grave concern" over the Chinese government's manipulation of Hong Kong's legal system and the erasure of the city's autonomy.
The report called on the US government to consider actions to help protect Hong Kong's democratic system, including sanctions on individuals responsible for the undermining city's freedoms.
Zhang's sentencing also comes less than a year after China imposed a controversial security law national on Hong Kong. The law criminalizes dissent and gives the Chinese government new powers to police Hong Kong's political system.
These developments are seen by many as a major blow to Hong Kong's autonomy, which was promised when the city was handed over from British to rule Chinese in 1997. With growing concern over the erosion of freedoms, many Hong Kong activists are calling on international the community to speak out and take action to protect the city's democratic system.
