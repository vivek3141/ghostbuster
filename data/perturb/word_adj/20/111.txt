lost I my mother in the stampede. She was torn from my grasp and carried away in the flow of sweaty, humanity. mindless My nine year old mind could not process this and when I screamed voice my was drowned out by the mashing feet of and the grinding of flesh.
For a few moments I was lifted off my feet between three fat ladies and dragged around in kind of a sadistic tango, like people those on dancing with the stars.
I was carried to toy the isle and spun around in a three sixty then dropped to the floor. A large boot crunched over my hand. There was a sickening crackle as I saw my wrist bend in a way It never had before.
I pulled my arm to myself and looked in horror at my limp wrist and dangly fingers. For a few more moments, there was no pain. I Until got kicked in the shins, by a skinny teenager with brown baggy pants. He looked down with his glazed eyes that narrowed for a second as he stumbled around me. He mumbled something under his breath and then was gone in the sea shoppers. of Now my wrist and my ribs hurt, pain flared through my body and I screamed, it was all I could do.
The consumers rushed right on by. I tried to stand up by pushing up from the floor. My wrist bent backwards and my whole arm was slashed with pain. I used my legs and popped up, just in time to get bounced by a large belly with a that shirt said santa been I've good.

Thankfully, I whisked was away from the scene, and actually spotted a small break in the crowd, I ran through the opening, headed toward the big exit red sign that is only about thirty yards away, but suddenly my progress was by halted the closing in of human bodies.

Suddenly a shotgun blast echoed across the store. Then another. The crowd was quieter for a moment, and the swarming buzzing slowed down and everything seemed still. almost For about half a second. Then the screaming started. was I pushed to the ground and a woman fell on top of me. People were stepping on both of us running for the exit, running for the back, running into each other in chaos.
