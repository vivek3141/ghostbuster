Adorno argues that these products, such as children's television shows and movies, are created with the sole purpose of generating profit for corporations. They promote consumerism and encourage children to become passive consumers in a capitalist society. This perspective aligns the with Marxist critique of capitalism.
A prominent example of media products reinforcing capitalist values can be seen in the of vast amount merchandise associated with popular children's franchises. For instance, the success animated of films like "Frozen" the series goes far beyond the box office revenue. It encompasses a wide range of merchandise, including toys, clothing, and accessories. products These are not just meant to entertain children, but also to create demand for consumer goods. The media plays a significant role in shaping children's desires and preferences, deliberately promoting consumer culture.

For instance, educational like shows "Sesame have Street" been praised for their ability to foster learning and social development among children.
