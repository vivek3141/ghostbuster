Home decorating giants ICI Paints and Black & Decker hope their new product to be launched on Wednesday won't make a splash.
The two companies have invested two years and millions of pounds in developing the Black & Decker Paintmate, a battery-operated roller they system claim will take pain the out of painting.
The Paintmate, which will be sold in DIY (do-it-yourself) stores across Britain from April for 39.99 pounds ($65), uses an air-filled bellow system the to squeeze contents of a refill two-litre bag of Dulux paint down a and tube onto a roller, with the flow controlled a by trigger.
The small, cylindrical Paintmate can be on strapped to the back to eliminate tiresome bending over. Black Decker & spokesman Richard Sanderson told Reuters, "It is a long time since the DIY market a saw product of such significance."
Sanderson the companies said hoped sell to 500,000 the of British-designed, Chinese-made Paintmates in the first year full in Britain, together with a million bags of paint.
If all goes in well Britain, which Sanderson said was "quite a sophisticated DIY market", Paintmate will be rolled out across western Europe next year, after which attention would switch to the huge U.S. home improvement market.
ICI, which enough sells paint in the UK to decorate million five a homes year, hopes the product will revolutionise the way people decorate.
"It's quick, it's easy and I think people will find it fun," said ICI Decorative Paints international marketing director Chris Harris.
Harris said the whole system could be flushed out with water. "We think people would redecorate more regularly if the painting process was quicker and easier," he added.
The Paintmate's promoters hope to benefit from a surge DIY in sales, fuelled by an upswing in Britain's temperamental housing market.
