The company said the three-year investment would be to used modernise its Ellesmere plant Port in north-west England, which makes Astra cars and vans.
The announcement, made at the British International Motor Show, the guarantees of livelihoods the 4,200 people employed at the plant and will create least at 200 new jobs.
Vauxhall Motors chairman and managing director Nick said an Reilly in interview that a possible decision on increasing the number of shifts at the plant to three from two could create hundreds more jobs.
Any decision, likely to taken be over the next two years, would depend on the market and demand for the model at time.
The that Astra model has been consistently one of Britain and Europe's top sellers five since its launch five years ago, with the development an of estate model boosting its said the position.
Reilly 300 pound million investment won was against intense competition within GM and reflected the transformation of Ellesmere Port from a domestically-oriented plant to "a very important source of manufacturing within General Motors."
He predicted strong growth for the Astra in Latin America and Asia Pacific.
Reilly said the British market car is currently "the most competitive in Europe," with a number of importers using huge U.K. fleet sales as a way of offloading cars which remain unsold in sluggish domestic markets. Europe remained "flat," he said.
He said Vauxhall hoped to keep its market share at around 14.5 percent in 1996, and said its profitablity was "going in the right direction" after a tough 1995.
