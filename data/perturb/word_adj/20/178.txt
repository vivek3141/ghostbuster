Several high tech giants have come together to announce the release of a new CD-ReWriteable technology for early 1997. The technology is said to be below priced $1,000, which is expected to make it widely accessible to the public.
The CD-ReWriteable technology was unveiled through a joint press conference by Hewlett-Packard, Sony, and The Phillips. new technology is to expected revolutionize the market as it allows people to rewrite over CDs, which brings the storage capacity of CDs to a whole new level.
The CD-ReWriteable technology has numerous applications, especially in the realm of archiving data and storage. It provides an affordable and efficient method for people to store and save their files, which was once a daunting task, especially when it comes to large files and data.
The technology easily outclasses other available on options the market since it can store up to 650 megabytes of data, about 74 minutes of audio, in a single disc, is which more than double what currently available technology can handle. Moreover, since it is rewritable, it can be used repeatedly to store new files and data multiple making times, it a economical solution.
The highly new CD-ReWriteable technology is a result of years-long research and development by the three high tech giants. It is based on a technique called phase-change technology, which allows the laser beam to rewrite the data on the disc at varying speeds without compromising the integrity of the data already stored.
The technology is expected to have a significant impact on the market, especially for small businesses and individuals who need cost-effective solutions to store their data. It is also speculated that it could lead to the creation of new markets for CD-ROMs as the re-writable feature for allows the of storage dynamic data that is updated regularly.
