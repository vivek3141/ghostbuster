I out struggle from my cocoon of blankets and into cold the of my bedroom. I like that it way. Every night I the open window, my to let the night in. Every morning the chill startles me awake. I open the curtains, look out onto the street. The usual crowd waltz down the street, going wherever it is they go. Someone glances up at window, my and hurriedly looks away as they realise I'm half naked.
As I walk across the room something crunches underfoot. A small, folded piece of paper on the floor. My name is written on it, in my own I handwriting. pick it up, scrutinise it. I don't writing remember this. I it, open and read the words inside.
*Act normally, otherwise they'll *
I'm notice. I confused. really don't recall writing this. What does it mean? Who are ‘ they ’? The questions are rattled my from head by a knock at my bedroom door. My flatmate.
‘ Huney, are you ok in there? be You'll late. ’
I look at the note again. And hesitate.
