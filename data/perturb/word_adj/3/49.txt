Sorry to be so dour, but I had to write something for first that 3-panel:
[1]
Character 1 - What do you think the fences on the roof are for?
Character 2 - Stop people from falling, or suicide I suppose.
[2]
Character 1 - Would a fence really someone stop on bent killing themselves?
Character 2 - No, maybe get 'em to use a different building though. They just don't want it to be their problem to deal with.
[3] Character 2 has walked off screen
Character 1 - Maybe if someone did, they wouldn't need the fences anymore...
