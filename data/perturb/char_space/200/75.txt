Italw ayspuzzled me, to say the least, and made meextr emely nervous.
Assuch Inever committed into re lati o nships, probably bygreat of having  my fe elingsnotreciprocated.
My longest relatio nshipwas witha manIloved deeply,Indy. Hewas  the complete opposi te of me: extraverted, charm ing , outgoing.Hewas friend with everyone, but stil  lreliable andgenerous.
Westayed together for acouple ofyears, and, I don'tknow   w hy,  but itre ally seemed like hehad feelings forme.
Butlike I did in   other relationships before, I shuthi mdown,rejecting himwhen Ifeltmy fee lingsgrowing to much.
Inthe  endhe  left m e, like they al l did. I  lear ned later t hat he waswithKe lly, a girlwemet a couple of timewhen we weretogether.
Imetother   menandw omen,anditalwaysended  the sam e way.Fast  forward toyesterday. Ke llycalls me,sayingthatIndywa s in the hospital , after  being hit by a  car. Hisco ndition wa s  cri tical, andhe has a sked forme.
And here Iam,   a bouquetofflowers inhands,   nervously looking    for room 68.Ifind it,half o pened,  and tak e a deepbreathtogive myself coura ge, and here Indy's weak voice."Kelly, you're. ..a  wo n derf ul girl but...I...I...Ineverloved you."
Thewords hitme like apunch. I st ormintheroom, buthiseyes a re already closed.  Forever.
