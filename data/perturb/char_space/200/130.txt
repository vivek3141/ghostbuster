The recent sentencing of Chinese dissident,  ZhangChe nguang, to 11years inprisonhas sparked concerns among HongKong's pro-democracy activists. Many feartha tthis move maybean indica tionof the C hinese governm ent's  in creasing effort s  to curb freedoms in H ong Kong post-handover.
Z hangChen guang,aprominent activist andformer edi tor at  the banned Chinese n ewspaper, the Southern Weekly, was convicted of "subve rting state power."  This charge isoften used against crit icsof the Chinese government wh o  push for greater political freedom a nd human rights.
Following his s entencing,many HongKong activists spoke out against whatthey see as a flagrant violation ofbasic  humanrights and a movetowards aut horitarianism. Democra cy activist,Joshua Wong, tweete d that "Beijing 'scrackdown in Hong Kongis increasingly brazenâ€¦ offici als are nowgoing after mainland dissidents."
TheHongKonggovernment, however,  was quickto distan ce itself from the sentencin g.In a statement, the governments aid that "Mr. Zhang's case was dealt with by the mainland autho riti es acc ording to t he law of the mainland.The  Hong Ko ng Special Administrative Reg ion government wouldnot interfere withthe judici a l proceedingsof the centralauthorities."Regar dless ofthe government's stance, many remain unconvinced that Zhang  ' s sentencing isa n isolatedincident. Criticsar gue that Hong K ong's freedomshave been steadily eroded in recent year s, with th e government taking anincreasingly hardline s ta nce  agains t  dissent.
This se  ntiment wasechoed in a recent report by theUnited States' Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which highlighted   " grave concern"  overthe  Chinese government's manipulation ofHo ngKong's  legalsystem  andthe erasure of the city's autonomy.
Thereport called on the US governm ent to consider act ions to help protect Ho ngKong's democraticsystem, incl uding sanction s on individuals responsible for un derminingthecity's freedoms.
Zhang's sentencing alsocomes lessthan ayear after China im  posed ac on troversial national security law onHong Kong. The lawcriminalizes dissent a nd  givesthe Chinese government  new powersto police HongKong's p olitical system.These developments are seenby man yas a major  blow toHong Kong's autonomy, which was promis edwhen the citywas handed over from Britishto Chinese  rule in  1997.  With growing concern ove r theerosiono f freedoms,many Hong Kong activists are calling on the interna tional comm unity tospe akou t  and takeaction top rotect the  city's democratic system.
