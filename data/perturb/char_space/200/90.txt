As Jack mindlessly  shuffled through the digital world, a fa miliar ringtone broke thesilence,cuttingthrough his vu lnerability. His hea rt raced  as h e  looked  atthe scr een, see ing the familiar name displayed: "Dad." Panic  mingled with hope as he answered the call.

"Hey, son.Ho ware you holding up?" The voice on the other end of the line  was unmi s takablyhis father's. It waswarm and comforting, just as Jack remembered.
"Dad? Is that really you? But... you' re gone... " Jack stammered,his mind struggling to make senseofthe impossible.
There w as a strange pause on the other end  before his father replied, "Jack,what are you talking about?I'm fine.  I've been thinkin g about you a lot lately, and I wanted to reach out."
Unease crept up Jack's spine. How couldhis father not remember? Was he losing hisgrip on reality? He tried to recall the funeral, the anguish and tearshe witnessed,butit felt distant, almos t like a fragmented memory.
"Dad, you died. I attended yourfuneral. How can you not r emember?" Jack's voice trembledwith fear  and confusion.
Silence hung  in the air, p regnant with mystery and unanswered questio ns. Finally, his father spoke hesitantly, "Jack... I don'tk nowwhat you're talking about. I've  been fine, spendingmy days painting and enjoying life. Areyou feelingalright, so n?"
The weightof a  thousan d doubts anduncertainties crashed down on Jack. Was he  goin ginsane?Could  he trust his memori es? Nervou sly  bitinghis lip, he tri ed  to rationalize the situation. If his father was alive and well, the n where were his funeral memories coming from? Was he living in an alternate reality?
Overwhelming curiosity mingledwitha growing sense of desperation. Jack decided he had to find answers, to understand whyhe remembered apara llel timeline that didn'tseem to have hap p ened. He reached out tohis friends, searchingforanyone  who might recallhis father's passing, but they all lookedathim with confusion.
H oursblurred into days as Jack relentlessly dug into his  past, scouring documents, old photographs, andeven se arching online dat abases.  Yet, there w as  no  trace of his  fathe r's death. It was as if hismemories were  a figment of his imagination, haunting him asa cruel trick.
Sleepless nights turned intoweeks, asJack's sanity slipped further away. Hequestioned every thought that entered his mind, every memory thatwhispered to him. The line between reality andfantasy beganto blur, leaving him utterly  lost amidst the la byrinth of hisown mind.
Finally, Jack stumbled upon a faded newspaper article, b uried deep wit hin an archive. It was dated years before his father's supposed death, recounting a miraculous recovery from terminal cancer. The article featured his father's beamingface, defying the odds and the grasp of death.
Tears welled up in Jack's eyes asrealization washedover him like a calming tide. He had been li vingin atimeline that never existed, a painful delusion that robbed him of his father's continued presence. The immense grief he had carried, the solitude that engulfed him, all borne from a mind fractured by  sorrow.
With trembling hands, Jack dialed his father's numberonceagain, praying for the fam iliar warmthto greet him on the o ther end. His heart soared ashis father's voice echoedthrough the phone.
"Dad, I needto apologize. I don't know what happened, but I got lost i n aworld where I believed you were gone. C an wemeet?"
His father's voicesof tened, fullof compassion, "Of course, son. Let's meet. I've missed you." 
In thatmoment, Jackfound solace in the  truth  andthe love thatexisted beyond the constraints ofhis fractured mind. The journeyto redisc over himself was far from over, but with newfoundclarity and the warmth of his f ather's l ove, he knew he could face anything that lay  ahead.
