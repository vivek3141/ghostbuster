MCI C  omm unications Corp. said Monday it reached a 10-year deal with NextWaveTelecom Inc. that thrust s MCIinto th e top tier of U.S. wireless communications providers.
Under  terms of the deal, MCI said it will connect itsnetwork to a system planned by NextWave to provide  personal  commu nications services, giving  it the capacity t o offer service to more than 110 million individuals in  63 areas,  including 29  of the top 50 markets .
Wash ington-bas ed MCI said it will bu y at least  10 billion minutes of  capacity for its persona l communications services from NextWave over  10years. Termsof the deal were not disclosed.
Personalc ommunicationsservices represent the new generation  of celluar  communicationss ervices, a llowing customers to send bothvoice and data transmissions over wi reless telepho nes.Th e deal will help underpin the financial fu ture of debt-laden NextWave, which was the largestbidderin the U.S. Fede ral  Communications Commission's auctions for "C-band" wireless radi o spectrum held  inearly July.
NextWave, based inSan Diego and NewYork, also planst o   sellstock to the public.
For MCI, the dealenables it to expand quickly into the rapidly growing market for wireless personal communications servic es.
Tw o years ago,MCI dr oppedout  of the auctionsforU.S.PCS licence safter thebidding became too rich forits t aste.
But with theNextWave pact and previouss mallerdeals, MCI hasmoved tobecome a majo r reseller of wir eless  services.As part of the deal, NextWave se lectedMCI to provide telecommunications and other s ervices supportingthe development and ongoingoperations of its personal communications services system, MCI said."This agreementwith NextWaveestablishes an immediate  nationwide PCSfoot printfor  MCI andr epresents an important next step in MCI's  wireless strategy,"said Whitey Bluestein ,vice president for MCI wirele ss strategy and development.
"Thisi s thefir st full  interconnection agreementof  its kind and brings new competition to the wireless marketplace," he said, noting that with full interconnection, MCIdoe s not needto own its own wireless facilities.
MCI said the NextWave agreement is a model for additional ag reemen ts itexpectsto  s ign with otherwi reless providers as part of its wireless interconnected network strategy.
The  strategy is MCI's blueprint for developing a full  ran ge of wireless services and features that will be integrated into MCI's existing communi c ations services.
"This  w asMCI' s strat egy all along," said Jeffrey Kagan, anAtlanta-based telecommunications industry analyst.
Kagan said  MCI has historicallypreferred to resell communicationsservices initially rather than investing in its own infrast ructure.  Over time, the comp any selectively buildsits owninfrastructure as it proves profitable to do so."Reselling service was how theybecame aheavy hitter in long dista nce in the first p lace,"Kagan said. " What their planis, is to resell servicefrom other pro viders and b uild networks wherethey see the need to do so," he said.
Kagan sai dMCI's d eal with NextWave marks thera pid realisationof its  resellerstrategy. "This all of a sudden puts MCI on the wireless communicationsma p in a big way."Still, he notedthat AT&TCorp.'s AT&T Wireless unit, theformer M cCaw Cellular bu siness,remainstwiceas large as MCI's cellular business, withabout 6.5 million subscribers in geographic regions covering 207 million potential customers.
MCI's deal with NextWave covers about 110 millio n potential cu st omerslivingin a mix of metropolitan and less-densely populated areas.
