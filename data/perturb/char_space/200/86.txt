Millions ofpe ople worl dwide suf ferfr om mental disorders: manias, phobi as, and panic attacks exhaust and torment alot of individuals. Oneof the widespr ead,long-lastingmental  ailments is anobsessive-compulsive dis or d er or OCD, which consistsofobsessive tho ught s andcompulsive behavi or  that ar e  al most impossibl e to  cont rol . The analysis ofthis disorder  due to th e fourDdiagnost ic indicators can let us  exp loreitmore profoundly and thoroughly.
  *Dis tress:OCD often  makes individuals feel ab normal when theyare forced to fight the terrible tho ughts torturing theirheads and repeat meaninglessacts intended to decreas e anxiety. In addition, having “unwanted, recurrent and pers istent images orimpulsesthat evoke anxiety or extre me distress”  and realizing “the unreasonabl e  nature of symptoms” peopl ecan not stop  them (VanLeeuwen et a l., 2020,  p. 1-2). Theybecome nervous and depressed: th erefore, the level of distre ss is high and complicatesthe person’ s life.
  * Dysfunction: Thisdisordersignifica ntly influences the daily life of apatient. Firstly, obsessive thoughtsoften interfere with the usual people’s  acts  andcausea surge of panic,  disturbing to completetheir work. Sometimes,  “cognit iveb iases causedysfunctio nalbeliefs” (Van Leeuw en  et al., 2 0 20,p. 2). Secondly, compulsive actions interrupt apatient’s dailyroutine, forcingthem to do specific stepsacertain number of times. Such activities  can lasteven for an hour or more:  therefore,the ext ent of d ysfunction is also no ticeable.
  * Danger: OCD may represent asig nif icant dangerfor an individual since sometim es, people feelso depressed that they areready to commit suicide. I naddi tion, sometimes, they may try t o de feat their obs essive thoughts,causing self-pain:forinstance, they can strike themselves to g et rid of the unwanted image. H owever,although o ne of the most widespread fearsof peopl e withOCDis to harm o thers, they rarely doit (O’Connor & Aude, 2019). Thus, the level of danger tos e lf is significantly higher th anthat  of  danger toothers.
  *Deviance: Since OCDcauses  abnormal  thoughts and behavior,people with such a diso rder can b echaracterized as deviant. However, it would be wrongto claim that it iseasyto “ determine the degree of deviation from the norm”(Davis , 2009, p.  1).OCD causes anxiety,stress, and panic; it makes peoplelive in fearthat i f they do not dospecificactions,  they will not be abletoavoid danger.Therefore, an individual should visit a clinicand let specialistshelpthem fight.
