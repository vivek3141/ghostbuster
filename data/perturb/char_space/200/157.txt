They a lwayssayinfair ytalesthatwhen a love done falls into  a deep sleep, there'sa way tobrea k thec urse. Kisses,a spell, a po tion,justthat there'ssomethingout there.Butin reallife, all we  c an dois dream.
When I saw him fal l asleep early after a rough day a  t  work I  smiled and though thow adorablehe look  ed hu ggi ng the pillow  witha strangeintens ity. Now tha tpose  feels more like some thing of his is justhanging on.
I  heard that  it's contagio us. That theentireward of theho spital we transp or t ed  himtowas shu t down after doctors started dropping to the floors, fastasleep, inthe middl eof  their  rounds. The entire place was qu arantined . 
"New virus plac es hundreds intocomas.Publicadv ised to st ay indoors."
And soI did.Everypiece of mediaI l ook to continues to cover the s tory as more and more peopleare dropping into deep  sleep throug hout the country. A few reportsevenci te my husband aspatient z ero.We're atthe po intwhere initial patientsare  slowstarving to death  fromlack of nutrientintake.This entireepide m ic isdrivin gme craz y.
I can't leave the house , I can't go to work. T he normal sounds of community have  just d  ropped.Theentire ci ty has becomea   waking ni ghtma re. Well, maybe  abetter ch oi ce o fwordsw ould suffice.
But I have my fairytales,andI don' t think I'm okaywithstaying inside for any longe r. Prince Charming always finds somew a y to do it  and so will I. I'm done  with  dreaming andhave to start doing .Doi ng somet hing. Anything. Because Iam sovery t ired,andI don't want towake   up ina world like this.
