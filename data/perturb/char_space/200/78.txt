In the grand  scheme ofthings, pro secutors a nd victims ofviolentcrimes  are naturalallies.The  prosecuto rs strive tobring theoffenders tojustice , whether to fulfilltheir duty before  the law or achiev e career pr ogress. Atthe same time, the victims get moral satisfaction when the criminal s are broughtto justice. Therefo re, one mightthink that prosecutors andvictimsare natural lysupposedto  cooperate. However,  this logical scenario does not necessarily happen in practice. Sometimes, the victims cannot  adequately cooperate witht he prosecutorsdue t  o the experienced shock, fear,  or mistreatment in the prosecutor’s office. Duri ngthe mid-70s, the Law Enforcement Assi s tance A dministration fundedthefirst Victim/Witne ssAssistanceProjects (VWAPs) in order to enhancecoop erationbetween the prosecutors’ offic es andvictims (Karmen, 2 019). Witht ime,the VWAPs havebecome firmlyest  ablishedinstitutions   charged with thenoble missionofsupporting cri m e victims.Prosecutoroffices can assi st thevictims of  violent crimes through variou s means.The best practices incl udepsyc hologicalhelpin hotlinesandcrisis cou nseling, shelter,food,transportation,and property recovery (Karmen, 2019). In addition, most VWAPs make referrals to local agencies, whichprovide th e victimswith long-term car e(Karmen, 20 19).F urthermore, prosecutor of fices off er legalassistancethrough pamphlets about the adjudic ation process. Finally,VWAPs mitigateconfusion bynotifying the victims aboutindictments, postpone ments,  acquittals,convictions,  andother possibledevelopments in  the case (Karmen,2019).
