The new adaptatio n of Wi lliam Shakespeare's timeless tragedy, "Romeo and  Juliet," presents both strengths andweaknesses interms of capturing the themes of the original play.

The brawl between the  rival gangs lacks  the e motional  weight and  co nsequences seen in the original play.Consequen tly, the destructive  nature of violence , whichunderliesthe tragedy of the story ,is not adequately portrayed. This dilution of  the violence weakenstheoverall impactof the adaptation and dimi nishes the significance of thetheme.
