Withthe  current bro ad variety ofspeci es, as wellas the e mergent  news aboutthe  s pecies thatare onthe vergeofextinction dueto the impact of  the changes inthe en vironment, one might believe that discovering new  animals is no lo nger apossibility. Ho wever,newspeciesare  stilldiscovered regularly,  the   r ecent inc redible find being anexampleof tha t.  Namely, the Nimba myotis, also knownasthe fuzzy orange bat,or Myotis n imbaensis, has  been identified  as a new speciesthis  year (Simmonset al., 2021). Havingorange   fur withblack pigmentation,Nimba Myotis r epresents arathe r unusual specimen of bats. The animal prefersnatural caves as the place where it lives a nd rests.  Lik e othe rbats,Nimba M yotis  uses laryngeal echolocation as  the meansof identifyin g and catchingprey i n the d ark.However, due to  thespeciesin question bei ng under researched, itsdietis mostly unknown (Simmonset al., 2021).Overall,the bat  representsa unique specimen  in itsclass.
The species belo ngs totheanimal kingdom, p articu larly, t o mammal sof theChiroptera orderandthe Vespertilionidae family (Simmonsetal., 2021). The main ra t ionale forplacing it in the animal ki  ngdomis the fact that Nimba Myotis isa  mamma l . Additional ly, the specified species reproducessexually,unlike membe rs of other kingdoms, and is multicellular(Simmons et al.,2021).  Furthermore , the fact that cells inNimba Myotis donot have cell walls, allowscla ssif yingit with other  species in the Animalkingdom. Therefore,  thebat should be d efinedasan animal , particularly,amammal. Furthermore, one s hould notethat, b ei ng a ba t, Nimba Myotis  rep resents t he largestorder inthe mamma l class after rodents (Simmons et al., 2021). Overall,the discoveryof NimbaMyo  tis has shedalotoflight  onthe s pecies of bats,in general.
