She was shaking, I was  too, he was dead. Bl oodo n  my hands,  I hopedther e was still light behind my  eyes. I never ki lle d aman before ,  I never had  to  save someo nebefore.Ididn' t feel go od, or mighty. She broke,slumped to th e ground,  her body,a tremor as she sobbed.I dropped t heknife, I turned  tolook at wha t I haddone. She  shouted my name t hrough tears.He had so muchredon hisstomach,histhroat wa s open too. I   didthat? Idid that, Ihad  to.  I saidasmuch out loud . Againshe shou ted my name. I c ouldn't touch her th ough. She isso white,and I haven'tdecided i f nowI  am dark.I didn 't f eel t ainted, my heart was still beating so fast.I took a  long hard breath,  he is deadand so is hisi ntent,we are alive  becauseI wouldnotallow him to h ave his way.
