Chinahas announced plans tobuild bigger  rockets that ca n accommodate heavierpaylo adsfor commercial satellite m arket ex pansion. The move ispart ofChina'sgrowing push to become a major  pla yer in the commercial  space industry.
According to reports, China aims to build rockets  witha capacityof up to100tonnes, which woul d significantlyoutpace the 22-tonne capacity of the country's currentflagship rocket, the Long March 5.
The new rocketswill be able to launch multiple satellite s at once, allowing China tocompete wi th established commercial spacecompanie s such as SpaceX and  Blue Origin.Speaking about the plans, ZhouYanfei, deputy chief engineer at th e  China Aerospace Scienceand Technology Co rporation (CASC), said:"The heavier rocketwill provide stronger lift capability forspace missions. It  wil l m eet  the  growing deman d of China's sa telliteindustry for rocket  launch services."
Th e announcement comes just months afterChina launcheda succe ssful mission to the far sideof the moon, a feat ach ieved by no othercountry before. The mission, which involved la nding a rover on the moon's surface, marked a significant s tep forward in China's ambitious  space program.
China is also planningto buildits own space station, which is set tolaunch in 2022. The  s tation will be capable ofaccommodating three astronauts forup to six monthsatatimea ndw ill be used to conduct  scientific research in areas such as astronomy, space medi cine, and space physics.
However,  China's space ambitionshave not been without controversy. The country has been accused of engaging in space militarization,with s ome expertsexpressing concerns overthe development of anti-satellite weapons.
China hasdenied theseallega tions, stating that itsspace program is purely for peaceful purposes. Nevertheless, the country's growi ngspace capabilities haveraised concerns am o ngU.S.policymakers, who see C  hina as a potential rival in the global space rac e.
China's  plans to build bigger rock e ts for the  commercial sate llite market couldalso have implicationsfo r the global space industry. With China entering the market, establishedplayers such  as SpaceX may face increased competition,potentially driving down pricesandincreasing innovat ion in t he sector.
However, some experts have raised concerns over the environmental impactof increased rock et launches. The proces s of laun ch ing r ockets into space can have a signif icant impact onthe environment, with exhaust pollution cont rib uting to gree  nhous egas emissionsand other harmful pollutants.
