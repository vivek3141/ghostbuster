Adam had   been looking forwardto this Sunday serviceat St. Mary'sChurch forweeks. As  aregular attendee,he foundcomfort andsola ce i n thefamiliar rhythmsofthelitu rgyand the soothinghymns. Today, however, something strange wasabout to happ en thatwould foreve r change his perceptionof  religious rituals.
Asthe congregationsettled into their pews,  the clergy beganthe ceremony. It  was time for the holy actof Communion,where the  symbolicbody and blood of Jesus werebelieved to be shared amongstthe faith ful. The wine chalice, filled with what was s upposed to represent the "Bloodof Jesu s," was first blessed andthen gently passed downthe aisles.
Unbeknownst to the believers, a mischievous prankster h ad spiked the wine with LSD. As the chalice r eached Adam,he hesitatedfora moment , sensing somethingpeculiar inthe air. Obli vious to theimpending chaos,he confidently tooka si p and t henpassed it alo ng.
The service continued but soon,w hat was me ant to be a gentle  and serene atmospheretransformed into a swirling kaleidoscope of colors. The walls of  thechurch s eemed  alive, breathing and pulsating with each passing moment.Adam's heart rac  ed as theeffectsof the drug tookhol d, andhe felt a strange mixture of f earand euphoria washing over him.
