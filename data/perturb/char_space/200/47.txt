H& R Block Inc., citing problems facing the onli ne  serviceindustry, said Wednesdayit has decided notto complet e the spin-off of  the rest of its  CompuServe  onlineunit,atleast for now.
The Kansas City,Mo.-based company, whichowns 80 percent of CompuServe  after spinning off part of the online serv ice ea rlierthis year , cited CompuServ e's recent financial troublesanduncertainties facing the online ind ustry.
Industryanalysts said  the problems  reflect thechanges ripplingthroughtheonline industry but were also partly unique to Columbus, Ohio-based Compuserve, which has  about 5.2 millio n subscribers, slig htly m ore thanhalf ofthem outside of theUnitedState s.America Online   Inc., the largest with more than 6 million s ubscribers, No. 2 Com puserve andProdigy have all been hurt a s usershave g one directlytothe Internet with lower-cost Internet access providers rather than online service s.
Some  anal ysts have said that the online services, whic hoffer packagesofspecialised information as well as Internetacce ss, maynotsurvivei n the long run, tho ugh the eventual shape of th e online industry remains far from certain.
"A lot of the peopleare goingto readthis as theonline market is ata crossroads and pretty shaky," said  one analyst who fol lowstheindustry .
H&RBl ock spun off 20percent of CompuServe inApril and had planned to distribute the rest to its shareholders.Butitsaid  Wednesday that it ha s d ecided not topresent the proposed spin-off of the rest of CompuServe toshareholders at itsan nual meeting scheduled for Sept. 11.
"The board continues to believe that a separationof CompuServe i s in the best interests ofH&R Block share holders and will continue to consi der the matter," H&R Block interim President Fran k Salizzoni said.
CompuServe's stock has dropped from a high of $35.50 on itsfirstday of trading to near$10 recently.Thestock rose after Wednesday's announcement  because new CompuServe shares still owned by H&R Block will n otcome ont o  the market.
CompuServe added 93.75 cents to $13.25 on Nasdaq ,while H&R Block fell  $2.125to $25.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. America Online added 75centsto $31.625, also on Nasdaq.
In July, CompuServe shocked Wall Street with a warning that it expected a  loss for itsfirst quarter endedJuly 31, itsfirst asa publi cly traded company.The company blamedthe high costs of introducing its new Wow! consumer online service and investing inanoverhaul of its network infrastructure, as well as a decline in overall subscriber  growth as cancellationsoutpaced new customers.
In r esponse,CompuServe and H&R Bl ockw ere slappedwith a shareholder lawsuit allegingthey h admisrepresented  the online service's prospects in the prospectus for the st ock  offering.
When the company last weekr eported a first-quar ter lossof$29.6 million, or 32cents a share, it also warned investors that losses wou ld continue for the second quarterendingin October.
H&R Block,which is also the  nation's largestconsumer tax filing servic e, is likely t o wait for the online industry to  settle down before complet ing the spin-off, analystssaid.
Inaddition tothe losses,H&R Block cited the planned introduction next mont h of new technology for CompuServe  and i tsnew Wow!  service.
Meanw hile, America On line has had problems of  itsown, incl udin g price cu ts to s tay competitive with Inte rnet acce ss pro viders and an embarrassing  19-hour service blackout earlier this month.  But analystssaid t hat in contrast to CompuServe, America Online hascontinued to grow, though ataslower pace. 
"The problems CompuServe is having are likely t o benefit America Onlinein the n extnine months," one analyst said.
