Dedu ctive reasoninginv o lv esthe constru ction a nd  deve lopme nt of cause-and-effe ct solid relat ionships.It is noteworthy that  the connection is e sta blished either between two  facts o r a point a nd the idea of howit willaffect thefuture (Besnard& H unter, 2 018). Thus, a judgment (lo gical expression) includes the first –the prerequ isite s, the   se cond – the conclusion. In lo gic, an argum entis valid onlywhe nit has a form thatmakes it  impossible for th e premises to be correct  and the j udg ment to be wrong.A ccording to theexpla ined three types ofdeductive arguments, a v a lidstatement do e s  no tneed to have actuallytru stworthy premise s.Still,it must have ones that, if they were accurate, wouldguarantee thattheconclus ion is proper.
Example: 1. All meta ls are hea  vy 2. Tin isa metal 3. Tin is heavyA soundarg u mentm ust have b oth a valid form and tr ue pre mises. Valid arguments can be unsound,but they wil  l h a ve wro ng assumptions.
Example:1. All dogs arecats
 2. All mice are do gs
 3.All mice are    cat s
What mak es this a valid statement is  not thatit has trus tworthy premises and a  proper conclusionbut the   logicalnecessity of the judgment , given the two assumption  s. The argument would be just as valid ifthe premises and conclusion  were wrong. H owever, itis essential to determine that t   he purpose   of argumentation is to est ablish the truth of ajudgment.An invalidargument do esn ot achieve this goal, so i t cannot  be co nsider ed sound (Besnard & Hunter, 2 0 18). Asound argu ment has a valid form and true premises; thus,  itcannot  be inva lid in allcases. If the argumentis invalid, then the beliefs thorou gh ly donot matter,and, in fact, only the conclusion  remai ns. The r efor e, this meansthat there is no argument i n this case, especially a  sound one.
