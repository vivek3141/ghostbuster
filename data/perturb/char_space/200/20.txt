Inhis text entitled “The Entitlemen t Theory”,the  phil osopher Robert Nozick speculates on a truly justecon omic st  ructure in the ideal formof the state. Nozi ckfocuses on the issueo fpro  pert y,its transfer  and ratification,  offeringa model for claiming  j ust entitlement (Vaughn,2019).Real justice, ac cordingto Nozick,consists in the appropr iation ofholdings or their originalacquisition, their fair and consensualtransfer and theprotection of therightto th e ir property.
 According tothe  principle of fair acquisition, people can  take  possess ion of property  if theydonottake itfrom othersan d donotw orsen thesituationof others in theproc ess.The principleof fairtransf er im pliestheright todonate property or voluntarily e xchange it. Nozick imagines aw orld inwhichfree exchange  will abo lish the existence of a  value-currency i nterm ediary – that is, the needs of people willbe perceived as primary in thee xch ange of goods.Theprinciple o f ratification impl ies that a pe rson who ha s u nfairly takenp ossession of a holdi ng isobli ged to retu rnit to the owner.According to Nozick, no  one except the owners ment ioned inthe firsttwo principles hasthe right to property. Theauthor finds  a fair transfer ofproperty only inthose cases when th e pr operty wasoriginally acquiredfa irly and all subse quentsta ges in i ts transfe r are the same.
Theauthor calls this principle of fair distrib ution historical, in which itis thr ough  the cir cumstances or actionsofacquisition  th at one can judge  the fair  ness ofthe possessionof a thing. Borrowingfrom JohnLocke’s principle of the self-property ofpeople, Nozick says thatpeople  represent a set oftalentst hat belong tothem . Combin ingthesetalents  with  t he s urroundingw orld, they can encroachon theacquisition of part of this w orld  by agreement, thati s, to ac quireproperty.
