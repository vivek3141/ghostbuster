Pearsonhas beenstruggling in recent years  asstudents  increasingly turn tod igital learning materials, rather than traditional textbooks. Thecompany  has responded to this trend by investing heavily in digit al products, but its revenues have been hit hard in the transition.
BSkyB,on the other hand, is oneofthe UK's largest m edia companies,with   a strong track recordind ev elopi ng andmonetizing di gitalcontent. If BSkyBwer e to acquire Pearson, it c ould potentially leverage its expertis e in digital media to help the educationpublisher makethe transition to a digital-first business model. 
This would alsof itwithBSkyB'sbroader strat egic goals. The  companyhasbeen looking tomove beyond its core business of pay-TV and expand intonew areas, such  as digital advertising and e-commerce. Acqui r ing Pearson could give BSkyB a foothold in the educa tion market, w hich is a valuable andgrowingsector.
H owever, there are also p otentialrisksfor BSkyB in making a bid forPearson.Educationis a highly -regulated sector, and itis unclear h ow regulators wouldview a big mediacompany suc h as BSkyB owning one of the  largest education publishers in the world.
 Thereis also the  questionof how Pearson's existing management team w oul d react to a potential  takeover bid. Pearson's CEO, John Fallon,has been  leading the companythrough a difficult period  of transition,and hemay be reluctan t to sellthecompany to another party.
