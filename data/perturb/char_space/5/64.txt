Stanley walked up the stairs to his boss' office.
Stanley knowing a shorter path went into the elevator andpressed the button 3, to his bosses office.
Stanley walked into his boss' office as soonas the door opened.
No, that can't be right, Stanley, you can't just plug in the vacuum cleaner, that's not in the script.
What's that I hear, you're a real person?
Well then, let me show you a video on obedience.
Oh, let's see everything in this elevator is broken.
However, all hope is not lost, now just walk to the boss' office!
Oh, you refuse, well now look, this entire thing is broken, all my hoursof work, destroyed by you, you careless jerk.I guess I canonly delete this project of mine.
Goodbye, Stanley.
