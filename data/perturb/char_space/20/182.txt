It is important tonote that the bag market is a large one, where customers are highly segmented, and produc ts significantly vary in both quality and purpose. Therefo re, readjusting the bag price isessential in order to ensure that profits aremaximized on the basis of collected data. The previously selected price was $250, whichwasbased on high-end tote bag analysis findings of $65-$250. The product’s size  is 9×11 made from leather, and it has a cost per unit equalto $36. The initial price choice was motivated by profit maximization, but it is evident t hat it did not account for price’s inf luence on supply-demand. Therefore, the newly selec ted pr ice is $65, which is still almost tw ice as  high as the cost per unit, and the expected profit from each bag is equal to $29.
55% prefer to buy online, and tote bags are the fastest-growing handbag styles. Manylow-end bags have prices below $65, but the selected product is made from leather and can be categorized as a mid-range, and thus, it cannot be lower than  $65. The target audience  is middle-class and higher -class mothers, but it should be noted that the brand is still unknown and requires proper marketing to build brand image. Thus, it is unjustified to select a high price range and risk lowering the demand, an d it cannot compete with high-end bags and is not recognized as such.
