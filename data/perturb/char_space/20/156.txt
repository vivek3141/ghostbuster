"You ready yet?  I'm about to leave!"
"Yeah, I just need to find mykeys in this mess.. Do you  want to me to follow?" She asks as she rummages through her purse.
"Yeah that's fine. Be caref ul driving! See you in a bit sis!"
I get in my car and buckle up. God I hate these drives now thatwe're older.There used to be a time whe n I could just pick up my little sister from moms and we can drive togethe r, bethere at the sam e ti me, not have to worry abouttrafficor work. But then again , there used to be a time before that...when my parents were together.
*sigh* Nothing we can do now huh.. Landon st. left and, what was it, Jefferso n Rd right ? I check the rearview more than the actual road. I  hate driving. Damn, that new red mustang looks awesome...seems to be going a b it too fast too....
Oh god,
Please
I look back the the rearview, slow down sis...This guy se ems to be either stupid or dru - before I can look back again I hear the sound of glass shattering and metal grinding against itself, breaks screeching. No, nono no no no....
