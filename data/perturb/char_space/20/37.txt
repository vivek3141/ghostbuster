Feeling lost and alone, I thought of my loved ones, their facesfading as I traveled further awayfrom home. Tears we lled in my eyes as I yearned for familiarity.But amid the chaos, a glimmer of curiosity sparked within me. Embracing this new reality, I dec idedto make the most ofmy unexpected journey. With no way back , I resolved to adapt, learn, and perhaps, leave a markon this astonishing future that had inadvertently becomemy destination.
