‘ …and we'll have an interview with him and his prize marrow at around a quarter to eight. The time is six -fifty-five, and this is BBC Southern Counties Radio. ’
The daily news blares over the radio. Light ro lls through the curtains. I turn over in bed.Just another Monday morning. Minute s pass, and I h ear all the familiar sound. Cars on the road outside.My flatmates stirring in their rooms. T he world is waking up.
I struggle out from my cocoon of blankets andinto the cold of my bedroom. I like it that way. Every night I open the my window, to let the night in. Every morning the chill startles me awake. I open the curtains, look  out onto the street. The usual crowd waltz down t he street, going wherever it is they go. Someone glances up at my window, and hurriedly looks away as theyrealise I'm half naked.
As I walk across the room something crunches underfoot. A small, folded piece of paper on the floor. My name is written on it, in my own handwriting. I pick it up, scrutinise it. I don' t rememberwriting this.I open it, and read the words inside.
*Act normally, otherwise they'll notice. *
I' m confused. I really don't recall writing this. What does it mean? Who are ‘ they ’? The questions are rattled from my head by a knock atmy bedroom door.My flatmate.
‘ Huney, are youok in there? You 'll be late. ’
I look at the note again. And  hesitate.
