You own a magical camera that reveals the true value of obj ects through its lens, just like a thermal camera, but instead of he at, it showcases their worth. Rings and jewelryburn brightly like the sun, signifying their immense value. Pla stic wastage remainsalmost invisible, reflecting its negligible worth. You've always beencautious never to view a person through it.  Until t oday. Curiosity gets the better  of you, and you cautiou sly aim the camera at yourself. It shattersyour hear t towitness your reflection, obscure and dulled. It's then you realize how little you value yourself; it's time for a c hange.
