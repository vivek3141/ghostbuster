Level 49 Paladin, schizophrenic calling's, walking thr ough this wall-things all dayto come to grips with my prowess. Wow kids, don't let the boogey man boogie in your closet, y ou  must have forgot to lock it, agnosticparents with a pocket full of apocalypse and a head full of spaces. Taste this, another jesus bracel et broke,another spiri t invoked, hold on to hope so faith can poke it's head into the realm of the dead.
I spy with my little  eye a child teetering on the edge; hold hands with me and the rest ofyour invisible friends. It's better to break than continue tobend, snap your soul in two and let it  mend...was it real? What I saw? What was it truly doing what it did? What was hiddeninside of my mind projected or rea lity neglected...Something segmented and crittering beneath the flowboards of the Trojanhorse awoke my paralysis  through the sacred doors.
War of the worlds, obsolete factions matching gains and comparing beef-sticks, equipped to rip shit like timid midgets insistent on doing what t hey didn't. Try not to be so literal,  try  not to feel intangibles as they creep up your spine, just trust in the sky and the stars will align. I ain't no judge, I ain't no jury, I'm just a boy walkinwith a vision too blurry to comprehend foe from friend and truth from trend but then again I can close my eyes and count to ten.. no fingers required, no toes to slow my numeral crusade, okay?
