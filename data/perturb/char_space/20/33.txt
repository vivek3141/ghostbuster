The doctor’s job is to follow ethical standards, including loyalty to patie nts andrespect for their choice. However, the profession concentrat es on philosophical, religious, and cultural traditions and beliefs. Physician-assis ted suicide can be seen as voluntary de ath by a medical professional. At the same time, the doctor provides all the necessary means and information regarding the patient’s desires for the end of life. Howe ver, such cooperation onth e part of a doctor cannot be ethically conditioned.
Allowing euthanasia can cause irreparable harm to the patient if done incorrectly. Thus, a person can be left without the possibility of a habitual existence. Even though many patients who decide todie to suffer from incurable diseases voluntarily, the doctor cannot assist them. In this case, the moral commandm ent that a person cannot take someone else’s life is violated (Clarke et al.,  2021). Moreover, doctor-assisted suicide is wholly opposed to thedefinition of a profession a imed at helping people. The d octor is seen as a healer, while physician-assisted suicide does not seem to control and calculate the risks, which can be a threat to many patients.
The dilemma lies in the Hippocratic oath given by all doctors, one of the points of which is not to harm. Thus, helping a patient with a death wish can be seen as a de liberate wish to injure the person. Moreover, it may reduce the level of trust between patients and medical staff since taking a life cannot be ethically justified. In addition, the religious view forbids doctors tohelp patients at the end of life, referring to the commandment not to kill a person. Furthermore, killing may be considered offensi ve due to society’s moral attitude. The pat ient’s pain can be alleviated with the help of available medicine  s, while the loss of life is an irreversible action.
