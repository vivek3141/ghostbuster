It all happ ened so suddenly.
Thats all I couldthink about as my feet thundered across the rubble stricken ground, I couldn't see anyone elseabout, at least.. anyoneable to move. The bodies of those whodidn't make it l aid all around , drooping out of windows and crunchedup into  corners,still twitching lightly.
 Some of the fumes were still around, accidentally w alking into a patch of the thi ck white smoke would makeyou coughharshly and make you light headed forseveral minutes. But long time exposure could leave the person unable t o move and theywould eventually go insane, stuck sitting down occasionally laughing.
It all happe nedso suddenly, who would have thought legalising weed would do this?
