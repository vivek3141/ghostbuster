Inhis text entitled “The Entitlement Theory”, the philosopher Robert Nozick speculates on a truly just economic structure in the ideal form of the state. Nozick focuses on the issue of property, its transfer and ratification, offering a model for claiming just entitlement (Vaughn,  2019).  Real justice, according to Nozick, consists in the appropriation of holdings or their original acquisit ion, their fair and consensualtransfer and the protection of the right to their property.
According to the principle of fair acquisition, people cantake possession of property if they do not take it from others and do not worsen the situation of others in the process. The principle of fair transfer implies the right to donate property or voluntarily exchange it. Nozick imagines a world in which free exchange will abolish the existence of a value-currency intermediary – that is, the needs of peoplewill be perceived as primary in the exchange ofgoods. The principle of ratification implies that a person who has unfairly taken possession of a holding is obliged to return it to the owner. According to Nozick, no one except the ownersmentioned in the first two principles has the right to property. The author finds a fair transfer of property onlyi n those cases when the property was originally acquiredfairly and all subseq uent stages in its transfer arethe same.
The author calls this principle of fair distribution historical, in which it is through the circumstances or actions ofacquisition that one can judge the fairness of the possession of a thing. Borrowing from John Locke’s principleof the self-property of people, Nozick s ays that people represent a set of talents that belong to them. Combining these talents with the surrounding world, they can encroach on the acquisition of part of this world by agreement, that is, to acquireproperty.
