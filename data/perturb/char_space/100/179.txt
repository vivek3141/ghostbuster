Furthermore, the author’s p oint isto d efine the state of discrimination in the country and the world nowadays and explorewhat steps need to betaken to develop identity. The book educates readers on how black people perform in white society and how whiteon es act in their community, noting the var ioussubtleties andcharacteristics of security and privilege.
Moreover, one of the central themes is the concern of patience and silence. People need to understand that black children sit together becausethey feel understood and can develop a part of their identitythat remains unformed without these connections. They think that other individuals are incapab le of sharing their values, and therefore it is unsafe to be a part of t heir circle. One of the first effortsto comprehendsystemic discrimination is eliminating the fear,shame, and protectionaround the word racist. Whether white or colored, everyone is exposed to the smog of stereotypes, misinformation, prejudice, and disregarded history.
There is a tendency, especially among whites, to deny the existence of systemic racism becauseaccepting it as truth is like admitting thatthey are racist, and that needs to be altered. The autho r’s idea is th atthere must be a clear distinction between the negative attitudes, assumptions, andstereotypes that one person may project on another a nd how racism operates in society. If everyone understood discrimination as a set of policies and practices that systematically give white people an advantage over people of color, the matter would becomeapparent.

It is the educator who can control the nature of this in teractiondirectly. The book helps comprehend that education is the most promising tooltofight  racism and build inclusive societies. Children can and shouldbe taught equality, respect, and tolerance from a young age.

Education contributes to building a global community in which integrity, ethics, non-discrimination, and respect for the rule of law are essential pillars. The author’s centralmessage emphasizes the educator’s role indeveloping the students’ ability to operate existin g or acquired knowledge to alte r their behavior. It is necessary to promote proper conduct inappropriate circumstances, such as making ethical decisions and speaking out against discrimination. Fighting something as pervasive as systemi c racism may seem like an impossible task for an educator, but Tatum emphasizes that everyone can start with their sphere of  influence. Every individua l has  some impact on the lives of others and is capable of taking small steps that will dismantle racist systems.
The book has undoubtedly valuable sense, thoughsome of t heauthor’s ideas seem exagge rated, such as ubiquitous racism in the media.Daniel Tatum illustrates the discriminationthrough the Li on King example. According to the author’s bel iefs, the good characters are voiced by white people andare portrayed in a lighter shade, and the evil ones are expressed by minorities andare darker. This s ampleseems irrational because i t is evident that no discrimination was intended.
Moreover, no one would think about the skin color of the person who voices the cartoon , let alone any hidden socialor racial controversiesthat it might represent.T his example demonstrates that  not all of Tatum’s  arguments are valid, and one should not look forracism everywhere. If one p arses all movies or any media for that matter, one would  assume that they are all built on discrimination, even if they  are not. It is necessary to encourage proper intentions and equality rather than seeking racism.
