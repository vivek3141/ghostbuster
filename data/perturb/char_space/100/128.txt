I love the music.  It reflects w hatis j ust about to happen .  It has saved me from more than a few relationshipsthat wouldhave be e n unsavor y.
 I have  two theories about the music.  Either I am t he onlyone who hears it, or everyone does and no  one ever t alks about it.  Which is fine.Music is a very personalthing after all.Normally, the music  is alwaysatacomfortable level, un less it is trying to warn me  of som ethingdir e.There was one moment whereâ€¦ One moment where the sound was deafen ing.
Therewas a rising crescendo ever since Iwoke up that morning. Iturned o n the news  towatchwhile eating breakf ast,  as I always do. Usuall y the music goes back and fort h between dramaticandmore more lulling, dependingon the  news break about to come up.But that morningitdidn 't change. I t  just crescendoinguntil the newscaster spoke.
"TheWorldTrade Centers have beenhit." I dropped m yfo rk. The ting  of  it hitting the table was all  I could hear. For the firsttime, e ver, my world had gonequiet.
As I watched the events unfold, the music contin ued to be silent. Fin ally, after what felt like days but was  onlyminutes, it started piping up again. A long, lowclarine tp layed . And then other instr uments s lowlyjoined it. Somethingsad, but hopeful. Itwasplaying  as I was heading  out the doo r to go to my Red Cross tosee what I could  do tohelp.
