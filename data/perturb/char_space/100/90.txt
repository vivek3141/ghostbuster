  Jack sat alone inhis small apartment, th e soft glow of his laptop illuminating the room. He absent-mindedly scrolled through his social media feed, tr ying to distract himself from the s uffocating weight of grief that consumed him. It had been a couple ofmonths since his father's passing, a devastating battle with cancer thats  tole him awaytoo soon. 
As Jack mindlessly shuffled through the digital world,a familiar ringtonebroke the silence, cutting through his vulnerability. His heart raced as helooked at the screen, seeing the fami liar name displayed: "Dad." Panic mingled with hope as he answered the call.
"Hello?" Jack's voice quivered, afraid togivein to  the hopethat twisted wi thinhim.
"Hey, son. How are you ho ldingup?" The voice on the other endof the line was unmistakablyhis father's. It was warm and comforting, just a sJack remembered.
"Dad? Is that really you? But... you're gone. .." Jack stammered, his mind struggling to make sense of th e impossible.
There was a strange pause on the other end before his father replied, "Jack , what are you talking about? I'm fine. I'vebeenthinkin g about you a lot lately, and I wanted to reach out."
Unease crept up Jack's  spine. How could his father not remember? Was h e losing his grip on reality? He tried to recall the fun eral, the anguish and tears he witnessed, but itfelt distant, almost like a fragmented memory."Dad, you died. I attended your funeral. How can you not remember?" Jack's voice trembledwith fear and confusion.
Silence hung in the air, pregnant with  mystery and unanswered questions. Finally, his father spoke hesitantly, "Jack... I don't know what you're talking abou t. I've been fine, spending my days painting and enjoying life. Are you feeling alright, son?"
The weight of a thousand doubts and uncertainties crashed downon Jack. Was he going insane? Could hetrust his memories? Nervously biting his lip, he  tried to rationalize the situation. If his father was  alive and well, then where were his funeral memoriescoming from? Was heliving in an alternate reality?
Overwhelming curiosity  mingled with a growing sense of desperation. Jack decided he had to find answers, to understand why he remembered a parallel timeline that didn't seem to have happened. He reac hed out to his friends, searching for anyone whomight rec all his father's passing, but they all looked at him with confusion.Hours blurred into days as Jack relentlessly dug into his past, scouring documents, old photographs,and even searching onlinedatabases. Yet, there  was no trace of his father's death. It was as if his memories were a figment of hisimagination, haunting him as a cruel trick.
Sleepless nights turned into weeks, as Jack's sanity slipped furtheraway. He questioned everythoughtthat entered his mind, ev ery memory that whispered to him. The lin e between reality and fantasy began  toblur, leaving him utterly lost amidst the labyri nth of his own mind.
Finally, Jack stumbled upon a faded newspaper artic le, buried deep within an archive . It wasdated years befor e his father's supposed death, recounting amiraculous recovery from terminal cancer. The article featured his father's beaming face, defyingthe odds and the grasp of death.
Tears w elled up in Jack's eyes asrealization washed over him like a calming tide. He had been living in a timeline that never existed,a painful delusion that robbed himofhis father's continued presen ce.The immense grief he ha d carried, the solitude that engulfed him, all borne from a mind fractured by sorrow.
With trembling hands, Jack dialed his father' s number once again, praying for the familiar war mth to greet himonthe other end. His heart soared as his father'svoiceechoed through the phone.
"Dad, I need to apol ogize. I don't know whathappened,bu t I got losti n  a worldwhere I believed you were gone. Can we meet?"
Hisfather's voice softened,full of compassion, "Of course, son. Let'smeet. I've missed you."
In that moment, Jack found solace in the truth andthe love that existed beyond the constraints of hi s fractured mind. The journeyto rediscover himself was far from over, but with newfound clarity and the warmthof his father's love, he knew he could face anythingthat lay ahead.
