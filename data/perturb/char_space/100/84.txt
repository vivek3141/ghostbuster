Be  ing a well-developed market with a high purchasing power of the population, Canada presen ts an array an opportunities for fore ign exports,  namely the U.S. Within this framework, agricultural ex ports reflect a considerable part of theoverall trade. Can ada remains the U.S.’s second-largest partner in this regard, and the relations aresupported by favorable agreement s between the nations. This report eval u ates Canada as a n agri cultural export destination  with an emphasi s on nuts andpistachios, in particular.
The process ofagricultural export into Canada is well-regulated,which promotes the safety and transparency o f trade relations. According tothe U.S. International Trade Administration, Canada accounts for 1 5% of the count ry’s total agricultu ral exports with $22 billion, m ost of whichare con sumer-orient ed. Through this exchange, Canada receives high-value products fo r its population, whe reas the U.S. support over 130,000 jobs. Since 1989, most American agricultural products  have entered Canada duty-free under the NAFTA and U.S.-Canada Free TradeAgreement,currently  replaced by the USMCA. Supply-managed products, such as dai ryandeggs, are not covered by th e agreement, which still implies tha t pistachio export will benefitfrom duty-free relations. As pert he agr eement, all shipments are required to  have a USMCA Certification of Origin in addition to the standa rd export documentation package (Government of Canada). For the consumer’s safety, Canada requests all exporters to provide a Phytosanitary Certificate for plant p roducts. They o fficially confi rmed th at they are pest-free, conforming with t he import er’s sanitary requirements, and have been inspected by the authoriz ed agency of the United States (Government of Canada). This way, the overall safety of agricultural exports is ensured.Because of the favorable trade environment, the export turnover between the United States  and Canada  hasbeen considerable.Within it, n uts trade hasbeen important,as conditioned by the climatic differences. Table 1 reflects the dynamics of the agricultural product and nut export to Canada. Table 2 contains the history of pistachio import in Canada.

Overall, Canada remains one of the leadingtrade  partners of the UnitedStates, as conditioned by the geographical  proximity of the countries, as  well as  their policy alignment.These relationsare well-regulated  by a history of mutuallybenefici al agreements that alleviatebureaucraticbarriers, while supporting the safetyand transparency of the trade. Pistachio exports into Canada wieldan increased potential in this regard,as long as the sanitaryrequirements are respected.
