‘ …and we'llhave an interview with himand his prize marrow at arou nd a quarter toeight . The time issix-fifty-five, andthisis BBC Southern Counties Radio. ’
The daily  n ews blares over th e radio.Li ght rol ls through the curtains.I turn over inbed. Just another Monday morning. Min utes pass, andI hear all the familiarsound. Cars on t he road outside. My flatmates stirring in their rooms. Theworld is waking up.
I strugg le out from mycocoon of blankets and into  thecold ofmy  bedroom. I like itthat way. Everyni ght I open the my  window, to letthe night in.Every mornin g the chill startles me awake.I  open the curtains, looko ut ontothe st ree t. T he usual crowdwa ltz down the street,goingwherever itis theygo.Someone glances up at my window, a nd hurriedly looks away as they realiseI'm half naked.
As I walk across the room s omething crunchesunderfoot. A small,folded pi ece of paper on the  floor.My name iswritten onit,in my own handwriting. I pick it  up, scru tiniseit. I don't remember writing this. I open it, and read  the words in side.
*Act normally, ot herwise they'l l notice. *
I 'm confused. I  really don'trecall writin g this. What doesitmean?Wh o ar e‘ they ’? The questionsare rattled from my head by a knock at my bedroom door. My flatmate.
‘ Huney,areyouok in the re? You'll be late. ’Ilook at the note again.  Andhesitate.
