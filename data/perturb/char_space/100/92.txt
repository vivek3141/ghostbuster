One way in which learned optimism serves as a coping mechani sm for nurses is by helping them reframe nega tive situations. I n high-stress moments, nurses may encounter difficult patients, medical errors, or conflicts with colleagues. These  experiences can easily lead to feelings offrustration, guilt, or anger. However, by utilizing learned optimism, nurses can reframe these situations and focus  on the positiveaspects.
