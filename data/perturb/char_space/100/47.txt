H&R Block Inc., citing problems facing the online service i ndustry, said Wednesday it has decidednot to  complete  the  spin-off of the rest of its CompuServeonline unit, at least for now.
T he Kan sas City, Mo.-based company, which owns 80 percent of CompuServe after spinning off part ofthe online service earlier this year,cited Compu Serve's recentfinanc ial troubles anduncertainties facing the online in dustry.
Industry analysts said the probl ems reflect the changes rippling through the online industry but werealsopart lyunique to Columbus, Ohio-based Compuserve, which has about 5.2 million subscribers, slightly more than halfofthem outside of the United States.
America Online Inc., the largest with more than 6 million subscribers, No. 2 Compuserve and Prodigy have all been hurt as users have gone directly to  the Internet with lower-cost Internet access providers rather than online services.
Someanalysts have said that the onlineservices, which of fer packages of specialised inform ation as well as Internet access, may not survive in the long run, though  the eventual shape of the online industry rem ains far from  certain. 
"A lot of the people are going to read thisasthe online market is at a crossroads and pretty shaky,"said one analyst who follows the industry.
H&R Block spun off 20 percent of CompuServe inApril and had planned todistribute the rest to its shareholders .But it said Wednesday that it has decided not to presentthe proposed spin-off of  the restof CompuServe to shareholders at its annual meeti ngscheduled for  Sept. 11.
"The board continues to believethat a  separation of CompuServe is in the best  interests of H&R Block s hareholdersand will continue toconsider the matter ," H&R Block interim President Frank Salizzonisaid.
CompuServe's stock has dropped from a high of $35.50  on its first day of trading to near $1 0 recently. The stock roseafter Wednesday's announce mentbecause new CompuServe shares still owned by H&R Bloc k willnot come onto the market.
CompuServe added 93.75 cents to $13.25 on Nasdaq, whi le H&RBlock fell $2.125 to $25.75  on the New York Stock Exchange. America Online added 75 cents to $31.625, also on Nasdaq.
In July, CompuServe shocked Wall Street with a warning that it expected a loss  for its first quarter ended July 31, its first as a publiclytraded company.
The company blamed the hi gh costs of introducingits newWow! consumer  online service and investing in an overhaul of its network infrastructure,  as well as a decline in overall subscriber growth as cancellations outpaced new cust om ers.
In response, CompuServe andH&R Block were slapped with a shareholder lawsuitalleging they had misrepresented the online service's pr ospects in the prospectus for the stock offering.
Whenthe company last week reported afirst-quarterloss of $29.6 million, or 32 cents a share,it also warn ed investors that losses would continue for thesecond quarter ending in October.
H&R Block, which is also then ation's largest consumer tax filing service, is likely to wait for the onl ine industry tosettledown before completing the  spin-off, analysts said.
In addition to th e losses, H&R Block cited the planned introduction next month of new technology for CompuServe and its new Wow! service.
Meanwhile, America Online has had probl ems of its own, including price cuts to stay competitiv e with Internet access providers  and an embarrassing 19-hour service blackoutearlier th is month.But analysts said that in  contrast to CompuServe,America Online has continuedto grow, though at a slower pace.
"The problems CompuServe is having are likely to benefit America Online in the next ninemonths," oneanalyst said.
