MCI Co mmunications Corp. said Monday itreached a  10-year d eal wi th  NextWave Telecom Inc. that thrusts MCI int o the top tier of U.S. wireless communications providers.
Under terms of the deal,MCI saidit will connect itsnetwork to  a system p lannedby NextWave to provide personal communications services, giving it the capacity to of fer service t o more than 110 mil lion individuals in 63 areas, including 29 of the top 50 markets.
Washington-based MCI said it will buy at least 10billion minutes of capacity for its personal communications services from NextWave over 10 years. Terms of the deal werenot disclosed.
Personal communicationsservices represent the new generation of celluar communicatio ns services, allowing customers to sendboth voice and data transmissionsover wireless telephones.
The deal will help underpin the financial future of debt-laden Ne xtWave, which was the largest bidder in the U.S. Federal Com  mu nications Commission's auctions  fo r "C-band" wireless radio spectrumheld in earlyJuly.NextWave, based in San Diego and New York, also plans tosell sto ck to the public.
For MCI, the deal enables it to expand quickly into therapidly growingmarket for wireless personalcommunications services.
Two years ago, MCI dropped out of the auctions for U.S. PCS licences af ter thebidding became too rich for its taste.
But withthe NextWavepact and previous smaller deals, MCI has moved tobecome a majo r reseller of wireless services.
A s part of the deal, NextWave selected MCI to providetelecommunications and other services su pporting the development and ongoing operations of itspersonal communications services system, MCI said.
"This agreement with NextWave establishes an  immediate nationwide PCS footprint for MCI and represents an important next step in MCI's wireless strategy," said Whitey Bluestein, vice presi dent for  MCI wireless strategy and development.
"This is t he first full interconnection agreement  of its kind and brings new competition  to the wireless marketpl ace," he said,noting that with full interco  nnection, MCIdoes notneed to own its own wireless facilities.
MCI said the NextWave agreement is a model for additional agreements it expects to signwith other wireless providers as part of its wireless interconnected network st rategy.
The strategy is MCI's blueprint for developing a full range ofwireless services and features that will be integrated into MCI's existing commun ications services."This was MCI's strate gyall along," saidJeffrey Kagan, an Atlanta-based telecommunications industry analyst.
Kagan said MCI has historically preferred to re sell communications services initi ally rather than i nvesting in its own infrastru cture. Over time, thecompany selectively builds it s own infrastructure as it proves profitable to do so.
"Reselling service was how they became a heavy hitter in l ongdistance in the first place," Kagan said."Whattheir pla n is, is to resell service from other providers and  build networks where they see the need todo so," he said.
Kagansaid MCI's deal with N extWavemarks the rapid realisation of its reselle r strategy. "This al l of a sudden puts MCI on the wireless communications map i n a big way."
Still, he noted that AT&T Corp. 's AT&T Wireless unit, the former McCawCellular business , remains twiceas large as MCI's cellular business, with about 6.5 million subscribers in geographic regions covering 207 million potential customers.
MCI's deal with NextWave covers about 110 million potential customers livingin a mix of metropolitan andless-densely populated areas.
MCI's stock traded at $25.25 a share Mond ay, down 25 cents,  onNasdaq.
