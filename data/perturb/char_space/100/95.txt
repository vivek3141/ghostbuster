With the currentbroad variety of s pecies, as well  a s theem ergent news about the species that areon the verge of extinction due to the impact of the changesin the environment, one might believe thatdi scoveringne w animals is no longer ap ossibility. However, newspecies are still  discovered regularly,the recent in credible  find being anexample  of that. Namely, the Nimbamyotis,also known as th efuzzyorange bat, or Myotis nimbaensis, has beenide ntified as a new species  thi s year (Simmons et al., 2021). Having orange fur with black pigmentation,  Nimba Myotisrepresents a rather unusual specimen of bats.Th e animal prefers natural cavesasthe place where itlives and rests.Like other bats, Nimba Myotis useslaryngeal echolocation as  the means ofid entifying andcatching prey in the dark. However, due to the species in question being under researched, its d ietis mostly unkno wn (Simmons et al., 2021). Overall, the bat represents a u nique specimen  inits class.
The species belongs to the animal kingdom, part icularly,to mammals of the Chiroptera order and the Vespertilioni dae family (Simmons et al.,2021). The main ration ale for placingit in the animal kingdom is the  f actthatNi mba Myotisisa mammal. Additionally,the specified spec ies reproduces sexually, unlike members of other kingdoms, and is multicellular(Simmons et al., 2021). Furthermore, the fact that cells in Nimba Myot is do not have cell  walls, allows classifying it with other s pecies in the Animal kingdom. Therefore, the bat should  be definedas an animal, particularly, a mammal.Furthermore, ones houldnote  that, being a bat, Nimba  Myotis  representsthe largest order in the mammal class after  rode nts (Simmons et al. , 2021). Overall, the discoveryof Nimba Myotis has shed alot of lighton thespeciesof bats, in general.
