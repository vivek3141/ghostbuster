...Shewas  shaki ng,I was too, he was  dead. Blood  onmy hand s, I hoped there  was still light behind myeyes.Inever killeda man before, I neverhad to savesomeone before. I didn't feel good, or mighty. She broke,slumpedto the ground, her body, a tremor as she sobbed. I dr oppedthe knife, I turnedto look at what I had done. Sheshouted my name through tears.H e had so mu chred  on hisstomach,his throat was opentoo. I did th at? I didthat, I had to. I saidasmuch out loud. Again she shouted my na me. I couldn't  touch her thoug h. She is so wh ite, and I haven 't decided ifnow Iam dark. Ididn't feel tai nted, my heart was still  beating so fast. I t ook a long hard breath, he isd eadand so is hi sin ten t,we are al i vebecause   I would not allow him to have hisway . Againshe shouts, but I'm deep inthought. Another long breath. I came to  a conclusion.I killeda man today, I did the right thing, I beat him to the punch, a nd I'm st ill  here  and I st ill haveto take care of her.
I told  her to stand, nicely,  Ioffered her ameek smile, and apologizedfor wh at she ha d seen and what I had to do. Istartedto explain why, but fuck it,  she can't hear anything, *she's in shock  Boone, get her inside*. I wal k her up the  street, she remembers she can'twalk in he els. She sees  the life on my hands, and that se ts heroff again. We go insidea shittymexican restaurant. I sit her down,I go to w ash my hands. I do itwit h my closed, I'm not sure if I wanna look at the guy who looks back atme above the sink. I'm not sure if I wanna be the voice on the phone to the police. I puke in the sink, maybe some got on myshoes.
What the hellam I doing?
