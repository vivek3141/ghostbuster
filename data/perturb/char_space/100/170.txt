Criminal intent is crucial when analyzing extortion cases. The perp etrator must have the intent to obtain something of value, such as money or property, from the victim. This intent distinguishes extortion  from other crimes, such as robbery or fraud.Additionally, the act of exercising control over the vict im is integral. This control can beestablished through physical confinement, emotional manipulation, or the threat ofexposingpersonal informationor trade secrets.
Potentia ldefenses to extortion charges may include lackof intent, co ercion, or entrapment. Claiming a lack of intent can be a valid defense if the accused can demonstrate that they didnot intend to obtain something of value through threats or acts of control.Coercio n can also be argued asa defense if the accused can provide evidence that they were forced into committing extortion through threats or violence.However, entrapment, where lawenforcement officials induce individualsinto committing extortion, is often not a valid defense.
