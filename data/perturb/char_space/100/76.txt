In Plato'sGorgias, the philosophical dialogue between Socrates, Gorgias, Polus, and Callicles revolves around the nature and purposeof rhetoric and oratory skills. Plato, through Socrates, criticizesthe opportunistic use of rhetoric for personal gain and highlights the importance of truth and justice in public speaking.
Socrates argues that rhetoric is mere flattery and a dangerous art if used without moral considerations. He em phasizes the need for orators to seek truth and pursue the  greater good rather than manipulatepeople 's emotions for self-serving purposes. Thi s can be seen when Socr ates questions Gorgias about the aim  of rhet oric, revealingthat Gorgias is  more focused on the power itgives him rather than its et hical implications.Similarly, the film  "Thank You for Smoking" provides a satirical takeon thepower of rhetoric inmodern society. Ni ck Naylor, the protagonist, utilizes his proficient oratoryskills as a spokesperson for the tobacco industry. He deceives the public by presenting strong argu  ments in favor of smoking, manipulating statistics,and using persua sive techniques.Naylor embodies  the opportunistic rhetoric that Plato criticizes, as he prioritizes his personal gainsoverth e well-beingand truthfulness of his discourse.
However, Plato's Socrates argues that tru e ora tory  skillsshouldserve justi ceand promote genuine knowledge. He valuesinternal consistency and logicalcoherence over eloquent speeches lacking substance. This  can be seen i n the dialogue when Socrates questionsCallicles, who belie ves in the superiorit y of those who can use rhe toric to satisfy their desires. Socrate s  challenges Calliclesto defend hisposition logically, exposing the flaws in his argumentand provin g that rhetoric alone cannot lead to a justsociety.
By showingthenegative consequences of manipulative rhetoric, "Th ank You for Smoking" supports Plat o's argument that the power of pers uasion mustbe used ethically. As the film progresses, Naylor experiences amoral awakening and acknowledges the harmful effects oftobacco products. He realiz es thathis rhetoricalskills can also be used to advocatefor consumer safety, shifting from de ceitful persuasion to a mo re righteousoratory.
In conclusion,Plato's Gorgias presents a critical examination of rhetoricand oratory sk ills, highlighting the importa nce of truth  and justice in publicspeaking. Thefilm"Thank Youfor Smoking" provides  a contemporary illustrationof Plato's   arg uments, as it explores t he deceptive nature of opportunist rhetoric and the potential for individuals to use their skills to pursue moral ends.
