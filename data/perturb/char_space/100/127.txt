   a.Carbon footprint: My omnivorous diet contributes to a larger carbon footprint compared to a purely plant-based diet due to the greenhou se gas emis sionsassociated with animal agricult ure.
   b. Deforestation and biodiversity  loss: My consumption habits indirectly contribute to deforestation and habitat destruction, asanimal agriculture  is a driving force behind land degradation and biodiversity loss.
   c. Water consumption: The animal agriculture industry consumes significant quantities of water, leading to water sca rcity in many parts of the world.
