China is set to all ow foreign companies tohave an expanded role in the country's key power sector. This move  is part of the government's ong oingeffortstoopen up its economy to foreign investme nt.
The State Council, China 's cabinet, has  approved adraft policy that woul d allow foreign companies tooperate andown a majority stake in  power transmission and distribution projects in thecountry. This marks a significant change from thecurrent policy which limits foreign ow nershipto a maximum of 49%.
Foreign companies willalso be allowed to invest in and operate power generationprojects in the country, which was previously restricted to domesti c firms. This is a majorboost f or fo reign firms seeking to  invest in China's energy sector, which has hugegrowth potential due to the country's rapid economic development.
The policy change comes amid growing tension s between Chi na and the US over trade and investment. The  Trump administration has been pushing  Chi na toopenup its mark ets to  UScompanies and address issuessuch as intellectual property thef t and forced technology transfer.China has beentaking steps to address these concerns,including announcing plans to lift restrictio ns on forei gn ownership in a number of sectors, in cluding finance, automotive, and t elecommunications. The move to allow for eign firms  to take abigger rolein the powersector isseen as a continuation ofthese efforts.
The policy change is also in line with China's long-term goal of reducing its dependence on fossil fu els and increasinginvestment inrenewable energy . The countryisalready theworld's lar gestmarket forsolar and wind power,andthenew policy is expected to furthe r boost investm  ent in th ese areas.
However, themove  to allowgreater foreign investment in the powersector is likely t oface resistance fr om some  quartersin China. Some domestic firms may argue that this couldlead to increased competition, while others may expressconcerns ov er national security implications.
Nevertheless,the move is s eenasa positive development for foreign companies seeking to invest in China. It is also seen as a signal that China i s committed to opening upits econo my and playing amore act ive rolein the global market.
