Pearson Stock Surges On Rumors Of Potential Takeov er Bid By BSkyB
S hares in  Pearson, theworld's lar gest educational  publisher, surgedon Frid ay on rumors of a potential takeover bid by BSkyB. The share s closed up 12% at£1,155, giving the company amarket capitalization of nearly £9bn.
The rumors of a takeover bid began on Thursd ay when a reportin the Financial Times suggested  that Rupert Murdoch's  News Corp was considering a bid for Pearson. News Corp already owns a 39%stake in BSkyB, and the report suggested that News Corpcoulduse BSkyB as a vehicle to makeabi d for Pearson.
The report sent Pearson's share price soaring on Thursday,and thestockcontinued toclimb on Friday following furth er rumors that BSkyB was indeed plann inga bid.
Neither Pearson nor BSkyBhave comm ented onthe rumors, and it is unclear whether a bid will materialize. However, analystshave su ggestedthat a takeover of Pearson by BSkyB could make s trategic  sense.
 Pearson has  been struggling inrecentyears as studentsincreasingly turn to digital learning material s, rather than traditiona ltextbooks. The company  has respond ed to this trend by investing hea vily in digital products,but its revenues have been hit hard in the transition.
BSkyB, on the other hand, isone ofthe UK's largest media companies, with astrong track record in developing and monetizing digital content. If BSkyB wereto acquire Pears on, it could potentially leverage  its expertise in digital media to helpthe education publisher make the t ransition to a digital-first business model.
This would also fit withBSky B's broader strategic goals.    The comp any has beenlooking to move beyond its co rebusiness of pay-TV and expand in to new areas, such as digital advert ising and e-commerce. Acquiring Pearson could give BSkyBa foothold in the education market , which is a valuableand gro wing sector.
However, the re are also potential risks for BSkyB in making a bid for Pearson. Education is a highly-regulated sector, and it is unclear how regulators would view a big mediacompany such as BSkyB owning one of the largest education publishers in the world.
There isalso the q uestion of how Pearson's existing management team would react to a potential takeover bid. Pearson's CEO, John Fal lon, has been leadingthe company through a difficult period of transition, and he may be relu ctant t o sell thecompanyto another party.
Despitethese uncertainties,the r umors of a potentialtakeover bid by BSkyB have put Pearson'ssharesfirmlyin the spotlight. Whether or not a bid materializes remains to b e seen, butfornow,investors are clearly e x cited about the possibility of a deal.
