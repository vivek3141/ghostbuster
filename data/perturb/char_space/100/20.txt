In his text entitled “The Entitlement Theory”, the philosopher Robert Nozick speculates o n  a truly just eco nomic  structurein the ideal form of the sta te. Nozick focuses on the issue of pr operty, its transfer and ratification,offering a model for claiming justentitlement (Vaughn, 2019). Real jus tice, according toNozick, consists  in the  appropriation  of holdings or theiroriginal acq uisition, their fairand consensual transfer and the protection of the right to their property.According to  the  principleof fair acqu isition,people c an take possession of property if they  don ottake it from others and  d o not worsen the situationof others in the process. The principle of fair  transfer implies the right t o don ate property or voluntarilyexchange  it. Nozick imagines a worldin which free excha nge will abolish theexistence o f a value-currency intermediary – thatis, the needsof peopl ewill be perceived asprimary in the exchange of goods.The principle of ratification implies that aperson who has unfairlytaken  possession o f a holding is obligedto retu rn it to the owner. Acc ording to Nozick, no one except the owners mentionedin the firsttwo p rinciples has the right to  property. The author finds a fairtransfer of property onlyin those caseswhent heproperty wasor  iginally acquired fairly and all subsequent stagesin it s transfer are  the same.
The author calls this principle of fair distribution h istorical,in which it is through the  circumsta nces or actions ofacquisition that one canjudgethe fairness of the possession  of a thing. Borrow ing from JohnLocke’s principleof the  self- property ofpeople, Nozick says that people representa setof talents that belong to them. Combiningthese talents w it hthe surrounding world, they can encroach on the acquisition of part of this world by agreement, that is, to ac quire property.
