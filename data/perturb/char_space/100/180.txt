Eight of t he top 10  public ly tradedU.S. health maintenance organizat ionsare expected toreport lower or flat fourth-quarter profitsas the industry shuts the books on a dismal year and moves warily into 1997.
Dissatisfied  with narrow profit margins, WallStreet is t urni ng cautious on many HMO stocks, although ple nty ofmergerand acquisition action u nderliesthe s ector andis supporting the shareprices of firmsseen as targets.
"Consolidation will remain at a   high level," said  Salomon Brothersmanaged he althcare analyst Robert Hoehn.  
As HMOs re por t quarterlyresults over the next fe w weeks, twocompanies  are expected to defy the earn ings slump.
Booming Oxford Health Plan s Inc has been a bright  s pot in  the gloom all year and isforecast to post pr ofits 70 percent higherthan the year -ago level, analysts said.
Pa cifiCare Heal th Systems Incis expected to show 10 to  13 percent earnings improvement, althoughits quarter willbe complicated by a pending a cquisitio n of FHP International Corp.
"It's sort of a throw-away quarter for" PacifiCare, said Vol pe Welty analyst Ed Keaney. 
The problem that mostHMOs were unable to solve throughout 1996 was a costly mismatch between medical cost inflation forecasts that fell s ho rt and an inability to pushthrough compensatory pre mium increases.A margin squeeze resulted.
"This  year there maybe room for a little bit of(prem ium) expansion as the year unfolds, butnot enough o f an increase tomake it possible for  these comp anies to restore margins to  previous levels," Keaney said.
