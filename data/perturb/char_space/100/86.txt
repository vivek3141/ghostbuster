Millions of people worldwide suffer from mental disorders: manias,phobias, and panic attacksexhaust and torment  a lotof individuals. One of the widespread, long-lasting mental ailments is an obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD,which consis tsof obses sive thoughtsand compulsive behavior that are almost impossible to control. The analysis of this disorder dueto the four  D diagnostic indicators can let us explore it more profoundly andthoroughly.
  * Distress: OCD often makes individuals f eelabnormal whenthey are forced to fight  the ter rible thoughts torturing their heads and repeat meaningless acts intended to decrease anxiety. In addition, having “unwanted, recurrentand persistentimages or impulsesthat evokeanxiety or extreme distress” andrealizing “the unreasonable nature of symptoms” people cannot stop  them (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020, p. 1-2). Theybec ome nervous  and depressed: therefore, the level of distressis high and complicates the pers on’s life.
  * Dysfunction: This disorder significantly influencesthe dailylif e of a patient. Firstly, obsessive thoughtsoften interfere w ith the usual  people’s acts and cause a surge of panic, d i sturbing to complete their work. Sometimes,  “cognitive biases cause dysfunctional beliefs” (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020, p. 2). Secondly, compulsive a ctions interrupt a patient’s daily routine,  forcingthem to do specific stepsa certain number of times. Such activities can last  even for an hour or more: therefore, the extent of dysfunction is also noticeable.
  * Danger:OCDmayrepr esent a significant danger for an individual sinc e sometimes, people  feelso depressedthat they are ready to commit suicide. In addi tion, sometimes, they may tryto de feat th eir  obsessive thoughts,causing self-pain: for instance, they can strike themselves to getrid of theunwanted  image. However, although oneof the most widespread fears of people withOCDis to harm others, they rarely do it (O’Connor & Aude, 2019). Thus, the level  of danger to self is  significantly higherthan thatof dan ger to others.
  * Deviance: Since OCDcauses abnormal thoughtsand behavior, people with such a disordercan be characteri zed as de viant. However, it would be wrong to claim thatit is easy to “determine the degree of devia tion from the norm”  (D avis, 2009,p. 1). OCDcauses anxiet y, stress, andpanic; it makes people  live in fearthat ifthey donot do specific actio ns, they will not be able to avoid danger. Therefore, an individual should visit a clinic and let specialists hel p them fight.
