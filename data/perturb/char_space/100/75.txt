It always puzzled me, to say the l  east, and ma deme extremely  nervous.
As such I never committedinto relationships,  probablyby  great ofhaving  my feelings not reciprocated.
My longe strelationship was with a man I loveddeeply, Indy. H e was the complete opposite of me:  extraverted, charming, outgoing. He was friend w ith every one,but still reliable  and generous.
We stayed together for a couple of years, a nd, Ido n't know  why,but it reallyseemed like he  had feelings for me.
B ut like I did in other relationships before,I shut himdo wn, rejecting him whenI feltmy feeli ngs growing  tomuch.
In the end he left me, like the yalldid. I learned later that he waswith Kelly,  a girl we met acouple of timewhen we  were together.Im et othermen a nd women,and it  al waysended the same wa y.
Fast forward to yeste rday. K ellycalls me, saying tha t Indywas in the hospital, afterbeing hitby acar. His condit ionwas critical, and hehas aske  d  for me.
And here I  am,a bouquet of flowers in hands, nervously lookin g  for room6 8.
Ifi nd it, half opened, andtakea deep breath to give myselfcourage, and here Indy's weak voice.
"Kelly, you're...a wonderfulgirl but...I...I...I never love d yo u."
The words hit   me like a punch. I storm in theroom, bu t his eyes are a lready closed.Forev  er.
