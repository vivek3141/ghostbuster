I groggilysat up as my roommate shook me awake, panic etchedacross his face. "There's no time! We have to go!" he exclaimed urgently. Confused, I pleaded for clarification. His eyes widened in fear as he responded, "There's no time! I woke up today and time doesn't exist anymore!" Disbelief coursed through my veins, but his words held an air of truth. With a knot in my stomach, we rushed outside, witnessing the chaos that ensued. Clocks froze, sun stood still, and the world remained trapped in an eternal moment. We were left with no choice but to navigate this timeless abyss.
