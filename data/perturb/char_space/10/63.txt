I groggily sat up as my roommate shook me awake, panic etched across his face. "There's no time! We have to go!"he exclaimed urgently. Confused, I pleaded fo r clarification. His eyeswidened in fear as he responded, "There's no time! I woke up today and ti me doesn't exist anymore!" Disbelief coursed through my veins, but his words held an airof truth. With a knot in my stomach, we rushed outside,witnessing the chaos thatensued.  Clocksfroze, sun stood still, and the world remained trapped in an eternal moment. We were left with no  choice but to navigate this timeless abyss.
