It always puzzled me, to say the least, andmade me extremely nervous.
As such I never committed into relationships, probably by great of having my feelings not reciprocated.
My longest relationship was with a man I loved deeply, Indy. He was the complete opposite ofme: extraverted, charming, outgoing. He was friend with eve ryone, but still reliable and generous.
We stayed together for a couple of years, and, Idon't know why, but it really seemed like he had feelings for me.
But like I did in other relationships before, I shut him down, rejectinghimwhen I felt my feelings growing to much.
In the end he left me, like they all did. I learn ed later that he was with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of time when we were together.
I met other men and women, and it always ended the same way.
Fast forward to yesterday. Kelly calls me , saying that Indy was in the hospital, after being hit by a car. His condition was critical, and he has asked for me.And here I am, a bouquet of flowers in hands, nervously looking for room 68.
I find it, half opened, and take a deep breath to give myself courage, and here Indy's weak voice.
"Kelly, you're...a wonderful girl but...I...I...I never loved you."
The words hit me like a punch. I storm in the room,but his eyes are already closed. Forever.
