"You ready yet? I'm about to leave!"
"Yeah, I just need to find my keys in this mes s.. Do you want to me to follow?"  She asks as she rummages through her purse.
"Yeah that's fine. Be careful driving! See you in a bit  sis!"
I get in my car and buckle up. God I hate these drives now that we're older. There used to be a time when I could j ust pick upmy little sister from moms and we can drive together, be there at the same time, not have to worry about traffic or work. But then again, there used to be a time before that...when my parents were t ogether.
*sigh* Nothing we can do now huh..  Landon st. left and, what was it, Jef ferson Rd right? I check the rearview more than the actual road. I hate driving. Damn, that new red mustang looks awesome...seems to be going a bit too fast too....
Oh god,
Please
I look back the the rearview, slow down sis...This guy seems to be either stupid or dru - befo re I can look back again I hear the sound of glass shattering and metal grinding against itself, breaks screec hing. No, no no no no no....
