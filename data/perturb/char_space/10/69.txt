I knelt down, blood still on my clothes, asking for fo rgiveness to these statues around me.I was never religious, but sometimes life makes you do things you never usually do. What I've  done in life cannot be undone, a mothers have lost sons, sisters have lost brothers andkids have lost their dads. I am not a sinner, but I have sinned; it's thebusiness I am in. I first killed a man at the age of 13 with my bare hands, choked him until he went cold. I'm 52 now--probably coming close to my last few years in this life, but there's one thing I don't regret and it's taking the life of a criminal who didn't belong. I hunt evil people who've caused misery to communities and I believe I've done the right thing so far. I got up from my knees and left San Jose church, which my family visited every few Sundays growingup. I took the last step onto thesidewalk when I felt the barrel of a.357 magnum being pressed against the b ack of my head. I didn't process what was happening because it had never happened. The world went silent and I could almost hear the finger tig htening on the trigger when the loud ba ng rang through the streets. All I had was 7 seconds before I saw black and felt my body tensing and going into shock. I hope they serve tequila in hell.
