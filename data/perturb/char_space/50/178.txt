Several high tech giants have come together to announce the release of a new CD-ReWriteable technology for early 1997. The  technology is said to  be priced below $1,000,  which is expected to make it widely accessible to the public.
The CD-ReWriteable technology was unveiled through a joint press conference by Hewlett-Packard, Sony, and Phillips. The new technology is expected to revolutionize the market as it allows people to rewrite over CDs, which brings the storage capacity of CDs to a whole newlevel.
The CD-ReWriteable technology has numerous applica tions, especially in the realm of archiving and data storage. It provides an affordable and efficient method for people to store and save their files, which was once  a daunting task, especially when it comes to large files and data.
The technology easily outclasses other available options on the market since itcanstore up to 650 megabytes of data, about 74 minutes of audio, in a single disc, which is more tha n double what currently available technology can handle. Moreover, since it is rewritable,it can be used repeatedly to store new  files and data multiple times, making it a highly economical solution.
The new CD-ReWriteable technology is a result of years-long researc h and development by the three high tech giants. It is b ased on a technique called phase-changetechnology, w hich allows the laser beam to rewrite the  data on the disc at varying speeds w ithout compromising the  integrity of thedata already stored.
The technology is expected to have a significant impact on  the market, especially for small businesses and individuals who need cost-effective solutions to store their data. It is also speculated that it could lead to the creation of new m arkets for CD-ROMs as the re-writable feature allows for the storageof dynamic data that is updat ed regularly.
Moreover, with the release of the CD-ReWriteable  technology,  consumers can expect a drop in the price of standard CD-ROMssince the market will be ope ned up to more economical alternatives.
"This is an exciting time for the industry and for all those wh o need to store and access their data regularly," sai d Koichi Suzuki of Sony. "This release will allow for the efficient management of files and the creation of new opportunitieswithin the market."
The CD-ReWriteable technology is a welcome sight for many people as they no l onger need to worry about their data being lost or compromised. The technology is expected to be a  hit among students, re searchers, andprofessionals,who generate a large amount of data and need easily accessible and reliablestorage solutions.
In conclusion, the rel ease of the CD-ReWriteable technology is a breakthrough in the field of storage technolo gy, and it is expected to have a significant impact on the market. Thetechnology's high capacity and affordability m ake it an ideal cho ice for people who need to constantly ma nage and store data. Further more, the technology could create new business opportunities, especially for small businesses who need to efficiently sto re theirvitalinformation.
