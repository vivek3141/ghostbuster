Placing his hand gently on her shoulder, Lucas introduced himself, hoping to  lend her his comforting presence. "Hello, ma'am. My name is Lucas. I couldn't help but notice yourmelancholy. Is everything alright?"
Emma looked up, her eyes shimmering with unshed tear s. "I... I don't know," she whispered, her voice trembling. "I used to hear my own song, a melody that accompaniedme through all the ups and downs of life. But nowit'sall static, as if something broke inside me."

Determined to help her rediscover her true melody, he gently placed his hand on her chest and closed his eyes.

Within her heart, Lucas discovered a flicker of hope dimly shining amidst the chaos. It seemed as though a heavy burden weighed her down, preventin g Emma’s true self from  experiencing the song that once defined her.
