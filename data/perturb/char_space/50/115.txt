The clothing industry is amongst the man y monopolistically competitive industries. There ar e many clothin g fir msinthe industry co mpe ting against each other while producin g similar products.However, the firmsin the industry earn competitive advantages by distinguishing their products through branding and advertisements(Davis and Özgür, 4). Product differentiation is oneof the strategies com monly used by monopolistic competitive firms. Product differentiation in a clothing firm can involve designs, the  quality of materials used,andthe prices charged for the c lothes. In advertisements, differentiation is put in physical aspects such as color,designs, elastic,and dif ferent sizes (Davis and  Özgür, 7). Intan gibleaspects includedin theclothing advertisement can be guaranteed money back,high quality,free delivery, and long-lasting usage.
Steel ma nufacturing is an examp le of an oligopolistic competitive industry. In such a marke t, a few steel manufacturing companies rule over other firms. The few firms  are the price and trendsetters for othersmall companies and often form a partnership to operate successfully (Ritz185). Todistinguish themselves from theircompetitors,they improve their productquality, hike or lower prices, and advertise the special featuresof their products. In an oligopolistic market, if a leading company lowers prices, theothers do not follow but rather improve their products to remain in the higher cuts of prices (Ritz 187). The few leading companiesalsosta y competitive in the industry by setting their standards high to prevent easy entry into theindustry. The firms set high standards by producing the highest quality products, selling them at ahigher price, and producing themin high q uantities (Ritz 189). That way, theyensure that the small or new companies fear the competition at the top thus ensuring reduced entry to the industry.
