Rite Aid Corp said it plans to swiftly integrate Thrifty PayLess Inc into its already-powerful company by attacking weaknesses in the regional  drugstore chain's distribution and technology.
"To make this acquisition work, we have to reduce costs and we have to reduce costs rapidly," Rite Aidchief executive officer Martin Grass told more than 250 investors andanalysts in a conference call.
In the latest drugstore mergerto sweep the industry,  Rit e Aid anno unced plans to buy Thrifty PayLess for $1.4billio n. 
U.S. drugstores are consolidatingat a feverish pace as the result ofpricing pressures and costly computer upgrades that are essential in today's world of managed healthcare.
Industry analystssaidThrifty PayLess has been plagued by a weak distribution system and inefficient technology.
"It is our belief that our technology is a lot mor e sophisticated than what is being used at Thrifty PayLess and that there are significant benefits that wecan bring -- not only to the store operations, but alsoto the customers," Grasssaid.  Analysts expect Rite Aid to make  significant progress reducing the Thrifty PayLess cost structure even though savings will not come from geographic overlap.  Rite Aid doesnot have any stores in Thirfty PayLess' West Coast markets.
"No one is as leanas Rite Aid," said Eric Bossha rd ofMidwest Research-Maxus Group.
But the proposed acquisition may create some new difficulties for Rite Aid, which typically has smaller stores and less varied merchandise than Thrifty PayLess.  Unlike Rite Aid, Thrifty PayLess  sell plants, ice cream and shoesas well as traditional drugstore items.  
Concerns about Rite Aid's move into these new areas sent the company's stock down two to 33-7/8 in af t ernoon trade.
"This issomethingthat is entirely outside their realm of experience.  That is a major question mark," said Joseph Ronning of Brown Brothers Harriman.
"These are completely different bus inesses.  These guys are general merchandisers," said Gary Vineberg of Merrill Lynch.
Grass addressed those issues in the conference call, saying that Rite Aid may add more mercha ndise expertsto asses s the different products.  
"There are certain linesof merchandise that we will continue tocarry out West that we don't carry back Ea st," Grass said.Shares of Thrifty PayLess, which made its initial public offer ing in April  at14 per share, gained three to 21-3/8. Takeover stock traders said the deal values Thrifty PayLess at $23.32 per share.
The proposed acquisition of Thrifty PayLess seems to eliminate Rite Aid as a potential bidderfor southeast drugstore chain Big B Inc.  Rite Aid has beenviewed as a possible bidder for Big B, which is fighting a hostile takeover from RevcoD.S. Inc.
Butin announcing the Thrifty PayLess acquisition, Rite Aid also said that it is pulling out of Florida, Alabama and Georgia , which are Big B's key markets.
