In Adorno's conceptof industrial culture, media products for children are seen as extensio ns of capitalist values.Adorno argues that these products, such as children's television showsand movies, are created with the sole purpose of generating profit for corporat ions. They promote consumerism and encourage children to becomepassiveconsumers in a capitalist society. This perspective aligns with the M arxist critique of capitalism.
A p rominent  example of media products reinforcing capitalist values can be seen in the vastamount of merchandise associat ed with popular children's franchises. For instance, the success of animated films like the "Frozen" series goes far beyond the box office revenue. It encompasses a wide range of merchandise,including toy s, clothing , and accessories. These products are not just meant to entertain children, but also to create demandfor consumer goods. The media plays a significant role in shaping children's desires and preferences , deliberately promoting consumer culture.
ContrastingAdorno's perspective, structural functionalism suggests that media products for children serve a more positive func tion in society. Accordingto this approach, these products fulfill children'sdevelopmental and educational needs, providingthem with entertaining and informative content.For instance, educational shows like  "Sesame Street" have been praised for their ability to foster  learningand social developmentamong children. Moreover, the media also serves to unify societyby providing cultural narratives and shared experiences.
While structural functionalismacknowledgesthe influence of capitalismin media production, it prioritizes the positive social contributions of these media products. This perspective tends tofocus on the potential benefits for children's growth  and the promotion of social cohesion.
In conclusion, media products for children do reinforce capitalistvalues to a significant e xtent, according to Adorno's concept of industria l culture. Examples like the promotional merchandise associated with popular  children's franchises emphasize the materialistic nature underlying these products. Ho wever, the pe rspective of  structural functionalism offers a more optimistic view, emphasizing the educational and unifyingaspects of media products. While both perspectives recognize capitalist influences in media production, they differ in their evaluation of the overall impacton society and children.
