‘ …and we'll have an interview with hima nd his prize marrow at around a quarter to eight. Thetimeis six-fifty-five, and this is BBCSouthern Counties Radio.’
The daily n ews blares over the radio. Light rolls through the curtains.I turn over in bed. Just another Monday m orning. Minutes pass,and I hear all the familiar sound. Cars on the road outside. M y flatmat  es stirring in their rooms. The world is  waking up.
I s truggle out from my cocoon of blankets and into the cold of my bedroom. I like it that way. Every night I open themywindow, to let the night in. Everymorning  the chill startles  me awake. I open the curtains, look out ontothe street. The usual crowd waltz down the street, goingwherever it is they go. Someone glances upat my window, and hurriedly looks awayas they realise I'm  half na ked.
AsI walk across the room something crunches underfoot. Asmall, folded piece of paper  onthe floor. My nameis written onit, in my own handwriting.I pick it up, scrutinise it. I don't remember writing this. I  open it, and read the words inside.
*A ct n ormally, otherwise they'll noti ce. *I'm confused. I really don' t recall writing this. What does it mean? Whoare ‘ they  ’? The questions a re rattled f rom my head bya knock at my bedroom door. My flatmate.
‘Huney, are you ok in there? You'll be late. ’
I lo ok at the note again. And hesitate.
