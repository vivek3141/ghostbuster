Thich Quang Duc committed self-immolation on the streets of Saigon onJune 11, 1963, and it changed the course of history. Today, the photograph of Thich Quang Ducâ€™s death, Th e Burning Monk, has become a universal symbol of rebellion and thefight against injustice. His death was reduced to a symbol, but it was much more thanthat (S inzelle, 22). It was an act ofde fiance against a corrupt government that had ki lledits citizens. It sparked a revolution,overt hrew the regime, and may evenhave caused the Americans to enter the Vietnam War. However, the monk himself most likely did not die for revol utionary ideas.His self-immo lation was an act of rejection ofthe system and the inability to deal with injustice.
Tunisian street vendor Mohammed  Bouazizi set himself on fire in protest against harassment by local officials. The desperate act of the young man caused mass street protests in thecity. The rioters demandedthe resigna tio n of President Ben Ali.Hispolitical regime faced long-term economic and  socia l problems, resulting in unemployment, mostly among young people. Mohammed Bouazizi became a symbol of the Arab Spring;he gained followersin Tunisia and other Arab countries, which also led to  mass protests.
Most of the self-immolations did  not impact the current situation; however, some of them pl ayed an impor tant role in t he political events in the country in which they took place. The actions of both men canhardly be cal led aspecific call for revolution. Both cases can be compared, con sideringthem as an extreme measure of disagreement with injustice. It seems that the men have noother means left for the official a uthorities to hear t hem. Inoneway oranother, both events significantl y influenced the c ourse of histo ry.
