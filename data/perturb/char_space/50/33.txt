Thedoctor’s job is to followethical standards,  including loyalty to patients and respect for their choice. However, the profession concentrates on philosophical, religious , and cultural traditions and belie fs. Physician-assistedsui cide can be seen as voluntary death by a medical professional. At the  same time, the doctor provides all the necessary meansand informationregarding the patient’s desires for the end of life. However,such coo peration on the part of a doctor cannot be ethically conditioned.
Allowing euthanasia can cause irreparable ha rm to the patient if done incorrectly.  Thus, a person can be leftwithout the possibility ofa habitual existence. Even though many patients who decideto dietosufferfrom incurable diseases voluntarily, the doctor cannot assistthem. In this case, the moral commandment that a person cannot take someone else’s life isviolated (Clarke et al., 2021).Moreover, doctor-assisted suicide is who lly opposed to the definition of a professionaimed at helping people. The doctor is seen as a healer, while physician-assisted suicid e does not seemto control and calculate the risks, which ca n be a threat to many patients.
The dilemma lies in the Hippocratic oa t h given by all doctors, one of th epoints of which is not to harm. Thus, helping a patient with a death wish can beseen asa deliberate wish to inju rethe person. Mo reover, it may reduce the level oftrust between patients and medical staff since taking a life can not be ethically justified. In addition, the religiousview forbids doctorsto help patients at the end of life, referring to the commandment no t to kill a person. Furthermore, killing may be considered offensive due to  society’s moralattitude. The patient’s pain can be alleviated with the help of available medicines, while the loss of life is an irreversible action.
