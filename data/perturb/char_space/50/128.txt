I love the music. It reflectswhat is just about to happen. It has sav ed me from more than afew relationships that would have b een u nsavory.
I have two theories a bout the musi c. Either I am the only one who hears  it, or everyone does and no one ever talks about it. Which is fine. Music is avery personal thing after all.
Normally, the musicis always at a comfo rtablelevel, unless it is trying to warn me of somethingdire. Th ere was on e moment whereâ€¦Onemoment where the sound was deafening.
There was arisingcrescendo  ever sinceI woke up that morning. I turned on the news towatch while eating b reakfast, asI alway s  do. Usually  the music goes back  and forth b etween dramatic and more more lulling, depending on the n ews break about to come up.But that morning it didn't change. It just cres cendoing until the  newscaster spoke.
"The Wo rld Trad e Centers have been hit." I dropped my fork. The tingof it hitting the table wa s all I could hear. For the  first time, ev er, my world had gonequiet .
As I watched the events unfold, the mus iccontinued to be silent. Finally, afterwhat felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again. A long,low clarinet played. And then other instruments slowly joined it. Something sad, but hopeful. It was playing as I was heading   out the door to go to myRed Cross to see what I could do to help.
