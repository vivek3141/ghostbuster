The population’s confidence in the ac tivities of medical organizations is an essential indicator of their effectiveness. Bringing current  terminology and th e nature of the relationship between patients and physicians into a state of certainty willhelp to unde rstand and delineate  the nature of consumerism in health care (Calnal, 2010).
