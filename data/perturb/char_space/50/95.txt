With the current broad variety of species, as well as the e mergent news about the species that are on the verge of extinctiondueto theimpactof the  changes in the environment, one might believe that discovering new animals is no longer a possibility. However, new spec ies are still discovered regularly, the recent incred ible find being an example of that. Namely, the Nimba myotis, alsoknown asthe fuzzy orange bat, or  Myotis nimbaensis, has beenidentified as a new speciesthis year(Simmons et al., 2021). Having oran ge fur with blackpigmentation, Nimba Myotis repres ents a rather unusual specimen ofbats. The animal pre fers natural cav es as the place where it lives and rests. Like other bats, Nimba Myotis useslaryngeal echolocation as the means of identifying and catching prey in the dark. However, due to the species in question being under researched, its diet is mostly unknown( Simmons etal., 2021). Overal l, thebat repre sents aunique specimen in its class.
The species belongs to the animal kingdom,particularly, to mammals o f the Chiroptera order and t he Vespertilionidae family (Simmons et al., 2021). The main rationale for placingit in the animalkingdom is the fact that Nimba Myotis is a mammal. Additionally, the specified species reproduces sexually, unlike members ofother  kingdoms, and is multicellular (Simmons etal., 2021). Furthermore, the fact that cells in Nimba Myotis do  not have cell walls, allows classifying it with other s pecies inthe Animal kingdom. Therefore,the bat should be defined as  an anim al, particularly, amammal. Furthermore, one should note that, being a bat, Nimba Myotis represents thelargest order in the mammal class after rodents (Simmons et al., 2021).Overall,thediscovery of Nimba Myotis has sheda lotoflight on the species of bats, in general.
