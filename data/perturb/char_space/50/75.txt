It always puzzled m e , to say the least, and made me extremely nervous.
As such I never committed into relationships, pro bably by great of having my feelingsnot reciprocated.
My longest relatio nship was with a man I loved deepl y, Indy.He was the complete opposite of me: extraverted, ch arming, outgoing. He was  friend with everyone, but still reliab le and generous.
We stayed together for a  couple of years, and, Idon't  know why, but it  reall y seemed likehe had feelings for me.
But like I didin otherrelationships befor e, I shut him down, rejecting h im when I felt my feelingsgrowing to much.
In the  end he left me, like they all did. I learned latertha t hewas with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of time when we we retogether.
I  met other men and women, and it always endedthe same way.
Fast forward to yesterday. Kelly calls me, saying that Indy was in the hospital, after  being hit by a car.His condition wascr itical, and hehas  asked for me.
Andhere I am, a bouquetofflowers in hands, ner  vo usly lookingfor room 68.
I find it, half opened, and take a dee p  breath to give myself courage, and here Indy'sweak voice.
"Kelly, you're...a wonderful girl but...I...I...I never loved you."
The words hitme like a punch. Istorm in the room,  but his eyes are already closed. Forever.
