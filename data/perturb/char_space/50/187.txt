Pearson Stock Surges On  Rumors Of Potential Takeover Bid By BSkyB
Shares in  Pearson, the world's largest educational publisher, surged on Friday on rumors of a potential takeover bid b y BSkyB.The shares closed up12% at£1,155, giving the comp any a market capitalization of nearly £9bn.
The rumors of a takeover bid began  on Thursday when a report in the Fin ancial Times suggestedthat RupertMurdoch's News Corp was considering a bid for Pearson. News Corp alre ady ownsa 39% stake in BSkyB, and the report sugg ested that News Corp could use BSkyB as a vehicle to make a bid for Pearson.
The report sent Pearson'sshare price soaring on Thursday, and the stock continued to climb on Friday following further rumors that BSkyBwas indeed planning a bid.
Neither Pearson nor BSkyB have commented on the rumors, and it is unclear whethe r a bid will materialize. However, analysts have suggested that a takeover of Pears on by BSkyB coul d make strategic sense.
Pearson has b een strugglingin recent years as students increasingly turn to digital learning materials, rather than traditio nal textbooks. The   company has responded t o thistrend by investing heavily indigital products, b ut its revenues have been hit hard in the transition.
 BSkyB, on the other hand, is  one of the UK's largest med ia companies, with a strong track record in developing and monetizing digital content. If BS kyB were to acquire Pearson, it could potentially leverage its expertise in digital media to help the education publisher make the transition to a digital-first business model.
This would also fit with BSkyB's  broader strategic goals. The company has  been looking to movebeyond its core businessof pay-TV and expand into new areas, such as digital adverti sing and e-commerce. Acquiring Pearson could give BSkyB a foothold in the education market, which is a valuable andgrowing sector.
However, there are also potential risks for BSkyB in making a bid for Pearson. Education is a highly-regulated sector, and it is uncle ar  how regulators would view a big media company such as BSkyB owning one of thelargest education publishers in the world.
There is also the question of how Pearson's existing managementteam would react to a potential takeoverbid. Pearson's CEO, John Fallon,hasbeen leading the comp any through a difficult period of transition, and he may be reluctant to sell the company to another party.
Despite these uncertainties, the rumors of a potential takeover bidby  BSkyB have put Pearson's shares firmly in the spotlight. Whet her or not a bid materializes re mains to be seen, but for now, investors are clearly excited about the possibility of a deal.
