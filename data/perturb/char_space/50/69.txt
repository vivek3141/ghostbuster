I knelt down, blood still on my clothes,asking for forgiveness to these statues around me. I was never religious, butsometimes life makes you do things younever usually do.  What I've done in life cannot be undone, a mothers have lost sons, si s ters have lost brothers and kids have lost  their dads. Iamnot a  sinner, but I ha ve sinned; it's thebusiness I am in. If  irst killed aman at the age of 13 with mybare hands, chokedhim until he went cold. I'm 52 now--probably coming close to my last few  years in this life, but there's one thing Idon't regret and it's taking  the lifeof acriminalwhodidn't belong. I hunt evil people who've caused misery to   communities a nd I believe I've done the right thing sofar. I got up from my kne es andleft San Jose church, which my family visited ever y few Sunday s growing up. I took thelast st ep onto the sidewalk when I felt the barrel of a.3 57magnum  being pressedagainsttheback of my head. I didn't process what was happening because it had neverhappened. The world went silent and I could almost hear the finger tighteningon the trigger whenthe  loud bang rang thr oughthe streets. All I had was 7 seconds before I saw black and felt mybody tensing and going into sh ock. I hope they serve tequila  in hell.
