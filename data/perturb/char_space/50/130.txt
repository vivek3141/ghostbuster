Th e recent sentencing of Chinese dissident, Zhang Chenguang, to 11 years in prisonhas sparked concerns a mong Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists. Many fearthat this move may be an indicationof the Chinese government's increasing efforts to curb freedoms in Hong Kong post-handover.Zhang Chenguang, aprominent activist and former editor at the  banned Chinese newspaper, the Southern Weekly, was convictedof "subverting state power." This charge is often used against critics of the Chinese gov ernment who push for greate r political freedom and human rights.
Following his sentencing, many Hong Kong activists spoke out against what they see as a flagrant violation of basic human rights and a movetowards author itarianism. Democracy activist, Joshua Wong, tweeted that "Beijing's crackdown in Hong Kongis increasingly brazenâ€¦ officials are now going after mainland dissidents."
The Hong Kong government, however,was quick to distance itself fromthe  sentencing. In a statem ent, the g overnment said t hat "Mr. Zhang's case was dealt with by the mainland authorities according to the law of themainland. The Hong Kong SpecialAdministrative Region government would not interferewith the judicial proceedings of the central authorities."
Regardless of the government's stance, many remain unconvinced that Zhang's sentencing is an isolated incident. Critics argue that Hong K ong's freedoms havebe en steadily eroded in recent years, with the governmenttaking an increasingly hardline stance against dissent.
This sentiment was echoe d ina recent report by the United States' Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which highlighted "grave concern" over the Chinese government's  manipulation of Hong Kong's legal system and the erasure ofthe city's autonomy.
The report called on the US government t o consider a ctions to help protect Hong Kong's  democratic system, including sanctions on individuals responsible for undermining the c ity's freedoms.
Zhang's sentencing also comes less than a year after China imposed a controversial national securitylaw onHongKong. The law criminalizesdissent and gives the Chinese government new powers to police Hong Kong's political system.
These developments are seen by  many as a major blow to Hong Kong's autonomy, which was promised when the city was handed over fromBritishto Chinese rule in 1997. With growing concern over the erosion of freedoms, many Hong Kong activistsare calling on theinternational community to speak out and take action t o  protect the city's democratic system.
