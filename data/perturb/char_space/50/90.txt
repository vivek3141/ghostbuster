Jack sat alone in his small apartment, the softglow of his laptop illuminating the  room. He absent-mindedly scrolled  through his social media feed, trying to distract himself from the suffocating weight of grief that consumed him. It had been a couple of months since his father's passing, a devastating battle with cancer that stole him away too soon. 
As Jack mindlesslyshuffled through the digital world, a familiar ringtone broke  the silence, cuttingthrough his vulnerability. His heart raced as he looked at the screen, se eing the familiar name displayed: "Dad." Panic mingled with hope as he answeredthe call.
"Hello?" Jack's voice quivered, afraid to give into the hope that twisted within him.
"Hey, son. How are you holdin g up?" Thevoice on the other end of the line wasunmistakably his father's. It was warm and comforting, just as Jack remembered.
"Dad? Is that really you? But... you're gone..." Jack stammered, his  mind struggling to make sense of the impossible.
There  was a strange pause on the other end before his father replied, "Jack, what are you talking about? I'm fine. I've been  thinking about you a lot lately, and I wanted to reach out."
Unease crept up Jac k's spine.How could his father no t remember? Was he losinghis grip on reality? He tried to recall the funeral, the anguish andtears he witnessed , but it felt distant, almost like a fragmented memory.
"Dad, you died. I attended your funeral. How can you not r emember?" Jack's voice trembled with fear and confusion.
Silence hung in the air, pregnant with mystery and unanswered ques tions. Finally, his father spoke hesitantly, "Jack... I don't know what you're talking about. I've been fine, spending my days painting and enjoying life.Are you feeling alright, son?"
The weight of a thousand doubts and uncertainties crashed down on Jack. Was he going insa ne? Could he trust his memories? Nervously bi ting his lip, he tried to rationalize the situation. If his father was alive and well, then where were his funeral memories coming from? Was he living in an alternate reality?
Overwhelming curiosity mingled with a  growing sense of desperation. Jack decided he had to fin d answers, to understand why he remembered a parallel timeline that didn't seem to have happened. He reached out to his friends, searching for anyone whomightrecall his father's passing, but they all looked at him with confusion.
Hours blurred into days as Jack relentlessly dug into his past, scouring documents, old photographs, and even searching online databases. Yet, there was no  trace of his father's death. It was as if his memories were a figment of his imagination, haunting him as a cruel trick.Sleepless nights turned into weeks, as Jack's sanity slipped further away.  He questionedevery thought that entered hismind, every memory that whispered t o him. The line between reality and fantasy began to blur, leaving him utterly lostamidst the labyrinth of his own mind.
Finally, Jack stumbled upon a faded newspaper article, buried deep within an archive. It wasdatedyears before his father'ssupposed death, recounting a miraculous recovery from terminal cancer. The article featured his father's beaming face, defying the odds and the grasp of death.
Tears welled up in Jack's eyes as realization washed over him like a calming tide. He had been living in a timeline thatnever existed, a painful delusion thatrobbed him of his fa ther's continued presence. The immense grief he had carried, the solitude that engulfed him, all borne from a mind fractured by sorrow.
With tre mbling hands, Jack dialed his father's number once again, praying for the familiar warmth to greet him on the other end. His heart soared as his father's voiceechoed through the phone.
"Dad, I need to apologize. I don't know w hat happened, but I got lost in a world where I believed you were gone. Can we meet?"
His father's voice sof tened, full of compassion,"Of course, son. Let's meet. I've missed you."
In that moment, Jack found solace in the truth and the love that existed beyond the constraints ofhis fractured mind. The journey to rediscover  himself was far from over, but with newfound clarity and the warmth of his father's love, he knew he could face anything that lay ahead.
