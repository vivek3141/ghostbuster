China has announced plans to build bigger rockets that can accommodat e heavier payloads for commercial satellite market expansion. The move is part of China's growing push to become amajor player in the commercial space industry.
According to reports, China aimsto build rockets with a capacity of up to 100 tonnes, which would significantly outpace the 22-tonne capacity of the country's current flags hip rocket, the Long March  5.
The new rocketswill be able to launch multiple satellites at once, allowing China to compete with established commercial space companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin.
Speaki ng ab out the plans, Zhou Yanfei, deputy chief engineer at the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), said: "The heavier rocket will pr ovide stron ger lift capability for space missions. It will meet the growing demand of China's satellite industry for rocket launch services."
The announcement comes just months after China launched a successful mission to the far side of the moon, a feat achieved by no other country before. Themission, which involved landing a rover on the moon's surface, marked asignificant step forward in China's ambitious space  program.
China is  al so planning to build its own spacestation, which is set to launch in 2022. The station will be capable of accommodating three astronauts for up to six mont hs at a time and will beused to conduct scientific research in areas such as astronomy, space medicine, and space  physics.
However, China's spa ce ambitions have not been without c ontroversy. The country hasbeen accused of engaging in space mili tarization, with some experts expressing concerns over the deve lopment of anti-satellite weapons.
China has denied these allegations, stating that its space program is purely for peaceful purposes. Neverthe less,the country's growing spacecapabilities have raised concerns among U.S. policymakers, who see China as a potential rival in the global space race.
China's plans tobuild bigger rocketsfor the commercial satellite market coul d also have implications for the globalspace industry. With China entering themarket, established players such as SpaceX may face increased competition, potentially driving down prices and increasing innovation in the sector.
However, some experts have raised concerns over the environmental impact of increased rocketlaunches. The process of launching rockets into space canhave a significant impact on the environment, with exhaust pollution c ontributing to greenhouse gas emissi ons and other harmful pollutants.
As such, there are calls for the space industry to develop more environmentally-friendly launch systems. One potential solution is the use of electric rockets, which would significantly reduce emissionsand pollution associated with traditional rocket launches.
Despite these conc erns,China's plans to build bigger rockets for the commercial satellite  market are likely to have significantimplications for the global space industry. With  China rapidly expanding its space capabilities, the country is setto become a major pl a yer in the sector, posing potential challenges and opportunities for established players and the wider industry as a wh ole.
