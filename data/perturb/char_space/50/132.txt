Devastated by the prophecy, Elara refused to accept her fate. She sought out the villagewise woman,seeking guidance and solace. The wise woman, her eyes fille d with compassion, told Elara, "Child,  prophecies are but shadows of what could be. The power lies within you to defy it. Seekjoy, surround yourself with love and light, and trust in your own strength."
