I n his text entitled “TheEntitlementTheory”, the philosopher RobertNozick speculates on a truly just ec onomic structurein the ideal form of thestate. Nozick focuses on the issue of property, its transfer and ratification, offering a model for claiming just entitlement (Vaughn, 2019).Real justi ce, according to  Nozick, consists in the appropriation of holdings or their original acquisition, their fair and consensual transferand theprotection of the right to  the ir property.
According to the principle  of fair ac quisition, people can take possession of property if they do not take it from others and donot worsenthe situation of ot hers in the process. The principle of fair transfer implies the right to dona te property or vol untarily exchange it. Nozick imagines a world  inwhichfreeexchange will abolish the existence of a value-currency intermediary – that is, the needs of people willbe perceived as primary in the exch ange of goods. The principle of ratification implies thata person who has unfairly   taken possession of a holding isobliged to returnitto theowner.According to Nozick,no  one except the owners mentioned in the first two principles has the right to property. The author finds a fa ir transfer of property only in those cases w hen the property was originally acquired fairly and all subsequent stages in its transfer are the same.
The authorcalls this principle of fair distribution historical, in which it is through the circumstanc es or actions of acquisition that one can judge the fairness of the possession of a thing. Borrowing from  John Locke’s principle of the self-property of people, Nozicksays that people represen t aset of talents that belo ng to them.Combining these talents with the surroundingworld, they can encroach on the acquisition of part of this world by agreement, that is, to acquire property.
