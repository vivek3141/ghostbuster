They always say infairytales that when a loved one falls in to a deep sleep, th ere's a way to breakthe cur se. Kisses, a spell, a potion, just that there's something  out there. But in real life,  all we can do is dream.
When I saw him fall asleep early after a rough day atwork I smiled and thought how adorable he looked huggingt he pillow witha strange intensity. No w that pose feels more like something of his is just hanging on.
I heard that it's contagious. That theentire ward of the hospital we transportedhim to was shut down after doc  to rs started dropping to the floors, fast asleep, in the middle of their rounds. The entire place was quarantined.
"New virus places hundreds into comas. Pu blic advised to stay ind oors."
And so I did.
Every piece of mediaI look to continues to cover th e story as more an dmore people are dr opping  in to deepsleep throughout the count ry. Afew report s even cite  my husband as patient zero. We 're at the point whe re initial patients are  slow starving t o death from lack of nutrient intake. This entire epidemic is driving me crazy.
I can't leave the house, I can't go to work. The normalsounds of  community havejust droppe d. The entire cityhas becomeawaking nightmare. Well, maybe a better choice of words would suffice.
But I have my fairytales, and I don'tthink I'm okay with st aying inside for any longer. Prince C harming always finds some way to do it andso will  I. I'm done with dreaming and have to start doing. Doing something. Anything. Because I amsovery tired, and I don't want to wake up in a world like  this.
