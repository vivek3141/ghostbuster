Eight of the top 10 publicly traded U.S. health maintenanceorganizations are expected to report lower orflat fourth-quarter profits as the industry shutsthe books on a dismal yearand moves w arily into 1997.
Dissatisfied with  narrow profit margins, Wall Street is turning cautious on manyHMO stocks, although plenty of merger and acquisition action underlies the sector and is supporting the share pricesof firms seen as targets.
"Consolidation will r emain at a highlevel," said Salomon Brothersmanaged healthcareanalyst Robert Hoehn.  
As HMOsreport  quarterly resultsover the next few  weeks, two companies are expected to defy the earnings slump.Booming OxfordHealth Plans Inc has been a bright spot in the g loom all year and is forecast to post profits 70 percent higher than the year-ago level, analysts said.
Paci fiCareHealth Systems Inc is ex pected to show 10 to 13 percent earnings improvement, although its quarter will be complicated by a pendingacquisition of FHP International Corp.
"It's  sort of  a throw-away quarterfor " PacifiCare, said Volpe Weltyanalyst Ed Keaney. 
The problem that most HMOs were unable to solve throughout 1996 was a costly mismatch between medical cost i nflation forecasts that fell short and an inability to push through  compensatory premium increases. A margin squeeze resulted."This year there may be room for a littlebit of (premium) expansion as the year unfolds, but not enough of an increase to makeit possible for these companies to restore ma rgins to previous levels ," Keaney said.
Citing small premium rises so far in the January  renewal period,  Hoehn said: "Uncertainties regarding profitability will remain, albeit at a reduced level from 1996."
