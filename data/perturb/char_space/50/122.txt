She was shaking, I was too, he was dead. Blood on myhands, I hopedthere was still light behind my eyes. I never killed a man before, I never had to save someone before. I didn't feel good, or mighty. She broke, slumped to the ground, her body, a tremor as she sobb ed. I dropped the knife, Iturned to look at what I had done. She shouted my name through tears. He had somu ch red onhis s tomach, his throat was ope n too. I did that? I did th at, I had to. I said as muchout lo ud. Again she shoutedmy na me. I couldn't to uch her though. She is so white,an d I haven't decided if now I  amdark. I didn't feel tainted, my heartwas still beating so fast. I took a long hard bre ath,he is dead and so is his intent, we are alive because I wou ld notallow him to have his wa y. Again she shouts, but I'mdeep  in thought. Another  long breath. I came to a conclusion. Ikil led a man today, I did the right thing, I beat him to the punch, and I'm still here and I still have to take care of her.
I told her to  s tan d, nicely, I offered her a meek smile, and apologized for whatshe had seen  and what I had to do. I started to explain why, but fuck it, she can't hear anything, *she's inshock Boone,  get her inside*. I walk her up the street, she remembersshe can't walk in heels.She sees the life on my hands, and that sets her off again. We go inside a shitty mexic an restaurant. I sit  her down, I go to wash my hands. I d o it with my closed, I'm not sure if I wanna look at the guy who looks back at me above the sink. I'm not sure if I wanna bethe voice onthe   phone to the police. I puke in the sink, maybe some got onmy shoes.
What thehell am I doing?
