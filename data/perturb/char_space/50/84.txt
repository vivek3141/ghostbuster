Being a well-developed market with a high purchasing power of the population, Canada presents an array an opportunities for foreign exports, namely the U.S. Within this framework, agricultural exports reflect a c onsiderable part of the overall trade. Canada remains the U.S.’s second-largest partner in this regard, and the relations are supported by favorable agreements between the nations. This report eval uates Canada as an agricultural ex  portdestination with an emphasis on nuts and pistachios, i n particular.
The pro cess ofagricultural export  into Canadais well-regulated, which promotes the safety and transparency of trade relations. According to the U.S. International Trade Administration, Canada accounts for 15% of the country’s total agricultural exports with $22 billion, most of which are consumer-oriented. Through this exchange,Canada receives high-value products for its population, whereas the U.S. support over 130,000 jobs. Since 1989, most American agricultural products have entered Canada duty-free under the NAFTA and U.S.-Cana da Free Trade Agreement, currently replaced by the USMCA. Supply-managed products, such as dairy and eggs, are not covered by the agreement, which still implies thatpistachio  export will benefit from duty-free relations. As per the agreement, all shipments are required to havea USMCA Certification of Origi n inaddition to the standard export documentation package (Government of Canada). For the consumer’s safety, Canada requests all exporters to provide a Phytosanitary Certifi cate for plant products. They officially co nfirmed that they are pest-free, conforming with the importer’ssanitaryrequirements, and have been inspect edb y theauthorized agency of the United States (Government of Canada).This way, the overall safety of agricultural exports is ensured.Because of the favorable trade environment, the export turnover between the United States and Canad a hasbeen considerable. Within it, nuts trade has been important, as conditioned by the climatic differences.Table 1 reflects the dynamics of the agricultural product and nut exportto Canada. Table 2 contains the history of pistachio import in Canada.
