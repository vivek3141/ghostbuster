It all happened sosuddenly.Thatsall I could think about as  my feet thundered  across therubble stricken ground, Icould n't se e anyone elseabout, at least..  anyonea ble to move. The bodies of  those whodidn't make it laid all around, d rooping out of windows and crunched up into corners,still  twitchi ng lightly.
Someofthe fumes were  stillaround, accidentally walking into a patchofthethick white smoke w ould make you cough harshly and make you lig ht headed forseveral minutes. Butlong time  exposure  could leave the person unable to mov eand they would eventually go i nsan e, stuck  sitting down occasionally laughing.It all happened s o sudd enly , who wouldhave thoughtle galising weed would do this?
