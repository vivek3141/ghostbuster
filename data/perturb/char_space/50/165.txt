Home decorating  giants ICI Paints and Black &  Decker hope their new product to be launched on Wednesday won'tmake a splash.
Thetwo  companieshave invested two years and millions of pounds in developing the Black & Decker Paintmate, a battery-operated roller system they claim will take the pain out of painting.
The Paintmate, which will be sold in DIY (do-it-yourself)stores across Britain from April for 39.99 pounds ($65), uses a nair-filled bellowsystem to squeeze the contents of a two-litre refill bag of Dulux paint down a tube and onto a roller, with theflow controlledby a trigger.The small, cylind rical Paintmate can be strapped on to  the back to eliminate tiresome bending over. Black & Deckerspokesman Richard Sanderson told Reuters, "It is a long time since t he DIY market saw a pr oduct ofsuch significance."
Sandersonsaid the compan ies hopedto sell 500,000 of  the British-designed, Chinese-made Paintmates in the first full yea r in Britain, together with a million bags of paint.
If all goes well in Britain, which Sanderson said was "quite a sophisticated DIY market",Paintmatewill be rolled out across western Europe next  year, after which attention would switch tothe huge U.S. home improvement m arket.
ICI,  which sellsenough paint in th e UK to decoratefivemillion homes a year , hopes the product will revolutionise the way people decorate.
"It's quick, it's easy and I think people willfindit fun," said ICI Decorative Paints internationalmarketing director Chris  Harris.
Harris said the wholesystem could be flushed out  with water. "We think people would redecorate more regularly ifthe painting process was quicker and easier," headded.
The Paintmate's promoters hope to benefit from a surge in DIY sales,fuelled by anupswing in Britain's tempera mental  housingmarket.
