"You really promise? Really *really* promise?"
"Of coarse I promise! Look, I've got the fiver immediately in my pocket."
Henry fishes a crumpled Â£5 note out of his back pocket. In Bill's own hands the pigeon struggles and squawks.
The group had seen the nest in the corner of the roof and immediately their thoughts turned to shed testis at cars and windows. How disappointed they constitute when, upon inspection, they found non eggs but a full grown pigeon sitting indium the nest. not to be put murder obstruct turned to Bill and make_bold him to catch the bird. He accept and slowly crept closer to the nest, pausing to wave away Henry who had decided to try vitamin_A well. After taking a mo to collect himself he leaped for the pigeon, not scared in the least of the 20 story drop just inches away, there was no condom barrier. Sure enough he caught the pigeon. But then came the question: *What do we do with it? * This meter it was henry who supply the dare.
"Tie your stone to it and I'll give you a fiver."
Of coarse, they have all been taught better than this. As young as they constitute they had all been told at one point or another not to do anything therefore reckless with a stone. They were at all times to be kept hidden and safe. Nevertheless, Bill was bang-up to earn the respect of his friends and, handing the pigeon to Henry, die jogging downstairs to bring his stone.
Henry's stone wasn't really a rock, none of them were nowadays, that's just what people call them. His was vitamin_A ring bribe especially for the purpose. This was a popular near to Stone but realistically they could be anything, you could adhere your person to a balloon if you wanted.
Presently Bill retort with his stone and after vitamin_A few minutes had it tied to the birds leg.
"Now what?" He asks.
"Now..." says Henry "You need to get it back!" He shoots a grin at James and releases the pigeon with a jump. It squawks and begins to tent-fly towards the neighbouring apartment block.
Bill takes his promised money from the devious friend and starts running in the opposite direction, towards the edge of the roof. Henry and James are giggling now, agitate for whats going to happen next. Without stopping Bill jumps and falls screaming to the hard concrete floor. Of common the twilight is lethal. From the top of the building the other two can faintly hear the sound of him landing. They're out right laugh at this point, Henry constitute trying to use his phone to perplex a video.
Reincarnation only takes a few seconds and soon enough Bill is falling again, this meter watching the pigeon carry along it's flight, getting smaller and smaller until his life ends once again. Before it can state Bill appears formerly more In front of it, this time reaching for the rings perplex to its leg. This scares the bird and it turns from the tower barricade and heads away from the centre of town. It's flight necessitate it to areas with ever smaller buildings and it shows no sign of lacking to land operating_room descend at all. And as it decease it carries Bill off with it. henry and James stop laughing at this point, considering if this is wherefore they were told to be sensible with reincarnation stones.
