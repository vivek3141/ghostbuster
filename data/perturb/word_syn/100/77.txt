She would go_on teaching, tirelessly writing on complex_number chalkboards and calling along imaginary scholar during the frozen moments.
As days turned into weeks and week change to months, I became known as the "Phantom Hero" - an unseeable do-gooder who appeared out of nowhere to aid those in need. Little did they know it was I who had the baron to halt meter and select the un-frozen.
But the knowledge of my gift weighed heavily on my soul. Though I sought to urinate a difference, one felt_up the burden of fudge others' lives.

In that moment, I sleep_together she possessed the same power. We were nobelium longer alone, no longer bound by our extraordinary abilities.
