I heard that it's contagious. That the full ward of the hospital we transported him to was shut gloomy after doctors started dropping to the floors, fast asleep, in the middle of their rounds. The entire place was quarantined.
"New virus places hundreds into comas. Public advise to stay indoors."
And so one did.
