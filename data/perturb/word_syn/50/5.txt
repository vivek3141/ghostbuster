Level 49 Paladin, schizophrenic calling's, walking through this wall-things wholly twenty-four_hours to come to grips with my prowess. Wow kids, don't let the boogey man boogie in your closet, you mustiness have forget to lock it, agnostic parents with a pocket full of apocalypse and a head full of spaces. Taste this, another jesus bracelet broke, some_other spirit invoked, hold on to hope so faith can poke it's head into the realm of the dead.
I spy with my little eye vitamin_A child teetering on the edge; hold hands with me and the rest of your invisible friends. It's better to break than continue to bend, snap your soul in 2 and let information_technology mend...was it real? What I saw? What was it truly dress what IT did? What was hidden inside of my mind visualize or reality neglected...Something segmented and crittering below the flowboards of the Dardan horse awoke my palsy through the sacred doors.
War of the worlds, obsolete cabal matching gain and comparing beef-sticks, equipped to rip shit like timid midgets insistent on dress what they didn't. Try not to constitute so literal, test not to feel intangibles as they toady up your spine, just entrust in the sky and the stars will align. I ain't nobelium judge, I ain't no jury, I'm merely a boy walkin with a vision too blurry to comprehend foe from friend and truth from trend but then again I can close my eyes and count to ten.. no fingers required, no toes to deadening my numerical crusade, okay?
