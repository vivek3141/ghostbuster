I love the music. It reflects what is just about to happen. It has saved me from more than a few kinship that would have constitute unsavory.
I have 2 theories approximately the music. Either I am the only one who hears it, or everyone does and no one ever talks approximately it. Which is fine. Music is a very personal thing after all.
Normally, the music is always astatine vitamin_A comfortable level, unless it is trying to warn me of something dire. there was matchless moment whereâ€¦ One moment where the healthy was deafening.
There was vitamin_A rising crescendo ever since I woke up that morning. I twist on the intelligence to watch while eating breakfast, vitamin_A I constantly do. Usually the music goes back and forth betwixt dramatic and more more lulling, depending along the news break about to come up. But that dawn it didn't change. It just crescendoing until the newscaster spoke.
"The World Trade Centers have been hit." I dropped my fork. The ting of it hitting the table was all I could hear. For the first time, ever, my world had gone quiet.
As I watched the consequence unfold, the music continue to be silent. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again. A long, gloomy clarinet played. And then other instruments slowly joined it. Something sad, simply hopeful. It was playing as I was steer forbid the door to decease to my Red Cross to visualize what I could do to help.
