I kneel down, blood calm on my clothes, asking for forgiveness to these statue around me. I was never religious, but sometimes life make you do things you never normally do. What I've done in life cannot be undone, a mothers have lost sons, baby have lost brothers and child have lost their dads. I am not a sinner, but one induce sinned; it's the concern I am in. I first killed a human_race at the age of 13 with my bare hands, choked him until he die cold. I'm 52 now--probably coming close to my last few years in this life, merely there's one thing I don't sorrow and it's taking the life of a criminal who didn't belong. one hunt evil people who've caused misery to communities and I believe I've done the right thing so far. I perplex up from my knees and left San Jose church, which my family visited every few Sundays growing up. one took the last step onto the sidewalk when one felt the barrel of a.357 magnum constitute pressed against the back of my head. I didn't process what was happening because information_technology had never happened. The world went silent and I could almost hear the finger tightening along the trigger when the loud bang rang through the streets. All I had was 7 seconds before I visualize black and felt my body tense and die into shock. one Hope they serve tequila in hell.
