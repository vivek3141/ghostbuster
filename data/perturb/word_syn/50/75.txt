information_technology always puzzled me, to pronounce the least, and made me exceedingly nervous.
As such I ne'er committed into relationships, probably by great of having my feelings non reciprocated.
My longest relationship was with vitamin_A man I loved deeply, Indy. He constitute the complete diametric of me: extraverted, charming, outgoing. He constitute friend with everyone, but calm_down reliable and generous.
We stayed together for a couple of years, and, I don't know why, but information_technology really seemed the_like he had feelings for me.
But like I did in other relationships before, I shut him down, rejecting him when I felt my feelings growing to much.
In the end helium left me, like they wholly did. I learn later that helium constitute with Kelly, a miss we met a pair of time when we were together.
I met other men and women, and it always ended the same way.
Fast forwards to yesterday. Grace_Kelly calls me, saying that Indy constitute in the hospital, after being hit by a car. His condition was critical, and he has necessitate for me.
And here I am, a bouquet of flowers in hands, nervously looking for room 68.
I find it, half opened, and take vitamin_A deep breath to give myself courage, and here Indy's weak voice.
"Kelly, you're...a wonderful girl but...I...I...I never loved you."
The words hit Maine like a punch. I storm indium the room, simply his eyes are already closed. Forever.
