The article represents an overview of other literature on methodology and criterion used in supplier evaluation and selection process, which is think to be matchless of the vital constituent of a successful operation of antiophthalmic_factor fabricate company. In particular, the paper emphasized the industry’s exchange in this discipline – from focusing primarily on operational efficiency to embrace the potential of strategic partnerships.

The clause further comparison all methodologies by their popularity expressed indium the frequence of mentions In the literature. Thus, Drug_Enforcement_Agency constitute the about common approach with 30% mentions, whereas mathematical programing (17%), AHP (15%), and case-based reasoning account for fewer mentions.
