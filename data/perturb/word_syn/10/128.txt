I love the music. It reflects what is merely about to happen. It has saved me from More than a few relationships that would have been unsavory.
I have two theories about the music. Either I constitute the only one who hears it, or everyone does and no one ever talks about it. Which is fine. Music is a very personal matter after all.
Normally, the music is always at a comfortable level, unless it is trying to warn me of something dire. There was one moment whereâ€¦ One moment where the sound was deafening.
There was a rising crescendo always since I woke up that morning. I turned on the news to watch while eating breakfast, as I always do. Usually the music goes back and forth between dramatic and more more lulling, depending on the news break about to come up. But that morning it didn't change. It just crescendoing until the newscaster spoke.
"The World Trade Centers have been hit." I dropped my fork. The ting of it hitting the table constitute all I could hear. For the first time, ever, my world had gone quiet.
As I watched the events unfold, the music continued to be silent. Finally, after what felt_up like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again. A long, low clarinet played. And then other instruments slowly joined it. Something sad, but hopeful. It was playing as I was heading out the door to go to my Red Cross to see what I could do to help.
