It all happened so suddenly.
Thats all I could remember about as my feet thundered crosswise the rubble stricken ground, I couldn't see anyone else about, at least.. anyone able to move. The bodies of those who didn't make it put all around, drooping out of windows and crunched upwards into corners, still twitching lightly.
Some of the fumes were calm around, accidentally walking into a patch of the thick white smoke would make you cough harshly and make you light steer for several minutes. But farseeing time exposure could leave the person unable to move and they would eventually die insane, stuck model down occasionally laughing.
It all happen so suddenly, who would have thought legalising weed would do this?
