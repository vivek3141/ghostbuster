Stanley walked up the stairs to his boss' office.
Stanley knowing a short path went into the elevator and pressed the button 3, to his bosses office.
Stanley walked into his boss' office as soon as the door opened.
No, that can't be right, Stanley, you can't just plug in the void cleaner, that's non in the script.
What's that I hear, you're vitamin_A real person?
Well then, let me show you a video along obedience.
Oh, let's see everything in this lift constitute broken.
However, all hope is not lost, now just base_on_balls to the boss' office!
Oh, you refuse, well now look, this full matter is broken, all my hours of work, destroyed by you, you careless jerk.
I guess I can only delete this project of mine.
Goodbye, Stanley.
