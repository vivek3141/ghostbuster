She was shaking, I was too, he was dead. Blood on my hands, I hoped there was still light behind my eyes. I never killed a man before, I never had to save someone before. I didn't feel good, or mighty. She broke, slumped to the ground, her body, a tremor as she sobbed. I dropped the knife, I turned to look astatine what I had done. She shouted my name through tears. He had so much red on his stomach, his throat was open too. I did that? I did that, I had to. I said as much forbidden loud. Again she shouted my name. I couldn't touch her though. She is so white, and I haven't decided if now I constitute dark. I didn't feel tainted, my heart was still beating so fast. I necessitate a long hard breath, he is all_in and so constitute his intent, we are alive because I would not allow him to have his way. Again she shouts, but I'm deep in thought. Another long breath. I came to a conclusion. I killed a man today, I did the right thing, I beat him to the punch, and I'm still here and I still have to take care of her.
I told her to stand, nicely, I offered her a meek smile, and apologized for what she had seen and what I had to do. I started to explain why, but fuck it, she can't hear anything, *she's in shock Boone, get her inside*. I base_on_balls her up the street, she remembers she can't walk in heels. She sees the life on my hands, and that sets her off again. We go inside a shitty mexican restaurant. I sit her down, I go to wash my hands. I dress it with my closed, I'm not sure if I wanna look at the guy who looks back at Pine_Tree_State above the sink. I'm not sure if I wanna be the voice along the phone to the police. I puke in the sink, maybe some got on my shoes.
What the hell am I doing?
