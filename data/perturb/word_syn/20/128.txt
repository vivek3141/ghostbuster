I sleep_together the music. It reflects what is just about to happen. It has saved me from more than a few family_relationship that would have been unsavory.
I have two theories about the music. Either I am the only one who hears it, or everyone does and no one ever talks about it. Which is fine. Music is a very personal thing after all.
Normally, the euphony is always at a comfortable level, unless it is trying to warn me of something dire. there constitute one moment whereâ€¦ One moment where the sound was deafening.
There was a rising crescendo ever since I woke up that morning. I turned on the news to watch while eating breakfast, as I always do. Usually the music goes back and forth betwixt dramatic and more more lulling, depending on the news break about to come up. But that morning it didn't change. It just crescendoing until the newscaster spoke.
"The World barter Centers have constitute hit." I dropped my fork. The ting of it hitting the table was all I could hear. For the first time, ever, my world had gone quiet.
As one watched the events unfold, the music continued to be silent. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again. A long, low clarinet played. And then other instruments slowly joined it. Something sad, but hopeful. It was playing as I was heading out the door to go to my Red traverse to see what I could do to help.
