I knelt down, blood still on my clothes, asking for forgiveness to these statues around me. I was never religious, but sometimes animation makes you do things you never usually do. What I've done in life cannot be undone, a mothers have lost sons, baby have lost brothers and kids have perplex their dads. I am not a sinner, but I have sinned; it's the business I am in. I first killed a man at the age of 13 with my bare hands, choked him until he went cold. I'm 52 now--probably coming close to my last few years in this life, but there's one thing I don't regret and it's taking the life of a criminal who didn't belong. I hunt evil people who've caused misery to communities and I think I've dress the right thing so far. I got up from my knees and left San Jose church, which my family_line visited every few Lord's_Day growing up. one took the last step onto the sidewalk when I felt the barrel of a.357 magnum being pressed against the back of my head. I didn't process what was happening because it had never happened. The world went silent and I could almost hear the fingerbreadth tightening on the trigger when the loud bang rang through the streets. All one had was 7 seconds before I saw black and felt my body strain and going into shock. I hope they serve tequila in hell.
