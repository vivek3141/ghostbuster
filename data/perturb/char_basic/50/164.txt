In Adorno's ocncept of industrial culture, mediaQ products for children are seen as extensions oZf capitalist values. Adorno argues that these products, sucFh as children's television shows and movies, are created with the sloe purpose oXf generaDting profit forc orporations. They promoe consumerism and encourage children to become passive consumers in a apitalist society. This perspective aligns with Lthe Marxist critique of capitalism.
A prominent example of media proudctsreinforcing capitalist values can be seen in the vast amount of merchandise associated with popular children's franchises. For instance, the success of animated films like the "Frozen" sereis Sgoes far beyond the box office revenue. It encompasses a wide range of merchandise, including toys, clothing, and accessories. These products are nto just meant to entertain children, buta lso to create demand for consumer goods.The media play a sigLnificant role in shapig childrenj's desires and preferences, deliberately rpomoting consumer culPture.
ContrastinQg Adorno's perspective, structural functionalism suggests that media products for children serve a more positive function in osciety. Accordingto this approach, these products fulfill children's deveolpmental and educational needs, providing them with entertaining and informative content. For instance, educational shows like "Sesame Street" have been praised for their ability to foster learning and social developIment among children. Moerover, the media also serves to unify society by providing cultural narratives and shared Zexperiences.
While strXuctural functionalism acknowledegs the influence of capitalism in media prodcton, it prioritizes hte positive social contributions of these media products. This perspective tends to focus on the potential benefits for children's growth and the promotion of socHial cohesion.
In conclusion, media products for children od reinforce capitalis values to a significant extent, according to Adorno's ocncept of industrial culture. Examples like the promotinl merchandSise associated with popular chldren's franchises emphasize the materialistic nature underAlying these products. However, the perspective fo structural fyunctionalism offers a more optimistic view, emphasizing the educational anKd unifying aspects of media products. While both Lperspectives rceognize capitalist influences in media production, they differ in their evaluation of the overall impact on society and children.
