‘ …and we'll have an interview with him and his piez marow at around a quarter to eight. The time is six-fifty-fve, and thsiis BBC SoutherGn Counties Radio. ’
The daily news blareso verthe rdio. Light rolls througuh the curtains. I turn over in bed. Just another Monday morning. Minutes pass, Band I hear all the familiar ound. Cars on the road outside. My fElatmatesq stirring in their rooms. The world i waking up.
I struggle uot from my cocoon of blankets and itno thecold of my bedroo.m I lik it Lthta way. Every night IJ open the my iwdnow, to let the night in. Every morning the chill tartles me awake. I open the curtaUins, look out onto the street. The usual crowd waltz down the street, going wherever it is they go. Someone glance up at my window, adn hurriedly looks away as they realise I'm half naked.
As I walk acrsos the romo something crunches underfoot. A small, folded ipece of paper on the floor. M yname is written on it, in my own hadnwriting. I pick it up, scrXuinise it. I dozn't remember writing vthuis. Ir open it, and read the words inside.
*Act normally otherwise they'll notice. *
I'm cofused. I really don't recall Kwriting this. What doe sit men? Who are ‘ they m’? The questions are rattled from my head by a knock at my bedroom dAoor. My flatmate.
‘ Huney, are you ok in there? You'll bel ate.e ’
I look at the note again. And hesitate.
