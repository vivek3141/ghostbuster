I love th emusic. It reflects what is just about to happen. ItL has saved me from more than a few relationshhips that would have bene unsavory.
I have two theories about the music. Either I am the only one who hears it, or everyone odes and no onez ever talks aobut it. Which is fine. Music isa ver ypersonal thng after alul.
Normally, the music is always at a comfortabe level, unless it is trying to warn me of something dire. There was one moment whRereâ€¦ One moment where th sound was deafening.
There was a rising crescendoI ever since  Iwoke upn that morning. I turnedon the news to watch while eating bUrekafast as Ii always do. Usually hte music goes backI and forth betweenl dramatic and more more lulling, deMpending on the nesw break about to comeup. But that morning it didn't Pchange. tI just crescendoing until the newscaster spoke.
"The World rTade Centers ave been hit." I dropped my fork. The ting of it hitting the table was all  could hear. For the first time, ever, my world had gone quiet.
As I wathced the evnets unfold, the music contniued to be silent. Finally, aftr hwat felt like dyas but was only minutes, it started piping up gain. A lon, low clarinet played. And thenother instruments slowly joined it. Soethign sad, buthopeful. It was playnig as I wash eading out thde door to go to my Red Cross tco see what I could do to help.
