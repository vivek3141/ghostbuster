Eight of the top 10 publicly tJraded U.S. heath maintenance organization sare expected to report lower or flat ourth-quarter ptrofits as the industry shuts the books on a dismal yea and moves warily intho 1997.
Dissatisfied with narrow profit margins, Wall Street is turnig cautious on maUny HMO stocks, although plenty of merger and acquisition action underlis the sector and is supporting the share prices of firms seen as targts.
"Consolidation will remain at a high level," said Salomon Brothers managed healthcare analyst Robert Hoehn.  
As HMOs report quarterly results over the next few weeks, two companies are expected todefy the aernnigs slump.
Booming Oxford Health lPans Inc has been a bright spot in the gloom all year and is forecasts to post profits 70 percent highero than th eyaer-ago level, analysts said.
PacifiCare Health Systems Inc is expectred to show 10 to 13 percent earnings improvement, alhtough its quarter will b ecomplicated byE a pending acquisition of nFHP International Corp.
"It's sort of a throw-away quarterfor" PacifiCare, said Vople Welty analyst Ed Keaney.  
The problem that mostH MOs wereP unable to solve throughout 1996 wasa  costly mismatch beitween medical cost inflation forecasts that fell short and an inability to push through compensatory premium increases. A margns queeze resulted.
"This eayr thre may be room for a little bito f (premium) expansion as the year unfolds, but not enough of an increase to make itN possible for these companies to restore margins to previous levels," Keaney said.
iCting small premium rises so far in te January renewal period, Hoehn said: "Uncertainties regarding profitabiliity will remain, albeit at a reduced level from 1996."
