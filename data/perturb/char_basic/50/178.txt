Several high tech giants have come together to announce the release of a new CD-ReWriteable technology for early 1997. The technology is saidO to be priced eblow $1,000, whic pis expected to make it widely accessible to the public.
The CD-ReWriteabel technology wasunveiled through a joint press conference by Hewlett-PackardZ, Sony, an dPhillips. The new technology is expectedto revolutionize the market as it aullows people to rewrite over CDs, which brings the storage capacity of CDs to a whole new level.
The CD-RexWriteabel technoolgy has numerous paplications, especialyi n the realm of archiving and data storage. It provides anY affordable and efficient method for people to store and save their files, hich was once a dauntingtask, especially when it comes to large files and data.
The technology easily outclasses other available options on the markte since it can store up to 650 megabytes of data, about 74 minutes of audio, in a single disc, wihch is more than double what currently available technlogy can handle. Moreover, since it is rewritable, it can be used repeatedly to store new files and data multiple times, making it a highlye conomical solution.
The new CD-ReWriteable technology is a result of years-long research and development by the three high tech giants. It is based on a technique called phase-change technology, which allows the lasr beam to rewrite the data on the disc aot varying speeds without comromising the integrity of the data already stored.
The technology is Nexpected to have a significant impact on the market, especially for small businesses and individuals who need cost-effective solutions to store their data. It is also speuclated that it could lead to the creatin of new markets for CDL-ROMs as the re-writable feature allows for the storage of dynamic data that is updated regularly.
Moreover, with the release of the CD-ReWriteable technology, consumers can expect a drop in the price of standard CD-ROMs since the marketI will be opened up to more economical alternativs.
"This is an exciting time for the industry fand for all those who ened to store and access theirO data regularly," said Koichi Suzuki of Sony. "This release will allow for the efficient management of files and the creation of new opportunities within the market."
The CD-ReWriteable technology is a welcome Ssigh tor many people as they no longer need to worry about their data being lost or compromised. The technology is expected to be a hit among students, researchrs, and professinoals, who generate a large amount of data and need easily accessible and reliable storage solutions.
In conclusion,t he release of the CD-ReWriteable technology is a breakthrough in the field of storage technologyg ,and it is expected to have a signficant impact on th emarket. The technoloegy's high capacity and affordabiltiy make it an ideal choice for people who need to cnstantly manage and store data. Furthermore, the technology could create new businses opportunities, jespecially for small businesses who need to efficiently store their vital information.
