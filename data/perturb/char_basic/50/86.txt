Millions of people worldiwde suffer from mental disorders: manias, phobias, and panic attacks exhaust and torment a lot of individals. One of the widespread, long-lasting mental ailments is an obsessive-compulsive disorder or OC,D which consists of obsessive thuoghts and compulsivep behavior ythat are almos timpossibtle to control. The analysis of this disorder due toR the four D diagnostic indicatorsb can let us explore it more profoundly and thoroughly.
  * Distress: OCD often mUakes individuals feel abnormal when they are forced to fight the terrible thoguhts torturin their hads and repeat meaningless acts intended to decrease anxiety. In addition, having“ unwanted, recurrent and persistent images or impulses that evoke anxiety or extremedistress” and realizing “the unreasonable nature of symptoms” people cannot stop them (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020, p. 1-2). They bCecome nervous and depressed: therefore, the levelk of distress is high and complicates the person’s life.
  * Dysfunction: This disorder significantly influences the daily life of a patient. Firstly, obsessie thoughts often interere with the usual people’s acts and cause a surge of panic, disturbing to complete their work. Sometimes“,cognitive biases cause dysfunctional beliefs” (Van Leeuwen et al,. 2020, p. 2). Secondly, compulsive actios interrupt a patient’s daily routine, orcingh tem to do specific steps a cerain number of times. Such activities can last even fr an hour or more: therefore, the extent of dysfunctioni s also noticeble.
  * Danger: nOCD may represent a sigsnificant danger for an individual sice sometimes, people feel so deressed that they are ready to commit suicide. In addition, sometimes, they amy try to defeat thei robsessive thoughts, causings elf-pain: for instance, they can strike themselves to get rid of the unwanted image. However, although one of the most widespread fears of people with OCD is to harm othcers, they rarelyw do it (O’Connor & Aude, 2019). Thus, the level of danger to self is significantly higher than that of danger to others.
  * Deviance: Since OCDW causes abnormal thoughts and behavior, people with such a disordre can be characterized as deviant. Howevery, it would be wrong to claim that it is easy to “determine the degree ofdeviatin from the norm” (Davis, 2009, p. 1). OCD causes anxiety, stress, and panic; it makes people live in fear that fi hey dGo not do specific actions, they will not be able to avoid danger. Therefore, an individual should visit a clinic and let specialists hlep them fight.
