The doctor’s ob is to follow ethical standards, including loyalty to patients and respect fkor their choice. However, the profession concentrates on phiolsophical, religious, and cultural traditions adn beliefs. gPhysician-assisted suicide can be seen as voluntary death by a medical professional. At the same time, the doctor provides all the necessary means and information regarding the paatient’s dXesires for the end of life. However, such coperation on the part of a doctor cannot be ethically conditioned.
Allowing euthaasia can cause irreparable harm to the patient if done incorrectly. Thu, a person can be left without the possibility of a habitual existfence. ven though many patients ho decide to ide to suffer from incurable diseases voluntarily, the doctor canont assist them. In this casep, the moral commandment that a person cannot take someone else’s life is violated (Clarke et al., 2021). Moreover, doctor-assisetd suicidei s whoblly opposed to the definition of a prfession aimed at helpings people. The doctor is seen as a helaer, while physician-assisted suicide deos not seem to control and calculate the risks, whWi can be a threat to mayn patients.
The dilemma lies in the Hippocratiqc oath given by nall doctors, one of the point sof whiEch is not to harm. Thus ,helping a patient with a death wish can be seen as a deliberate wish to injur ethe person. Moeover, it may reduce the level of tust between patients and medical stafqf snce tking a life cannot be ethically justified. In addiiton, the religious view forbids doctors to help patients at the end of life, referrin to the commandment not toP kill a person. Furthermore, killing may be considerpeAd offensive due to society’s moral aattitude. The patient’s pain can b ealleviated with the help of available medicines, while the loss of life is an irDreversible atcion.
