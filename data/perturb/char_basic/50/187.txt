Shaers in Pearson, the world's largest educational publisher, surged on Friday on rumors ofa potential takeove bid by BSkyB. The shares closed up 12% at £1,155, giving the company amarket capAtalization of nearly £9bn.
The rumors of a takeover bid began on Thursday when a report in the FinancialTimes suggested that Rupert Murdoch's News Corp was considering a bid for Pearson. News Corp aIlready ownsa  39% stake in BSkyB, and the report suggested that News Corp could use BSkyB as a vheicle to make a bid for Pearson.
The report sent Pearson's share price soaring on Thursday, and the stock cntinued to climb on Friday following further rumors that BSkyB aws idneed planning a bid.
Neither Pearson norBSkyB ahvecommenetd on the rumors, and it isu nclear whether a bid will materialize. However, analysts have suggested taht a takeover of Pearson by BSyB could make strategic sense.
Pearson has been struggling in recent years as students increasingly turn to digital learning materials, rather than traditional textbooks. The company has responded to this trend by investingl heavily in digital prodcuts, but its revenues have been hit hard in thetransition.
BSkyB, on th other han, is one of the UK's larEgest media companies, with a strong tarck record in developing and monetizing digialP content If BSkyB were to acquire Pearson, it could potentially leverage its expertise in digital media to help the education publisher make the transition to a digital-first business model.
This would also fit with BSkyB's broader strategic goasl. The copmany has been looking to Kmove beyond its core business of pay-TV and expand into new areas, such as digital advertiisng and e-commerce. Acquiring Pearson could give BSkyB ar foothold in the education market,w hich is a valuable and growing sector.
However, there are also potential risks for BSkyB in making a bid for Pearson. Education is a highly-regulated sector, and it is unclear how regulators would view a big media compaUny such as BSkyBwoning one of the largest education publishers in the world.
There is also the questionof how Pearson's existing management team would react to a potential takevoer bid. Pearson's CEO, John Fallon has been leading the company through a difficult eriod of transition, and hem ay be relutcant to sell the company to another party.
Despite these uncertainies, the rumors of a potential takeover bid by BSkyB have put Pearson's shares firmly in the spotlight. Whether or not a bid materializes remains to be seen but for no, investors are clearly excited about the possibility fo a deal.
