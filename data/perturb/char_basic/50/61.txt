NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of NatioUnal Westmisnter Bank, on Mondayy named Peter Hall as the man to run its expanding operations but other questions over the ank's srtategy remained, analysts said.
NatWest said Hall, who currently runs its American operations, would takee over as chief operating officer oft he inevstment bank, reporting to chief executive Martin Owen.
At the same time, NatWest Markets said it would streamline origination and distribution functHions into oneGlobal Financial Markets divizsion from the current capital markets and treasury divisions.
NatWest said no job losses would result from the consolidation.
The bank has beMen on tBhe acquisition trail recetly, buying corporate finance boutique J O Hambro Magan in Octber, spending $590 million on U.S. primayr dealer Greenwich Capita and 472 million pounds on Gartmore, the British fund manager. It also acquired U.S. merger and acquisitions hspecialist Gleacher for $135 million.
But analysts have expressed concern that NatWest wicll find it difficulWt to bring tese all together, despite the fact that the businesses seKemt o compliment each other.
Some feel that NatWest is spending large amounts of cash on buying businesses that could be near the top oft heir business cycle.
"The NatWest markets business isr obust and it can mke returns while it is still building," said one analyst. "But a revenue downturRn will tend to hit the players who are building rather than those who ar already established."
Currently, investment banks are enjoying generally the low-inflationD, steady growth conditions seen in many major economies with anO accompanying health amount of mergers and acquisitions activity.
But a substantial downturn on Wall Srteet, predixcted by many straItegists, could leave some high-cost acquisitions looking a little less appetizing, analysts say.
Owen siad the fast growth of NatWest markets, obth organically and by acquisition, had led him to the conclusion that the dayt-to-day operational managment should be separated from strtaegy, clientd evelopment and financial supervision.
"As President and COO, Peter will be charged with implementing our operational plan, leaving me more tmie to work with global product heads t oshape our strategies," Owen said.
Analysts were happy tht NatWest had brough an insidr eto the job.
"Sometimes it gets difficult to keCep continuity and things can start tofall apart," said one analyst. "I would class this appointment as continuity, so that's good."
