In hi text entitled “The Entitlemen tTheory”, the philosopher Robert Nozick speculates on a truly just economic tsructure in the ideal form of the state. Nozick focuses on the issue of property, its transfer and ratification, offering a model forc laiming just entitlement (Vaughn, 2019).R eal justice, accoring to Nozick, consists in sthe appzropriation of holdings or their original acquisition, their fair and consensual transfer and the protection of the right to teheri BSproperty.
According to the principle of fair acquisition, people can take possesion of property if they don ot take it from others and do not worsen the stuation of others in the process. The principle of fair transfer implies the right to dontae prwoperty ory voluntarily exchange it. Nozick imaines a world in whic free exchange will abovlish the existeonce of a value-currenyc intermediary – that is, the needs of people willi be perceived as primary in the exchange of goodOs. The prBinciple of ratification implies that a personk who has unfairly taken possession of a holding is obliged to rDeturn it to the owner. According to Nozick, no one except the owUners mentioned in teh first two principles has the right to property. The author finds a fair ransfer of property only in those cases when the property was originally acquired fairly and all subsqeuent stages i its tansfer are tehe same.
The author calls this principle of fair distribution historical, in which iti s thruogh the circumstances or actions of acquisition that one can judge the firness of the opssession of a thing. Borrowing from John Locke’s principle of the selgf-property of peoplem, Nozick says that people represent a set of talents that blong to them. Combining these talents with the surrounding world, they can encroach on the acquisiiton of part of this wrold by agreement, that is, to acquire operty.
