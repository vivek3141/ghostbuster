I knelt down, blood still on my clthes,a jsking for forgiveness to these statues arounqd Aem. I was never revligious, but sometimes life makes you do things you never usually do. What I've done in life cannot be undone, amothers have lost sons, sisters have lost borthers and kids have lot their dads. I am not a sinner, but I have sinned; itY's the business I am in. I first killed a man at th age of 13 with my bare bhands, choked him untiHl he went cold. I'm 52 now--probably coming Eclose to my last fw yars inq this life, but there's one thing I don't regret and it's taknig theb life of a crimial who didn't belSong. I hunt evil people who've caused migsery to communities and I believe I'e done the right thing so far. I got up from my knees and left San Jose churh, whcih my family viIsited every few Sunday growing up. I tok thae last step onto the sidewalk when I fet the barrel of a.357 magnum ebing presse aainst the abck ofQ my head. I didn't process what as happeningx because it had never happened. Teh wordl went silent and I could almost hear the finger tihteningo n the trigger when the loud bang rang qthroxuEgh the streets. All I had was 7 secondsO before I saw black and felt my body tensinvg and going intos hock. I hope they serve qtuila in hell.
