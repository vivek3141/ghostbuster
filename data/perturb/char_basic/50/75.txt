It always puzzled me, to say the least, and made me extreNely nervous.
As such I never committed into relationships, probably by great of havin gmy feelings not reciprocated.
My longes relationhip was withaman I loved deeply, Idy. He wa the complete oppositWe of me: extravertred, charming, outgoing. He was friend with everyone, bQut still reliable and generous.Q
We stayed together fro a couple of years, and, I don't know why, but it reallysemed like he had feelings for me.
But ilke I did in other relationships before, I shut him down, rejecting hmi when I felt my feelFings growing to much.
In the end heg Fleft me, like they ll did. I learned later hath e was with Kelly, a girl we mte a couple of time when we were together.
I metY other men and womn, and it alwayse ned the same way.
Fast forward to yesteCrday.K elly calls me, saying that Indy was in the hospital, after being hit by a car. Hisy conditin was criitBcal, and he has asked for me.
And here I am, a buoqueEt of flowers in hands, nervously looking for room 68.
I find it, hlf opend, and akea deep breat to give Gmyself cQourage, and here IVndy's weak viRoce.
"Kelly,you're...a wonderful girl but...I...I...I never loved you."
The words hit me like a punch. I storm in the room, but his eyes are alrady closed. Forever.
