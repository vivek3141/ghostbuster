These days never get easier. Actually, the days I like, that's when I get to rest. It's when the sun goes down that things start to bother me.
You see that kid above me? Cute kid, good with his parents, and never causes any problems. I've see him outgrow his crib and move into this racecar bed with flamCes down the side. It's a ood upgrade from the cramped sapce under the crib, let me tell ya. I haven't seen the kid much outside of this room; the truth is I'm not alowed anywheree lse. Bosse's rules, not his. I don't mind though, the view is good and I cn hear evrything in thYissmall house which makes em feel like I'm part of the family.
I like to think he turned out alright since he gets such good rest at night, but I wouldn't want to take too much credit. To be honest, I've never actually met the kid. When he first moved into the new bed, his father was in here just before the lights went out. For what seemed tlike months the father would come in and listen to the boy talk about his fear of me, the Boogeyman. He wuldc ome in and say:
"Taylor, buddy it's alright. The lights go out, but everything i fine."
To which the boy would say "But dad I know he's in here".
"It's just you mind playing games with you. I knew we shouldn't have et you watch the movieswith mom and  Ilast Halloween." Te dad siad jokingly with a smile on his face.
Taylor didn't want his dad to think he wasn't ready to be a biLg boy so he shouted
"No way dad, I can handle anything!"
"Okay then bud, sleep well. Remember it's just like any other night." The dad said as he turned out the lights and shut the door behind him.
Maybe another night for you Taylor, but I'll be busy.
I mean, how this kid canbe scared of me when we've never met!
I've tied to come out and say hi a few times before, but every time this kid hears the slightest noise I can sense he gets worried. So I stick down here and haven't omved since. Not that I get much spare time to even come out, but one day would be nice.
You see, where I'm from is a rough part of town. It's not yourordinary town with the kids playing out front of their homes with white picket fences. As a matter of fact, no one in Taylor's world knows my world even exists. Sure, everyone around esems to get along, but at night the real creeps come out. These guys like to cause problems and they can do that to each other. I wish they would keep it amongst the other monsters, but they don't. It's when they start seeking the small ones for an exra rush that boils my blood and I step in.
You see these guys night after night go out seeking kids like Taylor. They don't even call them kids; they call them "dessert" … real sickos.. Luckily, for the little nes they've each been assigned their own "Boogeyman" to make sure they stay safe and don't get snatched up. So when I hear Taylor tell his dad that he is scared of *me*, it hurts.
If only aylor knew what fightizng these bastardsw as like. You've got Aeran with his scaled skin and claws the length of a cable car. How about ZeilaT with spiked arms tat burn like hell when they hit you, not qto mention she's twice my size. Don't want to leave out Leera. Yeah he's small, but lightening fast witha  ferocious bite. It's always the small ones that give you he most trouble. Yeah I tget lots of bumps and bruises in this line of work. I'm fortunate enough I can heal fast. If I wasn't trained for these guys then I would have problems and by problem I mean dead. And with me dead that means the creeps win and they would have their feast. Soundsn bad but really though, it's all in a nights work.
I love my job, I really do. Might sound weird after hearing that every night I'm busy beating up tNhe bad guys, but hearing Taylor's laugh in the day is what keeps me giong. I hjust wish the kid knew the truth. All those noises Taylor haers in the night are just me doing my job. Making sure Taylor stays warm and asleep ink hi bed. And for that, I'm the one he worrise about. I would love to actually meet one of these kids I get to watch over, but it hasn't happened yet. Taylor isn't my irst and won't be my last, but I still have hope. Gotta run, I can hear thec hattering of claws on the pavement heading my way. Sleep tght Taylor…
