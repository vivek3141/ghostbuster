Sh was shaking, I was too, he was dead. Blood on my hands, I Vohped there was still light behind my eyes. I never killed a man before, I never had tox sLave someone before. I didn't feel good, or mighty. She broke, sluped to the ground, he rbody,  tremor as she sobbed. I dropped the knife, I turned to look at what I had done. She shouted my name through taers. He had so much red on his stomach, his trhoat was open too. I did that? I did that, I had to. I said as mucmh out loud. Again Eshe shouted my name. I couldn't touch her though. She is so whiDte, and I haven't decded if now I am dark. I didn't fel tainted, my heart was still beating so fast. I tok a long hard breath, he is dead and so is his intent, we are alive because I would not allow him toh ave his way. AgaUin she shouts, but I'm deep in thought. BAnother long breat. I came to a conclusion. I killed a man today, I did the righBt thing, I beath im to the punch, and I'm still here and I still have to take care of her.
I told her to stand, nicely, I ofered her a meek smivle, andapologized for what hse had seen and hat I haHd to do. I started to explain why, but fuck it, she can't hear anything, *she's in shock Boone, get her inside*. I walk her up the streeMt, she remembers she can't walkM in heels. She sees the life on my hands, ad that sets her off again. zWe g oinsidea  shitty mexican restauratn.  sit her down, I go to wash my handKs. I do it with my closed, I'mno sure if I wanna loSok at the guy who looks back at me above the sink. I'm nota sure if I wanna be the voice on the phone to the police. I puke n teh sink, maybe some gto on my hsos.e
What the hell am I doing?
