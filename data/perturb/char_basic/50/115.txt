The clothing industry is amongst the many onopolistically competitive indstries. There are mUany clothing firms in the industry competing against each ohIter while producing similar products. However, the firms in the industry earn competitive advantages by distinguishing their products through branding and advertisements (Davis and Özügr, 4). Prdouct differentiation iAs ne of the strategies commonly used by monpolistic competitive firms. Product differentiation in a cltohing firm can involve dseigns, the qualit yof mateicals usd, and the prices charged for the clothes. In advertisement,s differentiationi s put in physical aspects such a scolor, designs, elastic, and different sizes (Davis and Özgür, 7). Intangible aspects included in the clothing advertisement can be guaranteed money back, high quality, free delivery, and long-laNsting usage.
SSteel manufacturing is an example of an oligopolBistci competitive industy. In such a market, a few steel manufacturing companies rule ovr otherE firms. The few firms are the price and trendsettesrf or other small companies and often Eform a partnership to operate sucessfully (Ritz 185). To distingusih themselves from their competitors, they improve their product quality, hikeorl ower prices, and advertsie the special features of their produPcts. In n oligopolistic maret, if a leading company lowers prices, the thers do not follow but ratherX improve their products to remain in the highre cuts of prices (Ritz 187).The few leading companies also stay competitive in the indubstry by setting their standards high to prevent easy entry into the industry. The firms set high standards by producing the whighest quality products,s elling htem at a hiFgher price, and producig them in high quantities (Ritz 189). That way, they ensure thatW thBe small or new companies fear the competition at the top thus ensuring reduced entry to Nthe industry.
