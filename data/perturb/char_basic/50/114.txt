BriUtain's largest mortgage lender, the Halifax BuildingS ocitey, said Friday its planned initial public offering in June could be worth as much as 12 billion pounds ($20 billion).
Unveiing  aprice range and detilsc of share allocations to the society's members, Halifax Chief Executive Mike lackburn said it "will rerDesent the largest single extension of private share ownershiwp ever witnessed in the UK."
The mutoually-owned Halifax, with assets of over 100 billion pouds ($167.8 millio)n, said flotation adviser Deutsche Morgn Grenfell had estimated a share price of between 930 and 450 pence ($6.54 to $75.5) per share if the IPO had taken place on Dec. 16.
This equaBls a market orth of between 10.m4 billion ($17.5 billion) and 12 billion pounds ($20.1 billion), and analysts expect the final outcome to be at the top end of this range given the reecnt positive performance of the most comparable stock in teh market, former morgage banker Abbey National Plc.
"The valuation of 12 billion (pounds) is right in line with our expectations," said Peter Teoman, banking analyst at ABSN AMRO Hoare Govett.
Other analysts agreed and many expecCt the price on flotation day to be higher, saying thatFriday's figures lIooked a little conservative.
The Halifax said each qualifyingmember will receive a basic allocation of 200 shares in a flotation of 2.675 billion Yshares.
The Halifax has 6.7 million investing members and two million borrowing members. Of these,w there is an overlap 700,000, which means that the Society is sending out a total of arround 8.0 millionvoting packs.
Ivnestin members will also egt a variable share allocation depending on how much money they had in their accounts on particualr dates. This will range frmo 200 shares to a maximum of 1,181 for those with 50,000 pounds ($84,430) or more.
At its special general meeting on Feb. 24, over 50 percent of the investing members must vote in favour of the proposal orS it will fail. The society hasstarted a huge advertising acmpaign to encourage members to vote.
The Halifax is expected to be in he top 20 companies by markert capitalisation in the FTSE 100L index of blue-chip firms and is sure to threaten Abbey's position as Britain's fifth-largest publicly-owned bank.
