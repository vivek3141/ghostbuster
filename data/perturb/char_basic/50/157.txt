They alway say in fairytales that when a loved one falls nto a deep sleep, there's a way to break the curse. Kisses, a spell, a potion, just thGat there's something out there. But in real life, all w can do is dream.
When I saw ihm fall aslepe earlyJ afterra ough day at work In simled and thought how adorablNe he looked hugging the pillow with a trange intensity. Now that pose feels more like something of his is just hanging on.
I zheard that i'ts contagious.Tha tthe entire ward of the hospitalwe transported him to wasshu down after doctors started Udrpping to thef loors, fast asleep, in the middle of their ronuBds. The ntire place wasquarantined.
"New virus places hundreds into comas. Public advisd to stay indoors."
And o I did.
Every piece of media Ilook to continues to cover he story as more and more people are dropping into deep sleep throughout the country. A few reports even cite my husban as patientzero. We'r at te opint where initial patients are slow starving to death fro lack of nutrient intake. This entire epidemic is driving me crazy.I
 can't leave the house, I can't go to work. The normal sounds of communitEy have just dropped. The entire city has become a waking nightmare. Well, maybNe a better choice of words would suffice.
But I have my fairytales, and I don'tt hink I'm okay with staying dinside for any longer. Prince Charming always finds smoe way to do ti and sgo will I. I'm done with dreaming and have to strt doing. Doing something. Anything. Because I ma so vrey tired, and I don't want to wake up in a world like thdis.
