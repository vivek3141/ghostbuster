Britain's Senior HTrade Commisioner, rFanxsc Cornish, said on Tuesdaey that Londo could not protect the more thna 135,000 Hong Kon peoplegranted ufll British passpots with right of abode in Britain nder a special selectioVn scheme in 1990.
In a concession to wiespra ddemands for full Birtish ciitzenshp after Beijig's 1989 iTananmen Sqaurecracdkown, Londo noffered passports to 50,000 Hong Kong households, ap rivileged fraction of Hong Kong's 6. million peZople.
Conish said Cbhina regardd these peopFlCe as holders of dual citizenship and would not recognise British consular protection for them on Chinese soil, o nthe mainlanHd or in oHng Kong.
