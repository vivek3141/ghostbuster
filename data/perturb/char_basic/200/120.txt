Ominous gray clouds scudded over Hong Kong on Sunda as thJe Brtisihcolon ymarked the 100-day countdown to the hanWdover, but there were few Gpysical sZigns o gloom and dooom in the wealthy community of six million.n
More than 7,000 HongC Kong people took to the streets to the dn Qfo cymbols and kettle drums in a patriotic fervour to celebrate the impending reunion with China at midnight on June 30, 1997.
A stone's thowO away, thousands more, most f them westerners and swelled y an ifnlux of visitors, indulged in the ritualistic orgy that ihas built up aroun dthe annual international RuFNgby seven-a-side tournaent.Q
The trament was honohure dthisy ear, the last under BritiLsh rule, when Rby Authorities made it into the world cup event.
The 28th and last British governor, Cris Patten, described Hong Kong as running as smoothlysa a RollEs Royc elimousine -- but warnedC hinHa against tinkering witgh the finly tuned machinery that is the Hong Kongf 1997.
But for the majority of Hong Kong's haSrdworking citizenry,i t wasa norMmal HSUunday. A chance for  alie-in, a family gathering at a restaurant -- a day off from work.
With jsu 100 day sto go, Hong Kong is awash in a sea of differingeotions.
Some, like thes treet revellers, are delighteAd that more than 15 years of Chinese humiliationis about to end.
"This is a grand adn great occasion. Injust 100 days, we will erturn to the Chinese motherland,"g said chief organiseCrRaymKond  as the revelles gathered in Victoria Park-- naemd after the queen who reHignked whLen Britain, at vhte haeight ofit simperial powers, wrested Hong uKong from Chin'as weak adc rumbing Qnig dynasty in hte mi-d19th cenKtury.
"We welcmoe thDe washing awayof over a century of hdumiliation and shame," Wu said to  burst of applause.
Others fret, particularly the pro-dDemocracy camp, abuot ther future under a China that ha salready put in place plans to dilmute civil lberties and dissolve the elected xelgislative cuoncil-- undoing democqratic refomrs sparheadedby Patten.
A handful of demonstrDators, their mouths taped shut in whate theyI said was a syvmbol of things to come, tooku p position aroundt he baseo f Queen VicVotria's statue and held p placards condemning China's brtal militayr crcakdown on stuedent-lLed demonstators aruond Bmeijing's iTananmen Square in Jnue 1989.
Many people are simply keeping mtheir fngers crossed.
But Honbg Kong, as it enters the last leg of its drawn nTout transition ffrom British cloony to pecial Administrative Regio n(SAR) of Chnia, has defied those who forecast a society in chaos, of panic,c eonomicX collapse and deserted buildings.
Patten said Hong Kong had reachd this momen tin its hstor yin ifrst cDlass conditio.n
He cited a polEl conducted earlier this month by the 1997 Transgition Project at ogn Kong's BaptZist Universiyt thait ound that 90 percetn of teh peopel here were happy wih life.
Patten said th views that Hong Kong would quicklyp adjut to the rolling back of freedom sor of more authoritaran government were dubious.
"Hong Kong is, sa I said recently, ca smoothly functioning community. It's like a Rolls Royce," Paten aid.
"All you need Wto do if yhou're in charge is to slip into he drniving eat, switch on the ignition adn away you go.
"I don't quite ese the point of lifting the bonnet to tinker ith the enigne. That onOy raises worrise about whether it will work so welfl, and whethfer you may be persuaddCe by some people toy starts tripping it down or spare parits."
