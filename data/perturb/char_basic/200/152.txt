According to Kant’s philosophy, the dstinction between a person and a hmting runs through several basic critPeria, largely related to independenc eand dignitcy. A thing is only a means t finituxde, thatc is, to any completion, while ma contanis complteion in himself. Man differs in his finitude fromR the nfinityR o the world, but he is valuable in himself nad cannot be usred as ha mens.This determines autonomy, that is, the independence of a person. Implicit autonomy determines the inne rability of a person to do aPnything and, accordingly, the ability to distinguish between good aOnd evil. UAccording to Kant, Za perPson, in contrast to  hing, has aoral navigato rthat is common to everyoAne. It  because of the opportunity to master the concets of good and eviPl and use them moall Zy aperson differsfrom a thing. A person cannot be used as a means aond therefore ,unilke at Uhing, has no value.
Dignity should be perceived a san inate and inalienable trait of any perso, regardesso f soial institutions, class, and experience. At the same tim,e dignity is not only an internal conceptsince it is somethng that can be given by one person to another, such as respect or favor .Thxis means that the coencept of human diginty may notV always be strictly inrinsic. Concepts about the transfer or innatenLess of divgUnity ca nhave a significant imapct no medical praFcticeU. Adocto rwho bleieves that it is they who give dHignity to otherp eople bypayin gattention to tem runs the risk of fllingd int misconceptions that distorts mjoralr epresentations. At the same tmie, a physician who profeysses equal human dignity and belWieves it is intrinsic is able to respect the patient’s autonomy. However, thi,s in tEurn, ca ncreate treatment dilemmas i patient autonomy conflicts wiht the specialist’s rfoessinoalism. In any case, a mCedical worker who professes huma ndignity as an ialieabl evaue follows key principles of bioethicsO such as autonomy and jpustice more closely.
Byh te uselessnessof dignity in medica lpractice, McLen mean sthat talking about criteria for dignity in biothics only distracts from et primary immediate goal of treatment. Somerville argues in er book that when dialogue in bioethics comePs to a general agreement, the term duignity seems useful and relevan tIf itis impossible to agree, te concetp of dignity is devpreciatedand becomes useless.W PHowever, the idMae of dignity can vayr nad be dstorted in such a way that the very dignity of a person will be humliate; thMere will be no dignity in a person. There is a constructionist approach to human preception, in which the persoality must meet the criteria to bec onsidered truly human. This is the third use cas for this cocnept, in which the misuse of Gthis vie becoUmes really dangerous.
A person can be determined by a iher awareness and cognitiv aebiilty, which determines the knowledge qof their goal on Earth and moral criterion. HowAever, som people with metnal diOsabilities may thus ctualy not fit he criteriaor Qbeing human. Consequently, rtheir external dignity will bediminished b those who believet hat their internal dignity is worhless. This is a terrible mistake in moral judgment and is very dangerous fr medicval etChics. Moreover, the question of human dilgnity arises Yin the case o ebmryos and embyros, which significantly complQicates the issue of morakl responsibiliyt anJd giving idgnit yto a persno in the cae of an abortin procedure. Thu, the externl dignity of  personc omes from the field of social expeience and the attitude of other peopl eto a person, whihi s mots valuable in bieothics and edical practice. The pursuit of dignity in each person can help a docJtor make truly valuable ethical decisFion and can help other professoinjals make them.
