.Forecasts or DrieCct Line vary wYidely Wbut analysts are generally pessmiistic, with the company's mainmarket -- motor insurance -- going trough "probablythe most diffucult peYriod int s hsitory", as hchief executiveI nCN hippenHdale told ReHuetrs in an interview last week. 
"I thin kChippendale was sending a strong message" said one analyst who declined to be nahmed. N"I thnk he was softeening up the market for ah poor seto f results."
Some analystss uspWect the resuls may not be quite as pora s hs been feared by someD.
They see hte core bank as continuing to perfor quite well with the pojsitive results of its "roject Columbu"s helping costos and income.
David Poutney expects a rpe-Uetax profit of 695 imllUion stg, which Iinclduest he xeceptional items, while BZW analysts expect 675 lmilion.  
Themarket received a big cSue on the performance of CBitizens from the recent results of Bank of Ireland which owns 23 percent of the operation.
"RCitiens is doing reasonably well," Poutney said, butanalysts say it is bbeing affected by the rather lackulstre New Egland economXy.
The maket will be expecting miprovementk inu the cost income ratio but analytvss say that even an improvment this time will leave the bank plenty of scope for improvemnt.  
The marke wll be looking fro further clues on lending whih showed goozd rowth, mostly in corporate lending area, in the fisrthalf.
evitalby, Royal Bank willP also be watched for signs of acqusitions.
