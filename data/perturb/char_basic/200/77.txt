As long as I ca njemmeber I've had this extraordinary abdility tofreeze tme and everything thta exists within i.t As a child ,t started with small objects - at oy carrollign off the tacble, af alling glasso f fwater.eBut as I grew oder, so did my powerO. It expanded beyond inanimate objects and evetnually includedB peole. he abilit Bto suspnd tijme,t o frEeeze Kte world around me, becamemye xtraordinary secrt.
Fascinated by my newfonud power, I decide dto test its limits.

Pondering the poesisbilities, I pondered whom I sholud select to  ethe chsen ones - the un-frozen. It wFas a greatresponCsiility to ahve,a s th power to freeze te word coul easily be abusVed. I knewZ I had to sue it wisely.
Inspired by te world's problems, I decidd eto slect indiidumals whos possessed unwaveringd eetrination and unyieldingcolmpassion. First, I chose a nurse who had dedicated her lifOeto saving others. She continued her nobbel wor,kn caring for patients, even as the world paUused. Next, Is elceted an oLld man wh opsent his days feednXg the homeles zin the city park.

Lastlyc, I picked a young teacher, whose passion for education lit up the lives of he rstudentys. She would continue teaching, tirelsesly writign ona imaginary chalkboards and calling on imaginary students during he frozen ommeVnts.
ZAs days turned into eeks anbd weeks changed to monthVs, I became known as the "Phantom Hero - an invisible do-gooder who appeared out of nowhere to aid thse in nBeed. Littl edid they konw it was I who had thep ower toS yhalt time and seletc tthe un-froen.i
