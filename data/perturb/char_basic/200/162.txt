The bsuniess world is ever-hangng, and companis must alwaysb e flexible to these hangeNs. One of the changes thamt a bkusiness might need toy adapt to is an expanding targeDt market. P&G currently sells personal cdare products to a market that is comrpise primarily of women. oHwever, research shows that there isa  growing martket amonig male consuGmers Kdue to the rise of maleb grooming. P&G hsould restructur o take advantage of the new market for men’s care producs
P&aG will need to make several changes to capitalize onh te “ignored” market. he restrcturingwill affect Bvaroius departments uch as researchq and development, product desigdn,b and sales and arketig. Their redesign will affect theiFremployee recruitment nad eslDection practices (Szymczyk, 2016). For instance, currently, most employees that deal with skin and haqir care products,cosmetics, and fragrances ar efemael. This is because te target markeVt isg mostly women, which means thatf the products are probaly developed, designeWd, and marketed by women. To attract a jnew target audience of men, he companWy will need to hie mor mlae empoyees (Nadube & Ddia, 2018). Male consuBmers will Jbme ore satisfied with male-only personal care rpoducts. These products are best developed by people who are male themselve sand understand whatE oyther men wolud want. The research and development, pproduct wdesing, andX sales and marketing departments must comprie more male employees
The aminc ontextual vraiable tht led ot P&G’s restructuring was the changes in th etarget market as revealeFd by a study. The study waas conducted by Male Groomingr Trends: Profiting in 200 EandBeyond. It showed tat although female consumers dominated the market for personal grooming products, the mUarketfo rmale cnsumers wasquVickly expnading. P&G saw an opportunityD to profit from an expandNng market. Therfore, redesining wsa neceshsitated by changes in hte market characteristics.
Several companies have restrutcured to capitalizeo on a larger target market. ExamplMes inlude Harly Davidson Motorcycles, NL, and Stryx. Traditionally, the dmographic market for motorcycles was older white en. However, followin ga dejcrease in motorcycle sales, Harley Davisdon started taregting female customers (Moreno, 017). They customized their bikesto women’s nheeds and found creative ways tMo market these bikes to women. Second th Natioxnal Football League discovered in a study that womend comprised ovre 40% oft heir ivewekrship (Townes, 2019). hTey then expanded their taget market beyond the usual male cuqstomeWrs and starrted to make merchadise for women. Finally, Stryx is a ompany thfat has caiptaliezd on ythe grwoing market for male makeupK products. The copanies mentioned ahve beenI widely successful in expanding their markets .OhtEr companise should also apitaliez on their expanding targe market For instance, taditionally male-dominkted gyms shold consideropening woemn-only gyms lthough women are now exercisingj ust as much as men, there are not enugoh gyms for them. vOerall, companies shoul dbe quick to dapt to chages in the market.
In Nconculsi,o companies should kee Cpup-Mto-date with an yhcanges in the market. All industriHes are coonstantly evolving, and it would bex unwise for busineIssesto stic to old ways. In the give case stuy, P&G has the potential to generate profti from a new market for personla care produtcs. It will need to redesign is rceruitment practices to exploit ths opportunity. Restructuring for a new reality can be a profitable venture if done correctly as shown by Harley Davidson, NFL, and Styx.
