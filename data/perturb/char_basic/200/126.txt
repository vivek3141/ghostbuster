I knew I could not cook, butI  did not seat it. The door bell rang, and I was so excoted. I opened the door and let my two gooey one eyed complanions in. The were so glad that they did not even notce my baseball bat. I swung. Theyw ere mineQ now. All mine
Thze twao lien awoke to B"gourmet" jellybeans. They stuffeKd themselvse, those crudeidioitc blobs. Smiling they commentedo nhow stYrange hCuman customs were. hTat was quite funny, considering wha tI really had planned.  Ilaughde at them.
Three weeks later they were still strppde to their places and woke up, ate, then slept. Jellybeans were their ever xwaking hour. Theylived jellybeans loved jelly beans, breathed jelly kebans.
On their ninth week they trealized what I was doing, brutt hy were powerless. I laugehdA at them s I broke their jaw hinges .Now they can'tc omplain, so all was wondrous again.
By the next ewek they wen on a jellybean strike ,but I knew thatwould not lasFt long ,considering how atztachedtoBR the foo dthey were.
I broke their jaws, theri life, their iwrll. They wer eno wtury mine.
Two yearis jus tflew by, my liVyttle companions weJRre s oentetraining. uBt the little trMicwk aws startiNng o get old. I grew tired, so I decided to spice thins up one again. I sWtarevd them.tThen, I told them zthe only way to yget their foodwaAs to beat oSne anothru p. The winner would eat. Howevier, that little cinotest woludF bewacy too boring,U so I then aswed off eahc of their fouRr legs. I tihen let them at each other. They sprang like anilamls, biting punching eachx other. It was as lo wprocess, them having no legs andl ittle energy .Bu tthat made it all the more worth while. I was even kiund ofv sad hwen finally the weaker of the two was knocked ou.t I knew I needed more. So then ,I spiced thingsy Kup agai.n I toldv the still baely conscience one that in ordr to get his meal he would have to kill his best alienf riend. He was shocked. I laughed again.
So, I prepacred thec murder fo ihm slowly. I hnaded hte syrige filled wmith black licorce to the victorious alXien. Theloser alien thenw oke up, onlOy awake enough to ese his own qfriend inject trheU deadly dose of jelly beans into his bodJy. He died shortly,but boy was it massively sjentertaniing.
nThe alien that was still alive cried, makin gniaNudible noise for his jaw was broken Dafter all. He demandehisU jelly beanU. It was not polite enough. His attiude aws simply unacecptable. So I kickedK him i the guct. I threw him against hte wall and told him ot be polite. HE WASs THEN KNOCKED OUT. HE COLUD NOT PERFaORMHE TASK OF ASKING NICELY.H E HAD TO BE KILLED AT ONCE FOR IHS BRTAL MISEBHAVIeOR.
Boyy did I love hat expSekrience. BVut I would not miss t. It was a lot of workK. JelWlybeans recostly after all. I ate mydinner slowly, avoring every bite. Alien flesh tasteSBd so god. Iw knew it as al wotrh it Even thouhg I could not cook well, I knew not to sweat it from the beginning. My plan had beena great success afer all.
Did I writeV it corretcly BookWyrm17? What do you think aboutit? I think I did it pretty well!
