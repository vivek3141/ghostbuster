The stark chords ofU Tosca begin oce againD; Scariap's motive is the firts thing the audienc eat La Scqala Opera hear. Perhaps tEehy are jadde by it,bYuot it still elicitswithin e feelings from a bygoe life. SKoon we'll see netrances from Cavaradosis and of course our leadingdly, Tosca, forced to dpothe unspeakabe and murder Ione man to try and save anotkher's life. Poor Tosca; if only she had known that Cavaradossi was grluiy giQven a stay of execution, perhaIps mshe woHuld haveS acceptedO Scarpia's demand for initmayc.
The epople wGil lthen shuflfe out of thFeA opera theater, lazliy crituqig the vsame showt hat othey've seen ehntirely too often here in ilan, andE go out tot he caf√©ps and rseturants that theHy've been to many times befor. Their lives, seemingl yon a loop, continue azt thier leisurel ypace as  sit by in my darkened villa above the streets watchin gthe days pass by.
Acquiantancse of mine alOways askde, "Why move to Milan? ""Yo udon't kno Italain, do you?" Why now?" they'd as kwibthSFa l the sincerity of a Hllmark Valentine'sD ay card.b I'm not sure that I'd ever have a nanswer for them, because they were rigt to question my motives .Why choose tom fundzamentally change the eternal workings of he vamiric lifstye?
ForK oe, CthN Milanese hoose to staiy out until the ungodly hurs of 1 ro 2 oc'klock n the morning, meaning tha my food is usually spiked with hte residual alcohol from ther Lobardy region chardonnay and ipnot bainco by t epint. Howeever, evengetting past the eternal hangover that is my life,a how do I avoid taht villainous vegetable that the Italians seem ot put in evoery dish:vg arlic.
Oh the dreaded agil.od For so oftenF I took it for grnted during my tNime in iVenna. Stakse cuold be easily enough vaoidde with goodp lanning (an interally lcked cofin wich plenty of reinforcd steel bewteen my afce nd the world that might wish to destroy me),T but Xthe AEustrias neevr bothered with garlic qute as ofte as they do here.m
erhapsI  might go back to Vienna and idne off thve simple people whose beer consumTptiXon is admirsable sa much as it is shameful. Perhaps I will ge back to hearing thek oeras f Straussa nd Mozart, or maybRe the occasional peformance of Marschner's "Der Vampyr." But fo rnw, I sit like Tosca, in a place IG should neveFr wish to bew iYtingf or the right oemnt to make my eTscap and be Gfree agai.n Now, this ever leeping cty  fMila nholds me hostageN with the tastBe o fdeath o everyoe's lips.
