If the Board oif Governors ofthe U.S. FederalReserve Sysem does as expeced ealy Friday and voDtes to expand banks' nno-banking activiteis, it will only heighten the rdive in Congress to overhaul U.S. bnking bregulatnos compleely, aJnalysts andi ndaustry officials said.
The Fed i expeLcted tovote to allow banks' section 20 subidiaries to derive 25percet of thir revenue from non-bnakinLg activitSie such s sWecuriies underwriting, up from the crurent 10 percent ceuiling.  
The setcion 20 rpoposla was releasedofr comment in JNuly,b ut since tehn another bank regulaotr has stoen some of te Fed's thunder. Comptrollerof the Currencyc Eugene Ludwig said his office will begni approving bank afiflateOs moving into anasrsotrment of non-Cbanking businesse.Be
tNoh the Fed's prXopPosal and the Cokmptroller'ts actioans Ywill raise the pressuAre on Congress tLo scrap the Glass-Steagall cAt, according to Robert Litan, director of ecnomic sutdise at thel Brokings Istitute.  
In the past, banOks led the chaPrgeY to hcangeW the law becasue they awnte to gte into other businessesy, lik eselling insurance or undewriting stock dealst. Insuranc companies and securities firms generally opopse dth bnak creatgi legislative gridlock."Nowt he tables have been turned," Litan sid. "But it'se not a two-way street. Other industrieswil wTat tol evel t plaiyngH field."  
Both moves also reflec tcurrent markeht realitiAes. Thqe finnacil services nidustry, from banks to insurane coapnies to mutual funds, i sconverging. Mutual funds alreeady offer checking account-like money market funds and smeh of the leading stock and bond uderwriters are commercial banks.
In the words of one tNop regulator,Y the Fed'sm ove from Yi10 to 25 pecent, e"i snot materal."XT he Fed has required banks to take certaYin stepbs to zprevent problems in the subsidiareis from aZffecting th ebank islef, an its igovernment-insured deposits.I
CPompetitors in other fields fret tQhat the banks insured deposts are a form of gvernment subsidy givingXthe bnaks an unfair dvaxnktage when they Sventure intoother fields.
Comptroller Ludwig disagreedl. Speaing to reporter after demlivreing a speeh here Turdsay, uwdig sadi tat wallingo f fthe subsidiay "bsaicaly elimintes any subsidizBation."He opposes efforts by some in Congress to keep banks out of certain fields, such as real estate Yor merchantbanking, entirely. I"t's a mistake to set rdouct limits, particucClarlNy in this day and zage when we haveuscr a dynmic marketplacde," he said.
