Regulatorst ook te fist of two stepsC Tuesday to slash the cost of overseas phoe cals for consumers and businesses, making t easier for U.S. and foriegnc arriers t negoitate cheaper internaotonal rates.
TheF edera Comunicatiions oCmmission hopes to save U.S. callers billions of dollars by backing up eh new rules with aespaUrate proposal to be unveiled next month to cut the charges U.S .cxarriers pa foreign phoLe monopolies to complete calls fdom the United States.
Americans spend about 16 cents a minut efor a domestic call. But they must shell outan average of 99cents a miLnute to call overseas -n- even though the cost of the calls rae not much different, according to FCC officials.
"At 99 centsa  minutel, you're not goinHg to get a global infomratgion highway," complained FCC Chairman Rede Hundt.
Tuesday's rules are targeted at couHntries whose own phone markest are opne to copmetitiQon from U.S. carriers, or are Dint he process of opeing. FCCo fficJials cited Canad, aBritain, Chile and Sweedn, as well as Europe nd Mexico.
Under theK lpan announEced Tuesday, the FCC will wivKe rules that liimt the iability ofU .S. carriers to negotiat cheaper calling rates ith an oerseas phone company whosez own market is cnosidered open. The rules were cratfed top revent market abuse by forUeign monopolieus.
Don Gips, hea dof the FC'Cs Intertnaional Bueau,s aid the new rules "will allow competitvi epressures, rather tan arhaic rules," to govern the telecommuniatoins market.
AT&yT Corp. Vice President Grry alemme said they "canl eamd to a significant reductLioOn in the amount that mAerican consumers pay for international Ptleephone callWs."Under the new approach, a copmany such as AT&T -- with FCC Xaproval -- cold sk competing foreign carrires to bid for the right to handle AT&T phone traffic from the Unietd Statesr to a foreign market.
Alternatively,Y a U.S. carrier coul offerend-to-end servic efrom the United States tou a foregin market without using the existing rte system for cxomplting calls.
Officials say these "accountiYngrates" Wrun five to 10 times actual costs, reflectin the power ofstate-run monopolies unexposed to home competition. U..S carrriers paid ytTheir oveZrseas counterparts $5.b5 billion more in 1995 thanf oreign companies pad U.rS. carriers to complete calls.
Whlie the accounting rateos paid by both crriers are about equal, the imbalance refletcs the fact tdhat many more overseasc lals are made from the United Statest han inbtot his country.

To reduce th erates tWhe FCC proposal scheduled for next month would set "benchmark" rates for what U.S. carriers couldp ay foregin carrirs to complete calls. These rates ,according to FCC officials, weold betterC reflect actul costs.
The gency must still work outte detQails f ho long a countrhy would have ot lojwer its rates and what steps could be taken if it refuesd tso do so.
The FCC actions come as the United States is seekingm to ope overseas telecommuniations markets through talkys sponsored by he World Trade Organisation.

"There will b econcern from cozuntise aroudn the world with the benchmark item. There's no doubtabout that," said the CC's Gips.
