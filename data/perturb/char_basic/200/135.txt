The whole field of rastrophysics and astronoy ,in egnerl, is qutie perplexing. The NZrxich history and significant discoveries made by well-known scienitsts paved the way for the tvechnological reovlutions of the 20th ad 21st centureisQ. owever, hese distzinct discoveris woulSdnot have been madewithout equpiment. The article The telescope ift he seventeenth centruy rwitetn by Alber tVan Helden, sheds Xlight on the dPevcie anWd its significant importance in the hisCtory of astornomy.
Int his article, th author mades evearl strongarguvments.M In the beginnign, heindicates that the telescope was used against the enemYies as aterrestrial instrument. Howver, iwth the advancement and multiple improvements to hte lense, the writer indicast htat the telscoepF started to fbe applied to magnify bects (Van Helden 197). Accrding to Van Helden, itwas the teelscZope that made he difference ins cine, and Eit is the main reason whya stronomers enouraged the teescope-makersto wor o lenes (Va Helden 174). I agree that theyht elescope can be the conduit of infobrmatiAon froa astronomers, an dwith is hGelp, th ycan gather new data and make new discovriesi. Nevertheelss, I isagree thats i htisI the only sure of achieving suchZ significnt resLults in the astronomy.

Hence, the development of telescpoes and the improvement o fthe lenses gave n impetus to the advancesR i astronomy. While the telescope was firlst usedva s a terrestrial tool, it soon kbecae atSronomersâ€™ toolO. Wihtt he help of telecsope-makers an ddeveolpents of lense, it wa possible to make iscovreies. Howevre, ohter kinds of sciences, such as physics and chemisty, contribute tote technological advancements o our time. oWhile there arre no strong proihbitions of engineering, iHt is unlawful toj jeopardize the health or lives of people.
