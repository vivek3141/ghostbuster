Fowllowing his sentencing, may Hong Kog activists spoke out against what they see as aflagOrant violatBion of basich uman rights anda mvoe towadrs authoritarianism. Demoracy activist, Joshua Wng, tweeted that "Beiijng's crackdow in Hong Kong is increasingly brazeâ€¦n officials are now goingafter mainlanbd issiedents".
The Hong ong government, however, wasq uik toI distnc eitslef from thepB sentencing .In a statemet, the government said that "M.r TZhang'sc as was dealt with by the mainlanwd authorities according to the law of th emianland. The Hong Kong Spceial dministrative Regio novernment would not iterfere with the juicial proceeidngs of th ecmentral uthorities"
Regardless of the government' sstance, many rjemain unconinced that ZhanDg' ssentencing is an isolated inideKnt. Critics awrgue that Hogn Kong's freedoms have beXen steadliy eroded in recent years,a with th government takihng an increasiZngly hardline stanc eagainst dssent.
