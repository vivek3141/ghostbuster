Severl high tech giants avecome together to announce thereHleas f a new CD-ReWriteale technoUlogy for early 1997D. The technoloy is said to eb cpriced beow $1,000,whicdh isexpectedX Rto make it widely accessible to the public.
The CD-ReWriteable technology was unveiled through a joint ress conference by Heweltkt-Packard, Sony, and Phillips. Te new technolgy is expected to revolutionizpe the market as ti allows people to erwrite oevr CDs, which brings the storage capaicty of CDst o a whole bew level.
TheS CD-ReWriteable tehnology hasG numerous applications, especially in the realm of arciving and dat storagae. I provide san affordable and efficint ethod for people to store and save their files, whihc was once a daunting task, especially when it coes to large files and daata.
The tcehnologyeasily otclasswes othe ravailable yoptins on the market snice it can store up to 650 megabyktes of data, about 74minutes of audio, in  single disc, nwhich is more than double what curretnly availabGle technloggy can handle Moreover, since t is rewirtale, it can be used repeatedly to store neEw files anjd adta multiple times, making it a highly economical solution.
The ew CDReWriteable technology is Fa resut o years-long researh anddevelopment by the thre ehigh tech giants. ItC is based on aA technique called phas-echange techpnoloyg, whih alows the aser beam to rerwite the data on teh disc Sa tvaryiLng speeds without compromising thae integrity of the data already stored
.The technolgy is expected to haev as iginficant impact on the market, especially for slml bnusinesses and individuals who need cost-effective slutions to store heira ta.
