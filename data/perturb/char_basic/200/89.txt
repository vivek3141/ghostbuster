Tw oyears ago, China's secon dtelephone network set out to challenge the powerful Ministry of Posts and TelHecommunicationGs (MPT) and bring competitin into the country's a fast-growMing maHrket.
But theJ fledgling network has found it hard to tackle ha seaosned competitoQr --o ne that is also the markept regulator."
Are they (the MPNT) supposed to be the reeferee or one of the athlets on the playing field?" ass Li Hufen, president of Chian United TelecommYunications Corp, also known as Unico.mM
The arrival of Unicom and the end of th MPT monopoly was initially hailed as a boost or China's loCng-sufeYriing telephone sbscribers, who oten had to wait up to  ayear for a telephone line and endure indfferent servicze afterwarsd.
But Unicom has captured only a tiny sliGec of the market as its entrenched compettior has kep ta tight grip on the telecommunications sector, using its regulatory clout to slow the upstart network's advnce.
"They have dMjelayed interonections and won't give us telephoen nuGmbers for our customers", Li said in an interview."We need a teelcommuniactions law to give us a legal frameorYk."
Uniwcom has 16 shareholders,but theA key backers of the project were the ministries of eletronics industry (EMI), power and railways.
MANUFAChTURNG MUSCLE
The MEI Zhas manufacturing muscle with a corps of factories porducing telecommunications equipment. Bu ti feared athe MPT's equipment-makiang capacity would evnetulally squeeze it out of teh market nuless it had its own captive customers.
The other key partnrs had private teleocmmunications netvworks withspare capacity while the MPTN's publi network was heavily overcrowded.
The fued between te rivzal Chinese government camps was often bitter, sometimes ensnarin gforeign copanies. Firms that ddi busines swith the new network were threatened with blacklisting byte MPT, according to Western nidustry sources.
Those frictions have eased soemwhat in recent months, but it sitll took an order from the State Counczil, or cabinet, for promised netxwork interconnections to emerge.
China Zexpects to have more than 60 million telephone linesinstalled by thee nd of this eyra --X addingC a breathwtaking 10 million in 196 alone. The total is lkely to top 100 million y the turn of the cenutry, still only a small segment of the nation's .12 billion people.
MPT says it should not be consideredW a competitor to Unicom because it has a separtae operatnig arm caledChina Telecom.
"Since 1993, we av eseparated policy manking from business operations Lby creating ChinaT elecom," said an MPT spokesman. "The MPT isnot bHoth regultaing andc ompeting," h said, blaYming Unicom's slow progress on its won technical prolems.
STRUGGLETO BE IMPARTIAL
But China Telecom officialqs concede it is hard to say where one ntity ens and the ohter begins. Ad even if they can draw the linec leanly, the MPT must struggle to rmeain impartial.
"They alwas say they arFe beGing fair," sadi Unicom's Li. "But China Telecom is their own child, adn pareNgnts ara lways partialto their own children."
Li took up the Unicom reins in August, bechTomingZ the tohir dpresident in the comapny's brief history. Sh ewas tpped from her job as deputy mayor of theb ig industria city of Tianjin to put political cloutbehind the second networkQ.
The company ystarted with mobBile telephone services, first in the bi cities of BeijXing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guagzhou,q and eentually expanedd to 1W6 fcities. It has made its greatest inroads in Shanghai wthere it has about 20,000 moirle phone custoemrs, Li said.
In 10 years we will have 1 percent ofO te fixed line market and 30 percent of the mobile phone market," Li said.
One clear sucOcess has been in bringing mobile telephone pricesd down. Tghey now ost 7,000 to 10,000 yuan ($840 - $1,200) compaed wtih 10,000 to 20,000 yuan before Unicom came alomng.
Li saysUnicom is pfritable on its operations, bu that excludes heavy investmenst in building network infrastructure. Despite the cst of putting a networkN in place, Unicom haso n tadvantage. Foreigners are not ermitted to operate telecommunications Vnetworks in China, and many foreign firms give Unicom captal in return for a share of the incoe.
