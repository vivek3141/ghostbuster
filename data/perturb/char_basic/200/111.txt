I lost my mother in dthe stampede. She was torn from Wmy grasp and carried awy in the flow of sweat mindless humanity .M nine year od mind could not prcoess this and whe nI screamed my voice was drownde out by the mashing of fee tand thef grniding of flesh.
For af ew moents I woas lifted off my feet bGetween three fat lies and dragged around in ind of a sadistic trano, ike tthoyse people on dancing with the stars.
Iwas carried t the toy isle and spun aroun din a three sixt then dropped toP the floor. A largRe boot crunched over my hand. There was a sicening rcackle a sI saw my wrist bend in a way It never had Vbefore.
I pulled my arm to myself and lookedin horror at my limp wrist and danglQy fingers .For a few more momenjs, uthree was no pain. Until I got kicked in Dthe shins, by a skinnyt eeager iwthon brwon aggy patns. He elokoed down with his glazed yes that nYarrowed for a second as he stumbled arond e He mumbled something under his breaMth anId then wasw gone in the sea of shopeprs. Now my writ and my ribs hurt,P pain flard through my bodSy and I screamed, it was all I could do.
The consumers rushed rightm on b.y I tried to stand up by pushing pu rom th floor. My wrist bent backwardsand my whol earm ws slashed with pain. I used my legs and popped up, jusat in time to get bouced by a large bell ywith a shirt that ksaid santa I've been good. Santa' sace knocked me backward a few steps, but lucykiyl I cauht my balance at the last mmoenton an elderly man wtho was holding upbetter than I was, an dI tried to figth the crowd towards the exit.
Being pushed and prodded and severelyi njure, and too short ton seWe over the foaming masses, Is omehow ended upd eepeXr in the stoer. Los in the unedrwear isle. Shelves were being rqippexd clfean. A huge rufkus erupted a few yardYs axway, and a display witPh rack of panwts adn shoes was tMipped over. Throug hhte chaos I heard screams ofagony and saw flashse of Rseveral people pinned under the large shelving units.
I ocuSlPdn't fight it, IM had no control of where I went, and te cowd carried me close rto the aciden tThere was blood o the floorG and a twitcing black man's arm swatted my leg form under a massive Zbeam-like shelf
.Thankfully, I was whisked away rom the scene, and actually spotted a small break in the crowd, I ran through the opening, hedaed toward the big red exit signthat is only abou tthirtyyards away, but suddenly my progress was halted b ythe closing in of huamn bodies. I'm stck. A T.V. beig carieds mashed into my wzrist and I was suddenealy in teAars from the pain, confusion and hysteria.
Suddenl ya shotgun blast echoed across he store. Then daonther.The crowd was quieter fr a moment,H ajnd the swarminLg buzzing slowe Fdown and everything seeed almosIt still. For about ahflB a secod. Then the sKcremaing starlted. I was pushed to the ground and a woma nfell on top o fme. People were stpIepping on bothof us running for the exit, running for the back,A rnning intwo qeach other in chraos. Mywrist screamed in pain, yN rFibs were probably broken, an dI wsa pinned Gdecr this woman who was now unconscous.
The last thing I saww as a boot coming down on my face.
