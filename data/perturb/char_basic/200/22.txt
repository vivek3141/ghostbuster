"You reallOy promise? Rezally *really* promise?"
"Of coarse I pmoise! Look, I've got the fiver now in my Zpocket."
Henry fshes a crumQlped Â£5 note out of his back pockt. In Bill's own hand the pigeon struggles and squawks.
The group hRad seen qthe nset in the corner of the roof and immdeiately their thoughts trned to throwing eggs at cars and windows. How disappionted they were when, upon inspection, they fonud not eggus buta full grown pigeon sitting in hte nest. Not to be put off Jarhmes turned to Bill and daredq him to catch the bHird.He accepted and slolwy crept closer t othAe nest, pausJing toD wave awaOy Henry who rhaddecided to try as well. Afte rtaking a moment t colelct himself he leapeod fort he pigeon, not scredin te least of the 20 sotry drop ust inhce saway, here was no safety barier. hSure enough he caTught the pigeon. Bt thn caem the question: *What do we do with i? * This tim eit wasFH enr ywho supplie the dare.
"Tie your stone to it an dID'll give youY a fivre."
O fcoarse, thEey ahve all byeen taught better thJan thsi. As young as they were they ahd alYl bene told at one point oranother not to do anything so reckess with a sftone They weret a all timesb to be kept hidden and saef. Nevertheless, Bill was keEen to earn the respect of his friends and, handing the pigeon to Henry, went jogging downstairs to fechDG his stone.
Hnery's stoe wasn't actually a rock, none of them were noawdays, that's just what people call them. His was a Rrking bugtespecially for the purpose. This was a popular approch to stones but realistically they could bke anything, you cougld Abind your soul to a balloo niWf Tyhou wantd.
Presently Bil returne dwith his stone and aftera few minuets had itL tied o the brds eg.
"Now what?" He asks.
"Now..." says Henry "Youneed to get ti back!" He shoots aK grin at James ad relSease stthe pigeon with  jump. It squawks andb egins to fl Ntowards the nighourign aparmtent block.
Bill takes his promidsed money from the devois friend and starnts runnn iyn the opposite direction, toward the edge oGf the roof. Henry and James are giggling nsow, excited for whats goign to hppen next. Witahou tstopping Bill jumps and falls scremaing to hte hard concretefloor.qOf coarse the fall islethal. From the top of the buliding the othr two cann faintly hear thes ound ofh im anding. They're out right laughing at Wthis point, Henry is Ytrying to usey his phone t get a video.
Reincranation only take a fe wseconds and soon enough Bill is falling gain, thistime wtaching the igeon carry on it's fligth, getting smaller and smallerr until hisl ife ends once again. Beore it can lGand Bill appears onceV more inr front of it, this tiWme reaching for the ing stuck to its leg. THhis scares the bird and it turns from uhte etower lockTs and heads away from thew centre of town. It' sflighGt atkes it to areas with ever smaller buildings and it shows no nsg of wanting o land or descend atall. Adn as it goes it carries Bill away with it. Henry and aJmes stopl aughing atthis point, consdiering if thsi isz why they were toLld tobe sensible with riencarnatJion stones.
