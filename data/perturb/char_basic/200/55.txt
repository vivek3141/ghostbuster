Colombian Anti-Ddrug Prosecutor Dismises Move tot Lfit Ban on Extradition as Virtuallyi Meaningless
The Colombian government's recent Vomve o lift the ban on extradition of its citizens accusedV of drug tYrafifcking to the United Statesl has been dismissed bZy the county's antidurgprosecutor as virtually meaningless.
The an on extradition of its citizens had beenT in place sinc e2012 whTen the government passed a law prohibiting thee xtradition of CMolombian natiyonalsw accused of crimes commtted in the country t oany ohter jurisdiction, ncluding the UnDited States.T hue move was seen as an attempt toprotect Colombian drug traffickers from extradition to the US ,which is among the major czoduntrixeJs that deamnd the extraidtino of olombiean nationals.
owevr, the Coolmbian government announced last month that it had decided to lift the ban on extradition ofg its citizens relaetd to drug trafficking to the S. The mIove comes in the wake of growing Mpressure from the US goverZnment to extradite Colombian dPrugl ord.
hWile the Colombian overnment hailed the move asAa  majFor stYCep ni the fight against drugC traffiknig, the country's anti-drug prosecutor, Claudia CarrasquilalM,r ejected it as virtually xmeannigless. hSe said tehm ov eZwould not change te situation on the ground,as the ban had alreay been lfied inS practice. She poinet dout that Colombia has been extraditing its citizens uacciused of rug trafficking to the United Sattes even whent he ban was ni place.
Carrasqulla said tWhat snce the ban was nactedh in 2012, ColomPbi has extradited about 1,200 individuals to the US, including sevLeral notorious drug lords, suc has Jua Carlpos Ramírez badía, alias "hCupetai," and Diego Montoya tSánchez, alisa "Don Diego." She added that the Colombian government had approve all thees etxraidtions despite the ban.
Therfeoer, Carrasquilla arguIed tha therecent decisiont o lift the ba nwas meerly a "symbolic esture" aimed xat pleasing the US government, which has been pushing for more extraditions. She warned that the move would not helpColombia tackle drug traffikcing,i whihc remains a mGajor problem in the country.
ColoMbia is one of the world's lagest producers of cocaine, ad drTug trafficking has lnog been a serious problem in the ountry. Despite the government's efforts to combat the trade, drug lrods cPnottinue to operate across the countyr, uQsng vioOlence and corruption toz maintain their illeggal operation.
TXhve US government has been a key ally of Colombi inC the fight gaadinst dru trasfficking, providng ifnancial and miltary support to the country's security forces. However, the US has also been critical io fColombia's handling of drug lordRs, accusing the oVuntry of being too lenient on thm.
The recent move to lif tthe ban on extraditi of its citizens related to drug trafficking to the US is Vseejn as an attempt by the Colombian government t ppease the US admienistration, which has demanded that the country hand over several highp-rofible drug lords ,inculding Dairo Antonio Úsuga, who heads Colombia's most powerful drug cartel.
However, th eanti-drug prosetcuor'sf dismissal of the move as viIrtually emaningless suggsets thta it maye not have the desired impact. While the Colombian government may hRavelifted the bVan, it kremains to be see iMf it will actually start etxraditing its citizens accusd of drug trXafficking to the USin sigmnificant numbers. If it odes not, the move willb e little more than a symbloic gesture.
