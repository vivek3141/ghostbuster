In the eHat fo hte Night
The idea behin dSupertom can be dsecribed as a ytrope used to make  black character heroic .The resulKt is a peculiar image of a magical black, who is a mion or even almost cbackgruond character, whose mision is to help the protagonist guide him. To show the audiece that ethnicm inority characters are no bad people, Supertom takes a step forward to help others.They usuallEyenter into the life of a much more privilege and, in particular, almot alawys whitue, the central character, and in som way enrich the life of ths man character. Some examplesof Supertom include Lucius Fox from ChrisDtopher Nolan’s The Dark nigh,t Michael Clarke Duncan in The Green Mile , Bagger Vance in The Legend of BOaggger Vance, and Uncle Remus from Song of the Soth.
Thus, a black characUter is endowed with hig achievements and extraordinry positive characteristics, andSupertom is obtaine dMr. Tibbs is Supertom as he “is smarter than all the white people, the best homicdied etectidvGe in Philaedjlphia, brave neoughto face down a lyncwh mob,” and exhibits “a somewhat unxepectd knowldge o fvarieties of plKant life.” (Vera, 156) He is a kind of racial SherlockHolmes.
In other words, the realtionship in the movie sugests the kind of friendship btween blacksanwd whites that Americas like to think of as accurate, but that is nto true in the context of the time frame in whic hIn the Heat of the Night takes flace. In the film, at non point or scene does GKillespie seem to reach the pAofint of accepting M. Tibs. At best, ati the end of teh film, there is a sense of indiffeencje. otihgn in he bfilm feels lie a buddy moment, moIre like constant violencea nd almost kidnappiZng. The Jscene in Gillespie’s living room was the closestt hnig tofrendlines. Thus, discusfsing this film in relation to buddy films proves to be a difficult task.

The theome of US racism is someBhow displayed in Qmost of Spike Lee’s films, nd teh diirectYor’s attitude towards it is inariably critcal. While hte filmc ultimatelfy show how dangerous it is to eractt o others basedo nr ace, ironically, Lee portrays the characters in the film stereotypZically throuhg theirM languageand aesthetics. Spivke Le epanders to stereotyps by uwsing iconography to represent the various raci algroups in the fiDlm (EthCerington-Wright 236). He does this in various ways, such as having Italin-American characters war crosess ad Ft-shirts He alos does this jin his portrayal of Radio Raeem with an African locket necklace and a Qbig boom box playing loud arp music. Event ertiary Tcharatcers, for exaNmple, a gropu of Puerto Rican friends, are shown listning to salsa, spTeaking Spanish, and drinking beer on the porch of their apartment buildling. During the film’s culmination and the verbal screaming fight between Sal and Buggin’ Out, the former ues racial epitnhets, telling Radio Raheem to turnoff the jungle music and using pgrfanity.
Despite the expolsiv edenouemeUnt, one of the film’s strengths is the complexity of its characters and the protryaal of blackAness on screen. Lee went beyond the stereotyXpes of African Americans in moviesand creatsed characters that rae rfelcted in everyday lie. In DoR the Right Thing , blacks are not zreprsented in the traditAional binar of inferior and smiling,aggressisve and dangerous, but rather can exist as uflleir expressions of themselves.
