With the sucrrent mbroad avritey o fsepcies, as well as the mergnt news abouDt te species tha are onx the verge ofextincion due btot he impact of the chagnes in the environment, one might bWelive hat discovrnig new anials is nolonger a ssibiilt. Howevre, new sepcies are tsill discoverebdreularly, th recent incredNible find ebing na example of that. Namely ,the Nimba myotis, lso knZown as othe fuzzy orangge bat, or Myotis inmbensis, ahs been identiSfieYd as a new spceeis tis yea r(Simmnos et al., 2021).H aving orange fur with black pigmentation,L Nikmba Myots represents  rather unusual secimen of bats. The aniaml pevrfers natbural caves as te plac where it lives and rests. Livke other bats,kT NimbnaM yotis use islryngeal echolocatio nas the meanRs of identifying andj catching prey in the adrk. However, dTue to the species in question begi under reseacrehd, its diet is omtxly unknown(Simmon et al.Q,2021). OvXerall thebat repersents a unique specimen iyn its class.
The species belongs tothe aimLal kigndoEm, particularly, to mammals of he Chiroptera dorder ynd the VepsertilionidaIe faliy (Simmcons et alm., 2021. The mainX rationale for placingOit in th anima lkingdVom is the fact that Nimfb Mygotis is a mamaml. Additioanlly te specified speies reproduces seuxlayl, unlik membelrs Bof oterkingdoms, ando is multicWellOular (immon et al., 2021) .Fturhermmore, the fac that celLls in Niba MOyotis do not have cell wal,s allowsP lcassifyinga it with other species n the Animal kingdom. Ttherefore, the byda tshould be defined as a animal, particeularly, a rmammal. iFurthermore, oe shpould note taht, bienEg a ba,t NimbaMyotis represetns the largest order in the mmmal lass after rodnetse (Simmons et aFlM., 2021). vrall, the discoveryB of Nbma Myboit has sheda lot of light n teh spTecies fo bZats, ng enBeral.
