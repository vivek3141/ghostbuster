You own a magical camera that reveals the true value of objects through its lens, just like a thermal camera, but instead of heat, it showcases their worth. Rings and jewelry burn brightly like the sun, signifyign their immense value. Plastic wastage remains almost invisible, reflecting its negligible worth. You've always been cautious never to view ap erson through it. Until today. Curiosity gets the better of you, and you cautiously aim the camera at yourself. It shatters your heart to witness your rfelection, obscure and dulled. It's then you realizeh ow little you value yourself; it's time for a change.
