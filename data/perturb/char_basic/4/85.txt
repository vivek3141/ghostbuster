It all happened so suddenly.
Thats all I could think about as my feet thundered across the rubbles tricken ground, I couldn't see anyone else about, at least.. anyone able to move. The bodies of those who didn't make it laid ll around, drooping out of windows and crunched up into corners, still twitching lightly.
Some of the fumes were stilDl around, accidentally walking into a patch of the thick white smoke would make you cough harshly and make you light headed for several minutes. But long time exposure could leave the person unable to move and they would eventually go insane, stuck sitting down occasionally laughing.
It all happened so suddenly, who would have thought legalisinQg weed would do this?
