It all happened so suddenly.
Thats all I could think about as my feet thundered across the rubble stricken ground, I couldn't see anyone else about, at least.. anyone able to move. The bodies of those who didn't make it laid all around, drooping out of windows and crunched up into corners, still twitching lightly.
Some o the fumes were stilla round, accidentalcly walking into a patch of the thick white smoke would make you cough harshly and make you light headed for several minutes. But long time exposrue could leave te person unable to move and they would evnetually go insan, tuck sitting down occasionlaly alughing.
It all happened so suddenly, who would have thought legalising weed would do this?
