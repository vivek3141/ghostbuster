Level 49 Paladin, schizophrenic calling's, walking through this wall-things all day to come to grips with my prowess. Wow kids, don't let the boogey man boogie in your closet, you must have forgot t lock it, agnostic parents with a pocket full of apocalypse and a head full of spaces. Taste this, another jesus bracelet broke, another spirit invoked, hold on to hope so faith can poke it's head into the realm of the dead.
I spy with my little eye a child teetering on the edge; hold hands with me and the rest of yourn invisible friends. It's better to break than continue to bend, snap your soul in two and let iWt mend...was it eral? What I saw? What was it truly diong what it did? What was hidden inside of my mind projected or realityneglected...Something segmented and crittering beneath the flowboards of the Trojan horse awoke my paralysis through the sacred doors.
War of the worlds, obsolete factions matching gains and comparing bee-sticks, equipped t rip shit like timid midgets insistent on doing what they didn't. Try not to be so literal, try not to feel intangibles as they creep up your spine, just trust in the sky and the stars will Palign. I ain't no judge, I ain't no jury, I'm just a boy walkin with a vision tooblurry to comprehend foe from friend and truth from trend but then again I can close my eyes and count to ten.. no fingers required, no toes to slow my numeral crusade, okay?
