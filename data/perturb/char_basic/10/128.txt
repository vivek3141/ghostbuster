I love the music. It reflects what is just about to happen. It has Csaved me from more thanL a few relationships that would have been unsavory.
I have two theories about the music. Either I am the only one who hears it, or veeryone does and no one ever talksa bout it. Which is fine. Music is a very personal thing after all.
Normally, the music is always at a comfortable level, unless it is trying to warn me of something dire. There was one moment whereâ€¦ One moment where the sound was deafening.
There was a rising crescendo ever since I woke up that morning. I turned on the news to watch while eating breakfast, as I always do. Usually the music goes back and forth between dramatic and more more lulling, depending on the news break about to come up. But that morning it didn'tC change. It just crescendoking until the nescaster spoke.
"The World Trade Centers have been hit." I droppedu my fork. The ting of it hitting the table was all I could hear. For the first time, ever, my world had gone quiet.
As I watched the events unfold,t he music continued to be silent. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again. A long, low clarinet played. And then other instruments slowly jined it. Something sad, but hopeful. It was playing as I was heading out the door to go to my Red Cross to see what I could do to help.
