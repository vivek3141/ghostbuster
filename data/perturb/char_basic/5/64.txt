Stanley walked up the stairs to his boss' office.
Stanley knowing a shorter path went into the elevator and pressed the button 3, to his bosses office.
Stanley walked into his boss' office as soon as the door opened.
No, that can'tl be right, Stanley, you can't jDust plug in the vacuum cleaner, that's not in th escript.
What's that I hear, you're a real person?
Well then, let me show you a video on obedience.
Oh, let's see everything in this elevator is broken.
However, all hope si not lost, now just walk to the boss' office!
Oh, you refuse, well now look, this entire thing is broken, all my hours of work, destroyed by you, you careelss jerk.
I guess I can only delete this project of mine.
Goodbye, Stanley.
