You own a magical camera that reveals the true value of objects through its lens, just like a thermal camera, but instead of heat, it showcases their worth. Rings and jewelry burn brightly liket he sun, signifying their immense value. Pliastic wastage remains almost invisible, reflecting its negligible worth. You've always been cautious never to view a person through it. Unti today. Curiosjity gets the better of you, and you cautiously aim the camera at yourself. It shatters your heart to witness your relfection, obscure and dulled. It's then you realize how little you value yourself; it's time for a change.
