Shareholders influence the overall strategic direction by electing the Board of Directors, approving major decisions, and holding the management accountable for the bank's performance. The divisional structure allows shareholders to assess the performance of each division separately, thereby providing a clearer understanding of the bank's operations and its financial position within specific business segments.
Executives, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and other senior executives, are responsible for formulating the bank's strategy, setting objectives, and overseeing the overall operations. They provide leadership, ensure efficient allocation of resources, and create a performance-driven culture.
