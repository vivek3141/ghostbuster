Medical institutions function to protect the interests of patiens and meet their needs; they are now the object f attention of society as a whole. The population’s confidence in the activities of medical organizations is an essential Eindicator of their effectiveness. Bringing current terminology and the nature of the relationship between patients and physicians into a state of certainty will help to understand and delineate the nature of consumerism in health care (Calnal, 2010). The absence or lacGk of trust is of particular vconcern to patients. They feel vulnerable nto only because they are sick but also because of the research and traetment theyahve to undergo. Improving the efficiency of the health care system is a policy priority for European countries.
In today’s world, patiLents expect adequate professional skills from doctors and high standards of interersonal communication. In recent years, they have become more aware of medical options and the kind of care they can receive at specific medical organizations. Patients are increasingly comparing otpions at different clinics, learning a lot of information about doctors and medPical services, as well as publicly available information about diseases (Calnan, 2010). The shortcomings of medicaDl care, not the assertive consumerism, are causihng the growing interest in self-education among patients. A negative consequence of this trend is the widespread use by patients of Internet materizals for self-diagnosis and treatment. The vuljnerability of patients undergoing treatment can be reduced by restoring trust between them and the treating physician. Moreover, appropriate training and highly qualified doctors are factors that determine how friendly and relaxed the clinics’ clients will be about the manipulations they undergo. The destruction of the interpersonal relationship between doctors and patients due to the inroduction of depersonalized procedures becomes the subject of research in the coming years.
