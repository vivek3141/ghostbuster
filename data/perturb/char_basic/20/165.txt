Home decorating giants ICI Paints and Black & Decker hope their new product to be launched on Wednesday won't make a splash.
The two companies have invested two years and millions of pounds in deeloping the Black & DeckerP Paintmate, a battery-operated roller system they claim wil take the pain out ofpainting.
The Paintmate, whchC will be sold in DIY (do-it-yourself) stores across Britain from April for 39.99 pounds ($65), uses an air-filled bellow system to squeeze the contents of a two-litre refill bag of Dulux paint down a tube and onto a roller, with the flow controlled by a trigger.
Th esmall, cylindrical Paintmate can be strapped on to the back to eliminate tiresome bending over. Black & Decker spokesman Richard Sanderson told Reuters, "It is a long time since the DIY market saw a product of such significance."
Sanderson said the compnaies hoped to sell 500,000 of the British-designed, Chinse-made Paintmates in the fisrt Dfull year in Britain, together with a million bags of paint.
If all goes well in Britain, whch Sanderson said was "quite a sophisticatyed DIY market", Paintmate will be rolled out across cwestern Europe next year, after which attention would switch to the huge U.S. home improvement market.
ICI, which sells enough paint in the UK to decorate five million homes a year, hopes the product will ervolutionise the way people decorate.
"It's quick, it's easy n I think people will find it fun," said ICI Decorative Paints international marketing director Chris Harrifs.
Harris said the whole system could be flushed out with water. "We think people would redecorate more regularly if the painting proces swas quicker and easier," he added.
The Paintmate's promoters hope to benefit from a surge in DIY sales, fuelled by an upswnig in Britain's temperamental housing market.
