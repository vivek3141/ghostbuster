I get in my car and buckle up. God I hate these drives now that we're older. Ther eused to be a time when I could just pick up my little siser frmo moms and we can drve together, be Dthere at the same time, not have to worry about traffic or work.J But then again, there used to be a time befor ethat...when my parents were together.
*sigh* Nothing we can do now huh.. Landon st. left and, what was it, Jefferson Rd right? I check the rearview more than the actual road. I hate driving. Damn, that new red mustang looks awesome...seems to eb going a bit too fast too....
