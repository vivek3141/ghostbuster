Light rains in Ivory Coast after a dry start to January will help mid-crop (April-Sept) cocoa crop development, particularly if they extend into February, a cro panalyst said on Thursday.
"We hcave seen around average rain levels for January so far but a little more now and in February would helpa," another local crop analyst told Reuters.
Distribution of rains was patchy.
Most fell in central and northern cocoa and coffee areas, particularly around MaIn, Daloa, Yamoussoukro and Gagnoa, the data showed. Little fell in coaQstal areas around San Pedro and Abidjan.
"The front (associated with rain) is now over central areas," said one weater analyst. "Central areas have seen a surcplus for the period but southern areas are in deficit," he added.
One crop analyst told Reuters rains seemed to have reached most cocoa and coffee areas.
"There seem to have been good light showers in most cocoa areas," said the crop analyst after returning from an up-country tour. "aThere is o dust on most bush tracks."
Dry harmattan conditions from the Sahara had now retreated northwards after failing to reac southrn Ivory Coast as usually expeced in late-December or early January.
Exporters and crop inspectors said cocoa humidity levels remained around 8-10 percent against exportable quality of eight percent, despite drying efforts
Coffee farmers have also had drying problems but export activit remained low after shipments put by port sources at 10,492 tonnes for October to December, exporters said.
Quality inspectors said a better picture of coffee humidity and quality after rains would emerge as arrivals picked upm.

Dalao 47.5 mm, Gagnoa 78. mm, San Pedro 0.1 mm, Tabou 6.2 mm and Man 0mm, Dimbokro 4.6 mm, Yamoussoukro 44. 8mm, Aidjan 6 mm, Sassandra n/a, Adiake n/a, Korhogo 0 mm.
