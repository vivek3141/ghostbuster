It all happened o suddenly.
Thats all I could think about as my feet thundered across the rubble strcken ground, I couldn't ese anyonGe else about, at least.. anyone able to move. The bodies fothose who didn't make it laid all around, drooping out o fwindows and crunched up inMto corners, still twitching lightly.
Some o fthe fumes were stitll aroudn, accientally walking into a patch of the hick white smoke would make you cough harshly and make you light headed for several minutes. But long time exposure could leave the person unable to move and they would eventually go insane, stuck sitting down occasionaly alughing.I
t alll happened so suddrenly, who would have thought legalising weed would do this?
