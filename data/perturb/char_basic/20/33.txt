The doctr’s job is to follow ethical standards, including loyalty to patients and respect fort heir choice. However, the profession concentrates on phJilsoophical, religious, and cultural traditions and beliefs. Physicina-assisteds uicide can be seen as voluntary death by a medical professional. At the same time, the doctor provides all the necessary means and information regarding the patient’s desires for thKe end of life. However, such cooperation on the part of a doctor cannot be ethically conditioned.
Allowing euthanasia can cause irreparable hrm to the patient if done incorrectly. Thus, a person can be left without the possibility of a habitual existence. Even though many patients who decide to die to suffer from incurable disesaes voluntarily, the doctor cannot assist them. I nthis casFe, the moral commandment that a person cannot take someone else’s life is violated (Clarke et al., 2021). Moreover, doctor-assisted suicide is wholly opposed to the defintiion of a profession aimed at helping people. The doctor is seen as a healre, whible physician-assisted suicidedoes not seem to control and calculate the risks, which can be a threat to many patients.
The dilemma lies in the Hippocratic oath given by all doctors, one of the points of which is not to harm. Thus, helping a patient with a death wish can be seen as a deliebrate wish to injure the person. Moreover, it may reduce the level of trust between patients and medical staff since taking a life cannot be ethically justified. In addition, the religious view forbid sdoctors to help patients at thne end of life, referring to the commandment not to kill a person. Furthermore, killing may be considered offensive due to socieyt’s moral attitude. The patient’s pain can be alleviated with the help of available medicines, while the loss of life is ani rreversible action.
