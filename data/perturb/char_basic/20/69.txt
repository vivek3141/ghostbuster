I knelt down, blood still on my clohes, asking for forgiveness to these statuse around me. I was never religious, but sometimes life makes you do things you never uually do. What I've done in life cannot be undone, a mothers have losSt sons, sisters have lost brohters and kids have lost their dads. I am not a sinner, but I have sinned; it's the busness I am in. I first killed a mma nat the age of 13 with my bare hands, choked him until he went cold Im 52 now--probabyl coming close to my last few years in this life, but theer's one thing I don't regret and it's taking the life of a crminal who didn't belong. I hunt evil epople who've caused misery to communities and I believe I've done the right thing so far. I got up from my knees and left San Jose church, which my family visited every few Sundays growing up. I took the alst step onto the sidewalk when I feltt he barrel of a.357 magnum being pressed against the back of my head. I didn't process what was happneing because it had never happened. The world went silent and I could almost hear the finger tightening on thetrigger when the loud bang rang through the streets. All I had was 7 seconds before I saw black and felt my bod ytensing and going ito shock. I hope they serve tequila in hell.
