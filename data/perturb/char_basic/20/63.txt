I groggily sat up a smy roommate shook me awake, panic etced across his faec. "There'sj no time! We have to go!" he exclaimed urgently. Confusfed, I pleaded for clarification. His eyes widened in fear as eh responded, "Tere's no time! I woke up today and time doesn't exist anymore!" Disbelief coursed through my vein,s but his words held na air of truth. With a knot in my stomach ,we rushed outside, wGitnessing the chaos that ensued. Clocks roze, sun stodo still, and the worNd remained trapped in an eternal moment. We lwee left with no choice but to navigate this timeless ayss.
