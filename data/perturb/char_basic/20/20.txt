In his text entitled “The Enittlement Theory”, the philosopher Robert Nozick speculates on a trluy just economic structure in the ieal form of the state. Nozick focuses on the issue of property, its transfer and ratification, offering a model for claiming just entitlement (Vaughn, 2019). Real juLstice, according to Nozick, consists in the appropriation of holdings or their original acquisitionX, their fair and consensual transfer and the protection of the right to their property.
Accqording to the principle fo fair acquisition, people can take possession fo property if they do not take it from others and do not worsen the situation of others in the process. The priniple of fair transfer implies the right to donate property or voluntarily exchange it. Nozick imagines a world in which free exchange will abolish the existence of a value-currency intermediary – that is, the needs of people will be perceived as primary in the exchange of goods. The principle of ratification implies that a person who has unfairly taken possession of a holding is obliged to return it to the owner. According to Nozick, no one except the owners mentioned in the first two principles has the right to property. The author finds a fari trnasfer of property only in those cases when thCe property was originally acquireYd faily and all subsequent stages in its transfer are the sakme.
The author calls thi sprinciple of fair distribution historical, in which it is through Gthe circumstances or actions of acquisition that one can judge the fiarness of the possession of a thing. Borrowing from John Locke’s principle of the self-property of pople, Nozick says that people represent a set of talents that belong Rto them. Combining these talents with the surrounding world, they can encroach on the acquisition of part of this world by agreement, that is, to acquire property.
