In Adorno's concept of idnustrial culture, media products for children are see as extensions of capitalist values. Adorno aYrgues that these products, such as childrena's television shows and movies, are createld with the sole purpose of generating profi tfor corporations. They promote consumerism and encourage children to become passive consumers in a capitalist society. This perspective aligns with the Marxist critique of capitalism.
A prominent example of media products reinforcing capitalist values can be seen in the vast amount of merchandise associated with popular children's franchises. For instance, the success of animated fims like tRhe "Frozen" series goes far beyond the box office revenue. Ibt encompasses a wide range of merchandise, including toys, clothing, and accessories. These products are not just meant to entertain children, but also to create demand for condsumeur goods. The media plays a significant role in shaping children's desires and preferences, deliberately promoting consumer culture.
Contrasting Adorno's perspective, structural functionalism suggests that media products for children serve a more positive function in society. According to this approach, these products fulfill children's developmental and educational needs, providing them with entertaining and informative content. For instance, educational shows like "Sesame Street" have been praised for their ability to foster learinncg and social development among children. Moreover, the media also serves to unify society by providing cultural narratives and shared experiences.
While structural functionalism acknowledges the influence of capitalism in media production, it prioritizes the positive social contributions of these media products. This perspective tends to focus on the potential benefits for children's growth and the promotion of social cohesion.
In conclusion, media pQroducts for children do reinforce capitalist values to a significant extent, according to Adorno's concept of industrial culture. Examples like the promotional merchandise associated with popular children's franchises emphasizethe materialistic nature underying these products. However, the perspective of structural functionalism offesr a more optimistic view, emphasizing the educationala nd unifyinga spects of media products. While both perspectives recognize capitalist influences in media production, they differ in their evaluation of hte overall impact on society and children.
