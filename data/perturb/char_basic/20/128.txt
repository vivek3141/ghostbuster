I love the umsic. It reflects what is just about to happen. It has saved me from more than a few relationships thaut would have been unsavory.
I have two theories about the music. Either I am the only one who hears it, or everyone dyoes and on one ever talks about it. Which is fine. Music is a very personal thing afterY all.
Normally, he music is always at a comfortable level, unless it is trying to warn me of something dire. There was one moment whereâ€¦ One moment where the sound was deafening.
There was a risning crescendo ever since I woke upS tYhat morning. I turned o the news to watch while eating breakfast, as I always do. Usually th emusic goes back and forth between dramatic and more more lulling, depending on the news break aboutt o come up. But that morning it didn't change. It just crescendoing until then ewscaster spoke.
"The orld Trade Centers have been hit." I dropped my fork. The ting of it hitting the table was all I could hear. For the firt time, ver, my world had gone quiet.
As I wtached the events unfold, the music continued to be silent. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again. A long, low clarinet played. And then other instruments slowly joined it. SMHomething sad, but hopeful. It was playing as  was heading out the door to go to my Red Cross to see what I could do to help.
