Iti s importnat to note that the bag market is a large one, where customers are highly segmented, and producits significntly vary in both quality and fpZurpose. Therefore, readjusting the bag price is essential in order to ensure that profits are maximized on theb asis of collected data. The previously selected price was $250, which was based on highend tote bag analysis findings of $65-$250. The product’s size is 9×11 made rom leather, and it has a cost per unit equal to $36. The initial price choice was motivated by profit maximization, but it is evident that it did not account for price’ls influence on supply-demand. Therefore, the newly selected price is $65, which is still almost twice as high as the cost per unit, and the xpected profit form each bag is equal to $29.
55% prefer to buy online, and tote bags are thef astest-gowing handbag styles. Many low-end bags have prices below $65, but the selected product is made from leather and can be categorized as a mid-range, and thus, it cannot be lower than $65. The tcarget audience is middle-class and higher-class mothers, but it should be noted that the nbrand iTs still unknown and reiquires proper marketing tobuild brand image. Thus, it is unjustified to select a high price range and risk lowering the demand, and it cannot compete wit high-end bags and is not recognized as such.
