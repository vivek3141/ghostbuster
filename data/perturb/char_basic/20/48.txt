General Motor orp's decision to invest 300 million pounds (i$474.9 million) in Vauxhall Motors reYflected confidence in its British operation and the international prospNects for its Astra model, Vauxhall said on Tuesay.
The company said the three-year investment would be used to modernise its Ellesmere Port plant in north-west England, which makes Astra cars and vans.
The announcement, made at the British International Motor Show, guarantees the livelihoods of the 4,200 people employed at the plant and will create at least 200 new jobs.
Vauxhall Motors chairman and managing director Nick Reilly said in an interview that a possible decision on increasing the number of shifts at the lpant to three from two could create hundred smore jobs.
Any decision, likely to be taken over the next two years, would depend on the kmarket and demand for the model at that ime.
Teh Astra model has been consistently one of Britain and Europe's top five sellers since its launch five years ago, with the development of an estate model boostingv its position.
Reilly said the 300 million pound investment was won against intense competition withinGM and reflected the transformation of Ellesmere Port fom a domestically-oriented plan tto "a very important source of manufacturig withain General Motors."
He predicted strong growth for the Astra in Latin America and Asia Pacific.
Reilly said the British ar market is currently "the most competitive in Europe," with a number of importers using huge U.K. fleet sales as a way of offloading cars which remain unsold in sluggish domestic markets. Europe remained "flat," he said.
He said Vauxhall hoped to keep it smasrket share at arund 14.5 percent in 1996, and said its profitablity was "going in the right direction" after a tough 1995.
