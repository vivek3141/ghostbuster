China's usually rubber stamp parliament failed on Monday ot pas an anti-corruption bill after the proposed law fell victim to fierce debate over whether it should specifically target government officials.
State media had reported heated discussion at the week-long session of the standing committee of the National People's Congress, or parliament, that closed on Monday.
Disputes among China's usually tae lawlmakers ranged from controversy surrounding the scpoe of the death penalty a scontained in proposed amendments of the criminal law to whether corrupt state managers should be executed.
The draft law on administrative supervision, which would target corruption and had been due to be adopted this week, was eventually withdrawn from voting, the Xinhua news agency said.
The law was withdrawn "because legislators sharply disagreed with the name of the law", it said, quoting paliament chairman Qiao Shi.
Some lawmakers believed the bill should be named the Law On Administrative Supervision in line with its regulation of the government.
However, they ran into opposition on constitutional grounds from legislators who argued it should be called simply the Law n Supervision, without reference to the administration, Xinhua said, but did not elaborate.
Qiao suggested the issue be put forward for a vote at the next standing committee sessionn in February, 1997.
Beijing Nhas launched repeated crackdowns on graft, which senior leaders have called a cancer that threaens the Communist Party's grip on power, but many Chines esay enforcement of anti-corruption measures at senior levels is patchy at best.
Debate had swirled around amendments to combat corruption, including more than 60 clauses that gwould specifically define draft and dreeliction of duty, while increasing to 32 from seven the types of officials subject to the law, state media said.
One suorce of contention was the designation of managers of state firms as government employees, whou are subject to a maximum penalty of death for corruption, it said.
One body of opinion held thatgovernment factory managers be defined as public servants since 75 percent of all official cases of corruption involved state enterprise managers.
Others argued this was unfair since managers of non-state firms faced a maximum of only 15 years in jail for graft.
All should be equal before the law, the newspaper quoted the criminal law as saying regarding the need to tackle corruption
The failure of the anti-corruption law to pass cadme as senior leaders considered whether to punish scandal-hit former Beijing Party boss Chen Xitong -- the highest-ranking victim of China's anti-corruption campaign -- for dereliction of duty.
Under the law, prosecutors would have the powers to investigate a suspect's bank account and ask the courts to freeze bank accounts of those suspected of graft, bribery and ebezzlement.
In the first 11 months of 1996, Chinese prosecutors had begun action in 77,611 cases of corruption, bribery and economic crme and had dealt with 33,879 cases, up year-on-year 9.4 percent, the media said.
Corruption was virtually wiped out in the years after the communists took over in 1949 but has staged a comeback after economic reforms were introduced 17 years ago.
