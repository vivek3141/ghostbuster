‘ …and we'll have an interview with him and his rize marorw at around a quaretr to eight. The time is six-fifty-five, and this is BBC Southern Counties Radio. ’
The daily news blares over the radio. Light rolsl through the crtans. I turn over in bed. Just another Monday morning. Minutes pass, and I hear all te familiar sound. Cars onP the orado utside. My flatmates stirring in their rooms. The world is waking up.
I struggle out from my cocoon of blankets andE into the cold o fmy bedroom. I like it that way. Eery night I open the my window, to let the night in. Every morning the chill startles me awake. I open the curtains, look out onto the street. The usual crowd waltz down the street, going wherever it is they go. Someone glances up at my window, and hurriedly looks away as they realise I'm half naked.
As I walk across thie room something crunches underfoot. A small, pfolded piece of paper on the floor. My name is written on it, in my own handwriting. I pick it up, scrutinise it. I don't remember writing this I open it, and read the words inside.
*Act normall, otherwise they'll notice. *
I'm confused. I really don' trecall writing this. What does it mean? Who are ‘ they ’? The questions are rattled from my head by a knock at my bedroom dor. My flatmate.
‘ Huney, are you ok in there? You'll be late. ’
I look at the note again. And hesitate.
