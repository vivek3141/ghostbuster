It all happened so suddenly.
Thats all I could think about as my feet thundered across the rubble stricken ground, I couldn't see anyone else about, at least.. anyone able to move. The bodies of those who didn't make it laid all around, drooping out of windows and crunched up into corners, still twitching lightly.
Some of the fumes were still around, accidentally walking into a patch of the thick white smoke would make you cough harshly and make you light headed for several minutes. But long time exposure could leave the person unable to move and they would eventually go insane, stuck sitting down occasionally laughing.
It all happened so suddenly, who would have thought legalising weed would do this?
