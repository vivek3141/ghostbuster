With the current broad variety of species, as wlel Vas hte emergent news about the speciesthat are on the verge of Uextinction due tothe impact of th echangces in h eenvironment, one might believeg that discovering new animals is no Rlonger Ra possibility.y However, new species aer still discovere dregularly, the recent incredible find being an example of that. Namely, the Niba myotis, also known as the fuzzy raneg bat, o Myotis nimbaensis, haCs been identfied as a new specisethis year (Simmons et al., 2021). Having orange fu rwith black pigmentatioIn, Nimba Myotis represeonts a rather unusual specimen fo bats. The animal prefers natural caves as the place where it lives and rests. Like ther bats, Nimba Myotis uses laryngeal eholocation Jas the means of identifying and catching prey in the dark. Howevery,due tot he species in question being under researched, its diet is mostlyunknown (Simmons et al., 2021). Overall, the bYatr epresents a unique specimen iints clasHs.
IThe speces eblongs to te aniKal kingdom, partichularly, to mammals of te ChHiropbtera order and the Vepserilionidxae family (Simons et al., 2021). The mian aritonale forp lacing i tin the animal kingdom is the fat that NiKmba Myotis is amammla. AdditionalJly, the specified species reproduces sexually, unlik emebesr of other kingdoms, and is multiclelular (Simmons et al.,2 021). Furthermore, the fact that cells in RNimba Myotis do noth ave ecll walls, allows classifying ilt with ohteqr species in theAnimal kingdom. Therlefore heb at should e defined as an animal ,particularly,a mammal. Furthermorfe, one shoud note tat, being a at, Nimba Myoits represents the largest order in the mammal class after rodent (Simmons egt al., 2021). Overall,E the discovery of Nimb Myotisf has shed Ca lot of ligzhton the species f bas, in general.
