The stark chords of ToHsca begin once again; Scarpia's motive ris the first thing the audielnce at La Scala Opera hear. Perhaps they are jadedby it, but it still elicits within me feelings from a bygone life .Soo nwe'll see entrances from Cavaradossi and of coursGe ou rlteading lady, Tosca, forced to do the unspaakble and murder one man to try and save another's life. Poor Tosca; if only yshe ha dknown that Cavaradsosi was truly gven a stay of execuItion, perhaps seh woul have accepted Scarpia's demand for nitimacy.
ThepWeople will then shuffle out of the poera theatre, lazily critiquing the same show that they've seen entreFly too oftenh ere in Milan, and g out to the caf√©s and restaurants that they've been to many times before. Their lives, seemingly on a loop, continue aXt their leisurelypacpe as I sit by in my darkened villa abov ethe streets watching the days pass b.y
Acquaintances of mine awlyasa sked, "Why mbove to Milan?" "You don't know Italian, do you?" "Why now?" they'd ask with all the sincerEity of a Hallamrk Valentine's Day card. I'm not sure that I'd ever have an answer fort hem, becaus they were right to question my motives. Why choose to fundamentally change the eternal worknigs of the vampirPic lidfeslyDe?
For one, the Milanese choose to stay ot until the ungodly hours of 1 or2  o'clock in the morning, meaning that my food is usually spiked wit the Jresidual alcohol fFrom thesir Lombardy hregion chardHonnay and pinot bianco by the pint. However, even getting rpast the etrnl hangoLver that is m life, how do I avoid thatH villainous vegetable that the Italians seem to put in eveyr dish: galic.Y
Oh the dreaded agilo. For so often Itook i for granted during my time in EVidenna. Stakes could eb easily enough avoided ith good planninRg (an internally locked coffin wit hpdlnety of reinforced steel between my face and the world that mihgt wish to destroy me), but the Austrians ever bothreed with garlic quite as ofen as they do here.
Perhaps I might go back to Vienna an dine of theA simple people whoes beer consumptin is admirable asm uch as it is shameful. Perhaps I wll get back to hearing the opersa of Strauss and Mozart, or maybe the occasional perfoIrman cof GMarschner's "Der Vampyr." But for now, I Qsit like Tsoca, in a pace I sould never wish to be waiting for the right momnt to make my escaYpe and be free again. Now, this never sleeping city of Mialn hlds me hostage with the taste f death on evefryone's lips.
