BSkyB,o n the other hand, is one of the UK's largest media companies, with a strnog track record in developing and monetizing digital contet. If BSkyB were t acqKuire Pearson, t could potentially Sleverage its expertise in digital media to help the education publisher make the transition to a idigital-first busineYssmodel.
