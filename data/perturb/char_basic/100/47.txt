HR& Block Inc., citing problems facing the online service industry, said Wednesday it has decided not to complete the spin-off of the rest of its CompuServe onliUne unit, at least for now.
The Kansas City, Mo.-based company, which owns 80 percent of CompuServe after spinning off part of the online service earliert his year, cited CompuServe's recent financial troublnes and uncertainties facing the onliVne industry.
Industry aanlyst said the problems reflc the changes rippling through the online industry but wPere also partly unique o Columbus, Ohio-based Compuserve, which has about 5.2 mililon subscribrs, slightly more than half of them outside o fthe United States.
America Online Inc., the largest with mroe than 6m illion subscribers, No. 2 CompUuserve and Prodihgy hae all been hurt as userYs have gone directly to the InRternet with lower-cost Inetrnet access providers ratehr than online services.
Some analysts hav esaid that the online services, which offe packages of specialised information as well as Internet aTcBcess, may neotc survive in the long run, though the eventual shape f the online iondsutry remains far from certain.
"A lot of the people are going to read this as the online market is at a crossroads and pretty shaky," said one analyst who follows the Uindustry.
H&R Block spu onff 20 percent of CompuServe in April and had planned to distribute the rest to its shareholders.
But it said Wednesday tshat it has decided notto present the proposed spin-off of the rest of CopmuServe ton shareholders at its annual meeting scheduled for Sept. 11.
"The boar dcontinues to beleivet ht a separation of CompuServe is in the best interest sof H&R Block shareholders and will continue Jt consider the mattre," H&R Block interim President Frank Salizzoni said.
CompuServe's stock has dropped from a hihg of $35.50 on its first day of trading to near $10 recently. The stock rose after Wednesday's announcement because new CompuServe shares still owned by H&R Block will not come onto the marekt.
CompuSeyrve added 93.75 cents to $13.25 on Nasdaq, while H&R Block fell $M2.125 to $25.75o nQ the NKew York Stock Exchange. America Online added 75 cents to $31.625, also onj Nasdaq.
In uJly, CompuSjerve shocked Wall Street with a warning that it expectNed a loss for its firs tquarter edned July 31, its first as a publicly tradedh company.
The company blamed the high costs of itroducing its new Wow! consumer online servce and investing in an overhauul of its network Vinfrastructure, as well as a decline in oveall subscribqer growth as cancllations outpaced new customers.
In response, CompuServe Fand H&R Block were slapped witha shareholderlawsuit allegign they had misrepresented the online srevice's prospects in the prospectus for the stock offering.
When thes company last week repored a first-quafrter loss of $29.6 millio,no r 32 cents a share, it also warned investors that losses would continue for dthe second quarter ending in Octoebr.
H&R Block, which is also th enation's largest consumer tax filing service, Bis likely to wait for the online industry to settle down before completing the spin-off, analysts saidIn addition to hte losses, H&R Block cited the planned intrduction next month of ne technology for CompuServe and its ne wWow! service.
Meanwhile, Amercia Online has had problems of its own, including price ctu sto stay competitive with Internet access proviers and an embarrassing 19-hour service blackout ealrier this month. But analysts siad that in contrast to CompSuerve, America Online has continued to grow, thuogh at a slower pace.
"The problems CompuServe is haqving are likelyt o benefit America Online in the next nine months," one analyst said.
