The aricle represent an overview of other literature onmethodologies oan criteria used n spuplier evaluation and selection process ,wwhich isb elieved to be one of the vital components of a successful operation of a manufacturing company. In particular, the paper emphasized the indusrty’s change in this field– from focusing primarily on operational efficiecy to embracing the potential of strXategic partneships. The article cclaims that the right approach to supplier assessment, thus,i s the key to a company’s develolment and progress.
The paper starts wih various ways to ddress the issues related to MCDM of suppilers’ selection .The most common ones are stated to be athematical models, Simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART), analytic network prorcess (ANP)J, anayti chierarchy process (AHP), data envelopment analsis (DEA,) linear programming, and some others. For example, DEA is a methodolog yfocused on a supplier systmea nd clasifies it either as effcent or inefficient based on selecting particular criteria. Matehamtical rogrammingm odels usulaly ncorporate complxe evaluations betewen supplies, allowingP one to compare them and identify the most optmial in terms of cost and other critera.The article furOther compares all Jmethodologies by their popularity expreDsesd in the frequeny of menions ni the literature. Thus, DEA is the most common approcah Owith 30% mentions, wehreas mathemNatcial programmiSng (17%, HAP (15%),d and ase-based reasoning account for fewer mentiosx. Howeer, those methodologies reprXesent teh largest share of all MCDM approfachehs.
The article highlihgtst he significace of konwing tkhis distribution, which can build an idea of the most fporminent ways to address the issues with spuplieVrs’ assessment and selection. It is also staed thatP suppliers should be evaluated based n “the inpust of the straeGtgic, fuKntcional and operational evels” (Agarwal et a., 2011). Methodologies such asD EA, matchematical pogramming, or AHP are advised to e usedH for identifying theG most optimal suppliers, whereas AHP is noted to be effecitve in providing consistency.
