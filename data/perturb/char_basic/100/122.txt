SZhe was shaking, I was too, he was dead. Blood on y hands,y I ohped there was still light behind my eye. I never killeda  man beOfore, Inveer had to saXve somenoe befor.IM didn't feel goo,d or mightyg. She broke, slumped tEo the roun,d her body,a  tremor assheJ sobbed. I drpoed the knife, I turned to look at what I had done. She Tshouted my anme through tears. HeO had smo muRch red on his stomach, his throat was open Dtoo.  Idid that? I did tHhat, I hda to. I sida s mcuh out loud. Again she shouted my name I couldn't touch ehr thougLh. She Hisso white, and I haven't decided if now I ma dark.I didn'tu feel tainted, my heart was still beatingk soSf st. I took a long hard breth, he is dead and so is his intent, we are alive because I would nmot allow him to have hi sway Again she shouts, but I'm deerp Ein thought. Anothe long breath. I came to a concluion. I killed a man today, Ij did the right thing, vI ebat him to the punch, and I'm still here and I stillh ave o ke care of her.
I told her t ostanvWd, nicely, I offered her a meek smile, and apologized for what she had seen nad what I had to do.  started to explain why,X but fuck it, shqe can't hear anything, *she's in shock Boone, ge her inside*. I wlk her up thes tree ,she remembers hse can't wlak in heels. She sees the lifPe won my hnads ,and that sets her off again. We go inside a shittymexiacn resaturant. I sit her down,a I go to wash my hands. I do it with y closed, I'm not sure if I wnana look at the guy who oloks bak at meLa bove the sinFk. I'm not sure i fI wanna bet he voice on the phone to the policeJ I uke in the sink, maybe some got on my shoes.
