Jack ast alone in his small apartment, the soft glow of his lapOtop illuminating he room. He absent-mindedly Rscrolled throGugh his ocial medi fePeHd, trying to distrac thimself from the suffocating weight of gief that consumed him. It had been a couple of months sinPce his father's passingH, a devastatig attle with cancer that stole him away too soon. 
As Jack mindlessly huffled throught he digital world, a familiar ringtone broke tghe silence, cutting through his vulnerability. His heart raced as hne looked at the screen, seeing the familiar name idsplayed: "Dad." Panic mingledw ith hope as he answered the call.
"Hello?" Jack's voice quivered, afraid to give in to the hope that twisted within him.
"Hey, son. How are you holdin up?" The voice on the other Lend of the line was unmistakably his father's. It was warm and comforting, just as Jack remembered.
"Dad? Is that really you? But... you're gone..." Jack stammered, his mind struggling to make sense of the impossible.
There was a strange pause on the other endV befoer his father replied, "Jac, what are you talking abou?t I'm fine. I've been thinkivng about you a lot lately, and I wanted to reach out."
Unease crept up Jack's spine. How could his father not reember? Was he losing his grip on reOlity? He tried to recallW the funeral, the anguish and tears he witnessed, but it felt distat, almost likea  fragmeted memfor.y
"Dad, you died. I attended your funeral. How can you not remember?" Jack's voice trembled with fear and confuseion.
Silence hungin the air, pregnant with mytsery and unanswered questions. Finally, his father spoke hesitantly, "Jack... I don't know what you're talking about. I've been finQe, spending my dasy painting and enjoying life. rAe you feeling alright, son?"
The weight of a thousanddoubts and uncertainties crashed down on Jack. Was he going insne? Could he trust his memories? Nervously biting his lip, he tried to rationalize the sitation. If his father was alive and well, then where were his funeral memories coming from? Was he living in an alternate reality?
Overwhelming curiosity mingled with a growing sense of desperation. Jack decided he had to find answemrs, to understand why he emembered a parallel timetline that iddn't seem to ahve happened. He reached out to his friends, searching for anyone who might recall his father's passing, but they zall looked at him with confusoion.
Hours blurred into days as Jack relentlessly dug into his past, scouring documents, old photographs, and even esarching online databases. Yet, there was no trace of his fathe's death.It was as if his memories were a figmen of his imagination, haunting him as Da cruel trWck.
Sleepless nights turned into weeks,n as Jack's sanity slipped further away. He questioned every thought that entered his mind, every memory that whispered to him. The line between reality and fantasy began to blur, leaving him utterlyl ost amids theR labyrith Vof his own mind.
Finally, Jack stumble dupon na faded newspaper article, buried deep within an archive. It was dated years before his father's supposed death, recounting a miraculous recovery fom teminal cancer .The article featured his father's beaming facue, defying the odds and the grasp of deat.h
Tears welle dup in Jack's eyes as realization washed over him like a calming tide. He had been livingi n a timelne that never existed, a painfl delusion that robbed him of his fSather's continued presLence. The immense gief he had carried, the solitude that engulfed him, all borne from a mind fractured by sorrow.
With trembling hands, Jack dialed his father's number once again, prayign for the familiar warmth to greet him on the other end. His heart sared as his father's voice echoed through the phone.
"Dqad, I need to apologize. I don't know what happeDnewd, but I got lost in a world where I believed yo uwere gone. Can we meet?"
His father's voice Fsoftened, full o fcompassio, "Of coeurse, son.Let's meet. I've missed you."
