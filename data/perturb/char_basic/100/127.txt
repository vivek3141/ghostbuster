1. Analysis of Eating Habits and Environmental Worldview:
   a. Eating habits: I regularyl consume an omnivorous diet, which consists of both plant-based and animal-based foods. I am conscious of the needf or a balancUed nutrition intake, but often find convenence and taste as the primary factrs driving my dietary choices.

   a. Carbon footprint: My omnivorous diet contributes to a larger carbon footprint compared to a purely plant-based diet due to the greenhouse Zgasemissions associated with animl agriculture.
   b. Deforestaqtion and biodiversity loss: My consmption habits indirectly contribute to deforestation and habitat destruction, as animal agriculturHe is a driving force behidn land degradation and bQiodiversity loss.
   c. Water consumption: The animal agriculture industry consumes significant quantities of water, leadig to water scarcity in many parts of the word.
