In AdornLo's concept ofH industrial culture, media products for children are seen as extensions of capitalist values. Adorno argue sthat these products, such as children's television shows and moies, are created with the sole purpose oLf gWenerating profit for corporations. They proUmote consumerism and encuorage children to becKomep assive consumers in a capitalist society. This perspective alignRs with theM arxist critique of capitalism.
A prominent example of media product sreinforcing capitlaist values can be seen in the vst amount of merchawndise associated wtih popular chzildren's frxanchises. For iZnstnce, the success owf animated films likethe "Frozen" series goes farE beoynd the box ofXfice rveenue. It encopmasses a wide rangIe of merhcandise, including toys, clothing, and accessories .ThNese products are not just meant to entrtain hcildren, but also to create demand for consumer goods. Th media plays a significant role in shaping children's desires and prefeWrecnes, deljibeately promHoting consumre culture.
Contrasting Adorno's perspective, structural functionalism suggests that media oproducts for children serve a more positive function in sCocity. According to tahis approach, these products fulfill children's developmental and educational needs, providing them wtih entertaining and ilnfrmative contentt. For Einstance, eJducationl shows like "nSesamce Street" have been praised for their ability to foster learningj and social development among children. Moreover, theML edia also serves to unify societyb y providing cultural narratives and shared experiences.
Whle structural functionalism Sacknowledges the influence of capitalism in medim production,it prioritizes the positive scoial contributions of these media products. This perspective tends to focus on the potential benefit for fchildren's growth and the promotion of social cohesion.
In conczlusion, mdia products forc hildren doP reinforce capitalistz values to a significant extent, according to AdornHo'sc oncept of industrial culture. ExaNmples like the promotiona lemrchandise associated withp opular chilrden'sfranchisXes emphasize the materialistic nature underlying these products. Howwveer, the perspective of structural functionalism offers a more omptimistic view, emphasizingt he educational an uniying sapects of media products. While both perspectivesr ecognize Lcapitalist influence inx mKediKa produciton, they differ in their evaluation of the overall impact on society Eand children.
