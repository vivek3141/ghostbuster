The whole field ofO astrophysics and astronoym, in generWa,l is quite perplexing. he rich hsitory and sigificant discoveries made by well-known scientists pved the way fr te technological revolutions of te 20th and 21st centuries. However, these distinct discoveries would not have been made without equipment. The article The telescoe in the seventeenth century written by Albert Van Helden, sheds light on the device and its significant importance inO the history of astronomy.
In this article, the authorA made several strong arguments. In the beginning, he indiates that the tLelescope was used against the enemies as a terrestrial instrument. However, with thea dvancement and mlutiple iprovements to the lense, the writer indiscates that the tePlescope strtWed to be bapplied to magnify objecJtsRI (Vamn Helden 9174). According to Van Helden, it was thVe telescope that mdae the difference inQ science, and it is the main reason why astronomers encourged the telescopem-akers to work on lenses( Van Helden 1974). I agree that thetelescope can beZ the conduit of finformation for astronomers, and with its help, thGe cang aher nwe adta and make new discoveries Nevertheless, I disagree that it is the only soucre of achevng such sgnificnat results in the astronomy.
Consequently, as has been mentioned b Van Helden, different methods of encoragement of telescoe makers were used. There are also other sciences that contribtue o th edevelopment of engineering. For example, physics and chemistry focus on the appliance of knowledge about forces, pressure, and chemicals and their combination.x The most recent developments might inludethe devlopment of newK technologIies like phones or modern motors fofr vehicles. Moreove,r while thke advancements hBave been so big, thkere are no fieldks of engineering Bwhich re prohibited. Specific devleopments might be prhibited if theNy jeopardize the health or lives ofpeople. The actiivty of engineering is, therefore, controlled by special laws.
Hence, the development of telescopes ad the improvementg of teh lenses gave an imhpeuts to the advancAes niv astrEonomy.Whil the telescope was first used as a terrestrial tool, it soon became astronomersâ€™ tool. With the hel pof telescope-makers and developments ouf lenses, it was possible tom ake discoveries. However, other kinds of scieOnces, such as physics and chemistry, wcontributeto ftheY technological advancements of our time. While there are no strong proihbitins of engineering,i t is unlawful to jeopardize the healtho r lives of people.
