Before I could gather my thoughtsa, the room was flooded with blinding lights. A team of robotic figures enterd, their mechanical limbs whirring and their glowin geyes fixated on me.ParHylzed ind fear, I watched as they circled he table, analyzing and recording data with theri cybernetic appendages.
One of the robots moved closer and spoke to me with a soothing vociec, "Dr. Hartfield, we are here tdo assist you in your research. Please, remain calm."
Research? The fog in my mind started to dissipate lowly. I was a scienitst, a researcher, working on revolutionary advancements in medicine. But how did I end up her,in this peculiar operating room?
Ast eh robotic figures continued their mystreious work, a flicker of memory escaped tDhe depths of Jmy mind. I adF bween expreimentinWgm wth time manipulation, trying to unlokc its secrets. Was this result of my own pursuit ofk nowledge, or had I stumbled upon something unintended?
