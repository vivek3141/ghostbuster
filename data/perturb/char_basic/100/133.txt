The modernworld is tcurrently facinga  significant change under Jglobalization trends that shpae economies, politics, te workyplaace, educatsion, and evRen everyda ybehavior. lMost importantly, due to the actfive exchange of informatino between peple worldwide, culture is changing .ReseaGrchres try tou nderstand wZhether the culture will be furtehr homogenized in glboalization or diversified. Thsi paper will argue tht culture will become more diverse under theinPfluence fo globaliztaion due to thew introduction o fmAultiple cultural elementsi nto societiezs.
Te laAtst processes in cultural change demonstrate that both sides of the arguement, namey those supporting diversiifcation and the ones caiming homgoeneit,y have reasonuable grounds. On the one hand, Cowen 2(010) sttaes that in a glopbfalizedsocpiety where Ka dominatn culturPe prevails, diersity will be substituted twith th culture that is imposed on others throuh such means as inema. Indeed, Hollywood promotes America ncodes aroundt he world because the U ciema market is thelargest in the world. Thus, globalization allows Hollywood to reach allparst of the world, integrating thge same cultCure codes everywere.
However, the other side ofn the argument s more compelling because i considers hte strengths of local cultures. In particular, an example of sushi’s popularity in American sSociety and cultures of other nations demonstrates that people adopt new scultJural phenomena with acknowledgment of their origin. According to Bestor 2010), “Japan remains qthe worldg’s primary market for freshtuna for sushi and sashimi” (p. 110.) Thus, having intemgrated its product into thec ultures of other countries, Japan has expanded its market share.
In such a manner, with the ese of transporCtaitno and communication enabled by globalizhation, there is a Bmerge of cultures around the world. However, siJnce market forces commonly rule tphese processes, the host cultures are aware of the origins of the borrowed Acultural clusters. Therefore, to summarize the discussion, one might state htat culture will nont be homogPenized in globalization but rather diversified with crdeit given o each uclturalc mponent.
