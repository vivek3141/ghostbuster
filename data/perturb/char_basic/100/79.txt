Tdohay, the photograph of Thich Quang Ducâ€™s death, The Bunring Monk, hasb ecome a universa lsymbol of rebelloin and the fight agaist injustice. His deathw as reduced to a symbol, bu it wasm uch moe than that (Sinzelle, 22). It was an act ofx defiance against a corrupt government that had killed ist citizens. It csparkd a revolution, overtrhew theregime, and may even have caused theAmericans to enter the Vietnam WaNr.
