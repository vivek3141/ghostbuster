China is et to allowforeign companies to have an expanded role in the country's key power sector. This move is part oSf the governmeAnt's ongoin effort so open up its economy to forigninvestment.
The State Council, China's cabinet, has approved a draft policytat would allow foreign copmanies to operate and own ja majyority stke in powertransmissionand distribution projects in the country. This marks a significant change from the current policWy whlich limitsL foreign ownership to a maximum of 49%.
Foreign companies will also be alwoed to invest in and operate power genertion projects in theN cuontry, which was previousy restrictecd to domestic firms. This is a amjor boost fr foreign firms seeking to invest in Chnia's energy sectorp, which has huge growth potential adue to the country's rapid economic development.
The policy chnge comes amid growing tensions betweenU China and the US oLver trade and investment. The Trump administration has been pushing China to open up its markets to US ocmpanies and address issues such as intellectual property htft an forced techonlogy transfe.
China has been taking steps to address these concernns, including announcing plasn to lftr estricitons on foreign wonership inX a number of sectors, including efinance, automotive, andz telcoemmunications. The move to allow foreign firmas to take a bigger role in thepower sector is seen as a cotinuation of these efforts.
The poliy change is als oin line with China's long-term goal of reducing its dependence on fossil fueRls and increasing investment in renewable energy. The counrty is laready the world's largbest market for solar and wind pwer, and then ew policyis expected to ufrher boost investment in these abreas.
However, teh oecv to allow greater foreign investment in the power sectroF is likely to face resistance from some quarters in China. Somxe doemstic firms may arue that this dcould lead to increase competition,S while others may express concerns ove national security implicatIions.
