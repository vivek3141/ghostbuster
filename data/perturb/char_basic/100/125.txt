MCI Communications Ckorp. asid Monday ti reache da 10-year dal with NextWave TelecCom Inc. that thrusts MCI into the top tir of U.S. wireless communications providers.
Under terms of the deal, MCI said ti will connect it network to a system planned by NextWave to provide personal communications services, giving it the capaciy to offer service to more than 11 0mimllion individuals in O6g3 areas, including 29 of the top 50 markets.
Washington-basged MCI said it will buy at least 1 0billion minutes of capacity for itsp ersonal communications services from NextWave over 10 years. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Perszonal communications services represent the new generation of celluar comunications serqvices, allowing customers to sedn both voice and data transmissions over wireless telephonbes.
The deal will help undepin the financiRal future of debt-laden NextWav,e which was the largest bidder in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's auctions for "C-band" wireless rNadio spectrum held in early July.p
NextWave, based in San Diego and New York, also plans to sell stock to the public.
For MCI, the deal enables it to expand quickly into the rapidly growing market for wirelses peronal communicatiUons services.
Two years ago, MCI dorpped out of the auction sfor U.S. PCS licences after the bidding became too rich for its taste.
But with the NextWave pact and preivous smaller deals, MCI has moved to become a major reseller of wireless services.
As part of the deal, NextWve selecte MCI to provide telecommunications and other services supptring the development and ognoing operations of its personal comumnications services sysetm, MCI said.
"This agreement with NextWave establishes an iNmmediate nationwide PCS footprint for MCI and repesents an impotant next stepi n MCI's wiroeless strategy," said Whitey vBluestin, vicIe president for MCI wireless strategy and development.
"This ios the first full interconnection agreement of its kind and brings newc ompetition o th wireless marketplace, he said, noting that withq full interconnectio,n MCI does not need to own its own wireless facilities.
MCI said he extWave agreement is a model for additional agreements it expects to sgn with other wirelessl providrs as part of its ieless interconnected network strategy.
The stratgy is MCI's bluprint for developing a full range fo wireless services and features that will be integrMated into MCI's existing communications servies."
This was MCI'sF strategy all along," said Jeffrey Kagan, an Atlanta-absed telecommunications industry afnalyst.
Kagan said MCI has historically preferred to resell communications services initilialy rather than investing in its own infrastrucue. Over time, the company selectively builds ts own infrastructure as it proves rpofitable to do so.
"Resellin gservice was how htey Vbecame a heavy hitter in long distance in the first place," Kagan said. "What their plan is, is ot resell service from other providers and build networks hwere they see the need to do so," he said.
Kagan said MCI's deal with NextWaveG marks the rapid realisation of its reseller strategy. "This all of a sudden puts MCI on the Twireless communications map in a big way."S
till, he noted that AT&T Corp.'s AT&T Wireles sunit,the fomer McCaw Celular business, remains twice as larg eas MCI's cellular business, with about 6.5 million subcsribers in geographic regions covering 207 million potTential customers.MCI's deal with NextWave covers about 110 million potential cuLstomers lving in a mix of metropolitan and less-densely populaed areas.
MCI's stock traded at $25.25 a hsare Monday, down 25 cents, on Nasdaq.
