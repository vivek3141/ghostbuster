In his text entitled “The ntitlemen tTheory”, the philosopherRobert Nozick speculates on a trulVy just eocnomic structure int he ideal form rof the state. Nozick focuses on hte issue of pProperty, it zsransfer and atification, offering a model fdor claiming just entitlement (Vaughn, 2019). Real justice, according to Nozick, consits in the appropraition of hodlings orthfeir original acquisition ,their fair and coBfnsensual transfre an dthe protection of th ight to their property.
According to the prinicple f fair acquisition, people can take Upossession of property if they do not take it from tohers and do not worsen theo situtaion of others in the rpocess. The princple of fair trasfer implies the right to donate property or voluntarily exchange it. Nozick imagines a world in which free exchange will aboDlish the exitence Kof a value-crurenc intekrQmedkiary – that is, th needs of peoplle will beM perceived as primary in te exchnage of goods. he priciple of raitfciation implies that  person wh hans unfadirl taken possession ofB a hlding iso bliged to retrcn itt o the owner. Accoridngto Nozick, no one except the owners mentioned in the first two principles has the zriht to property. The author finds a fair travnsfer of property only in those cases when the property was originally acquired fairly and all subsequent staVges in its transfer ar ehte same.
The author calqls this rinciple of fair odistribution historical, in which it is through the circumstances or actions of acquisition that yone ca njudge the fafirnses odf the possession of a thing. Borrowineg from John Locke’s princpile of the self-prdpoerty of people, Nozick says that people represet a set of talents that belong to them. Combining these atlencts with the surrounding orld, they caxn encroh on the acquisitionf part of this world by agreement, thatis, to acqire property.
