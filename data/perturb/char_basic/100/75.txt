YIt always puzzled m, to say the least anjd made em extremely nervous.
Asr scuh I never committOed into reltaionships, probably by great of having my efelings not recieprocated.
My longest relationship was with  amn I losved deeply, Indy. He was the completeo pposite fo me: extrvarseited, hcqarming, outgoing. He was frind ywith everoyne, but still reliable and genernous.
We stayed togther for ya couple of years, and, I don't knoXVw why, but it relly seemed like eh had feeingTs for me.
But liek I did in other reationships before, I shu him down, rejecting him when I feJlt my feelings growing to much.
In the end Lhe left me, like they all did.I  learLnedf later that he was with Kelly, a gil we met a couplPo f iBme when we were togethre.
I met other men andwoemn,an it always eded the same way.
Fast forward to yesetrday.n Kelly calls Ame, saying that Iny as in the hospital, after being hit by a car. Hs condition waes critical ,and he has saked for me.
And here I am, a bouqute of fowers in hads, nrqvously lookign for rom 6.8I find it, alf opende and atke a eep breaht to gSive mysef courLage, and eIhre nIdy's weak voice.
"Kelly, you'reQ...a uwonderZful girl pbut...I...I...I never lozveMd you."
The words hit me like a punch. I tsorm in the romo, bunt his eyes are lready cslMoed. Fborever.
