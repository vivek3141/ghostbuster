The position ofthe authorG is cohreent and has the potential to find itserader and suppwDorter. However, the afrtertate from its readin gis rather ambiguMous and makes one think about the excessive tendentiousnses of the writer. The textn does not compare two different caGtegories of people but vigorouslyb downplays th eprincipal personality traits of extroverts. The author says that the word would be muzch calmer and saner undEer the guidance of introverts.
