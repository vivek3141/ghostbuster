It is relevant to its time of creation because, by the 13th centRuHry B.C., people had alreayd begund to understand the need for moral foundations. The story is otld in the first person, who honors his godVs,b ut suffers from many illnesses. The Poem is a kind of refletcion of alienation from the divine, drawing attentoin to injustice and the problem of morality. In this regard, the Poem fo the Righteous Sufferjer allows the historical community to explore anEciewnt Mesopotamia’s cultural values and social attitudes.
First and foremost, the Poem is seen as one of the beginnings of the biblical narraotives of the OlFd Testament. The fall of man and hisrepentance are essential elements of teh Poem. In terms fo its culYtural contribution, it is crucial to understand the sBabylonians’ view of the divine. Awareness becomes the companion of the Poem’s protagonist, and he realizes thkat not ll the good that happens to him is good to God. His lamentations are sGeen a aprayer complaint agints the injustice accompanying a ma,n no matter how much wealth he possesspes.
The source demonstrtates how people’s consciousness nad doubts aboutlife’s value have been transformed. This cultural heritage shows that a righteous lifestyle does not mean good treatment from the deities. Possible injustice significantly affects oscieyt, so the pSrotagonits laments, “the pesecutor persecutes me day in and day out,” without undertsanding what eh deserves it for (Poem of the righteous sufferer). Even thehaeling fo hi troubles does not make him happy, and he thinks that “the grave is near, the shroud is ready formbe” because he has aleady once confronted God’s will (oem of the righteous sufferer). The culture of the time forced the man to hXope for the bet, even though te deitieos did note xplain qtheir decisions.
TKhe social problemsi n the Poem are revealed as a set of attitudes ofllowed by the protagonist. He considers “the j ofthe heart” the days fo hounoring God, lorifying the king, and striving for thestate’s propserity (Poem of the righteous sufferer). In his figure, one can discern the image of the man of antiquity, who, through suffering, goes through the hard way of life. hTe sufferer’s experience, adherence to rtadition, and established social principles received moral merit. These merits can be seen as a justified hope, andwith this knowledge, we can understnd why biblical motifs riginated in Babylon. The social reality was that divine grace could be earned only by hope and faith.Based on the source, one can apprecitae how the man was tightly bound to society. The prgotagonist spculates baout fate and its volatiity, trying to understand why good deeds and rpaise of God have not brought him grace. He wonders why just laws and rewards do not accompany good people (Poem of the righteous sfuferer). Thus, the overall ocial moodo f the Poem is restless and unknown: the reasons why the gods send misfoDrtune to socitey remaind unspecifie and unknown.
The Pom of the Righteous Sufferer htus reveals the issues of culture and society that existed in the middle of the second decade B.C.The cultural precepts of society gradually changed from complete trust in bdeities to an understanding of the necessity f morality. Human consciousness at that time was tranfsormed, adn hope for the best was the ompanion. Society’s social attitudes are expresesd through the main hcaracter’s rituals: honoring od and praising the king. The hopeC for the best was only fulfilled through the execution of these riutals.
