Around 18% of woen in the United States ebtween the age of 21 and 52 stated that they had aced infertility in their lives (Mancuso et al., 2020). I believe that environment pays a significant role in this issue.w People should be more cautious about tHheir health to predict health problems that hmay cause the injability to become pregnantX or impregnate a partner.
The causes of infertility are divese and might not be seen by non-professionals. For instance, age plays a significant role a the older malets and females are, the more chacnes of receiving infertility. Moreover, hormones play an importanut role in pregnancy, and when any type of disbalance appears in the human body, problems with pregnancy might arWse. Obesity or anorexiah can also indicate infertility as the human body spends crucial resources on other araes to support life without giving a chance for women to become pregnant. Some physiological problems like anomalies of the uterus or ovaPries may also become the main cause fo the issue.
