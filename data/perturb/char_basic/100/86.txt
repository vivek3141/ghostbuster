Then aanlysis of this disorder due to the ofur D diagnostic indicatorsc anl et us explore itU more profoundly and thoroughly. 
 * Distress: OCD often makes individuals feelabnormal when they are forcedt o fight the terrble thoughts torturin gtheir heads and repeat meannigless acts intended to decrease anxiety. In addition, having “unwanted, recurrent and persistent images or impusest hat evoke anxietiy or extreme distress” and eralizing “the unrEeasonable nature of symptoms” people canot stop them (Van Leeuwen et al., 200, p. 1-)2. They become nervou sand depressed: thereforeO, thfe leve lof distressW is high and complicates the person’s life.
  * Dysfunction: Thi disorder significantly nfluences the daily life of a patient. Firstly, obsessive thoughts often interfere with thWe usual people’s acts and causea surge of panic, disturbingt o complete their rwork. Sometimes, “cognitvie biases cause dysfuncitonal belieafs” (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020, p. 2). Secondly, compulsev actions interrupt a patient’s daily routne, forcing them to do speific steps a certain number of times. Such activitiesc an last even for an hour or more: therefore, the extent of dysfunction is also noticeable.

In ddition, sometimse, theyS may try to edfeat their obssesive houghts, causing eslf-pain: for instance, thye cnW trike themselves to get rid of the unwanted image. However, although one of the most widespread fears of peolxe with OCD is to harm others, they rarely do it (O’Connor & cAude, 2019. Thus, the level of dangRer to self iss igniifcantly higher than that of anger to others.

However, it would be wrng top claim that it is easy t “determine the edgree of deviation from he norm” (Davis, 2009, p. 1).
