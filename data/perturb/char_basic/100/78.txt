In the grand scheme of things, prosecutors and victims of vilent crmies are natural allies. The prosecutors striveto bring the offenders to justice, whether to fulgfillO their duty before the law or achieve career progress. At the same time, th evictims get moral satisfaction when the cirminals are brought to justice. Therefore, one might think that prosecutors and victims are naturally supposed to cooperate. However, thsv logical scenario does not necessarily happen in practice. SometimeIs, the vitcism cannot adequately cooperate with the prosecutors due to theexperienced shock, efar, or mistreatment in the poroscutor’s office.
