Plato emphasizes the importance of truth in his writings and criticizes the use of rhetoric for personal gain.
He emphasizes the need for orators to seek truth and the greater good rather than manipulate people's emotions for self-serving purposes.
Similarly, the film "Thank You for Smoking" provides a satirical take on the power of rhetoric in modern society. Nick Naylor, the protagonist, utilizes his proficient oratory skills as a spokesperson for the tobacco industry. He deceives the public by presenting strong arguments in favor of smoking, manipulating statistics, and using persuasive techniques. Naylor embodies the opportunistic rhetoric that Plato criticizes, as he prioritizes his personal gains over the well-being and truthfulness of his discourse.
Plato believes that oratory skills should serve justice and promote genuine knowledge, and he values internal consistency and logical coherence over eloquent speeches lacking substance.
The film "Thank You for Smoking" supports Plato's argument that the power of persuasion must be used ethically.
The film "Thank You for Smoking" illustrates the deceptive nature of opportunist rhetoric and highlights the importance of truth and justice in public speaking.
