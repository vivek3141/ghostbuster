The first thing the audience will hear is Scarpia's motives.
The people will leave the opera theatre and go to the cafes and restaurants that they've been to before.
Acquaintances of mine always asked, "Why move to Milan?" "You don't know Italian, do you?" "Why now?" they'd ask with all the sincerity of a Hallmark Valentine's Day card. I'm not sure that I'd ever have an answer for them, because they were right to question my motives. Why choose to fundamentally change the eternal workings of the vampiric lifestyle?
For one, the Milanese choose to stay out until the ungodly hours of 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, meaning that my food is usually spiked with the residual alcohol from their Lombardy region chardonnay and pinot bianco by the pint. However, even getting past the eternal hangover that is my life, how do I avoid that villainous vegetable that the Italians seem to put in every dish: garlic.
During my time in Vienna, I took the aglio for granted, but the Austrians never bothered with it.
Perhaps I might go back to Vienna and dine off the simple people whose beer consumption is admirable as much as it is shameful. Perhaps I will get back to hearing the operas of Strauss and Mozart, or maybe the occasional performance of Marschner's "Der Vampyr." But for now, I sit like Tosca, in a place I should never wish to be waiting for the right moment to make my escape and be free again. Now, this never sleeping city of Milan holds me hostage with the taste of death on everyone's lips.
