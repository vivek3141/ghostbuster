In August, Hong Kong's air cargo handling increased despite the trade tension between China and the US.
According to the HKIA, the increase in air cargo volume was due to a growth in exports.
The airport handled a total of 434,000 tonnes of cargo in August. The growth was seen primarily in exports to Europe, North America, and Southeast Asia. The increase in volume suggests that Hong Kong remains a vital link in global supply chains.
Despite the ongoing trade war, HKIA continues to be competitive, offering airlines and shippers access to extensive air and sea networks and a logistics industry hub.
HKIA is positive about the future.
