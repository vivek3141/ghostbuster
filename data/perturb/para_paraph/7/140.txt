A place to call home is more than just a place to live.
Home is when a person knows they are surrounded by people who can make them feel good.
When home takes on a human figure, it is referred to as a family.
Since college is where people spend most of their day, I feel at ease. My classmates, whom I have known for many years, are also at the same school. For instance, I have a friend in the same class as me who is like a sibling to me. We communicate a lot, and he knows all of my secrets. I have known him for years and consider him to be my best friend. All of my professors are familiar to me, and they are all delightful to me. They also instruct me and assist me with any problems I may have.
For me, the feeling of home is the place where I can return at any time, and if not all, then one.
