Financial services and property group Liberty International Holdings on Thursday unveiled a move into the British pensions market in ventures involving the British Telecom Pension Scheme and pension fund management group Hermes.
Liberty is establishing its own pensions company, Liberty International Pensions, which will target both the needs of money purchase pension schemes and retail pensions.
Ten percent of the equity of Liberty International Pensions will be paid for by the BT Pension Scheme.
Liberty and Hermes said in a joint statement that they were setting up a new subsidiary called Hermes Liberty International Pensions to offer specialized investment services to the British pensions industry.
Donald Gordon, Liberty's chairman, said that a 1.5 billion pound transfer of assets to the new funds would be critical mass from the beginning.
Gordon said Liberty was "well positioned to take advantage of the changes affecting the UK pensions industry." Hermes' expertise in investment management and track record would help it to provide quality and competitively priced pension services.
Liberty's managing director said that Liberty International Pensions was ready for launch but still needed approval from Britain's Department of Trade and Industry.
Hermes called the joint pensions venture a meeting of minds.
"Liberty has the ability and techniques of selling pensions, it also has the systems, and the administration, and we think that's a very good marriage."
Ross Goobey said Hermes had approached Liberty International only to find the group had been considering an approach to Hermes.
"It really was a meeting of minds on this. Whether it develops further from this we shall see. I think one step at a time is quite enough for us."
He said the venture would probably not be up and running until the first quarter of next year as regulatory approval first had to be obtained for the new group.
The British Telecom Pension Scheme's decision to transfer assets to the new funds would give the new venture a boost.
"I hope it gives some people some sense of security that the biggest pension scheme in the country is willing to do this," he said.
Liberty plans to sell personal pensions at its regional shopping centres, which are held through a majority-owned subsidiary Capital Shopping Centres. These have more than 150 million customer visits a year, Liberty said.
