Foreign companies will be allowed to play a bigger role in the country's power sector.
The State Council, China's cabinet, has approved a draft policy that would allow foreign companies to operate and own a majority stake in power transmission and distribution projects in the country.
Foreign companies will also be allowed to invest in and operate power generation projects in the country, which was previously restricted to domestic firms. This is a major boost for foreign firms seeking to invest in China's energy sector, which has huge growth potential due to the country's rapid economic development.
China and the US are at odds over trade and investment.
The move to allow foreign firms to take a bigger role in the power sector is seen as a continuation of previous efforts.
The policy change is in line with China's long-term goal of reducing its dependence on fossil fuels and increasing investment in renewable energy.
However, the move to allow greater foreign investment in the power sector is likely to face resistance from some quarters in China. Some domestic firms may argue that this could lead to increased competition, while others may express concerns over national security implications.
The move is seen as positive for foreign companies that want to invest in China.
