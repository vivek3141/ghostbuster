I realized I was no longer in the comfort of my self-driving car when I looked out the window.
When I tried to remember how I ended up here, it was obvious that something had gone wrong.
The air was filled with unfamiliar smells and the language spoken around me was foreign.
My mind raced with questions. Where was I? How had I ended up in a time so distant from my own? Feeling lost and alone, I thought of my loved ones, their faces fading as I traveled further away from home. Tears welled in my eyes as I yearned for familiarity.
But amid the chaos, a glimmer of curiosity sparked within me. Embracing this new reality, I decided to make the most of my unexpected journey. With no way back, I resolved to adapt, learn, and perhaps, leave a mark on this astonishing future that had inadvertently become my destination.
