The music saved me from bad relationships.
Either I am the only one who hears it or everyone else does.
If the music is trying to warn me of something dire, it will always be at a comfortable level.
There was a rising crescendo ever since I woke up that morning. I turned on the news to watch while eating breakfast, as I always do. Usually the music goes back and forth between dramatic and more more lulling, depending on the news break about to come up. But that morning it didn't change. It just crescendoing until the newscaster spoke.
I could not hear the sound of the World Trade Centers.
As I watched the events unfold, the music continued to be silent. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again.
