Pearson stock spiked on rumors of a possible takeover by BSkyB.
Shares in Pearson, the world's largest educational publisher, surged on Friday on rumors of a potential takeover bid by BSkyB. The shares closed up 12% at £1,155, giving the company a market capitalization of nearly £9bn.
The rumors of a takeover bid began on Thursday when a report in the Financial Times suggested that Rupert Murdoch's News Corp was considering a bid for Pearson. News Corp already owns a 39% stake in BSkyB, and the report suggested that News Corp could use BSkyB as a vehicle to make a bid for Pearson.
The report sent Pearson's share price soaring on Thursday, and the stock continued to climb on Friday following rumors that BSkyB was planning a bid.
BSkyB and Pearson have not commented on the rumors.
Pearson has been struggling in recent years as students increasingly turn to digital learning materials, rather than traditional textbooks. The company has responded to this trend by investing heavily in digital products, but its revenues have been hit hard in the transition.
One of the UK's largest media companies, BSkyB, has a strong track record in developing and monetizing digital content.
This would also fit with BSkyB's broader strategic goals. The company has been looking to move beyond its core business of pay-TV and expand into new areas, such as digital advertising and e-commerce. Acquiring Pearson could give BSkyB a foothold in the education market, which is a valuable and growing sector.
However, there are also potential risks for BSkyB in making a bid for Pearson. Education is a highly-regulated sector, and it is unclear how regulators would view a big media company such as BSkyB owning one of the largest education publishers in the world.
Pearson's CEO, John Fallon, has been leading the company through a difficult period of transition, and he may be reluctant to sell the company to another party.
Despite these uncertainties, the rumors of a potential takeover bid by BSkyB have put Pearson's shares firmly in the spotlight. Whether or not a bid materializes remains to be seen, but for now, investors are clearly excited about the possibility of a deal.
