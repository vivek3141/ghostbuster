The initial public offering of the Halifax Building Society could be worth as much as 20 billion pounds.
It will be the largest extension of private share ownership ever witnessed in the UK, according to the chief executive of the society.
The mutually-owned Halifax, with assets of over 100 billion pounds ($167.8 million), said flotation adviser Deutsche Morgan Grenfell had estimated a share price of between 390 and 450 pence ($6.54 to $7.55) per share if the IPO had taken place on Dec. 16.
This equals a market worth of between 10.4 billion ($17.5 billion) and 12 billion pounds ($20.1 billion), and analysts expect the final outcome to be at the top end of this range given the recent positive performance of the most comparable stock in the market, former mortgage banker Abbey National Plc.
Peter Toeman said that the valuation was in line with expectations.
Other analysts agreed and many expect the price on flotation day to be higher, saying that Friday's figures looked a little conservative.
A basic allocation of 200 shares will be given to each of the qualified members.
A total of 8.0 million voting packs have been sent out by the society.
Investing members will also get a variable share allocation depending on how much money they had in their accounts on particular dates. This will range from 200 shares to a maximum of 1,181 for those with 50,000 pounds ($84,430) or more.
At its special general meeting on Feb. 24, over 50 percent of the investing members must vote in favour of the proposal or it will fail. The society has started a huge advertising campaign to encourage members to vote.
The Halifax is expected to be in the top 20 companies by market capitalisation in the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip firms and is sure to threaten Abbey's position as Britain's fifth-largest publicly-owned bank.
The British insurance and long-term savings sectors have room for expansion.
