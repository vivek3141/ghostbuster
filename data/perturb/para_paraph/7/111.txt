My nine year old mind couldn't comprehend that my mother had been torn from my grasp and was carried away in the flow of sweaty, mindless humanity.
For a few moments I was lifted off my feet between three fat ladies and dragged around in kind of a sadistic tango, like those people on dancing with the stars.
I dropped to the floor after being carried to the toy isle and a large boot crunched over my hand.
I pulled my arm to myself and looked in horror at my limp wrist and dangly fingers.
The consumers rushed right on by. I tried to stand up by pushing up from the floor. My wrist bent backwards and my whole arm was slashed with pain. I used my legs and popped up, just in time to get bounced by a large belly with a shirt that said santa I've been good. Santa's face knocked me backward a few steps, but luckily I caught my balance at the last moment on an elderly man who was holding up better than I was, and I tried to fight the crowd towards the exit.
Being pushed and prodded and severely injured, and too short to see over the foaming masses, I somehow ended up deeper in the store. Lost in the underwear isle. Shelves were being ripped clean. A huge rufus erupted a few yards away, and a display with racks of pants and shoes was tipped over. Through the chaos I heard screams of agony and saw flashes of several people pinned under the large shelving units.
There was blood on the floor and a twitching black man's arm swatted my leg from under a massive beam-like shelf as the crowd carried me closer to the accident.
Thankfully, I was whisked away from the scene, and spotted a small break in the crowd, I ran through the opening, headed toward the big red exit sign that is only thirty yards away, but suddenly my progress was halted by the closing in of human bodies.
The crowd was quieter for a while, and the swarming buzzing slowed down, but then a woman fell on top of me.
The last thing I saw was a boot coming down on my face.
