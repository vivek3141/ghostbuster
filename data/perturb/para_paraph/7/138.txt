In the Heat of the Night
The idea behind Supertom is to make a black character heroic.
Thus, a black character is endowed with high achievements and extraordinary positive characteristics, and Supertom is obtained. Mr. Tibbs is Supertom as he “is smarter than all the white people, the best homicide detective in Philadelphia, brave enough to face down a lynch mob,” and exhibits “a somewhat unexpected knowledge of varieties of plant life.” (Vera, 156) He is a kind of racial Sherlock Holmes.
The relationship in the movie suggests a kind of friendship between blacks and whites that Americans like to think of as accurate, but that is not the case in the time frame in which In the Heat of the Night takes place.
Do the right thing.
In February 2020, two white men killed Ahmaud Arbery for allegedly robbing someone.
The theme of US racism is displayed in most of Spike Lee's films, and the director's attitude towards it is critical.
One of the film's strengths is the complexity of its characters and the portrayal of blackness on screen.
