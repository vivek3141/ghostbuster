General Motor Corp.'s decision to invest 300 million pounds in the British arm of the company reflected its confidence in the British operation and the international prospects for the Astra model, the company said on Tuesday.
The company said the three-year investment would be used to modernise its Ellesmere Port plant in north-west England, which makes Astra cars and vans.
The announcement, made at the British International Motor Show, guarantees the livelihoods of the 4,200 people employed at the plant and will create at least 200 new jobs.
Vauxhall Motors chairman and managing director Nick Reilly said in an interview that a possible decision on increasing the number of shifts at the plant to three from two could create hundreds more jobs.
Any decision, likely to be taken over the next two years, would depend on the market and demand for the model at that time.
The development of an estate model has boosted the position of the Astra model, which has been one of Britain and Europe's top five sellers since its launch five years ago.
The 300 million pound investment was won against intense competition within GM and reflected the transformation of the plant from a domestically oriented plant to a very important source of manufacturing.
He predicted strong growth for the Astra in Latin America and Asia Pacific.
The British car market is currently the most competitive in Europe, with a number of importers using huge U.K. fleet sales as a way of offloading cars which remain unsold in sluggish domestic markets.
He said that the profitablity of the company was going in the right direction after a tough 1995.
