The Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System is expected to vote early Friday on expanding banks' non-banking activities.
The Fed is expected to allow banks' section 20 subsidiaries to derive 25 percent of their revenue from non-banking activities, up from the current 10 percent ceiling.
The section 20 proposal was released for comment in July, but since then another bank regulator has stolen some of the Fed's thunder. Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig said his office will begin approving bank affiliates moving into an assortment of non-banking businesses.
The Fed's proposal and the Comptroller's actions will increase the pressure on Congress to scrap the Glass-Steagall Act.
Insurance companies and securities firms opposed the banks creating legislative gridlock.
"Now the tables have been turned," Litan said. "But it's not a two-way street. Other industries will want to level the playing field."  
Both moves also reflect current market realities. The financial services industry, from banks to insurance companies to mutual funds, is converging. Mutual funds already offer checking account-like money market funds and some of the leading stock and bond underwriters are commercial banks.
In the words of one top regulator, the Fed's move from 10 to 25 percent, "is not material." The Fed has required banks to take certain steps to prevent problems in the subsidiaries from affecting the bank itself, and its government-insured deposits.
Competitors in other fields worry that the banks insured deposits are a form of government subsidy giving the banks an unfair advantage when they venture into other fields.
Ludwig said that walling off the subsidiary eliminated any subsidization.
He opposes efforts by some in Congress to keep banks out of certain fields, such as real estate or merchant banking, entirely. "It's a mistake to set product limits, particularly in this day and age when we have such a dynamic marketplace," he said.
