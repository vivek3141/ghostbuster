"You ready yet? I'm about to leave!"
"Yeah, I just need to find my keys in this mess.. Do you want to me to follow?" She asks as she rummages through her purse.
"Yeah that's fine. Be careful driving! See you in a bit sis!"
I get in my car and buckle up. God I hate these drives now that we're older. There used to be a time when I could just pick up my little sister from moms and we can drive together, be there at the same time, not have to worry about traffic or work. But then again, there used to be a time before that...when my parents were together.
I don't like driving and we can't do anything anymore.
Oh god,
Please.
This guy seems to be either stupid or dru - before I can look back again, I hear the sound of glass shattering and metal grinding against itself.
