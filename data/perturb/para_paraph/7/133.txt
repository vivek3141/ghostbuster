The culture of the modern world is changing due to the active exchange of information.
According to the latest processes in cultural change, both sides of the argument have reasonable grounds.
The strength of local cultures is considered more compelling by the other side of the argument.
In such a manner, with the ease of transportation and communication enabled by globalization, there is a merge of cultures around the world. However, since market forces commonly rule these processes, the host cultures are aware of the origins of the borrowed cultural clusters. Therefore, to summarize the discussion, one might state that culture will not be homogenized in globalization but rather diversified with credit given to each cultural component.
