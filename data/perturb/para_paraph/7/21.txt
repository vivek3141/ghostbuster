Through his New Deal programs, Roosevelt brought about social and economic change.
During the Great Depression, immigrants faced immense hardships and discrimination. To address this issue, President Roosevelt signed the National Origins Act of 1934, which abolished discriminatory quotas based on nationality. This act ensured fair treatment of immigrants and promoted equality. Moreover, the creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) within the New Deal aimed to provide work opportunities, housing, and education for millions of young unemployed men, many of whom were immigrants. The CCC not only put food on their tables but also gave them a sense of belonging and hope for a better future.
African Americans who were disproportionately affected by economic disparity were helped by Roosevelt's policies.
The right to join unions was given to workers by the National Industrial Recovery Act.
In conclusion, President Franklin Roosevelt’s acts and laws had a transformative impact on the nation’s recovery from the Great Depression. His New Deal programs, including the National Origins Act, CCC, NYA, WPA, NIRA, and FLSA, were instrumental in providing relief, economic opportunities, and social reforms. These initiatives played a crucial role in improving the lives of immigrants, African Americans, and workers, ultimately bringing about a significant societal change and setting the foundation for a more inclusive and prosperous America.
