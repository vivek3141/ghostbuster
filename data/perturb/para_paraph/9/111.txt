My nine year old mind couldn't comprehend that my mother had been torn from my grasp and was carried away in the flow of sweaty, mindless humanity.
I was lifted off my feet between three fat ladies and dragged around in a tango, like those people on dancing with the stars.
I dropped to the floor after being carried to the toy isle and a large boot crunched over my hand.
I pulled my arm to myself and looked in horror at my limp wrist and dangly fingers.
I tried to stand up by pushing up from the floor, but my arm was slashed and I couldn't stand up.
I ended up deeper in the store because I was pushed and prodded and injured and too short to see over the foam.
There was blood on the floor and a twitching black man's arm swatted my leg from under a massive beam-like shelf as the crowd carried me closer to the accident.
Thankfully, I was whisked away from the scene, and spotted a small break in the crowd, I ran through the opening, headed toward the big red exit sign that is only thirty yards away, but suddenly my progress was halted by the closing in of human bodies.
Suddenly a shotgun blast echoed across the store. Then another. The crowd was quieter for a moment, and the swarming buzzing slowed down and everything seemed almost still. For about half a second. Then the screaming started. I was pushed to the ground and a woman fell on top of me. People were stepping on both of us running for the exit, running for the back, running into each other in chaos. My wrist screamed in pain, my ribs were probably broken, and I was pinned under this woman who was now unconscious.
The last thing I saw was a boot coming down on my face.
