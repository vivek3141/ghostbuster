It always puzzled me, to say the least, and made me extremely nervous.
As such I never committed into relationships, probably by great of having my feelings not reciprocated.
My longest relationship was with a man I loved deeply, Indy. He was the complete opposite of me: extraverted, charming, outgoing. He was friend with everyone, but still reliable and generous.
I don't know why we stayed together for a couple of years, but it seemed like he had feelings for me.
But like I did in other relationships before, I shut him down, rejecting him when I felt my feelings growing to much.
He was with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of times when we were together.
It ended the same way when I met other men and women.
Fast forward to yesterday. Kelly calls me, saying that Indy was in the hospital, after being hit by a car. His condition was critical, and he has asked for me.
I am holding a bouquet of flowers and nervously looking for room 68.
I find it, half opened, and take a deep breath, and here Indy's voice is weak.
"Kelly, you're a wonderful girl, but I never loved you."
He's already closed his eyes, and the words hit me like a punch.
