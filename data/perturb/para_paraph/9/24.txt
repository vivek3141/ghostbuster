By the 13th century B.C., the poem was relevant to its time of creation.
The fall of man and his repentance are important parts of the poem.
The source demonstrates how people’s consciousness and doubts about life’s value have been transformed. This cultural heritage shows that a righteous lifestyle does not mean good treatment from the deities. Possible injustice significantly affects society, so the protagonist laments, “the persecutor persecutes me day in and day out,” without understanding what he deserves it for (Poem of the righteous sufferer). Even the healing of his troubles does not make him happy, and he thinks that “the grave is near, the shroud is ready for me” because he has already once confronted God’s will (Poem of the righteous sufferer). The culture of the time forced the man to hope for the best, even though the deities did not explain their decisions.
He considers the days of honoring God, glorifying the king, and trying for the state's prosperity to be the joy of the heart.
The man was bound to society.
In the second decade B.C., the cultural precepts of society changed from complete trust in deities to an understanding of morality.
