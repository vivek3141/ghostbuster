I'm about to leave!
"Do you want me to follow you?" she asked as she searched through her purse.
"Yeah that's fine. Be careful driving! See you in a bit sis!"
I used to be able to pick up my sister from my mom at the same time and not have to worry about traffic or work.
I don't like driving and we can't do anything anymore.
Oh my gosh.
Please.
I look back the the rearview, slow down sis...This guy seems to be either stupid or dru - before I can look back again I hear the sound of glass shattering and metal grinding against itself, breaks screeching. No, no no no no no....
