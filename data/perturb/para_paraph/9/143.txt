As the sun set, Sarah opened her eyes to see a new day.
Sarah went back to the previous day to find out what happened.
Sarah looked at the sky.
Sarah discovered ancient legends of a mystical realm where dreams and reality intertwined.

She realized that sometimes we must venture beyond the known to regain what we have lost.
