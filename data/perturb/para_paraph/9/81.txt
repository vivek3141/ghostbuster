Many couples in the United States may face this problem, and the causes can vary from congenital diseases to acquired physical or psychological trauma.
Older males and females are more likely to get infertility, and hormones play an important role.
The percentage of male infertility is low.
A higher percentage of females suffer from infertility due to diseases that can't be treated.
Infertility remains the main problem that is not under full control. In some cases, it may become impossible to give a person a chance to continue becoming pregnant or impregnate their partner. However, sometimes it is possible to solve the problem by using medicines, surgical procedures, and In vitro fertilization (Repping, 2019). Moreover, a psychotherapist can help deal with psychological problems that are barriers to conceiving a child. Every case is unique, and only doctors can decide if any treatment would be useful or not.
