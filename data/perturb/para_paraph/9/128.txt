The music saved me from bad relationships.
Either I am the only one who hears it or everyone else does.
Normally, the music is always at a comfortable level, unless it is trying to warn me of something dire. There was one moment whereâ€¦ One moment where the sound was deafening.
The music went back and forth between dramatic and lulling as I watched the news, but that morning it didn't.
I could not hear the sound of the World Trade Centers.
The music was silent as I watched the events unfold. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again.
