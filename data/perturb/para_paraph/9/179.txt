The issue of discrimination against people of color is pervasive despite democracy and international law, argues Beverly Daniel Tatum, a prominent expert on education and psychology.
The book reveals the issue of inequality from multiple angles, and it is demanding to pick out a few leading ideas, as Tatum tries to cover distinct topics in a certain number of pages. She starts with a definition of racism and explains that it is challenging to have an honest conversation about race due to its negative stigma. Furthermore, the author’s point is to define the state of discrimination in the country and the world nowadays and explore what steps need to be taken to develop identity. The book educates readers on how black people perform in white society and how white ones act in their community, noting the various subtleties and characteristics of security and privilege.
The concern of patience and silence is one of the central themes.
There is a tendency, especially among whites, to deny the existence of systemic racism because accepting it as truth is like admitting that they are racist, and that needs to be altered. The author’s idea is that there must be a clear distinction between the negative attitudes, assumptions, and stereotypes that one person may project on another and how racism operates in society. If everyone understood discrimination as a set of policies and practices that systematically give white people an advantage over people of color, the matter would become apparent.
There are fundamental issues of discrimination that are particularly acute in education because of the negative racial biases that black children face.
Education contributes to building a global community in which integrity, ethics, non-discrimination, and respect for the rule of law are essential pillars. The author’s central message emphasizes the educator’s role in developing the students’ ability to operate existing or acquired knowledge to alter their behavior. It is necessary to promote proper conduct in appropriate circumstances, such as making ethical decisions and speaking out against discrimination. Fighting something as pervasive as systemic racism may seem like an impossible task for an educator, but Tatum emphasizes that everyone can start with their sphere of influence. Every individual has some impact on the lives of others and is capable of taking small steps that will dismantle racist systems.
The book has valuable sense despite some of the author's exaggerated ideas.
Moreover, no one would think about the skin color of the person who voices the cartoon, let alone any hidden social or racial controversies that it might represent. This example demonstrates that not all of Tatum’s arguments are valid, and one should not look for racism everywhere. If one parses all movies or any media for that matter, one would assume that they are all built on discrimination, even if they are not. It is necessary to encourage proper intentions and equality rather than seeking racism.
In conclusion, Why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria?, and other conversations about race, is a book that explains the hardships that people of color experience.
