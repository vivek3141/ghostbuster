Mental disorders include manias, phobias, and panic attacks.
When individuals are forced to fight the terrible thoughts and repeat meaningless acts to decrease anxiety, they feel abnormal.
The daily life of a patient is influenced by this disorder.
  * Danger: OCD may represent a significant danger for an individual since sometimes, people feel so depressed that they are ready to commit suicide. In addition, sometimes, they may try to defeat their obsessive thoughts, causing self-pain: for instance, they can strike themselves to get rid of the unwanted image. However, although one of the most widespread fears of people with OCD is to harm others, they rarely do it (Oâ€™Connor & Aude, 2019). Thus, the level of danger to self is significantly higher than that of danger to others.
It is not easy to determine the degree of deviation from the norm.
