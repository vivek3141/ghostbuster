There is a connection between two facts or a point and the idea of how it will affect the future.
The example is:
All metals are heavy.
 2. Tin is a metal
 3. Tin is heavy
A valid form and true premises are required for a sound argument to be valid.
Example:
All dogs are cats.
All mice are dogs.
 3. All mice are cats
The logical necessity of the judgment is what makes this a valid statement.
