Profits at Canada's six big banks topped C$6 billion ($4.4 billion) in 1996, smashing last year's C$5.2 billion ($3.8 billion) record as Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada wrapped up the earnings season on Thursday.
The six banks made a combined profit of $6.26 billion in the fiscal year that ended in October.
But a third straight year of record profits came amid growing public anger over perceived high service charges and credit card rates, and tight lending policies.
Bank officials said that millions of Canadians owned bank shares.
Shareholders of four of the six banks were rewarded with healthy dividend hikes this year.
"Our activities mean jobs, investment, tax revenue, dividend payments and foreign income for Canada's economy," Al Flood said after the bank reported a 35 percent jump in net income on Thursday.
CIBC, Canada's second-largest bank, said net income climbed to C$1.36 billion ($1 billion) in fiscal 1996 from C$1.01 billion ($743 million) in 1995.
CIBC also boosted its quarterly dividend by C5 cents (3.6 cents) to C50 cents (37 cents), the second increase in 1996.
Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Royal Bank of Canada previously raised their payouts as well.
Royal Bank, Canada's largest bank, reported the highest corporate profit in Canadian history on Wednesday, with 1996 net income rising 13 percent to C$1.43 billion ($1.05 billion).
Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal cracked the billion-dollar barrier this year, joining CIBC and Royal Bank, which crossed the threshold in 1995 and 1994 respectively.
National Bank had a 30 percent jump in net income to C$318 million this year.
The banks attributed their performances to lower credit losses and healthy commercial and personal banking. Investment banking, brokerage and mutual fund businesses also enjoyed a banner year as financial markets soared in 1996.
Earnings at CIBC's Wood Gundy Inc. investment arm skyrocketed 122 percent to C$528 million ($389 million) in 1996.
The group's earnings and dividend hikes were in line or slightly better than analysts' forecasts.
Hugh Brown said it was good news and a good outlook for 1997 in terms of earnings and dividends.
In 1997, Brown said Big Six profits may grow between 9 and 10 percent, up from previous growth forecasts of about 7 percent.
Bank stocks, which have led the Toronto Stock Exchange to new heights since September, fell on Thursday in tandem with the rest of the market. CIBC led the decline, dropping C$2.50 ($1.84) to close at C$57 ($42) in brisk trading.
