Despite the trade tension between China and the US, Hong Kong's air cargo handling increased in August.
According to the HKIA, the increase in air cargo volume was due to a growth in exports.
A total of 434,000 tonnes of cargo was handled at the airport in August.
Despite the ongoing trade war, HKIA continues to be competitive, offering airlines and shippers access to extensive air and sea networks and a logistics industry hub.
HKIA believes in the future.
