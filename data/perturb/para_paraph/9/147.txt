The ODS, Vaclav Klaus' political party, won twelve out of 27 seats in the Senate elections.
The ODS has emerged as the largest party in the Senate, and this has given the Czech Prime a boost.
Klaus is considering rearranging the cabinet.
The road to obtaining a larger mandate is not likely to be easy for the Prime Minister.
Despite the challenges, Klaus remains optimistic that he can garner the necessary support to strengthen his political position. Speaking to reporters after the Senate elections, the ODS leader expressed gratitude for the faith that the voters had placed in his party. He also promised to deliver on his campaign promises, which included lower taxes and increased investment in infrastructure and public services.
The Czech Republic has been beset by political instability and uncertainty in recent times.
Klaus is expected to continue his quest for a larger mandate in the coming weeks and months. His next big test will come in the regional elections due to be held in November. These elections will be closely watched to see whether the ODS can maintain its momentum, and whether Klaus can gain enough support to push ahead with his political agenda.
The Czech Prime Minister's quest for a larger mandate will be a topic of much debate and scrutiny in the weeks and months ahead.
