The scene before me remained the same as I slowly opened my eyes as the morning sun peeked through the curtains.
It felt like a dream, just a moment ago I was living a modern life, surrounded by technology and convenience.
The streets were lined with cobblestones and the air was filled with the sound of horseshoes.
I stumbled upon a young boy, his curious eyes mirroring my own disbelief. With a shaky voice, I asked him what year it was. He chuckled and shrugged, "Why, it's the year of our Lord, 1327."
I was trying to make sense of my situation when I decided to visit the local cathedral.
The spires of the grand structure were reaching for the heavens as I entered.
Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months. I immersed myself in this strange new world, learning its ways and customs. I trained alongside knights, tilling the fields with peasants, and established myself as a healer within the community. But every night, as I lay down to sleep, I yearned for the world I had left behind - the comfort, the simplicity of modern life.
I wanted the familiarity of the buzzing city streets, the soft glow of electric lights, and the soothing hum of technology, but I had to accept my reality.
I realized that I had changed when I watched the sunset over the medieval town.
In this ancient world, beauty existed in simplicity, where love flourished within the hearts of men and women. I may never fully understand how or why this happened, but I knew that within these medieval walls, I had found a sense of purpose and a newfound appreciation for the value of time.
I embraced my new reality as I walked through the stone streets under the gaze of the cathedral.
