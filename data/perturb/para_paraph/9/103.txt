Oliver lived in the center of a small town.
The tranquility of the woods had always brought Oliver peace, and he often sought solace among the whispering trees.
Oliver found shelter in a stone tower, but as darkness descended, he took refuge in a dusty chamber.
Just when his spirit was fading, a blinding light filled the chamber, and he found himself once again standing in front of the pocket watch. Ecstatic, he hastily pocketed it, and reality shifted. Oliver’s respawn landed him in a cramped crate, surrounded by the jumbled mess of a post office. Stacked upon others, he was far from comfortable, akin to a forgotten package. Oliver contemplated the irony of his immortality while yearning for a more dignified spawn.
Throughout his peculiar existence, Oliver misplaced his precious pocket watch on countless occasions. From bustling marketplaces to desolate mountain peaks, each respawn presented new challenges. He would often awaken in the middle of busy streets, narrowly avoiding stampedes of confused pedestrians. Once, to his utmost embarrassment, he found himself at the center of a grand opera performance, appearing to materialize out of thin air during a poignant, silent moment.
Amidst his misadventures, Oliver discovered an undeniable pattern—an unfathomable connection between his emotions and the watch's misplacement. The more he lamented about his current respawn location, the more likely he was to misplace it. Over time, Oliver learned to embrace his circumstances, laughing at the audacious situations in which he found himself.
Oliver's most memorable misplace occurred when he felt an overwhelming sense of wanderlust on a whimsical summer afternoon. He ventured into the depths of a dense jungle, hoping to find awe-inspiring creatures and hidden treasures. As he tiptoed through the foliage, marveling at the mesmerizing sights, the pocket watch slipped from his grasp and tumbled into a mysterious pool of quicksand.
Oliver was in a mud bath at the spa when the watch disappeared.
Oliver's pocket watch offered a lifetime of strange adventures, from spawning in an outrageous costume party to appearing in the middle of an island.
The story of Oliver, the man bound to a pocket watch, continues to unfold, as a reminder to never be too attached to one's own world.
