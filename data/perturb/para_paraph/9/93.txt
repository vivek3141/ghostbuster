Light rains in Ivory Coast after a dry start to January will help mid-crop (April-Sept) cocoa crop development, particularly if they extend into February, a crop analyst said on Thursday.
"We have seen around average rain levels for January so far but a little more now and in February would help," another local crop analyst told Reuters.
Distribution of rains was patchy.
Most fell in central and northern cocoa and coffee areas, particularly around Man, Daloa, Yamoussoukro and Gagnoa, the data showed. Little fell in coastal areas around San Pedro and Abidjan.
The weather analyst said that central areas have seen a surplus but southern areas are in deficit.
According to a crop analyst, the rains seem to have reached most cocoa and coffee areas.
After returning from an up-country tour, the crop analyst said there seemed to have been good light showers in most cocoa areas.
Dry harmattan conditions from the Sahara had now retreated northwards after failing to reach southern Ivory Coast as usually expected in late-December or early January.
Despite drying efforts, cocoa humidity levels remained around 10 percent against exportable quality of eight percent.
Coffee farmers have also had drying problems but export activity remained low after shipments put by port sources at 10,492 tonnes for October to December, exporters said.
Quality inspectors said a better picture of coffee humidity and quality after rains would emerge as arrivals picked up.
The second 10 days of January in key growing areas were shown in the data from the national weather station.
Gagnoa 7.8mm, San Pedro 0.1mm, Tabou 6.2mm, Dimbokro 4.6mm, Aidjan 6mm, and Korho.
No data were available for Adiake and Sassandra.
