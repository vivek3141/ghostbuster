The first thing the audience at La Scala Opera will hear is Scarpia's motives.
The people will walk out of the opera theatre and go to the caf√©s and restaurants that they've been to many times before.
I'm not sure if I'd ever have an answer to the question of why I moved to Milan in the first place.
The Milanese stay out until 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, meaning that my food is usually spiked with residual alcohol from their Lombardy region.
The Austrians never bothered with the aglio, even though I took it for granted.
Perhaps I might go back to Vienna and dine off the simple people whose beer consumption is admirable as much as it is shameful. Perhaps I will get back to hearing the operas of Strauss and Mozart, or maybe the occasional performance of Marschner's "Der Vampyr." But for now, I sit like Tosca, in a place I should never wish to be waiting for the right moment to make my escape and be free again. Now, this never sleeping city of Milan holds me hostage with the taste of death on everyone's lips.
