A majority stake in CIGNA's Japanese unit is going to be acquired by the Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co.
The Japanese insurer is expected to complete the acquisition of 51% of CIGNA Life Insurance Co. by the end of 2021, pending regulatory approval.
The acquisition will allow the company to enter the health and life insurance sector as well as its traditional property-casualty insurance business.
CIGNA will be streamlining its operations following a strategic review of its international insurance portfolios.
CIGNA Life Insurance Co., which has roots in Japan dating back to 1987, provides various life and health insurance products, including individual life insurance, universal life insurance, and medical insurance.
Changes in financial regulations and low-interest rates have hurt the insurance unit.
Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. seeks to invigorate the unit with increased capital while taking advantage of the growing demand for health and life insurance among the country's aging population.
"As the Japanese market continues to evolve, we are excited to partner with CIGNA to offer a wider range of products to strengthen our customer experience and competitive advantage," said Akio Kiyotani, President and CEO of Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co.
The deal is part of a wave of consolidation in the Japanese insurance industry driven by changing demographic and intensified by the COVID-19 Pandemic.
MassMutual Japan is part of the U.S.-based MassMutual Financial Group.
With the acquisition of Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co., CIGNA will benefit from a considerable capital injection to enhance its operational efficiency.
The terms of the transaction have not been disclosed. Still, Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. is expected to receive the financial backing required to grow its position in the Japanese insurance market better.
