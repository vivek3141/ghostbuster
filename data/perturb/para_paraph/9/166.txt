The deal, which is expected to close within the next few months, will see Lear Corp. take full control of the privately-held company.
With the acquisition of Borealis, Lear Corp. is looking to provide a total solution for automakers, including everything from seating systems and electronics to complete interior solutions. This move follows a successful year for Lear Corp., who have enjoyed solid demand across all of their product categories, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
This acquisition will allow the integration of Borealis' design, engineering, and manufacturing capabilities.
The acquisition of Borealis also means that Lear Corp. will be able to offer customers a wider range of colors, materials, and finishes for their automotive interiors. The company has already indicated that it will be investing heavily in Borealisâ€™ manufacturing facilities in Sweden, giving it access to state-of-the-art equipment and processes that will further streamline its operations and improve output quality.
In announcing the acquisition, Ray Scott said that the move would grow the company's presence in the automotive interiors market and support its ongoing efforts to provide customers with innovative products that are safe, sustainable, and affordable.
In its mission to build the most comprehensive range of automotive interior components and systems in the world, the acquisition of Borealis marks a significant step forward for Lear Corp.
