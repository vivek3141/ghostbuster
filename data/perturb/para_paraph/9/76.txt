Plato emphasizes the importance of truth in his writings and criticizes the use of rhetoric for personal gain.
Socrates argues that rhetoric is mere flattery and a dangerous art if used without moral considerations. He emphasizes the need for orators to seek truth and pursue the greater good rather than manipulate people's emotions for self-serving purposes. This can be seen when Socrates questions Gorgias about the aim of rhetoric, revealing that Gorgias is more focused on the power it gives him rather than its ethical implications.
The film "Thank You for Smoking" pokes fun at the power of rhetoric.
Plato believes that oratory skills should serve justice and promote genuine knowledge, and he values internal consistency and logical coherence over eloquent speeches lacking substance.
Plato's argument that the power of persuasion must be used ethically is supported by the film "Thank You for Smoking".
In conclusion, Plato's Gorgias presents a critical examination of rhetoric and oratory skills, highlighting the importance of truth and justice in public speaking. The film "Thank You for Smoking" provides a contemporary illustration of Plato's arguments, as it explores the deceptive nature of opportunist rhetoric and the potential for individuals to use their skills to pursue moral ends. Both Plato and the film call for a responsible and ethical use of rhetoric, emphasizing the need to prioritize truth and justice over personal gain.
