In fairytales, there's a way to break the curse when a loved one falls into a deep sleep.
When I saw him fall asleep early after a rough day at work, I smiled and thought of how cute he looked hugging the pillow.
I heard that it's contagious. That the entire ward of the hospital we transported him to was shut down after doctors started dropping to the floors, fast asleep, in the middle of their rounds. The entire place was quarantined.
The public is advised to stay indoors.
And so I did.
Every piece of media I look to continues to cover the story as more and more people are dropping into deep sleep throughout the country. A few reports even cite my husband as patient zero. We're at the point where initial patients are slow starving to death from lack of nutrient intake. This entire epidemic is driving me crazy.
I can't leave the house and I can't go to work.
I don't want to stay inside anymore and PrinceCharming will find a way to do it.
