Consistency of data is a key factor in achieving reliability.
In an experiment testing the effect of a new drug on blood pressure, it is crucial to follow a standardized protocol.
The degree to which a study measures what it claims to measure is called validity.
If a researcher is interested in measuring depression, they can use the Beck Depression Inventory.
Inter-rater reliability checks can be performed to ensure consistent interpretation of qualitative data.
In conclusion, reliability and validity are vital in research, particularly when measuring the relationship between independent and dependent variables.
