In the Heat of the Night
The idea behind Supertom is to make a black character heroic.
Supertom is obtained when a black character is endowed with high achievements and positive characteristics.
The relationship in the movie suggests a kind of friendship between blacks and whites that Americans like to think of as accurate, but that is not the case in the time frame in which In the Heat of the Night takes place.
Do the right thing.
In February 2020, two white men killed Ahmaud Arbery for allegedly robbing someone. In March, two police officers broke into the apartment of Breonna Taylor, who died from their gunshots, during an anti-drug raid. Then comes the culmination – Floyd’s death in May. Therefore, despite the age of creation, Do the Right Thing does not lose its relevance.
The theme of US racism is somehow displayed in most of Spike Lee’s films, and the director’s attitude towards it is invariably critical. While the film ultimately shows how dangerous it is to react to others based on race, ironically, Lee portrays the characters in the film stereotypically through their language and aesthetics. Spike Lee panders to stereotypes by using iconography to represent the various racial groups in the film (Etherington-Wright 236). He does this in various ways, such as having Italian-American characters wear crosses and t-shirts. He also does this in his portrayal of Radio Raheem with an African locket necklace and a big boom box playing loud rap music. Even tertiary characters, for example, a group of Puerto Rican friends, are shown listening to salsa, speaking Spanish, and drinking beer on the porch of their apartment building. During the film’s culmination and the verbal screaming fight between Sal and Buggin’ Out, the former uses racial epithets, telling Radio Raheem to turn off the jungle music and using profanity.
The portrayal of blackness on screen is one of the film's strengths.
