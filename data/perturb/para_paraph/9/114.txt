The building society's initial public offering could be worth 20 billion pounds.
Unveiling a price range and details of share allocations to the society's members, Halifax Chief Executive Mike Blackburn said it "will represent the largest single extension of private share ownership ever witnessed in the UK."
If the IPO had taken place on December 16, the share price would have been between 490 and 450 pence.
This equals a market worth of between 10.4 billion ($17.5 billion) and 12 billion pounds ($20.1 billion), and analysts expect the final outcome to be at the top end of this range given the recent positive performance of the most comparable stock in the market, former mortgage banker Abbey National Plc.
Peter Toeman said that the valuation was in line with expectations.
Other analysts agreed and many expect the price on flotation day to be higher, saying that Friday's figures looked a little conservative.
A basic allocation of 200 shares will be given to each of the qualified members.
A total of 8.0 million voting packs have been sent out by the society.
Investing members will also get a variable share allocation depending on how much money they had in their accounts on particular dates. This will range from 200 shares to a maximum of 1,181 for those with 50,000 pounds ($84,430) or more.
At its special general meeting on Feb. 24, over 50 percent of the investing members must vote in favour of the proposal or it will fail. The society has started a huge advertising campaign to encourage members to vote.
Abbey's position as Britain's fifth-largest publicly-owned bank is likely to be threatened by the fact that the Halifax is expected to be in the top 20 companies by market value.
It said it sees room for huge expansion in the British insurance and long-term savings sectors.
