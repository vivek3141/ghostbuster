I've been able to freeze time and everything within it for as long as I can remember.
During my escapades, I was able to choose which people remained frozen.
It was necessary to use the power to freeze the world so that it wouldn't be abused.
Inspired by the world's problems, I decided to select individuals who possessed unwavering determination and unyielding compassion. First, I chose a nurse who had dedicated her life to saving others. She continued her noble work, caring for patients, even as the world paused. Next, I selected an old man who spent his days feeding the homeless in the city park. Seeing him pour soup into empty bowls while time stood still was a remarkable sight, a testament to his selfless soul. Lastly, I picked a young teacher, whose passion for education lit up the lives of her students. She would continue teaching, tirelessly writing on imaginary chalkboards and calling on imaginary students during the frozen moments.
I became known as the "Phantom Hero", an invisible do-gooder who appeared out of nowhere to aid those in need.
Even though I wanted to make a difference, I felt the burden of manipulating others' lives.
One day, I chose an elderly woman sitting alone on a park bench to be the un-frozen. As she watched me move amidst the suspended world, her eyes sparkled with recognition. Without a word, she smiled. In that moment, I knew she possessed the same power. We were no longer alone, no longer bound by our extraordinary abilities.
Through connection, we discovered the true potential of our power - the power to unite and inspire others to create a better world, frozen or not.
