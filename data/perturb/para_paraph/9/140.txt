A house is more than simply a place to live; in fact, that is only one description of a house. A home is a place where one feels more comfortable and looks forward to living through every day. A house is constructed not with stones or timbers but with the link of family. A person may own every materialistic property on the earth, but it would be not very sensible if he did not have someone with whom to exchange it. In other terms, expressing pleasure is also linguistically tied to home. Additionally, home is more than a physical location; it is a state of mind. They share a sense of joy and pleasure with their family members.
Home is when a person is surrounded by people who make them feel good.
When home takes on a human figure, it is referred to as a family.
We communicate a lot and are both at the same school.
If not all, then one, the feeling of home for me is the place where I can return at any time.
