Stanley walked up the stairs to his boss' office.
Stanley knowing a shorter path went into the elevator and pressed the button 3, to his bosses office.
Stanley walked into his boss' office as soon as the door opened.
Stanley, you can't just plug in the vacuum cleaner, that's not in the script.
What's that I hear, you're a real person?
Well then, let me show you a video on obedience.
Everything in this elevator is broken.
Just walk to the boss' office.
The entire thing is broken and destroyed by you.
I can only remove this project from my computer.
Stanley, goodbye.
