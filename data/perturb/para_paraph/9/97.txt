Sierra Semiconductor Corp.'s stock jumped more than 27 percent Thursday on expectations the company will emerge as a smaller but more profitable operation after it exits the computer modem business.
The San Jose, Calif.-based company's stock gained after its announcement Wednesday that it plans to pull out of the highly competitive modem-chip business and focus instead on the fast-growing market for computer networking equipment.
The stock rose $2.625 to $11.875 in late trading on NASDAQ.
According to an analyst, the company will be a more profitable business now that it is a smaller company.
Sierra still has a lot of work to be done, including cutting as many as 150 jobs from its work force and building up the business of its PMC-Sierra unit, according to analysts.
The company has announced plans to take a charge against earnings of $50 million to $80 million to write down the value of assets and inventories and cover severance payments.
Scott Randall of Soundview Financial Group said the company likely would have difficulty selling its modem-chip business.
He said that announcing your intention to exit a business becomes a complete buyer's market.
While the company is focused on the fastest-growing part of its business, the market for networking chips has begun to attract the attention of larger players such as International Business Machines Corp.
Randall asked if they could make the transition to be a much larger company as the market develops.
Even though the company is expected to shrink to less than half of its current size in sales, other analysts were more bullish.
"It's a positive strategic move," said Miles Kan of Hambrecht & Quist. "The modem business is a low-margin, commodity business," he said.
Sierra's PMC-Sierra unit generated $33 million of the company's $117 million in sales in the first half of the year, compared with $45 million in sales of modem chips, Kan said. But the PMC unit is far more profitable, he said.
Sierra's stock has fallen from a high of nearly $25 this year as the computer chip sector has been battered by falling prices and concern about slowing demand.
