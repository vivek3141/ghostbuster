Home decorating giants ICI Paints and Black & Decker hope their new product to be launched on Wednesday won't make a splash.
The companies claim that the Paintmate will take the pain out of painting.
The Paintmate, which will be sold in do-it-yourself stores across Britain from April, uses an air-filled bellow system to squeeze the contents of a two-litre refill bag of Dulux paint down a tube and onto a roller.
The small, cylindrical Paintmate can be strapped on to the back to eliminate tiresome bending over.
Sanderson said the companies hoped to sell 500,000 of the British-designed, Chinese-made Paintmates in the first full year in Britain, together with a million bags of paint.
If all goes well in Britain, which Sanderson said was "quite a sophisticated DIY market", Paintmate will be rolled out across western Europe next year, after which attention would switch to the huge U.S. home improvement market.
ICI, which sells enough paint in the UK to decorate five million homes a year, hopes the product will revolutionise the way people decorate.
Chris Harris said that people will find it fun.
The whole system could be flushed out with water if the painting process was quicker and easier.
The Paintmate's promoters hope to benefit from a surge in DIY sales, fuelled by an upswing in Britain's temperamental housing market.
