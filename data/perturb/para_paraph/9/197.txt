I have two hands that are different from what I have in my waking life.
I can create and shape worlds in my dreams with these hands.
But there is a darkness that lurks within these dreams too. As the wielder of boundless possibilities, there is a temptation to dabble in the forbidden; to delve into the depths of my subconscious. With this power, I create a parallel universe where my deepest desires and fears collide.
Shadows cling to my fingertips, and an eerie mist follows my every move in this twisted realm.
My hands are used to shape heroes, imbuing them with courage and strength.
When I awake, the memory of these dream hands lingers, twinkling in my mind's eye like distant starlight. Though I cannot physically possess these hands in the waking world, their essence remains. They serve as a reminder of the infinite potential that lies dormant within me, of the untapped power waiting to be unleashed.
I embark on my waking life with a renewed sense of purpose.
