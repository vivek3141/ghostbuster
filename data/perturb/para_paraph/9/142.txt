The move is part of China's push to become a major player in the commercial space industry.
According to reports, China aims to build rockets with a capacity of up to 100 tonnes, which would significantly outpace the 22-tonne capacity of the country's current flagship rocket, the Long March 5.
The new rockets will allow China to compete with established commercial space companies.
Zhou said that the heavier rocket will provide stronger lift capability for space missions, and that it will meet the growing demand of China's satellite industry for rocket launch services.
Just months ago, China launched a successful mission to the far side of the moon.
China is also planning to build its own space station, which is set to launch in 2022. The station will be capable of accommodating three astronauts for up to six months at a time and will be used to conduct scientific research in areas such as astronomy, space medicine, and space physics.
However, China's space ambitions have not been without controversy. The country has been accused of engaging in space militarization, with some experts expressing concerns over the development of anti-satellite weapons.
China has denied these allegations, stating that its space program is purely for peaceful purposes. Nevertheless, the country's growing space capabilities have raised concerns among U.S. policymakers, who see China as a potential rival in the global space race.
The global space industry could be affected by China's plans to build bigger rockets.
However, some experts have raised concerns over the environmental impact of increased rocket launches. The process of launching rockets into space can have a significant impact on the environment, with exhaust pollution contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful pollutants.
Electric rockets could be used to reduce emissions and pollution associated with traditional rocket launches.
China's plans to build bigger rockets for the commercial satellite market are likely to have significant implications for the global space industry.
