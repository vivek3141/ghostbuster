Parents with a pocket full of apocalypse, don't let the boogey man boogie in your closet, you must have forgot to lock it.
It's better to break than continue to bend, snap your soul in two and let it heal.
War of the worlds, obsolete factions matching gains and comparing beef-sticks, just trust in the sky.
