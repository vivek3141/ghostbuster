I knew I could not cook, but I did not sweat it. The door bell rang, and I was so excited. I opened the door and let my two gooey one eyed companions in. They were so glad that they did not even notice my baseball bat. I swung. They were mine now. All mine
The aliens talked about how strange human customs were.
Three weeks later, they were still strapped to their places and woke up, ate, then slept. Jellybeans were their every waking hour. They lived jellybeans loved jelly beans, breathed jelly beans.
On their ninth week they realized what I was doing, but they were powerless. I laughed at them as I broke their jaw hinges. Now they can't complain, so all was wondrous again.
They went on a strike, but I knew it wouldn't last long because of how attached they were to the food.
I broke their jaws, their life, their will. They were now truly mine.
The little trick was starting to get old, so I starved them and told them the only way to get their food was to beat one another up.
The loser alien woke up and saw his friend inject something into him.
The alien that was still alive cried, making inaudible noise for his jaw was broken after all. He demanded his jelly beans. It was not polite enough. His attitude was simply unacceptable. So I kicked him in the gut. I threw him against the wall and told him to be polite. HE WAS THEN KNOCKED OUT. HE COULD NOT PERFORM THE TASK OF ASKING NICELY. HE HAD TO BE KILLED AT ONCE FOR HIS BRUTAL MISBEHAVIOR.
Boy did I love that experience. But I would not miss it. It was a lot of work. Jellybeans are costly after all. I ate my dinner slowly, savoring every bite. Alien flesh tasted so good. I knew it was all worth it. Even though I could not cook well, I knew not to sweat it from the beginning. My plan had been a great success after all.
Do you think I did a good job?
