Drug traffickers are opposed to the change in the country's stance on the issue.
In order to protect the country's sovereignty, the ban was put in place.
The current administration led by President Ivan Duque has been pushing for the ban to be overturned. The country's top court has now approved the move, allowing for the extradition of Colombian nationals who are wanted by foreign countries for drug trafficking.
Drug traffickers responded with force after a car bomb exploded in the capital of the country.
The government has made strides in recent years to combat the issue, but it is an ongoing battle. The government has made strides in recent years to combat the issue, but it is an ongoing battle.
Drug traffickers won't engage in illegal activities if the ban is lifted.
However, the move is not without controversy. Some critics argue that it could lead to a destabilization of the country. They say that drug traffickers will seek revenge on those who cooperate with authorities, and that it could lead to an escalation of violence.
President Duque has made it clear that he is not backing down. He sees the move as a way to send a message to drug traffickers that their reign of terror is over.
"We will not allow drug traffickers to continue to operate with impunity in our country," he said in a statement. "This is a critical step in our fight against drug trafficking, and we will do whatever it takes to bring those responsible to justice."
The United States has been a strong ally in this fight, providing funding and resources to help combat the issue. The United States has been a strong ally in this fight, providing funding and resources to help combat the issue.
