Sorry to be so dour, but I had to write something for that first 3-panel:
[2]
Character 1 - What do you think the fences on the roof are for?
The second character is supposed to stop people from falling.
[3]
Character 1 - Would a fence really stop someone bent on killing themselves?
Character 2 - No, maybe get 'em to use a different building though. They just don't want it to be their problem to deal with.
Character 2 has left the screen.
Character 1 - Maybe if someone did, they wouldn't need the fences anymore...
