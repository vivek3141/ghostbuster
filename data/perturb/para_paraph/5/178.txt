Several high tech giants have come together to announce the release of a new CD-ReWriteable technology for early 1997. The technology is said to be priced below $1,000, which is expected to make it widely accessible to the public.
The CD-ReWriteable technology was unveiled through a joint press conference by Hewlett-Packard, Sony, and Phillips. The new technology is expected to revolutionize the market as it allows people to rewrite over CDs, which brings the storage capacity of CDs to a whole new level.
The CD-ReWriteable technology has numerous applications, especially in the realm of archiving and data storage. It provides an affordable and efficient method for people to store and save their files, which was once a daunting task, especially when it comes to large files and data.
The technology can hold up to 650 megabytes of data and 74 minutes of audio in a single disc, which is double what currently available technology can handle.
The CD-ReWriteable technology is based on phase change technology, which allows the laser beam to rewrite the data on the disc at varying speeds without compromising the integrity of the data.
The technology is expected to have a significant impact on the market, especially for small businesses and individuals who need cost-effective solutions to store their data.
Moreover, with the release of the CD-ReWriteable technology, consumers can expect a drop in the price of standard CD-ROMs since the market will be opened up to more economical alternatives.
Koichi Suzuki of Sony said, "This is an exciting time for the industry and for all those who need to store and access their data regularly."
The CD-ReWriteable technology is a welcome sight for many people as they no longer need to worry about their data being lost or compromised. The technology is expected to be a hit among students, researchers, and professionals, who generate a large amount of data and need easily accessible and reliable storage solutions.
In conclusion, the release of the CD-ReWriteable technology is a breakthrough in the field of storage technology, and it is expected to have a significant impact on the market. The technology's high capacity and affordability make it an ideal choice for people who need to constantly manage and store data. Furthermore, the technology could create new business opportunities, especially for small businesses who need to efficiently store their vital information.
