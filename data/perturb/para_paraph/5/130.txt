The recent sentencing of Chinese dissident, Zhang Chenguang, to 11 years in prison has sparked concerns among Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists. Many fear that this move may be an indication of the Chinese government's increasing efforts to curb freedoms in Hong Kong post-handover.
Critics of the Chinese government who push for greater political freedom and human rights are often charged with subverting state power.
Following his sentencing, many Hong Kong activists spoke out against what they see as a blatant violation of basic human rights and a move towards authoritarianism.
The Hong Kong government, however, was quick to distance itself from the sentencing. In a statement, the government said that "Mr. Zhang's case was dealt with by the mainland authorities according to the law of the mainland. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government would not interfere with the judicial proceedings of the central authorities."
Critics argue that Hong Kong's freedoms have been steadily eroded in recent years, with the government taking an increasingly hardline stance against dissent.
This sentiment was echoed in a recent report by the United States' Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which highlighted "grave concern" over the Chinese government's manipulation of Hong Kong's legal system.
The report called on the US government to consider actions to help protect Hong Kong's democratic system, including sanctions on individuals responsible for undermining the city's freedoms.
Less than a year ago, China imposed a controversial national security law on Hong Kong.
These developments are seen by many as a major blow to Hong Kong's autonomy, which was promised when the city was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997. With growing concern over the erosion of freedoms, many Hong Kong activists are calling on the international community to speak out and take action to protect the city's democratic system.
