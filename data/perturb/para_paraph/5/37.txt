I blinked groggily as I awoke to the faint sound of city traffic. Rubbing my eyes, I realized I was no longer in the cozy comfort of my self-driving car. Confused and disoriented, I peered out of the window, only to find myself surrounded by towering skyscrapers and bustling streets I had never seen before.
Panicking, I desperately attempted to recall how I ended up here. The last thing I remembered was programming my destination on the car's console and activating the auto-darkening windows, hoping to catch some sleep during the long journey. But something had clearly gone wrong.
The air was filled with unfamiliar smells and the language spoken around me was foreign.
My mind raced with questions. Where was I? How had I ended up in a time so distant from my own? Feeling lost and alone, I thought of my loved ones, their faces fading as I traveled further away from home. Tears welled in my eyes as I yearned for familiarity.
I decided to make the most of my journey and learn from it.
