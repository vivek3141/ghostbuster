Foreign companies will be allowed to play a bigger role in the country's power sector.
The State Council, China's cabinet, has approved a draft policy that would allow foreign companies to operate and own a majority stake in power transmission and distribution projects in the country. This marks a significant change from the current policy which limits foreign ownership to a maximum of 49%.
Foreign companies will be allowed to invest in and operate power generation projects in the country, which was previously restricted to domestic firms.
China and the US are at odds over trade and investment.
The move to allow foreign firms to take a bigger role in the power sector is seen as a continuation of these efforts.
The policy change is also in line with China's long-term goal of reducing its dependence on fossil fuels and increasing investment in renewable energy. The country is already the world's largest market for solar and wind power, and the new policy is expected to further boost investment in these areas.
However, the move to allow greater foreign investment in the power sector is likely to face resistance from some quarters in China. Some domestic firms may argue that this could lead to increased competition, while others may express concerns over national security implications.
The move is seen as positive for foreign companies that want to invest in China.
