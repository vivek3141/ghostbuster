She was shaking and I was too, he was dead.
I told her to stand, nicely, I offered her a meek smile, and apologized for what she had seen and what I had to do. I started to explain why, but fuck it, she can't hear anything, *she's in shock Boone, get her inside*. I walk her up the street, she remembers she can't walk in heels. She sees the life on my hands, and that sets her off again. We go inside a shitty mexican restaurant. I sit her down, I go to wash my hands. I do it with my closed, I'm not sure if I wanna look at the guy who looks back at me above the sink. I'm not sure if I wanna be the voice on the phone to the police. I puke in the sink, maybe some got on my shoes.
What am I doing?
