The issue of discrimination against people of color is pervasive despite democracy and international law, argues Beverly Daniel Tatum, a prominent expert on education and psychology.
The book reveals the issue of inequality from multiple angles, and it is demanding to pick out a few leading ideas, as Tatum tries to cover distinct topics in a certain number of pages.
The concern of patience and silence is one of the central themes.
There is a tendency for whites to deny the existence of systemic racism because it is like admitting that they are racist.
There are fundamental issues of discrimination that are particularly acute in education because of the negative racial biases that black children face.
Education contributes to building a global community in which integrity, ethics, non-discrimination, and respect for the rule of law are essential pillars. The author’s central message emphasizes the educator’s role in developing the students’ ability to operate existing or acquired knowledge to alter their behavior. It is necessary to promote proper conduct in appropriate circumstances, such as making ethical decisions and speaking out against discrimination. Fighting something as pervasive as systemic racism may seem like an impossible task for an educator, but Tatum emphasizes that everyone can start with their sphere of influence. Every individual has some impact on the lives of others and is capable of taking small steps that will dismantle racist systems.
The book has undoubtedly valuable sense, though some of the author’s ideas seem exaggerated, such as ubiquitous racism in the media. Daniel Tatum illustrates the discrimination through the Lion King example. According to the author’s beliefs, the good characters are voiced by white people and are portrayed in a lighter shade, and the evil ones are expressed by minorities and are darker. This sample seems irrational because it is evident that no discrimination was intended.
Moreover, no one would think about the skin color of the person who voices the cartoon, let alone any hidden social or racial controversies that it might represent. This example demonstrates that not all of Tatum’s arguments are valid, and one should not look for racism everywhere. If one parses all movies or any media for that matter, one would assume that they are all built on discrimination, even if they are not. It is necessary to encourage proper intentions and equality rather than seeking racism.
In conclusion, Why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria?: And other conversations about race is a book that explains the hardships that people of color experience. Despite the controversial ideas, the author describes the causes of inequality in an accessible manner and points out that everyone can enhance the situation if they take action. Thus, this book is helpful to everyone, especially the educator, who lays the foundation of the relationship between diverse groups of children.
