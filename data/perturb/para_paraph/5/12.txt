One of the vital components of a successful operation of a manufacturing company is supplier evaluation and selection process, which is an overview of other literature on methodologies and criteria used in supplier evaluation and selection process.
The paper starts with various ways to address the issues related to MCDM of suppliersâ€™ selection. The most common ones are stated to be mathematical models, Simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART), analytic network process (ANP), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), data envelopment analysis (DEA), linear programming, and some others. For example, DEA is a methodology focused on a supplier system and classifies it either as efficient or inefficient based on selecting particular criteria. Mathematical programming models usually incorporate complex evaluations between suppliers, allowing one to compare them and identify the most optimal in terms of cost and other criteria.
The popularity of methodologies is compared by the number of mentions in the literature.
It is possible to build an idea of the most prominent ways to address issues with suppliers by knowing this distribution.
