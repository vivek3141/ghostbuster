I love the music. It reflects what is just about to happen. It has saved me from more than a few relationships that would have been unsavory.
I have two theories about the music. Either I am the only one who hears it, or everyone does and no one ever talks about it. Which is fine. Music is a very personal thing after all.
The music will always be at a comfortable level if it is trying to warn me.
There was a rising crescendo ever since I woke up that morning. I turned on the news to watch while eating breakfast, as I always do. Usually the music goes back and forth between dramatic and more more lulling, depending on the news break about to come up. But that morning it didn't change. It just crescendoing until the newscaster spoke.
I could not hear the sound of the World Trade Centers.
As I watched the events unfold, the music continued to be silent. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again.
