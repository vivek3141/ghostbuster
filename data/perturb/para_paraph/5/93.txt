Light rains in Ivory Coast after a dry start to January will help mid-crop (April-Sept) cocoa crop development, particularly if they extend into February, a crop analyst said on Thursday.
"We have seen around average rain levels for January so far but a little more now and in February would help," another local crop analyst told Reuters.
Distribution of rains was patchy.
Most fell in central and northern cocoa and coffee areas, particularly around Man, Daloa, Yamoussoukro and Gagnoa, the data showed. Little fell in coastal areas around San Pedro and Abidjan.
"The front (associated with rain) is now over central areas," said one weather analyst. "Central areas have seen a surplus for the period but southern areas are in deficit," he added.
According to a crop analyst, the rains seem to have reached most cocoa and coffee areas.
"There seem to have been good light showers in most cocoa areas," said the crop analyst after returning from an up-country tour. "There is no dust on most bush tracks."
The dry harmattan conditions from the Sahara had retreated northwards after failing to reach the southern part of the country.
Despite drying efforts, cocoa humidity levels remained around 10 percent against exportable quality of eight percent.
Coffee farmers have had problems with drying, but export activity remained low after 10,492 tonnes were shipped by port sources for October to December.
Quality inspectors said a better picture of coffee humidity and quality after rains would emerge as arrivals picked up.
The second 10 days of January in key growing areas were shown in the data from the national weather station.
Dalao 47.5 mm, Gagnoa 7.8 mm, San Pedro 0.1 mm, Tabou 6.2 mm and Man 0 mm, Dimbokro 4.6 mm, Yamoussoukro 44.8 mm, Aidjan 6 mm, Sassandra n/a, Adiake n/a, Korhogo 0 mm.
No data were available for Adiake and Sassandra.
