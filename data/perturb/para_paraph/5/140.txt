A house is more than just a place to live, it is a place to call home.
Home is when a person is surrounded by people who make them feel good.
For me, home is made up of memories of memorable moments that contributed to shaping and teaching me. As a result, my house is also people, and when home takes on a human figure, it is referred to as a family. I feel that family is a relative concept that is determined by connections rather than blood (Hess). No matter where I go in the future, this atmosphere and these individuals who have shaped me as a human and shown me how to behave will always be a strong foundation for me. I know I can always return home. Indeed, the spirit is where the household is.
My friends and I are both at the same school and we communicate a lot.
In this way, I can summarize and express what home for me is. In this essay, like a home, I show my family and the college where I study. For me, the feeling of home is the place where I can return at any time, and if not all, then one person can definitely help me. Home is a sense of calm and security, and for myself, I single out such a factor as communication. The house is the place where you studied something for a long time and communicated with people who, as a result, became close to me. Feeling at home is an essential feeling for every person because it gives people support and faith in themselves and their loved ones.
