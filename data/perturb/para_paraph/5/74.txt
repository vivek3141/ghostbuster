84 people were killed in a brutal attack against a British police station.
He turned off the television as the newsman began to drone on and on about the many he had killed. No one had yet put the pieces together that he was actually not a normal human. He was a powerful figure, practically a God, able to kill practically anyone, but he could not control himself. He had gone over the plans enough times to know that there were only 64 cops in that Northern Irish station, meaning that he had killed 20 of his best men. "Oh well" he said to himself as he approached the doorway, "It doesn't matter how many I killed, what matters is that no one sees the true point of today." he knocked on the door as he made sure the silencer was fastened firmly on his 1895 Nagant revolver, he'd need to be quiet. "Hello Mr. Barmington!" he said cheerily
The MP asked, "Who are you?"
He said, "If only you could have lived to see how important your death is for our people's freedom."
