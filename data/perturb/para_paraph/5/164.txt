Children's television shows and movies are extensions of capitalist values according to Adorno.
The amount of merchandise associated with popular children's franchises is an example of media products reinforcing capitalist values.
Structural functionalism suggests that media products for children serve a more positive function in society.
While structural functionalism acknowledges the influence of capitalism in media production, it prioritizes the positive social contributions of these media products. This perspective tends to focus on the potential benefits for children's growth and the promotion of social cohesion.
In conclusion, media products for children do reinforce capitalist values to a significant extent, according to Adorno's concept of industrial culture. Examples like the promotional merchandise associated with popular children's franchises emphasize the materialistic nature underlying these products. However, the perspective of structural functionalism offers a more optimistic view, emphasizing the educational and unifying aspects of media products. While both perspectives recognize capitalist influences in media production, they differ in their evaluation of the overall impact on society and children.
