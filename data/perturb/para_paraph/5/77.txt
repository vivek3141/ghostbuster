As long as I can remember, I've had this extraordinary ability to freeze time and everything that exists within it. As a child, it started with small objects - a toy car rolling off the table, a falling glass of water. But as I grew older, so did my power. It expanded beyond inanimate objects and eventually included people. The ability to suspend time, to freeze the world around me, became my extraordinary secret.
Fascinated by my newfound power, I decided to test its limits. I soon discovered that I could choose which people remained unfrozen during my time-stopping escapades. They would continue their activities, ignorant of the frozen world around them. It was a surreal sight to see them moving amidst the motionless backdrop.
I had to use the power to freeze the world wisely, as it could easily be abused.
I chose a nurse who had devoted her life to saving others.
As days turned into weeks and weeks changed to months, I became known as the "Phantom Hero" - an invisible do-gooder who appeared out of nowhere to aid those in need. Little did they know it was I who had the power to halt time and select the un-frozen.
But the knowledge of my gift weighed heavily on my soul. Though I sought to make a difference, I felt the burden of manipulating others' lives. I longed for connection in this timeless void, for someone to see me and understand. I wanted to share my secret, to let someone in on this incredible power.
An elderly woman sitting alone on a park bench was the un-frozen that day.
Through connection, we discovered the true potential of our power - the power to unite and inspire others to create a better world, frozen or not.
