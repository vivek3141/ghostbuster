The first thing the audience at La Scala Opera will hear is Scarpia's motives.
The people will walk out of the opera theatre and go to the caf√©s and restaurants that they've been to many times before.
I don't know if I would ever be able to explain why I moved to Milan.
For one, the Milanese choose to stay out until the ungodly hours of 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, meaning that my food is usually spiked with the residual alcohol from their Lombardy region chardonnay and pinot bianco by the pint. However, even getting past the eternal hangover that is my life, how do I avoid that villainous vegetable that the Italians seem to put in every dish: garlic.
Oh the dreaded aglio. For so often I took it for granted during my time in Vienna. Stakes could be easily enough avoided with good planning (an internally locked coffin with plenty of reinforced steel between my face and the world that might wish to destroy me), but the Austrians never bothered with garlic quite as often as they do here.
Perhaps I might go back to Vienna and dine off the simple people whose beer consumption is admirable as much as it is shameful. Perhaps I will get back to hearing the operas of Strauss and Mozart, or maybe the occasional performance of Marschner's "Der Vampyr." But for now, I sit like Tosca, in a place I should never wish to be waiting for the right moment to make my escape and be free again. Now, this never sleeping city of Milan holds me hostage with the taste of death on everyone's lips.
