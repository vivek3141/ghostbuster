The announcement came hot on the heels of Silver King's acquisition of the Home Shopping Network.
The time is ripe for a new national broadcasting outlet that will be geared toward a younger, more tech savvy audience.
The acquisition of HSN, which is expected to close in the coming weeks, will give Silver King the financial clout necessary to make its new network a reality. HSN, which is a popular home shopping channel, generates revenue of over $2.5 billion per year. Diller believes that the company can leverage HSN's existing customer base to help promote its new network, which he hopes will be available to viewers across a variety of platforms, including traditional television, streaming services, and social media.
"We see a huge opportunity in creating a new type of broadcasting network that is truly designed for the 21st century," he said.
The focus of the new network will be on lifestyle and entertainment.
