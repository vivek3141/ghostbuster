When I dream, I have two hands that are not like the hands I have in my waking life. They possess an otherworldly elegance, yet exude an enigmatic power. I am no longer limited by the physicality of my human form; I am a being capable of transcending boundaries.
In my dreams, these hands allow me to create and shape worlds.
As the wielder of possibilities, I have a temptation to explore the depths of my unconscious.
Shadows cling to my fingertips, and an eerie mist follows my every movement in this twisted realm.
My hands are used to shape heroes, imbuing them with courage and strength.
The dreams of these hands linger in my mind as if they were distant stars.
And so, I embark on my waking life with a renewed sense of purpose, determined to shape my reality. I may not have those fantastical hands in this realm, but I have something equally extraordinaryâ€”my imagination. With it, I can create, craft, and mold my path, just as I do in my dreams. With each step, I move closer to transforming my waking world into something just as enchanting as the ones I conjure when I close my eyes and dream.
