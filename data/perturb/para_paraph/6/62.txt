I always feared death. That is, until I died myself.
For a long time, I was terrified of death, casting a shadow on my happiness.
It happened on an unusually foggy evening. I was driving home after a long, exhausting day at work. The thick mist enveloped the road, creating an eerie atmosphere. As I accelerated, pushing through the dense fog, a sudden flash of headlights jolted me out of my thoughts, and a deafening crash ensued.
I felt pain as I tried to comprehend what had happened.
The paramedics arrived with their sirens blaring, pulling me from the wreckage with careful urgency. As I lay on the cold, hard stretcher, my body ravaged and broken, a strange sense of tranquility washed over me. The constant fear that had plagued my life seemed to dissipate, as if the accident had jolted me awake from my own self-imposed slumber.
In the hospital, I lingered between life and death. Every breath I took was a testament to my fragile existence. Yet, I no longer felt that debilitating fear that had gripped my soul. I was torn between gratitude for still being alive and an inexplicable urge to explore the realm of death.
I immersed myself in books and discussions about death, feverishly seeking answers to the questions that plagued me for so long.
"In the Realm of Death" is a book filled with stories of near-death experiences.
With each turning page, my fear of death gave way to a sense of awe and curiousity. The experiences described within were diverse; some witnesses spoke of boundless love and warmth, while others confronted their deepest regrets and inner demons. It struck me that death was not to be feared but rather approached with wisdom and openness.
Armed with newfound knowledge, I became determined to embrace life fully and release any lingering anxieties. I reconnected with loved ones and engrossed myself in newfound passions. Every day became an opportunity for growth and appreciation, while the fear of death seemed increasingly distant.
Months turned into years, and with each passing day, I shed the remnants of my once fearful existence. My perspective had shifted. Death was no longer the end but rather a transitionâ€”the beginning of a new chapter.
Then, one afternoon while out for a leisurely stroll, I felt a sudden tightness in my chest. The world around me blurred as my heartbeat grew erratic. Gasping for breath, I clutched my chest and collapsed onto the pavement.
Time seemed to stand still as concerned strangers gathered around, their voices fading into an incomprehensible murmur. I could feel the veil of life slipping away, embracing what once frightened me. But this time, there was no panic, no fear. Instead, there was acceptance.
As my consciousness waned, I welcomed death as a friend.
In that final moment, as my heart beat for the last time, I departed this realm and embarked on a journey into the realm of the eternal.
