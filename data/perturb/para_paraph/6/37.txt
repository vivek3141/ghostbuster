I realized I was no longer in the comfort of my self-driving car when I looked out the window.
Panicking, I desperately attempted to recall how I ended up here. The last thing I remembered was programming my destination on the car's console and activating the auto-darkening windows, hoping to catch some sleep during the long journey. But something had clearly gone wrong.
The language spoken around me was foreign and the air was filled with unfamiliar smells.
I wondered how I ended up far away from home.
I decided to make the most of my unexpected journey and learn from it.
