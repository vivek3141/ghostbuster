Mental disorders include manias, phobias, and panic attacks.
When individuals are forced to fight the terrible thoughts torturing their heads and repeat meaningless acts intended to decrease anxiety, they feel abnormal.
  * Dysfunction: This disorder significantly influences the daily life of a patient. Firstly, obsessive thoughts often interfere with the usual people’s acts and cause a surge of panic, disturbing to complete their work. Sometimes, “cognitive biases cause dysfunctional beliefs” (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020, p. 2). Secondly, compulsive actions interrupt a patient’s daily routine, forcing them to do specific steps a certain number of times. Such activities can last even for an hour or more: therefore, the extent of dysfunction is also noticeable.
Sometimes, people feel so depressed that they are ready to commit suicide, and they can strike themselves to get rid of the unwanted.
It is not easy to determine the degree of deviation from the norm.
