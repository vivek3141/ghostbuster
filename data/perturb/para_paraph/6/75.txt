It always puzzled me, to say the least, and made me extremely nervous.
As such I never committed into relationships, probably by great of having my feelings not reciprocated.
The man I loved the most was Indy, and he was the opposite of me.
I don't know why we stayed together for a couple of years, but it seemed like he had feelings for me.
I reject him when I feel my feelings growing, like I did in other relationships.
I learned later that he was with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of times when we were together.
It ended the same way when I met other men and women.
Indy was in the hospital after being hit by a car, and Kelly called me to let me know.
And here I am, a bouquet of flowers in hands, nervously looking for room 68.
I find it, half opened, and take a deep breath to give myself courage, and here Indy's weak voice.
"Kelly, you're...a wonderful girl but...I...I...I never loved you."
The words hit me like a punch. I storm in the room, but his eyes are already closed. Forever.
