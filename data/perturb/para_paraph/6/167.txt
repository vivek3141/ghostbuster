They caught up with me while I was in the interrogation room.
With a glimmer of satisfaction in their eyes, the detectives asked me to recount my first kill. The room fell silent as my mind wandered back to that fateful night. I was just a broken teenager, desperate for revenge against a world that had betrayed me.
Her name was Emily. Fragile and lost, she became my first victim, the catalyst for the darkness within me to awaken. I had watched her from afar, learning her routine, her vulnerabilities. That night, I carefully orchestrated my entrance into her life. As she slept soundly, unaware of the force that crept closer, I raised the blade. 
As the steel kissed her skin, I felt a mixture of fear and excitement.
The detectives realized that there was no redemption for me after they were horrified by my twisted tale.
