Colombia has long been a hub for drug trafficking, but the country is taking steps to crack down on the issue by overturning its extradition ban. The move is facing backlash from drug traffickers who are seeking to prevent the extradition of their associates.
The ban was put in place in the 1990s as a way to protect the country's sovereignty. However, it has since become a roadblock in the fight against drug trafficking. Colombian authorities have found it difficult to prosecute drug traffickers who flee the country when they are under investigation.
The ban was being pushed for to be overturned by the current administration.
Drug trafficking organizations in the country have responded with force. Just this week, a car bomb exploded in the capital of Bogota, killing several people and injuring dozens more. The attack has been linked to a group known as the National Liberation Army, which is believed to have ties to drug trafficking.
Colombia has long struggled with drug trafficking, which has fueled violence and corruption in the country. The government has made strides in recent years to combat the issue, but it is an ongoing battle.
The move to lift the extradition ban is seen as a crucial step in the fight against drug trafficking. The government hopes it will encourage drug traffickers to think twice before engaging in illegal activities.
However, the move is not without controversy. Some critics argue that it could lead to a destabilization of the country. They say that drug traffickers will seek revenge on those who cooperate with authorities, and that it could lead to an escalation of violence.
President Duque has made it clear that he is not backing down. He sees the move as a way to send a message to drug traffickers that their reign of terror is over.
He said that they will not allow drug traffickers to operate with impunity.
The United States has been a strong ally in this fight, providing funding and resources to help combat the issue. The United States has been a strong ally in this fight, providing funding and resources to help combat the issue.
