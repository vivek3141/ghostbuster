One of the major challenges facing China's economy is the unemployment of workers from state-owned enterprises.
Despite these concerns, China's private sector has been providing new job opportunities for the large numbers of workers who are being laid off from state-owned enterprises. According to official figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics, private enterprises created an impressive 13.73 million new jobs in the first nine months of 2021. This constitutes a 50.7% increase over the same period last year when only 9.05 million new jobs were created in the private sector. 
There were more layoffs in the state sector in the first half of the year than in the same period last year.
One reason for the shift towards private employment is the economic growth and the increasing demand for services. As consumers in China are becoming wealthier, the service sector has been expanding rapidly, providing new employment opportunities in areas such as retail, hospitality and healthcare. In fact, the service sector has been the largest contributor to new job creation in the private sector with 41% of the new jobs created in 2021 coming from this sector. 
Another factor contributing to the success of the private sector in absorbing laid-off workers is the government's supportive policies. In response to concerns about job losses, the Chinese government has been proactive in encouraging private sector growth and supporting laid-off workers. In 2021 the government has implemented a range of measures, including tax cuts, a reduction in social security fees, and government subsidies for the training of workers. Additionally, the government has created special funds to support small- and medium-sized enterprises, which are often the most likely employers of laid-off workers. 
While the private sector has been expanding rapidly, it is important to note that job creation is not evenly distributed across all regions in China. The coastal provinces have been the most successful in creating new jobs, with regions such as Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu the most active in private sector job creation. However, the situation is more difficult for workers in less developed inland regions where the private sector is less developed and government policy support is limited. 
China has made progress in addressing the issue of unemployment, thanks to the private sector and government policies.
