Climate change is an important topic for research.
I don't know much about the topic, but I know that the release of radioactive materials caused a lot of diseases and deaths.
I want to learn more about the reasons that led to the disaster and whether it could have been avoided. Also, I want to investigate the reasons behind the decision of the USSR government to conceal the truth and not let people save their lives.
The values, assumptions, and beliefs I have related to the topic are two different things.
My opinion about the topic is that people should learn from such disasters and use this devastating lesson in the future. However, my perspective is very closely connected to the current world situation. The relevant events happening due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are alarming. In the context of my topic, I should note that a few days ago, Russians attacked Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which is the largest in Europe (Borger & Henley, 2022). Whereas the very question of the Russian invasion of Ukraine is highly tragic and relevant, I will focus on the nuclear plants’ seizure in this paper. Russians seized Chornobyl and Zaporizhzhia nuclear plants, and they seem not to realize what aftermath explosions there could bring.
I want to investigate the topic of the Chornobyl nuclear because it seems that history has not taught some people anything.
