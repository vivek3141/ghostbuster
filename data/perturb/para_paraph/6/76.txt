Plato criticizes the use of rhetoric for personal gain and highlights the importance of truth in his writings.
Socrates argues that rhetoric is mere flattery and a dangerous art if used without moral considerations. He emphasizes the need for orators to seek truth and pursue the greater good rather than manipulate people's emotions for self-serving purposes. This can be seen when Socrates questions Gorgias about the aim of rhetoric, revealing that Gorgias is more focused on the power it gives him rather than its ethical implications.

This can be seen in the dialogue when Socrates questions Callicles, who believes in the superiority of those who can use rhetoric to satisfy their desires. Socrates challenges Callicles to defend his position logically, exposing the flaws in his argument and proving that rhetoric alone cannot lead to a just society.
