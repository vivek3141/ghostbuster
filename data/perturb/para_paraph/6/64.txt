Stanley walked up the stairs to his boss' office.
Stanley knowing a shorter path went into the elevator and pressed the button 3, to his bosses office.
Stanley walked into his boss' office as soon as the door opened.
Stanley, you can't just plug in the vacuum cleaner, that's not in the script.
What's that I hear, you're a real person?
Let me show you a video about obeying.
Oh, let's see everything in this elevator is broken.
However, all hope is not lost, now just walk to the boss' office!
This entire thing is broken and destroyed by you, you careless jerk.
I only have the power to remove this project from my computer.
Goodbye, Stanley.
