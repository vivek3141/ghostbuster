Despite the trade tension between China and the US, Hong Kong's air cargo handling increased in August.
The HKIA said that the increase in air cargo volume was due to exports.
In August, the airport handled a total of 434,000 tonnes of cargo.
Despite the ongoing trade war, HKIA continues to be competitive, offering airlines and shippers access to extensive air and sea networks and a logistics industry hub. The airport is preparing for future growth by constructing a third runway to handle more traffic and expanding its cargo terminal facilities.
Despite the uncertain global economic environment, HKIA remains optimistic about future growth.
