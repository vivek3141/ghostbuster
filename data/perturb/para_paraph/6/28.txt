A gunshot rang out, shaking the very foundations of Sasha's world.
The sound of gunpowder exploding was normal.
It wasn't holding her lover's dying form in her own arms.
She had treated gun wounds on the field before, saved lives with her work, but now she found her hands shaking and unable to call for help.
She knew doctors weren't supposed to treat patients close to them but there was no guarantee the ambulance would make it on timeâ€¦
Elizabeth ran down the stairs into the lap of the person waiting on the couch.
"Mama, tell me a story!"
"How about a story of where your name came from?" the girl asked, as she put her chin into the crook of her hand.
