A place to call home is more than just a place to live.
A home is when one understands they are around individuals who can run them nuts in a second and make them feel good in the very same second. Home signifies that no matter what one is experiencing or how difficult life becomes, there will always be someone watching out for them. When a person is secure enough to provide an honest account of themselves, they know they will be accepted definitively. For myself, I can single out a few places where I feel at home. This work was written with the aim of explaining oneâ€™s own concept of home and a place where a person feels at home.
For me, home is made up of memories of memorable moments that contributed to shaping and teaching me. As a result, my house is also people, and when home takes on a human figure, it is referred to as a family. I feel that family is a relative concept that is determined by connections rather than blood (Hess). No matter where I go in the future, this atmosphere and these individuals who have shaped me as a human and shown me how to behave will always be a strong foundation for me. I know I can always return home. Indeed, the spirit is where the household is.
We communicate a lot and are both at the same school.
If not all, then one, the feeling of home for me is the place where I can return at any time.
