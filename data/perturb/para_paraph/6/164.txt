Adorno sees children's television shows and movies as extensions of capitalist values.
The amount of merchandise associated with popular children's franchises is an example of media products reinforcing capitalist values.
Contrasting Adorno's perspective, structural functionalism suggests that media products for children serve a more positive function in society. According to this approach, these products fulfill children's developmental and educational needs, providing them with entertaining and informative content. For instance, educational shows like "Sesame Street" have been praised for their ability to foster learning and social development among children. Moreover, the media also serves to unify society by providing cultural narratives and shared experiences.
While structural functionalism acknowledges the influence of capitalism in media production, it prioritizes the positive social contributions of these media products. This perspective tends to focus on the potential benefits for children's growth and the promotion of social cohesion.
