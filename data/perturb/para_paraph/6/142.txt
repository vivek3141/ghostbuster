China has announced plans to build bigger rockets that can accommodate heavier payloads for commercial satellite market expansion. The move is part of China's growing push to become a major player in the commercial space industry.
The Long March 5 has a 22-tonne capacity.
The new rockets will allow China to compete with established commercial space companies.
Speaking about the plans, Zhou Yanfei, deputy chief engineer at the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), said: "The heavier rocket will provide stronger lift capability for space missions. It will meet the growing demand of China's satellite industry for rocket launch services."
The announcement comes just months after China launched a successful mission to the far side of the moon.
China is also planning to build its own space station, which is set to launch in 2022. The station will be capable of accommodating three astronauts for up to six months at a time and will be used to conduct scientific research in areas such as astronomy, space medicine, and space physics.
However, China's space ambitions have not been without controversy. The country has been accused of engaging in space militarization, with some experts expressing concerns over the development of anti-satellite weapons.
China has denied these allegations, stating that its space program is purely for peaceful purposes. Nevertheless, the country's growing space capabilities have raised concerns among U.S. policymakers, who see China as a potential rival in the global space race.
China's plans to build bigger rockets for the commercial satellite market could also have implications for the global space industry. With China entering the market, established players such as SpaceX may face increased competition, potentially driving down prices and increasing innovation in the sector.
However, some experts have raised concerns over the environmental impact of increased rocket launches. The process of launching rockets into space can have a significant impact on the environment, with exhaust pollution contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful pollutants.
As such, there are calls for the space industry to develop more environmentally-friendly launch systems. One potential solution is the use of electric rockets, which would significantly reduce emissions and pollution associated with traditional rocket launches.
The global space industry is likely to be affected by China's plans to build bigger rockets.
