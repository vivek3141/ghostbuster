The European conquest and colonization of the Caribbean region in the 15th and 17th centuries was aided by a number of factors.
The Caribbean had a lot of resources that were valuable to Europe at the time.
The impact of diseases brought by European colonizers led to the decline of the indigenous population in the Caribbean.
The decline of Spanish power allowed other European nations to establish colonies in the Caribbean.
The colonization of the Americas mainland diverted resources from the Caribbean and led to the decline of Spanish power.
The abundance of valuable resources, the availability and utilization of African slave labor, and the decline of Spanish power all contributed to the European conquest and colonization of the Caribbean region in the 15th and 17th centuries.
