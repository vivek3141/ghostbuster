Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists fear that the Chinese government may be trying to curb freedom in Hong Kong.
Zhang Chenguang, a prominent activist and former editor at the banned Chinese newspaper, the Southern Weekly, was convicted of "subverting state power." This charge is often used against critics of the Chinese government who push for greater political freedom and human rights.
Following his sentencing, many Hong Kong activists spoke out against what they see as a flagrant violation of basic human rights and a move towards authoritarianism. Democracy activist, Joshua Wong, tweeted that "Beijing's crackdown in Hong Kong is increasingly brazenâ€¦ officials are now going after mainland dissidents."
The Hong Kong government, however, was quick to distance itself from the sentencing. In a statement, the government said that "Mr. Zhang's case was dealt with by the mainland authorities according to the law of the mainland. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government would not interfere with the judicial proceedings of the central authorities."
Critics argue that Hong Kong's freedoms have been steadily eroded in recent years, with the government taking an increasingly hardline stance against dissent.
This sentiment was echoed in a recent report by the United States' Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which highlighted "grave concern" over the Chinese government's manipulation of Hong Kong's legal system and the erasure of the city's autonomy.
The report called on the US government to consider actions to help protect Hong Kong's democratic system, including sanctions on individuals responsible for undermining the city's freedoms.
Less than a year ago, China imposed a controversial national security law on Hong Kong.
These developments are seen as a blow to Hong Kong's autonomy, which was promised when the city was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
