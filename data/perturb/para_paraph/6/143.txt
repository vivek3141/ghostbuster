As the sun set, Sarah opened her eyes to see a new day.
Sarah was determined to find out what happened, and she retraced her steps from the previous day.
Months went by, revealing no medical explanations. Desperation and isolation engulfed Sarah's once vibrant spirit. But one evening, while gazing at the night sky, she spotted what seemed like a shooting star. A seed of hope ignited within her.
The ancient legends of a mystical realm were discovered by Sarah.
She performed an ancient ceremony by her window while she closed her eyes.
She realized that sometimes we must venture beyond the known to regain what we have lost.
