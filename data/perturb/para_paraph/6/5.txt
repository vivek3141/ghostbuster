Don't let the boogey man boogie in your closet, you must have forgotten to lock it, parents with a pocket full of apocalypse.
It's better to break than continue to bend, snap your soul in two and let it heal.
War of the worlds, obsolete factions matching gains and comparing beef-sticks, equipped to rip shit, just trust in the sky.
