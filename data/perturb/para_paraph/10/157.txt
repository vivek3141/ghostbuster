When a loved one falls into a deep sleep, there's a way to break the curse.
When I saw him fall asleep early after a rough day at work, I smiled and thought of how cute he looked hugging the pillow.
I heard that it's contagious. That the entire ward of the hospital we transported him to was shut down after doctors started dropping to the floors, fast asleep, in the middle of their rounds. The entire place was quarantined.
The public is advised to stay indoors.
And so I did.
As more and more people are falling into deep sleep, my husband is listed as patient zero in a few reports.
I can't leave the house and I can't go to work.
I don't want to stay inside anymore and PrinceCharming will find a way to do it.
