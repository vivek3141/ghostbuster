Mental disorders include manias, phobias, and panic attacks.
Individuals feel abnormal when they are forced to fight the terrible thoughts and repeat meaningless acts to decrease anxiety.
The daily life of a patient is influenced by this disorder.
Sometimes people feel so depressed that they are ready to commit suicide, and they can strike themselves to get rid of the unwanted.
  * Deviance: Since OCD causes abnormal thoughts and behavior, people with such a disorder can be characterized as deviant. However, it would be wrong to claim that it is easy to “determine the degree of deviation from the norm” (Davis, 2009, p. 1). OCD causes anxiety, stress, and panic; it makes people live in fear that if they do not do specific actions, they will not be able to avoid danger. Therefore, an individual should visit a clinic and let specialists help them fight.
