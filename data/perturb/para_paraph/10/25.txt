Australia-based transport equipment hire and logistics firm, Brambles Industries Ltd, reported a 15.8 percent profit lift for the 1995/96 year on Friday despite flat Australian and European economies.
Surging profits from Brambles' U.S. and European CHEP pallet hire joint venture with Britain's GKN Plc compensated for otherwise slow growth from Australia, the company said.  
The continued improvement in our performance is a reflection of the successful retionalisation of our wholly owned businesses and strong growth from our CHEP joint ventures.
"CHEP USA, in particular, continues to justify our confidence in its long term growth prospects in the region," he said.
Brambles' net profit rose to A$215.1 million (US$169.9 million) for the year to June 30, 1997 from A$97.7 million in 1994/95, but the previous year's result was undermined by a large abnormal loss.  
Pre-abnormal profits for 1995/96 rose 15.8 percent to A$214.8 million, at the top end of analysts' expectations.
Pre-tax profits rose 13 percent and 30 percent from Europe and the United States respectively, while Australian profits rose eight percent.
"Overseas profits grew at twice the rate in Australia and the trend is likely to continue," Fletcher said.
He said that there will be more contributions from CHEP in Europe and North America.
The strong performance from the non-Australian operations had encouraged the company to look for more acquisitions outside Australia.
"You should expect some acquisition work in the Northern Hemisphere, but we already operate in here," he said, referring to areas like transport equipment rentals and records managements.
He said strong contributions from the United States and Europe should help offset soft Australian conditions and help produce profit growth.
"We don't have an expectation that we will get a lot of help from this economy," he said.
The result generally pleased analysts, who pointed to the strong U.S. pallet operations as the main bullish note.
"CHEP USA is the outstanding area," said Macquarie Equities analyst Ian Myles.
"As long as they're saying positive things about CHEP in the USA then they'll be alright and there's a reasonable amount of momentum there," another Sydney transport analyst said.  
The shares closed up five cents at A$18.90 against a soft market overall.
