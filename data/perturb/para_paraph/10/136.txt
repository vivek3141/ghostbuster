The first thing the audience at La Scala Opera will hear is Scarpia's motives.
The people will leave the opera theatre and go to the cafes and restaurants that they've been to before.
I don't know if I would ever be able to explain why I moved to Milan.
For one, the Milanese choose to stay out until the ungodly hours of 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, meaning that my food is usually spiked with the residual alcohol from their Lombardy region chardonnay and pinot bianco by the pint. However, even getting past the eternal hangover that is my life, how do I avoid that villainous vegetable that the Italians seem to put in every dish: garlic.
During my time in Vienna, I took the aglio for granted, but the Austrians never bothered with it.
I might go back to Vienna and eat some of the people who drink beer.
