The partnership with Bank of Scotland marks the entry into retail banking of one of the UK's largest supermarket chains.
Sainsbury's Bank will offer a range of products including personal loans, credit cards, and savings accounts, as well as insurance and mortgages. The supermarket has also pledged to offer competitive rates and rewards programmes to attract customers. 
Speaking about the launch, Sainsbury's CEO Simon Roberts said: "As a trusted brand with millions of customers across the UK, we are well-placed to offer banking services that meet their changing financial needs. We are excited to be partnering with Bank of Scotland, which shares our commitment to customer service and innovation." 
The partnership with Bank of Scotland will see a range of banking services integrated into Sainsbury's stores, giving customers the convenience of being able to manage their banking and shopping in one place. Sainsbury's Bank will also offer digital banking and mobile app services. 
The move into banking is a major strategic shift for Sainsbury's, which has been steadily expanding its financial services offering over the past decade.
It will face competition from other retailers who already have their own banking services.
Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at Investec, said: "Sainsbury's is taking a smart, low-risk and potentially high-reward step into the banking market."
However, others have warned that Sainsbury's may struggle to compete with the big banks, which have much larger customer bases and more resources. David Watts, a banking consultant at McKinsey, said: "Sainsbury's will need to offer something truly unique to entice customers away from the established banks. It will also need to invest heavily in customer service and technology to stay competitive." 
According to a recent survey by the supermarket, nearly half of its customers would be interested in using its banking services.
The launch of Sainsbury's Bank represents a major milestone for the UK retail banking sector, which has seen increasing competition from non-traditional players in recent years. With its established customer base and innovative products, Sainsbury's looks set to shake up the market and give the big banks a run for their money.
