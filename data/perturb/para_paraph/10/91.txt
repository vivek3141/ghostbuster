Adam was looking forward to the Sunday service at St. Mary's Church, but something strange was about to happen.
The symbolic body and blood of Jesus were believed to be shared amongst the faithful.
He took a sip and then passed it along, oblivious to the impending chaos.
The church's walls became a kaleidoscope of colors as the service continued.
While some in the congregation panicked, others embraced the hallucinations, believing it to be a divine experience.
The clergy continued the service while they were unaware of what had happened.
As abruptly as it had begun, the hallucinations started to fade. The vibrant colors dimmed, and the walls of the church returned to their mundane state. The congregation slowly regained their senses, looking around in confusion and disbelief.
The revelation of the source of the experience caused some to question the separation between the sacred and the profane.
Life at St. Mary's would never be the same after that Sunday service.
