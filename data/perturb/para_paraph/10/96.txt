The scene before me remained the same as I slowly opened my eyes as the morning sun peeked through the curtains.
It felt like a dream, just a moment ago I was living a modern life, surrounded by technology and convenience.
The streets were lined with cobblestones and the air was filled with the sound of horseshoes.
The boy said it was the year of the Lord.
My mind reeled. Middle Ages? How? I had so many questions, but I knew I had to adapt quickly. Desperately trying to make sense of my situation, I decided to visit the local cathedral.
The spires of the grand structure were reaching for the heavens as I entered.
I immersed myself in this strange new world, learning its ways and customs as I lay down to sleep.
My heart ached for the familiarity of the buzzing city streets, the soft glow of electric lights, and the soothing hum of technology. Yet, I knew I had to accept my reality. I had to appreciate this unique opportunity to experience life in a world long gone.
I realized that I had changed when I watched the sunset over the medieval town.
Love flourished within the hearts of men and women in the ancient world.
And so, as I walked through the stone streets, under the watchful gaze of the towering cathedral, I embraced my new reality. For who knows, perhaps this dream had awakened me to a life I never knew I craved.
