I have been able to freeze time for as long as I can remember.
I was able to choose which people remained unfrozen during my escapades.
It was necessary to use the power to freeze the world so that it wouldn't be abused.
I chose a nurse who had devoted her life to saving others.
As days turned into weeks and weeks changed to months, I became known as the "Phantom Hero" - an invisible do-gooder who appeared out of nowhere to aid those in need. Little did they know it was I who had the power to halt time and select the un-frozen.
Even though I wanted to make a difference, I felt the burden of manipulating others' lives.
An elderly woman sitting alone on a park bench was the un-frozen that day.
Together, we wandered through the frozen world, selecting those who would carry on their remarkable deeds amidst the stillness. Through connection, we discovered the true potential of our power - the power to unite and inspire others to create a better world, frozen or not.
