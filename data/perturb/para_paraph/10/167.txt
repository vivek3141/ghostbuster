I was in the interrogation room when they caught up with me.
I was silent when the detectives asked me to recount my first kill.
The catalyst for the darkness within me to awaken was Emily.
My hand trembled with a mix of fear and exhilaration as the steel kissed her skin. I cannot deny the intoxicating power coursing through my veins, knowing I held her very life in my hands. In that moment, I saw her life force escape her body, extinguished by my hand. The feeling was indescribable.
The detectives were horrified by my twisted tale and realized that there was no redemption for me.
