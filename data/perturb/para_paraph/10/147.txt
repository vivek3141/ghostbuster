The ODS, Vaclav Klaus' political party, won twelve out of 27 seats in the Senate elections.
The Czech Prime has been given a boost by the emergence of the ODS as the largest party in the Senate.
Klaus is considering rearranging the cabinet.
The road to obtaining a larger mandate, however, is not likely to be easy for the Prime Minister. Opposition parties have condemned his plan to call early elections, arguing that it would be a waste of taxpayers' money and that it is too soon to make such a move. Some members of the governing coalition have also expressed skepticism about Klaus' quest for a larger mandate, with some accusing him of being too authoritarian and not listening to the voices of other political groups.
Klaus is optimistic that he can get the necessary support to strengthen his political position.
The Czech Republic is beset by political uncertainty.
Klaus is expected to continue his quest for a larger mandate in the coming weeks and months. His next big test will come in the regional elections due to be held in November. These elections will be closely watched to see whether the ODS can maintain its momentum, and whether Klaus can gain enough support to push ahead with his political agenda.
The Czech Prime Minister's quest for a larger mandate will be a topic of much debate and scrutiny in the weeks and months ahead. It remains to be seen whether he can overcome the challenges he faces and achieve his political goals.
