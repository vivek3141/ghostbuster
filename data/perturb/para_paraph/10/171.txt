China's usually rubber stamp parliament failed on Monday to pass an anti-corruption bill after the proposed law fell victim to fierce debate over whether it should specifically target government officials.
State media had reported heated discussion at the week-long session of the standing committee of the National People's Congress, or parliament, that closed on Monday.
Disputes among China's usually tame lawmakers ranged from controversy surrounding the scope of the death penalty as contained in proposed amendments of the criminal law to whether corrupt state managers should be executed.
The draft law on administrative supervision, which was due to be adopted this week, was eventually withdrawn from voting.
The law was withdrawn because legislators disagreed with the name of the law, it said.
Some lawmakers believed the bill should be named the Law On Administrative Supervision in line with its regulation of the government.
However, they ran into opposition on constitutional grounds from legislators who argued it should be called simply the Law on Supervision, without reference to the administration, Xinhua said, but did not elaborate.
The issue should be put forward for a vote at the next standing committee session.
The Communist Party's grip on power is being threatened by a cancer that Beijing has called a cancer, but many Chinese say enforcement of anti-corruption measures at senior levels is patchy.
State media said that debate had swirled around amendments to combat corruption, including more than 60 clauses that would specifically define draft and dereliction of duty, while increasing to 32 from seven the types of officials subject to the law.
One source of contention was the designation of managers of state firms as government employees, who are subject to a maximum penalty of death for corruption, it said.
According to one body of opinion, 75 percent of official cases of corruption involve state enterprise managers.
Others argued this was unfair since managers of non-state firms faced a maximum of only 15 years in jail for graft.
The criminal law said that all should be treated the same, according to the newspaper.
The failure of the anti-corruption law to pass came as senior leaders considered whether to punish scandal-hit former Beijing Party boss Chen Xitong -- the highest-ranking victim of China's anti-corruption campaign -- for dereliction of duty.
The law gives prosecutors the power to freeze a suspect's bank accounts.
In the first 11 months of 1996, Chinese prosecutors had begun action in 77,611 cases of corruption, bribery and economic crime and had dealt with 33,879 cases, up year-on-year 9.4 percent, the media said.
Corruption was virtually wiped out in the years after the communists took over in 1949 but has staged a comeback after economic reforms were introduced 17 years ago.
