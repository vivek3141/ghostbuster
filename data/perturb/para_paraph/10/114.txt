Britain's largest mortgage lender, the Halifax Building Society, said Friday its planned initial public offering in June could be worth as much as 12 billion pounds ($20 billion).
It will be the largest extension of private share ownership ever witnessed in the UK, according to the chief executive of the society.
If the IPO had taken place on December 16, the share price would have been between 490 and 450 pence.
This equals a market worth of between 10.4 billion ($17.5 billion) and 12 billion pounds ($20.1 billion), and analysts expect the final outcome to be at the top end of this range given the recent positive performance of the most comparable stock in the market, former mortgage banker Abbey National Plc.
"The valuation of 12 billion (pounds) is right in line with our expectations," said Peter Toeman, banking analyst at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.
Friday's figures looked conservative, but other analysts think the price will go up.
A basic allocation of 200 shares will be given to qualified members.
A total of 8.0 million voting packs have been sent out by the society.
Investing members will get a variable share allocation based on how much money they have in their accounts.
The society has started a huge advertising campaign to encourage members to vote.
The Halifax is expected to be in the top 20 companies by market capitalisation in the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip firms and is sure to threaten Abbey's position as Britain's fifth-largest publicly-owned bank.
It said it sees room for huge expansion in the British insurance and long-term savings sectors.
