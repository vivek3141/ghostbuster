I let my two friends in because I was so excited.
The two alien awoke to "gourmet" jellybeans. They stuffed themselves, those crude idiotic blobs. Smiling they commented on how strange human customs were. That was quite funny, considering what I really had planned. I laughed at them.
They woke up, ate, and slept for three weeks.
They were powerless when I broke their jaw hinges on their ninth week.
By the next week they went on a jellybean strike, but I knew that would not last long, considering how attached to the food they were.
They were now mine after I broke their jaws.
I told them the only way to get their food was to beat each other up, because the little trick was getting old.
The loser alien woke up and saw his friend inject the deadly dose of Jelly beans into his body.
The alien that was still alive cried, making inaudible noise for his jaw was broken after all. He demanded his jelly beans. It was not polite enough. His attitude was simply unacceptable. So I kicked him in the gut. I threw him against the wall and told him to be polite. HE WAS THEN KNOCKED OUT. HE COULD NOT PERFORM THE TASK OF ASKING NICELY. HE HAD TO BE KILLED AT ONCE FOR HIS BRUTAL MISBEHAVIOR.
I ate my dinner slowly, savoring every bite, even though I could not.
Do you think I did a good job with BookWyrm17?
