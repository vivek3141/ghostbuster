In the first half of the year, income from scratchcard sales fell by over 450 million pounds.
The National Lottery will have a second weekly draw on February 5 and will be held every Wednesday thereafter, according to the chief executive.
This compares with pre-tax profit of 36.2 million pounds and sales of 2.51 billion pounds in the same period a year ago.
The total dividend paid by the five companies was 10 million pounds, up from 9.5 million.
Two thirds of the adult population regularly buy tickets for the Saturday draw, an event which is televised live and has become a ritual for many Britons.
But sales of Camelot's "Instants" scratchcards fell from 871 million pounds last year to 419 million this time.
The decline in scratchcard sales was expected.
The Chairman said that sales of Instants have fallen since their launch and are now settled at 17 million pounds a week.
The second weekly draw should boost sales of National Lottery game tickets by 15-20 percent from their current weekly average of 69 million.
Camelot said that over one billion pounds -- 50 percent of turnover -- had been handed out in prize money in the first half and that 567 million pounds had gone to "Good Causes" -- including charities and projects in sports and the arts.
Camelot, which has been granted a seven-year licence, said that over 40 percent of turnover went to "Good Causes" and the governnment in duties, making it the world's most efficient lottery operator.
Profit after tax is just under one percent of total sales and Holley dismissed criticisms of Camelot's performance.
He said that foreign lottery companies were confused by the atacks.
The group confirmed plans to set up The Camelot Foundation to support organisations helping the disadvantaged and disabled.
