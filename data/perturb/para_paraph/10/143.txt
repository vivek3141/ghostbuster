As the sun set, Sarah saw a new day.
Sarah went back to the previous day to find out what happened.
Sarah saw a shooting star while gazing at the night sky.
Sarah discovered ancient legends of a mystical realm where dreams and reality intertwined.
She performed an ancient ceremony by her window while she closed her eyes.
She realized that sometimes we must venture beyond the known to regain what we have lost.
