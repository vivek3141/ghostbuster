The business case for the Centers for Diabetes appears to be positive since the project is closely aligned with the needs of the community and the targets set by theAffordable Care Act.
First and foremost, the idea of a community health center that addresses the community health needs is closely aligned with the value-based care and the community focus that are the targets set by ACA.
The only way to mitigate this risk is to begin marketing and outreach activities as soon as the project is approved and there is funding to support the further stages of operations. In this way, the community will become familiarized with the hospital and the Center, and even if other similar initiatives arise, this Center will already have an established brand image, which can guarantee that it will also have visitors.
The second significant issue identified in the report is the financial statements, since based on the assessments, the reimbursements, revenue, and grant funding will be insufficient to cover the costs of staffing and operations.
The Center for Diabetes should consider two main concerns.
