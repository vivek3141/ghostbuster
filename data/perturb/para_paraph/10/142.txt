China is trying to become a major player in the commercial space industry.
The country's current flagship rocket, the Long March 5, has a 22-tonne capacity.
The new rockets will be able to launch multiple satellites at once, allowing China to compete with established commercial space companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin.
Speaking about the plans, Zhou Yanfei, deputy chief engineer at the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), said: "The heavier rocket will provide stronger lift capability for space missions. It will meet the growing demand of China's satellite industry for rocket launch services."
Just months ago, China launched a successful mission to the far side of the moon.
The Chinese space station will be able to accommodate three astronauts for up to six months at a time and will be used to conduct scientific research in areas such as astronomy, space medicine, and space physics.
However, China's space ambitions have not been without controversy. The country has been accused of engaging in space militarization, with some experts expressing concerns over the development of anti-satellite weapons.
China insists that its space program is for peaceful purposes.
China's plans to build bigger rockets for the commercial satellite market could have implications for the global space industry.
The process of launching rockets into space can have a significant impact on the environment, with exhaust pollution contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful pollutants.
As such, there are calls for the space industry to develop more environmentally-friendly launch systems. One potential solution is the use of electric rockets, which would significantly reduce emissions and pollution associated with traditional rocket launches.
China's plans to build bigger rockets for the commercial satellite market are likely to have significant implications for the global space industry.
