I realized I wasn't in the driver's seat when I looked out the window.
Panicking, I desperately attempted to recall how I ended up here. The last thing I remembered was programming my destination on the car's console and activating the auto-darkening windows, hoping to catch some sleep during the long journey. But something had clearly gone wrong.
The air was filled with unfamiliar smells and the language spoken around me was foreign.
I wasn't at home.
But amid the chaos, a glimmer of curiosity sparked within me. Embracing this new reality, I decided to make the most of my unexpected journey. With no way back, I resolved to adapt, learn, and perhaps, leave a mark on this astonishing future that had inadvertently become my destination.
