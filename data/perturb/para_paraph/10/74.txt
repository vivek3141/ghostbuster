84 people were killed in a brutal attack against a British police station.
As the newsman talked about how he had killed so many people, he turned off the TV.
The person asked who they were.
"That's not important" He raised his weapon and fired two shots into the MP's chest, the once into his head for good measure. "If only you could have lived to see how important your death is for our people's freedom"
