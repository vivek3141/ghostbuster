A house is more than just a place to live, it is a place to call home.
A person is surrounded by people who make them feel good.
As a result, my house is also people, and when home takes on a human figure, it is referred to as a family.
We communicate a lot and are both at the same school.
If not all, then one, the feeling of home for me is the place where I can return at any time.
