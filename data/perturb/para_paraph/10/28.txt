A gunshot rang out, shaking the very foundations of Sasha's world.
The sound of exploding gunpowder was something normal.

It was not certain if the ambulance would make it to the hospital on time.
Elizabeth ran down the stairs and into the lap of the person who was waiting on the couch.
Tell me a story!
The girl put her chin into the crook of her hand and asked, "How about a story of where your name came from?"
