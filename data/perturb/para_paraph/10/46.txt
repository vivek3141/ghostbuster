Climate change is one of the most significant topics of interest and research.
I know that the release of radioactive materials caused a lot of diseases and deaths.
I want to learn more about the reasons that led to the disaster and whether it could have been avoided. Also, I want to investigate the reasons behind the decision of the USSR government to conceal the truth and not let people save their lives.
The values, assumptions, and beliefs that I have related to the topic are two different things.
My opinion about the topic is that people should learn from such disasters and use this devastating lesson in the future.
I want to investigate the topic of the Chornobyl nuclear because it seems that history has not taught some people anything.
