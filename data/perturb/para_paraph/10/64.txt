Stanley walked up the stairs to his boss' office.
Stanley pressed the button in the elevator to get to his office.
Stanley was in his boss' office as soon as the door opened.
Stanley, you can't just plug in the vacuum cleaner, that's not in the script.
You're a real person, what's that?
Well then, let me show you a video on obedience.
Everything in this elevator is broken.
Just walk to the boss' office.
Oh, you refuse, well now look, this entire thing is broken, all my hours of work, destroyed by you, you careless jerk.
I can only remove this project from my computer.
Goodbye, Stanley.
