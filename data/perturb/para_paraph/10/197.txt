I don't have the same dexterity in my hands.
In my dreams, these hands allow me to create and shape worlds.
As the wielder of possibilities, I have a temptation to explore the depths of my unconscious.
Shadows cling to my fingertips, and an eerie mist follows my every movement in this twisted realm.
My hands are used to shape heroes.
As if they were distant stars, the dreams of these hands linger in my mind.
And so, I embark on my waking life with a renewed sense of purpose, determined to shape my reality. I may not have those fantastical hands in this realm, but I have something equally extraordinaryâ€”my imagination. With it, I can create, craft, and mold my path, just as I do in my dreams. With each step, I move closer to transforming my waking world into something just as enchanting as the ones I conjure when I close my eyes and dream.
