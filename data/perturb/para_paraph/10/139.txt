A majority stake in CIGNA's Japanese unit is going to be acquired by the Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co.
Regulatory approval is needed before the acquisition of CIGNA Life Insurance Co. can be completed.
Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. aims to steer growth with the acquisition, as it enters into the health and life insurance sector along with its traditional property-casualty insurance business.
CIGNA will be streamlining its operations following a strategic review of its international insurance portfolios.
CIGNA Life Insurance Co., which has roots in Japan dating back to 1987, provides various life and health insurance products, including individual life insurance, universal life insurance, and medical insurance.
The insurance unit has suffered some hit in recent years due to changes in financial regulations and low-interest rates.
Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. seeks to invigorate the unit with increased capital while taking advantage of the growing demand for health and life insurance among the country's aging population.
"As the Japanese market continues to evolve, we are excited to partner with CIGNA to offer a wider range of products to strengthen our customer experience and competitive advantage," said Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co.'s President and CEO, Akio Kiyotani.
The deal also marks the latest move in a wave of consolidation in the Japanese insurance industry driven by changing demographics and intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic.
MassMutual Japan is a Japanese unit of the U.S.-based MassMutual Financial Group.
CIGNA will benefit from a capital injection as a result of the acquisition of Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co.
Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. is expected to receive financial backing in order to grow its position in the Japanese insurance market.
