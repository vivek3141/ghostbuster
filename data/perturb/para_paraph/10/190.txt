Blood banks have undergone ups and downs due to technological progress and world wars.
Due to limited knowledge of blood types and compatibility, early attempts to transfer blood from one person to another were unsuccessful.
One of the key figures in the history of blood transfusion is Dr. James Blundell, an obstetrician in London, who performed the first successful human-to-human blood transfusion in 1818. Despite this breakthrough, the practice faced significant challenges. The lack of understanding about blood types and coagulation often resulted in transfusion reactions, making the procedure highly risky.
Karl Landsteiner discovered the A, B,AB, and O blood types in the early 20th century, which led to the establishment of blood banks.
In response, blood banks were established as part of military medical services to provide readily available blood for transfusions.
The AIDS epidemic of the 1980s led to a drop in blood donations.
The HIV detection window was greatly improved by the development of nucleic acid testing.
There were notable ups and downs due to technological and world events.
