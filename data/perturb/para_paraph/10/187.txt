Pearson stock spiked on rumors of a possible takeover.
Pearson's shares closed up 12% on Friday after rumors of a potential takeover bid by BSkyB.
News Corp already owns a 39% stake in BSkyB, and the report suggested that News Corp could use BSkyB as a vehicle to make a bid for Pearson.
The report sent Pearson's share price soaring on Thursday, and the stock continued to climb on Friday following further rumors that BSkyB was indeed planning a bid.
BSkyB and Pearson have not commented on the rumors.
Pearson has been struggling in recent years as students increasingly turn to digital learning materials, rather than traditional textbooks.
BSkyB, on the other hand, is one of the UK's largest media companies, with a strong track record in developing and monetizing digital content. If BSkyB were to acquire Pearson, it could potentially leverage its expertise in digital media to help the education publisher make the transition to a digital-first business model.
BSkyB wants to move beyond its core business of pay-TV and into new areas such as digital advertising and e- commerce.
It's not clear how regulators would view a big media company such as BSkyB owning one of the largest education publishers in the world.
There is also the question of how Pearson's existing management team would react to a potential takeover bid. Pearson's CEO, John Fallon, has been leading the company through a difficult period of transition, and he may be reluctant to sell the company to another party.
