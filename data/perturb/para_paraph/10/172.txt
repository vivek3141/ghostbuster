In a move that has raised eyebrows both locally and internationally, the Chinese government has accused veteran dissident Wang Xizhe of illegally crossing the border and pursuing those who helped him do so.
Wang, a well-known figure in the Chinese democracy movement, has been a thorn in the side of the ruling Communist Party for decades. He was last arrested in 2014 for speaking out against government corruption and sentenced to eight years in prison.
In December 2020, it was reported that Wang had managed to cross the border intoMyanmar, where he sought the help of local pro-democracy activists.
Wang has been accused by the Chinese government of violating its national security laws by leaving the country illegally and engaging in activities that could be harmful to the state.
Wang was accused of breaking Chinese law by leaving the country illegally and engaging in activities that endanger national security, according to a statement released via state media.
The embassy said that Wang had "colluded with foreign anti-China forces, accepting their support and funding, and stepping up his anti-China activities."

This latest move by the Chinese government has been criticized by human rights groups and pro-democracy activists, who say that it is just another example of Beijing's crackdown on dissent and freedom of expression.
"This is a clear attempt to intimidate those who dare to stand up against the Chinese government and speak the truth," said William Nee.
"This is a clear violation of their basic human rights," he said.
The case has also raised concerns among Myanmar's pro-democracy movement, which has been grappling with its own political crisis since the military coup in February 2021. Many pro-democracy activists in Myanmar fear that the Chinese government will pressure the Myanmar authorities to extradite Wang to China.
The ministry said that it had never received a request from the Chinese government to extradite someone.
For his part, Wang has remained defiant in the face of the Chinese government's accusations. In a statement released through his lawyer, Wang said that he was "not afraid" of the Chinese government and would continue to speak out for democracy and human rights in China.
"I believe that the Chinese people deserve freedom, democracy, and human rights," he said. "I will continue to fight for these values until they are achieved."
