I was saved from bad relationships by the music.
I have two theories about the music. Either I am the only one who hears it, or everyone does and no one ever talks about it. Which is fine. Music is a very personal thing after all.
Normally, the music is always at a comfortable level, unless it is trying to warn me of something dire. There was one moment whereâ€¦ One moment where the sound was deafening.
The music went back and forth between dramatic and lulling as I watched the news, but that morning it didn't.
"The World Trade Centers have been hit." I dropped my fork. The ting of it hitting the table was all I could hear. For the first time, ever, my world had gone quiet.
The music was silent as I watched the events unfold. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again.
