Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists fear that the Chinese government may be trying to limit freedom.
Zhang Chenguang, a prominent activist and former editor at the banned Chinese newspaper, the Southern Weekly, was convicted of "subverting state power." This charge is often used against critics of the Chinese government who push for greater political freedom and human rights.
Following his sentencing, many Hong Kong activists spoke out against what they see as a blatant violation of basic human rights and a move towards authoritarianism.
The Hong Kong government distanced itself from the sentencing.
Critics argue that Hong Kong's freedoms have been steadily eroded in recent years, with the government taking an increasingly hardline stance against dissent.
This sentiment was echoed in a recent report by the United States' Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which highlighted "grave concern" over the Chinese government's manipulation of Hong Kong's legal system.
The report called on the US government to take action to protect Hong Kong's democracy.
Zhang's sentencing also comes less than a year after China imposed a controversial national security law on Hong Kong. The law criminalizes dissent and gives the Chinese government new powers to police Hong Kong's political system.
These developments are seen as a blow to Hong Kong's autonomy, which was promised when the city was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
