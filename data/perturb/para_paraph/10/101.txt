According to a study by PC-Meter, home use of the World Wide Web has doubled in the last year.
The market research company said 11 percent of all 98.7 million U.S. households was equivalent to about 11 million homes and was up from 4.4 percent (or 4.3 million) a year ago.
In the last month, 13.9% of households claimed to have used some type of internet access service.
Twenty-five percent of these home Web users now visit shopping sites, PC-Meter's audience rating reports show.
According to PC-Meter's audience rating report, of the cybershoppers, men represented the highest percentage of users. In September, for example, 62.8 percent of Web surfers were men and 37.2 percent were women.
Four basic types of shopping are represented in the top 10 shopping sites; free software downloads, interactive auctions, clubs that sell to members and retail operations.
"With the holiday season upon us, the greatest growth to date at these sites may well occur," said Pamela Smith, a vice president of PC-Meter.
Shareware.com, a software service of online publisher C/NET Inc., was the top consumer shopping site, followed by Columbia House Co., which sells music CDs, computer CD-ROMs, videotapes and laser disks.
Columbia House and ZD Net are both popular consumer shopping sites.
Other top shopping sites included Amazon.com, at No. 5, which is a cyber-book store with more than 1 million titles to choose from. Surplus Direct was No. 6, with sales of computer hardware and software.
The 10th most popular shopping site was Onsale, an auction site for computer hardware, software and consumer electronics.
PC-Meter said its results on home Internet use came from an October survey of 9,928 personal computer-owning and non-PC-owning homes. The survey is conducted on a quarterly basis. Its audience rating report is done monthly.
PC-Meter is a subsidiary of the NPD Group, which is based in Port Washington, N.Y.
