If the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System does as expected early Friday and votes to expand banks' non-banking activities, it will only heighten the drive in Congress to overhaul U.S. banking regulations completely, analysts and industry officials said.
The Fed is expected to allow banks' section 20 subsidiaries to derive 25 percent of their revenue from non-banking activities, up from the current 10 percent ceiling.
The section 20 proposal was released for comment in July, but since then another bank regulator has taken some of the Fed's thunder.
Both the Fed's proposal and the Comptroller's actions will raise the pressure on Congress to scrap the Glass-Steagall Act, according to Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institute.  
In the past, banks led the charge to change the law because they wanted to get into other businesses, like selling insurance or underwriting stock deals. Insurance companies and securities firms generally opposed the banks creating legislative gridlock.
It's not a two-way street despite the tables being turned.
The financial services industry is merging.
The Fed's move from 10 to 25 percent is not material according to one top regulator.
Competitors in other fields worry that the banks insured deposits are a form of government subsidy giving the banks an unfair advantage when they venture into other fields.
Ludwig said that walling off the subsidiary eliminated any subsidization.
He opposes efforts by some in Congress to keep banks out of certain fields, such as real estate or merchant banking, entirely. "It's a mistake to set product limits, particularly in this day and age when we have such a dynamic marketplace," he said.
