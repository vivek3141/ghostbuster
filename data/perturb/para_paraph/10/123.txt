Air Macau, the flag carrier of Macau, is expecting a substantial increase in belly cargo as it plans to introduce new aircraft and routes to China.
Air Macau has announced the acquisition of two new Airbus A321neo aircraft, which will join its fleet from December 2021. The new aircraft will help expand the airline's network, increase frequencies and improve connectivity between Macau and China.
With the introduction of new aircraft and routes, Air Macau is expecting an increase in belly cargo.
Air Macau will be able to increase its cargo capacity with the new aircraft's larger cargo hold.
Air Macau's Chief Commercial Officer said the airline has identified several sectors for growth, including mail, fresh produce, and e- commerce.
The airline has established partnerships with several logistics firms in China to offer seamless cargo services to its customers. Air Macau has also said that it will be using its cargo capacity to support the transportation of medical supplies and equipment.
Air Macau's plans to expand its network and cargo operations come at a time when the air cargo industry's demand has been on the rise.
Air Macau's cargo operations made up 20% of the airline's revenue in 2020.
With the introduction of new aircraft and routes, Air Macau is positioning itself to take advantage of the growing demand for air cargo transportation in the region while providing more cargo transportation options for its customers.
