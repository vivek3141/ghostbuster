The company, which operates as Central Bank of the Midwest, has a strong presence in the state.
The bank has more than $2 billion in assets and operates more than 50 branches throughout Missouri and Kansas.
In recent years, Missouri has seen a number of bank mergers and acquisitions as smaller players have struggled to compete in a rapidly changing industry. Larger regional banks, such as UMB Bank, Central Bancompany, Commerce Bancshares, and First Horizon National Corp., have been on the prowl for potential acquisition targets as they seek to expand their market share and gain a competitive advantage.
Increased access to capital, expanded product offerings, and greater operational efficiencies are some of the benefits of a merger.
Bank mergers can lead to job cuts and branch closings, but they can also create new employment opportunities.
While no formal announcements have been made, industry experts believe that the bank remains a highly attractive target in the ongoing wave of consolidation in Missouri's banking industry.
