Oliver lived in the center of a small town.
Oliver's misadventures began one foggy morning when he set off on a hike to a nearby forest. The tranquility of the woods had always brought him peace, and he often sought solace among the whispering trees. As he wandered deeper into the enchanting forest, the watch slipped from his hands unnoticed. Suddenly, a thunderous roar echoed through the trees, predicting an imminent rainstorm. Panic set in as he realized he had misplaced his only lifeline.
Oliver found shelter in a stone tower, but as darkness descended, he took refuge in a dusty chamber.
Just when his spirit was fading, a blinding light filled the chamber, and he found himself once again standing in front of the pocket watch. Ecstatic, he hastily pocketed it, and reality shifted. Oliverâ€™s respawn landed him in a cramped crate, surrounded by the jumbled mess of a post office. Stacked upon others, he was far from comfortable, akin to a forgotten package. Oliver contemplated the irony of his immortality while yearning for a more dignified spawn.
He would often misplace his pocket watch in the middle of busy streets.
Oliver found a correlation between his emotions and his watch's location.
Oliver's most memorable moment was when he felt like he wanted to go somewhere.
Oliver was in a mud bath at the spa when the watch disappeared.
Oliver's pocket watch offered a lifetime of strange adventures, from spawning in an outrageous costume party to appearing in the middle of an island.
The story of Oliver, the man bound to a pocket watch, continues to unfold, as a reminder to never be too attached to one's own world.
