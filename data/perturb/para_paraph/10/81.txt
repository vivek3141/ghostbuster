Many couples in the United States may face this problem, and the causes can vary from congenital diseases to acquired physical or psychological trauma.
The causes of infertility are diverse and might not be seen by non-professionals. For instance, age plays a significant role as the older males and females are, the more chances of receiving infertility. Moreover, hormones play an important role in pregnancy, and when any type of disbalance appears in the human body, problems with pregnancy might arise. Obesity or anorexia can also indicate infertility as the human body spends crucial resources on other areas to support life without giving a chance for women to become pregnant. Some physiological problems like anomalies of the uterus or ovaries may also become the main cause of the issue.
The percentage of male infertility is not high.
A higher percentage of females suffer from infertility due to diseases that can't be treated.
Sometimes a solution can be found by using medicines, surgical procedures, and in-vivo fertilization.
