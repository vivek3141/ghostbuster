A place to call home is more than just a place to live.
Home is when a person knows they are surrounded by people who can make them feel good.
As a result, my house is also people, and when home takes on a human figure, it is referred to as a family.
My friends and I are both at the same school and we communicate a lot.
If not all, then one, the feeling of home for me is the place where I can return at any time.
