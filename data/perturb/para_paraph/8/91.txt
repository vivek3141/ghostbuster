Adam was looking forward to the Sunday service at St. Mary's Church, but something strange was about to happen.
It was time for the holy act of communion, where the symbolic body and blood of Jesus were believed to be shared amongst the faithful.
Unbeknownst to the believers, a mischievous prankster had spiked the wine with LSD. As the chalice reached Adam, he hesitated for a moment, sensing something peculiar in the air. Oblivious to the impending chaos, he confidently took a sip and then passed it along.
The church's walls became a kaleidoscope of colors as the service continued.
Some in the congregation panicked, but others believed it to be a divine experience.
Meanwhile, the clergy, unaware of what had transpired, continued the service. Their voices became a cacophony of sound, blending with the chaotic environment. Adam watched with wide eyes as the figure of Jesus on the cross above the altar seemed to detach itself and float towards him, radiating a blinding light.
As the hallucinations faded, the walls of the church became dull.
Word spread quickly within the church, revealing the source of the psychedelic experience. Shocked and perplexed, the prankster was identified, and although some were outraged, others saw the incident as a transformative awakening. Congregants began questioning the separation between the sacred and the profane, realizing that the divine could be experienced in unpredictable ways.
After that Sunday service, life at St. Mary's would never be the same. People's faith had been shaken, but also strengthened.
