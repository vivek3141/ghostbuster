It made me very nervous and puzzled me.
As such I never committed into relationships, probably by great of having my feelings not reciprocated.
Indy was the man I loved the most, but he was also the opposite of me.
It seemed like he had feelings for me when we stayed together for a couple of years.
But like I did in other relationships before, I shut him down, rejecting him when I felt my feelings growing to much.
I learned later that he was with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of times when we were together.
I met other men and women, and it always ended the same way.
Fast forward to yesterday. Kelly calls me, saying that Indy was in the hospital, after being hit by a car. His condition was critical, and he has asked for me.
I am holding a bouquet of flowers and nervously looking for room 68.
I find it, half opened, and take a deep breath to give myself courage, and here Indy's weak voice.
"Kelly, you're...a wonderful girl but...I...I...I never loved you."
He's already closed his eyes, and the words hit me like a punch.
