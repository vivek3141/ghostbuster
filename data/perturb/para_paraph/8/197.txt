I have two hands that are different from what I have in my waking life.
These hands allow me to create and shape worlds in my dreams.
But there is a darkness that lurks within these dreams too. As the wielder of boundless possibilities, there is a temptation to dabble in the forbidden; to delve into the depths of my subconscious. With this power, I create a parallel universe where my deepest desires and fears collide.
In this twisted realm, my hands take on a sinister aura. Shadows cling to my fingertips, and an eerie mist follows my every movement. I mold monsters and demons, their jagged forms haunting the corners of this realm. It is a place of nightmares, where the boundaries between good and evil blur, and the line separating reality from fantasy disintegrates.
My hands are used to shape heroes, imbuing them with courage and strength.
The dreams of these hands linger in my mind as if they were distant stars.
I embark on my waking life with a renewed sense of purpose, determined to shape my reality.
