The need for orators to seek truth and the greater good is emphasized by him.
Similarly, the film "Thank You for Smoking" provides a satirical take on the power of rhetoric in modern society. Nick Naylor, the protagonist, utilizes his proficient oratory skills as a spokesperson for the tobacco industry. He deceives the public by presenting strong arguments in favor of smoking, manipulating statistics, and using persuasive techniques. Naylor embodies the opportunistic rhetoric that Plato criticizes, as he prioritizes his personal gains over the well-being and truthfulness of his discourse.
Plato believes that oratory skills should serve justice and promote genuine knowledge, and he values internal consistency and logical coherence over eloquent speeches lacking substance.
By showing the negative consequences of manipulative rhetoric, "Thank You for Smoking" supports Plato's argument that the power of persuasion must be used ethically. As the film progresses, Naylor experiences a moral awakening and acknowledges the harmful effects of tobacco products. He realizes that his rhetorical skills can also be used to advocate for consumer safety, shifting from deceitful persuasion to a more righteous oratory.
The film "Thank You for Smoking" shows the deceptive nature of opportunist rhetoric and highlights the importance of truth and justice in public speaking.
