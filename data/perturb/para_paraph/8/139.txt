Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. is set to acquire a majority stake in CIGNA's Japanese unit as part of its ambitious growth strategy.
The Japanese insurer is expected to complete the acquisition of CIGNA Life Insurance Co. by the end of 2021, pending regulatory approval.
Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. aims to steer growth with the acquisition, as it enters into the health and life insurance sector along with its traditional property-casualty insurance business.
The move will also help CIGNA streamline its operations following a strategic review of its international insurance portfolios.
CIGNA Life Insurance Co., which has roots in Japan dating back to 1987, provides various life and health insurance products, including individual life insurance, universal life insurance, and medical insurance.
The insurance unit has suffered some hit in recent years due to changes in financial regulations and low-interest rates.
Increasing capital and taking advantage of the growing demand for health and life insurance among the country's aging population is what Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. seeks to do.
"As the Japanese market continues to evolve, we are excited to partner with CIGNA to offer a wider range of products to strengthen our customer experience and competitive advantage," said Akio Kiyotani, President and CEO of Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co.
The deal is part of a wave of consolidation in the Japanese insurance industry driven by changing demographic and intensified by the COVID-19 Pandemic.
MassMutual Japan is part of the U.S.-based MassMutual Financial Group.
With the acquisition of Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co., CIGNA will benefit from a considerable capital injection to enhance its operational efficiency.
Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. is expected to receive financial backing in order to grow its position in the Japanese insurance market.
