After a dry start to January, there will be light rains in February that will help cocoa crop development.
"We have seen around average rain levels for January so far but a little more now and in February would help," another local crop analyst said.
There was patchy distribution of rains.
The data showed that most fell in central and northern cocoa and coffee areas.
"Central areas have seen a surplus for the period but southern areas are in deficit," said the weather analyst.
One crop analyst told Reuters rains seemed to have reached most cocoa and coffee areas.
"There seem to have been good light showers in most cocoa areas," said the crop analyst after returning from an up-country tour. "There is no dust on most bush tracks."
The dry harmattan conditions from the Sahara had retreated northwards after failing to reach the southern part of the country.
Exporters and crop inspectors said cocoa humidity levels remained around 8-10 percent against exportable quality of eight percent, despite drying efforts
Coffee farmers have also had drying problems but export activity remained low after shipments put by port sources at 10,492 tonnes for October to December, exporters said.
Quality inspectors said a better picture of coffee humidity and quality after rains would emerge as arrivals picked up.
The data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, showed the following rainfall for the second 10 days of January in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan:
Gagnoa 7.8mm, San Pedro 0.1mm, Tabou 6.2mm, Dimbokro 4.6mm, Aidjan 6mm, and Korho.
No data were available for Adiake and Sassandra.
