Kellogg Co. on Friday reported a drop of more than 30 percent in its third quarter profits as its cereal volume dropped in an intensely competitive market.
Kellogg, which makes Corn Flakes, Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, Fruit Loops and Special-K, is fighting back, launching marketing plans for the fourth quarter that are aimed at boosting its sales.
Richard Lovell said that they would be taking what they believed to be appropriate actions.
The company, the world's biggest maker of ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, said its net income for the third quarter fell to $159.5 million, including a $21.3 million charge, from $230 million a year ago. On a per share basis, Kellogg's earnings dropped 29 percent to 75 cents, with fewer shares outstanding, from $1.05 last year.
Despite a 1 percent gain in worldwide sales volume, Kellogg's overall sales fell 9 percent as continued weak prices for breakfast cereals offset a 1 percent gain in worldwide sales.
"As previously forecast, our third quarter performance was influenced significantly by competitive conditions in the U.S. cereal category," Kellogg Chairman Arnold Langbo said in a statement.
In the third quarter, analysts estimate that the domestic cereal sales volume fell between 9 and 10 percent.
"We can't detail it. It was a challenging quarter in the U.S. and our volume was down," Lovell added.
The fourth quarter of 1996 will probably show a slight increase from a year ago.
"It's a challenging comparison," Lovell said.

Kellogg said the U.S. cereal market overall was sluggish, with sales growing about 1.5 percent, measuring grocery stores, mass merchandisers and all other outlets.
Looking ahead, Kellogg refused to outline what promotional programmes it was planning for the fourth quarter.
Analysts don't think the Battle Creek, Mich.-based cereals giant will return to couponing or buy-one, get-one-free promotions.
"It's sort of left to speculation what they're going to do," SBC Warburg analyst Chris Jakubik said.
At this time, there is no indication that they have shifted from their long-term strategic goal, which is to reduce inefficient promotions.
Kellogg reduced prices on about two-thirds of its breakfast cereals in June. Other major manufacturers also cut prices this year as they battled for market share and tried to jump-start consumer purchases.
But those price cuts alone apparently were not enough to jump-start consumer purchases, according to Smith Barney analyst David Rabinowitz.
"The message there is that prices have to come down further," Rabinowitz said.
According to Information Resources data, U.S. ready-to-eat cereal sales in grocery stores fell 1.6 percent to 2.6 billion pounds for the 52 weeks ended Aug. 11, according to the most recent data available, compared with a year earlier.
Kellogg's sales volume declined in that period by 4.1 percent to 881.3 million pounds for a market share of about 34.4 percent, Information Resources said.
