I've been able to freeze time and everything within it for as long as I can remember.
Fascinated by my newfound power, I decided to test its limits. I soon discovered that I could choose which people remained unfrozen during my time-stopping escapades. They would continue their activities, ignorant of the frozen world around them. It was a surreal sight to see them moving amidst the motionless backdrop.
I had to use the power to freeze the world wisely, as it could easily be abused.
I chose a nurse who had devoted her life to saving others.
I became known as the "Phantom Hero", an invisible do-gooder who appeared out of nowhere to aid those in need.
But the knowledge of my gift weighed heavily on my soul. Though I sought to make a difference, I felt the burden of manipulating others' lives. I longed for connection in this timeless void, for someone to see me and understand. I wanted to share my secret, to let someone in on this incredible power.
One day, I chose an elderly woman sitting alone on a park bench to be the un-frozen.
Through connection, we discovered the true potential of our power - the power to unite and inspire others to create a better world, frozen or not.
