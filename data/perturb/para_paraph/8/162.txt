One of the changes that a business might need to adapt to is an expanding target market.
P&G will need to make changes in order to succeed in theignored market.
The main contextual variable that led to P&Gâ€™s restructuring was the changes in the target market as revealed by a study. The study was conducted by Male Grooming Trends: Profiting in 2009 and Beyond. It showed that although female consumers dominated the market for personal grooming products, the market for male consumers was quickly expanding. P&G saw an opportunity to profit from an expanding market. Therefore, redesigning was necessitated by changes in the market characteristics.
Older white men were the demographic market for motorcycles.
Businesses shouldn't stick to old ways when the market is changing.
