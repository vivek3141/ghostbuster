Climate change is an important topic for research.
I don't know much about the topic, but I know that the release of radioactive materials caused a lot of diseases and deaths.
I would like to learn more about the reasons that led to such a disaster and to find out whether it was preventable. Also, I want to investigate the reasons behind the decision of the USSR government to conceal the truth and not let people save their lives. I cannot understand how they could have been silent at a time when thousands of citizens were being gradually driven into an ecological trap.
The values, assumptions, and beliefs I have related to the topic are two different things.
My opinion about the topic is that people should learn from such disasters and use this devastating lesson in the future.
The topic of the Chornobyl nuclear seems to have not been taught in history.
