"Who can replace Death? He was the most feared of us all. Without Death there can be no reckoning upon the sinful mortals."
War scratched his thinning beard. He was running out of options. No others had dared to take up such a heavy burden. While War was no stranger to the horrors of, he shuddered to think about the atrocities that Death had committed. Was there any being in the 7 realms to take up the Cloak and Scythe?
"But there is someone." hissed Famine.
All the atrocities we have committed were dealt with by Man.
Famine's face was covered with a ragged hood and he had a sick smile.
Conquest was quick to challenge.
A mortal man is greedy, selfish and cruel.
quest, have you learned anything from Death?
We are the horsemen of the apocalypse, both terrible and glorious, and we will charge and strike fear into the hearts of sinners. When the Horn of the Heavens sounds we will charge and strike fear into the hearts of sinners.
"ENOUGH!"
War slammed into Conquest, knocking him down to the brimstone. He unleashed an onslaught of blows onto his golden armor until it was dented beyond recognition. Breathless, War stood up towering over his foe and boomed.
"I will not take this insolence. Death was the best of us. I loved him as a brother and a mentor."
War's face softened for a second.
I will end you if you blaspheme our brother again.
Conquest nodded in shame. He was not used to the bitter taste of defeat. He silently vowed that War would pay for the humiliation he suffered.
"Famine. You say that a mortal can replace Death. Bring him to me."
"As you wish brother."
