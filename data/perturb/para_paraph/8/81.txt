Older males and females are more likely to get infertility, and hormones play an important role.
The percentage of male infertility is not high compared to the opposite gender. Nevertheless, 7% of men suffer from this problem, and the causes of these cases are different (Krausz et al., 2022). Around 20% of those males who cannot impregnate their couples are suffering from genetic factors that were transferred throughout generations. When males check their health conditions and diagnose infertility at early stages, they have a chance to overcome this problem and protect the ability to procreate. Low sperm production may also happen due to psychological factors like depression or any type of disorder.
