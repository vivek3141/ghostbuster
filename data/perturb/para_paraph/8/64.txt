Stanley walked up the stairs to his boss' office.
Stanley went into the elevator and pressed the button to get to his office.
Stanley was in his boss' office when the door opened.
No, that can't be right, Stanley, you can't just plug in the vacuum cleaner, that's not in the script.
You're a real person, what's that?
Well then, let me show you a video on obedience.
Everything in this elevator is broken.
All hope is not lost, just walk to the boss' office.
Oh, you refuse, well now look, this entire thing is broken, all my hours of work, destroyed by you, you careless jerk.
I only have the power to remove this project from my computer.
Goodbye, Stanley.
