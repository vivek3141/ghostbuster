The first thing the audience at La Scala Opera will hear is Scarpia's motives.
The people will then shuffle out of the opera theatre, lazily critiquing the same show that they've seen entirely too often here in Milan, and go out to the caf√©s and restaurants that they've been to many times before. Their lives, seemingly on a loop, continue at their leisurely pace as I sit by in my darkened villa above the streets watching the days pass by.
Acquaintances of mine always asked, "Why move to Milan?" "You don't know Italian, do you?" "Why now?" they'd ask with all the sincerity of a Hallmark Valentine's Day card. I'm not sure that I'd ever have an answer for them, because they were right to question my motives. Why choose to fundamentally change the eternal workings of the vampiric lifestyle?
When the Milanese stay out until 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, my food is spiked with alcohol from the Lombardy region.
During my time in Vienna, I took the aglio for granted, but the Austrians never bothered with it.
I might go back to Vienna and eat some of the people who drink beer.
