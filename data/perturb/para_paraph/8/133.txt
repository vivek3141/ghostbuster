The latest processes in cultural change show that both sides of the argument have reasonable grounds.
However, the other side of the argument is more compelling because it considers the strengths of local cultures. In particular, an example of sushi’s popularity in American society and cultures of other nations demonstrates that people adopt new cultural phenomena with acknowledgment of their origin. According to Bestor (2010), “Japan remains the world’s primary market for fresh tuna for sushi and sashimi” (p. 110). Thus, having integrated its product into the cultures of other countries, Japan has expanded its market share.
The host cultures know the history of the cultural clusters.
