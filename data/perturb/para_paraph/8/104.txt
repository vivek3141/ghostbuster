It was a warm summer day and I was out for a stroll. I saw them on the other side, walking down the sidewalk, two by two. I didn't pay much attention until they passed under the glow of the gaslamp. Never had I seen such an pair of opposites! For the brief time they walked under it, the light illuminated the pair. The man's limbs and head were covered in scars! What I had mistaken for a beard was a mass of scars! His arms and legs were so densely overrun that I had thought it a coat and trousers! The woman had black hair, long and straight, as if it were manufactured string by string. But her skin is what shocked me, even greater than the man! It had the most exquisite complexion, almost translucent in the light, and I saw nary a flaw on it. I looked to my own marred hands, although compared to that man, it was a blessing; as I worried, small cuts formed on my arm. It began to sting as my sweat seeped into my fresh wounds. Not wanting more scars, I shook my negative thoughts and ran to the couple.
"Sir," I exclaimed, "Excuse my frankness sir, but I must inquiry, how is it that your wife is so beautiful, yet you are so…."
The man and woman looked at each other, she turned away, blushing, and he laughed raucously.
"Hideous?" asked the man between laughs.
I was embarrassed by my rudeness.
He put his arm around my shoulder and said, "I get it all the time."
"My apologies sir, but how, in this world, did your wife manage to keep from scarring?"
"Well, you see," he said with a wink, "she's not my wife, but my daughter."
I was taken aback. "Still….How?"
Her cooking is lousy and she can't tell a joke.
He said to take a look at her finger.
I peered at the daughter, she offered her right hand and I saw a thin bright streak of red on her index finger.
The man pulled me in, "I'm gonna tell you a story."
"Long ago, when I was married, I swore never to have kids. I didn't want any children to be born into this world, so that was that. But my wife had other plans, and so my daughter was born. I fell in love with her and swore to devote my life to her. As she grew, though, I began to worry. 'How would I protect her from the world?' So I set out to every doctor, physician, and scientist I could find, asking for a cure. Of course, if there was a cure already, no one would be like this."
He cleared his throat, took a deep breath, and continued.
"On one particular visit to a doctor, I had my daughter with me and upon exiting the building, I met a man dressed all in black.
"This must be the devil," I thought as I entered the building.
'Wait,' the man in black said, 'I can save your daughter.'
I was skeptical and scoffed, 'What for my soul?'
He replied, 'I am bored with just bartering with souls, I am more interested in it's durability.' The devil continued, giggling, 'You see, I do have the power to stop your daughter's scarring, but I'm not a very charitable person.'
'What do you want?' I asked.
'I want you to partake in a very simple wager,' he said, 'Your daughter won't get scars, but *you* will; more specifically, very scar your daughter gets will be transferred to you. If you can manage this wager, you keep your soul, if not, well, you know what will happen."'
I was dumbstruck that he took the deal, and that he managed to last this long.
The man said that his daughter grew up and he took the blows.
I wondered if he ever regretted his deal with the devil.
He replied with a smile, "Not at all."
