There was an attack on a police station.
He turned off the TV as the newsman talked about how he had killed so many people.
The person asked, "Who are you?"
"That's not important" He raised his weapon and fired two shots into the MP's chest, the once into his head for good measure. "If only you could have lived to see how important your death is for our people's freedom"
