Silver King acquired the Home Shopping Network.
The time is ripe for a new national broadcasting outlet that will be geared toward a younger, more tech savvy audience.
The financial clout that the acquisition of HSN will give Silver King will be needed to make its network a reality.
"We see a huge opportunity in creating a new type of broadcasting network that is truly designed for the 21st century," Diller said in a statement. "The acquisition of HSN gives us the resources we need to make this vision a reality, and we're excited to get to work building something truly special for viewers across the country."
The focus of the new network will be on lifestyle and entertainment.
