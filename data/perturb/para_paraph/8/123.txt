Air Macau, the flag carrier of Macau, is expecting a substantial increase in belly cargo as it plans to introduce new aircraft and routes to China.
In December of 2021, Air Macau will get two new aircraft.
With the introduction of new aircraft and routes, Air Macau is expecting an increase in belly cargo.
Belly cargo refers to the cargo carried in the cargo hold of the aircraft, beneath the passengers' cabin. With the new aircraft's larger cargo hold, Air Macau will be able to increase its cargo capacity and take advantage of the growing demand for air cargo transportation between China and Macau.
Air Macau has identified several sectors for growth, including mail, fresh produce, and e- commerce.
The airline has established partnerships with several logistics firms in China to offer seamless cargo services to its customers. Air Macau has also said that it will be using its cargo capacity to support the transportation of medical supplies and equipment.
Air Macau's plans to expand its network and cargo operations come at a time when the air cargo industry's demand has been on the rise.
In 2020, Air Macau's cargo operations contributed significantly to the airline's revenue, making up nearly 20% of its total revenue. The airline is optimistic that with the expansion of its cargo operations, it will continue to see growth in its financial results.
With the introduction of new aircraft and routes, Air Macau is positioning itself to take advantage of the growing demand for air cargo transportation in the region while providing more cargo transportation options for its customers.
