Sorry to be so dour, but I had to write something for that first 3-panel:
[2]
What do you think the purpose of the fence on the roof is?
People are supposed to be stopped from falling by the second character.

Character 1 - Would a fence really stop someone bent on killing themselves?
Character 2 - No, maybe get 'em to use a different building though. They just don't want it to be their problem to deal with.
[3] Character 2 has walked off screen
Someone might not need the fence anymore.
