I was saved from bad relationships by the music.
Either I am the only one who hears it or everyone else does.
If the music is trying to warn me of something dire, it will always be at a comfortable level.
The music went back and forth between dramatic and lulling as I watched the news, but that morning it didn't.
"The World Trade Centers have been hit." I dropped my fork. The ting of it hitting the table was all I could hear. For the first time, ever, my world had gone quiet.
As I watched the events unfold, the music continued to be silent. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again.
