The recent sentencing of Chinese dissident, Zhang Chenguang, to 11 years in prison has sparked concerns among Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists. Many fear that this move may be an indication of the Chinese government's increasing efforts to curb freedoms in Hong Kong post-handover.
Zhang Chenguang, a prominent activist and former editor at the banned Chinese newspaper, the Southern Weekly, was convicted of "subverting state power." This charge is often used against critics of the Chinese government who push for greater political freedom and human rights.
Following his sentencing, many Hong Kong activists spoke out against what they see as a flagrant violation of basic human rights and a move towards authoritarianism. Democracy activist, Joshua Wong, tweeted that "Beijing's crackdown in Hong Kong is increasingly brazenâ€¦ officials are now going after mainland dissidents."
The Hong Kong government distanced itself from the sentencing.
Regardless of the government's stance, many remain unconvinced that Zhang's sentencing is an isolated incident. Critics argue that Hong Kong's freedoms have been steadily eroded in recent years, with the government taking an increasingly hardline stance against dissent.
This sentiment was echoed in a recent report by the United States' Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which highlighted "grave concern" over the Chinese government's manipulation of Hong Kong's legal system.
The report urged the US government to protect Hong Kong's democracy.
A year ago, China imposed a controversial national security law on Hong Kong.
These developments are seen as a blow to Hong Kong's autonomy, which was promised when the city was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
