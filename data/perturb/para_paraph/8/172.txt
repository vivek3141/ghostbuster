Wang, a well-known figure in the Chinese democracy movement, has been a thorn in the side of the ruling Communist Party for decades. He was last arrested in 2014 for speaking out against government corruption and sentenced to eight years in prison.
However, in December 2020, news emerged that Wang had managed to cross the border into Myanmar, where he had sought the help of local pro-democracy activists. It was reported that he was hoping to make his way to Thailand, where he planned to seek asylum.
The Chinese government has since accused Wang of violating its national security laws by leaving the country illegally and engaging in activities that could be harmful to the state. Chinese authorities have labeled Wang a "criminal suspect" and issued an international warrant for his arrest.
Wang was accused of breaking Chinese law by leaving the country illegally and engaging in activities that endanger national security, according to a statement released via state media.
The embassy said that Wang had "colluded with foreign anti-China forces, accepting their support and funding, and stepping up his anti-China activities."
The statement also included a warning to anyone who had provided support to Wang during his escape from China. Chinese authorities said that they would "punish severely those who have been colluding with Wang Xizhe and provide relevant information on his whereabouts."
This latest move by the Chinese government has been criticized by human rights groups and pro-democracy activists, who say that it is just another example of Beijing's crackdown on dissent and freedom of expression.
"This is a clear attempt to intimidate those who dare to stand up against the Chinese government and speak the truth," said Amnesty International's China researcher, William Nee.
He said that this was a clear violation of their basic human rights.
The case has also raised concerns among Myanmar's pro-democracy movement, which has been grappling with its own political crisis since the military coup in February 2021. Many pro-democracy activists in Myanmar fear that the Chinese government will pressure the Myanmar authorities to extradite Wang to China.
The ministry never received a request from the Chinese government to extradite someone.
For his part, Wang has remained defiant in the face of the Chinese government's accusations. In a statement released through his lawyer, Wang said that he was "not afraid" of the Chinese government and would continue to speak out for democracy and human rights in China.
He believes that the Chinese people deserve freedom, democracy, and human rights.
