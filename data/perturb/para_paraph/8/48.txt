General Motor Corp.'s decision to invest 300 million pounds in the British arm of the company reflected its confidence in the British operation and the international prospects for the Astra model, the company said on Tuesday.
The company said the three-year investment would be used to modernise its Ellesmere Port plant in north-west England, which makes Astra cars and vans.
200 new jobs will be created as a result of the announcement made at the British International Motor Show.
Increasing the number of shifts to three from two could create hundreds more jobs according to Nick Reilly.
Depending on the market and demand for the model at that time, a decision would likely be taken over the next two years.
The Astra model has been consistently one of Britain and Europe's top five sellers since its launch five years ago, with the development of an estate model boosting its position.
Reilly said the 300 million pound investment was won against intense competition within GM and reflected the transformation of Ellesmere Port from a domestically-oriented plant to "a very important source of manufacturing within General Motors."
He predicted strong growth for the Astra in Latin America and Asia Pacific.
Reilly said the British car market is currently "the most competitive in Europe," with a number of importers using huge U.K. fleet sales as a way of offloading cars which remain unsold in sluggish domestic markets. Europe remained "flat," he said.
He said that the profitablity of the company was going in the right direction after a tough 1995.
