I realized I was no longer in the comfort of my self-driving car when I looked out the window.
When I tried to remember how I ended up here, it was obvious that something had gone wrong.
The air was filled with unfamiliar smells and the language spoken around me was foreign.
I wondered how I ended up far away from home.
I decided to make the most of my unexpected journey and learn from it.
