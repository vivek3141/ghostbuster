"You really promise? Really *really* promise?"
I promise, I have the fiver in my pocket.
Henry fishes a crumpled Â£5 note out of his back pocket. In Bill's own hands the pigeon struggles and squawks.
The group had seen the nest in the corner of the roof and immediately their thoughts turned to throwing eggs at cars and windows.
"Tie your stone to it and I'll give you a fiver."
They were told not to do anything reckless with a stone.
Henry's stone wasn't actually a rock, none of them were nowadays, that's just what people call them. His was a ring bought especially for the purpose. This was a popular approach to stones but realistically they could be anything, you could bind your soul to a balloon if you wanted.
Bill tied a stone to the bird's leg.
"Now what?" He asks.
"Now..." says Henry "You need to get it back!" He shoots a grin at James and releases the pigeon with a jump. It squawks and begins to fly towards the neighbouring apartment block.
Bill ran in the opposite direction towards the edge of the roof and Henry and James were excited for what would happen next.
Bill is falling again, this time watching the pigeon carry on it's flight, getting smaller and smaller until his life ends once again.
