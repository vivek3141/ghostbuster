I have a unique genome, and my doctor calls it Immutable, which means that I can be bitten by a vampire, attacked by a werewolf, or even cursed by magic.
The supernatural creatures of legends began killing and turning everyone after I was born.
I was thrown out of the world because I thought I was one of his houses.
I get paid excellently and I have a great benefits package because I work for the Unseelie.
I keep an eye on him as he has a lot of samples.
All in all then, this world's not so bad. I make a good living, I have lots of friends, and I recently started seeing an Unseelie Fae, a girl named Mashian, who's even older than I am. I've even been thinking of sharing my secret with her, so hopefully she's okay dating a human. Anyway, that's life in 1358 A.U. It's different that I expected when I was a kid, but it's not bad. Not bad at all.
