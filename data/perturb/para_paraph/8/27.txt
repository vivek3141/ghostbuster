Archetypes serve as a framework through which we view and understand others, providing us with a sense of familiarity and predictability.
We are drawn to individuals who display characteristics of bravery, selflessness, and determination, whether it be a friend who volunteers at a local shelter or a colleague who goes above and beyond in their work.
The shadow is a representation of ourselves that we find undesirable or suppress.
Archetypes such as the "sage" or the "jester" help shape our perception of people and events.
