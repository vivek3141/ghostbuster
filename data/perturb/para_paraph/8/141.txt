Profits at Canada's six big banks topped C$6 billion ($4.4 billion) in 1996, smashing last year's C$5.2 billion ($3.8 billion) record as Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada wrapped up the earnings season on Thursday.
The six banks each reported a double-digit jump in net income for a combined profit of C$6.26 billion ($4.6 billion) in fiscal 1996 ended Oct. 31.
But a third straight year of record profits came amid growing public anger over perceived high service charges and credit card rates, and tight lending policies.
Bank officials defended the group's performance, saying that millions of Canadians owned bank shares through mutual funds and pension plans.
Four of the six banks increased their dividends this year.
"Our activities mean jobs, investment, tax revenue, dividend payments and foreign income for Canada's economy," CIBC chairman Al Flood said after the bank reported a 35 percent jump in net income on Thursday.
In the 1996 fiscal year, net income at the bank rose to C$1.36 billion from C$1.01 billion in 1995.
CIBC also boosted its quarterly dividend by C5 cents (3.6 cents) to C50 cents (37 cents), the second increase in 1996.
Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Royal Bank of Canada raised their payouts.
Royal Bank, Canada's largest bank, reported the highest corporate profit in Canadian history on Wednesday, with 1996 net income rising 13 percent to C$1.43 billion ($1.05 billion).
Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal cracked the billion-dollar barrier this year, joining CIBC and Royal Bank, which crossed the threshold in 1995 and 1994 respectively.
National Bank had a 30 percent jump in net income to C$318 million this year.
The banks attributed their performances to lower credit losses and healthy commercial and personal banking. Investment banking, brokerage and mutual fund businesses also enjoyed a banner year as financial markets soared in 1996.
Earnings at CIBC's Wood Gundy Inc. investment arm skyrocketed 122 percent to C$528 million ($389 million) in 1996.
The group's earnings and dividends were better than expected.
Hugh Brown, a banking analyst with investment dealer Nesbitt Burns Inc., said it was good news and a good outlook for 1997 in terms of earnings and dividends.
Brown said he now had a more positive outlook for bank earnings in 1997, saying Big Six profits may grow between 9 and 10 percent next year, up from previous growth forecasts of about 7 percent.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's bank stocks fell on Thursday in tandem with the rest of the market.
