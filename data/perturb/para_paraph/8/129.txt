The life and teachings of Jesus Christ can be understood by reading the Synoptic Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and John.
One of the most apparent similarities between the Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of John is their focus on Jesus' life, ministry, death, and resurrection. Both sets of Gospels present a narrative of Jesus' birth, his teachings and miracles, his betrayal, crucifixion, and resurrection. They convey similar themes of love, compassion, and forgiveness, and highlight Jesus as the Son of God.
However, the Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of John differ greatly in their approach, structure, and content. The Synoptics, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are often referred to as "synoptic" due to their shared content and similar narrative structure. They are notably briefer, focusing more on Jesus' actions, parables, and teachings, and less on his inner thoughts and emotions. There is also a significant overlap in the stories and events they cover.
John's Gospel focuses on Jesus as the Word made flesh and presents a more mystical and abstract approach to the life of Christ.
The wedding at Cana, the raising of Lazarus, and the conversation with Nicodemus are just a few of the unique stories and teachings in John.

Furthermore, the differences in content and style between the Synoptics and the Gospel of John compel us to consider the intended audiences and purposes of these texts. The Synoptic Gospels seem to be aimed at a Jewish audience, highlighting Jesus' role as the long-awaited Messiah and the fulfillment of Jewish prophecy. The Gospel of John, on the other hand, seems to be more universal in its approach, appealing to a broader audience and emphasizing Jesus' role as the divine Logos or Word.
Additionally, the variations in narrative structure and theological emphasis also call into question the historical accuracy of these texts. Scholars have debated whether the Synoptic Gospels or the Gospel of John provide a more authentic representation of Jesus' life and teachings. Some argue that the Synoptics, being closer in time to Jesus, offer a more historically reliable account. Others propose that John's Gospel, with its unique theological insights, reflects a deeper understanding of Jesus' teachings.
There are similarities between the Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of John, but they differ in their approach, structure, and theological emphases.
