Financial services and property group Liberty International Holdings on Thursday unveiled a move into the British pensions market in ventures involving the British Telecom Pension Scheme and pension fund management group Hermes.
Liberty International Pensions will cater to both the needs of money purchase pension schemes and retail pensions.
BT Pension Scheme, which owns Hermes, is to pay five million pounds ($7.8 million) for 10 percent of the equity of Liberty International Pensions, with the rest held by Liberty.
Liberty and Hermes said in a joint statement they were also setting up a new subsidiary called Hermes Liberty International Pensions to offer specialised investment services to the British pensions industry, with Hermes as fund manager.
Donald Gordon, Liberty's chairman, said that a 1.5 billion pound transfer of assets to the new funds would be critical mass from the beginning.
Gordon said Liberty was "well positioned to take advantage of the changes affecting the UK pensions industry." Hermes' expertise in investment management and track record would help it to provide quality and competitively priced pension services.
David Fischel, Liberty's managing director, said Liberty International Pensions still required approval of Britain's Department of Trade and Industry but was otherwise ready for launch.
The joint pensions venture was called a meeting of minds.
"Liberty has the ability and techniques of selling pensions, it also has the systems, and the administration, and we think that's a very good marriage."
Ross Goobey said Hermes had approached Liberty International only to find the group had been considering an approach to Hermes.
I think one step at a time is enough for us.
He said the venture would probably not be up and running until the first quarter of next year as regulatory approval first had to be obtained for the new group.
The British Telecom Pension Scheme's decision to transfer assets to the new funds would give the new venture a boost.
"I hope it gives some people some sense of security that the biggest pension scheme in the country is willing to do this," he said.
Liberty plans to sell personal pensions at its regional shopping centres, which are held through a majority-owned subsidiary Capital Shopping Centres. These have more than 150 million customer visits a year, Liberty said.
