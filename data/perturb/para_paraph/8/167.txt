They caught up with me as I sat in the interrogation room, surrounded by detectives.
When the detectives asked me to recount my first kill, I was silent.
Her name was Emily. Fragile and lost, she became my first victim, the catalyst for the darkness within me to awaken. I had watched her from afar, learning her routine, her vulnerabilities. That night, I carefully orchestrated my entrance into her life. As she slept soundly, unaware of the force that crept closer, I raised the blade. 
I felt a mixture of fear and excitement as the steel kissed her skin.
After they were horrified by my tale, the detectives realized that there was no redemption for me.
