In the heat of the night.
Supertom's goal is to make a black character heroic.
Thus, a black character is endowed with high achievements and extraordinary positive characteristics, and Supertom is obtained. Mr. Tibbs is Supertom as he “is smarter than all the white people, the best homicide detective in Philadelphia, brave enough to face down a lynch mob,” and exhibits “a somewhat unexpected knowledge of varieties of plant life.” (Vera, 156) He is a kind of racial Sherlock Holmes.
In other words, the relationship in the movie suggests the kind of friendship between blacks and whites that Americans like to think of as accurate, but that is not true in the context of the time frame in which In the Heat of the Night takes place. In the film, at no point or scene does Gillespie seem to reach the point of accepting Mr. Tibbs. At best, at the end of the film, there is a sense of indifference. Nothing in the film feels like a buddy moment, more like constant violence and almost kidnapping. The scene in Gillespie’s living room was the closest thing to friendliness. Thus, discussing this film in relation to buddy films proves to be a difficult task.
Do the right thing.
In February 2020, two white men killed Ahmaud Arbery for allegedly robbing someone.
The theme of US racism is displayed in most of Spike Lee's films, and the director's attitude towards it is critical.
One of the film's strengths is the complexity of its characters and the portrayal of blackness on screen.
