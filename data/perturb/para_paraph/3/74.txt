The 'Kings of Ulster' claimed 84 victims today in a brutal attack against a British police station.
He turned off the TV as the newsman talked about how he had killed so many people.
The MP asked, "Who are you?"
"That's not important" He raised his weapon and fired two shots into the MP's chest, the once into his head for good measure. "If only you could have lived to see how important your death is for our people's freedom"
