Parents with a pocket full of apocalypse, don't let the boogey man boogie in your closet, you must have forgot to lock it.
I spy with my little eye a child teetering on the edge; hold hands with me and the rest of your invisible friends. It's better to break than continue to bend, snap your soul in two and let it mend...was it real? What I saw? What was it truly doing what it did? What was hidden inside of my mind projected or reality neglected...Something segmented and crittering beneath the flowboards of the Trojan horse awoke my paralysis through the sacred doors.
War of the worlds, obsolete factions matching gains and comparing beef-sticks, equipped to rip shit, just trust in the sky.
