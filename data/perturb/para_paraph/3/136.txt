The first thing the audience at La Scala Opera will hear is Scarpia's motives.
The people will then shuffle out of the opera theatre, lazily critiquing the same show that they've seen entirely too often here in Milan, and go out to the caf√©s and restaurants that they've been to many times before. Their lives, seemingly on a loop, continue at their leisurely pace as I sit by in my darkened villa above the streets watching the days pass by.
I'm not sure if I'd ever have an answer to the question of why I moved to Milan in the first place.
For one, the Milanese choose to stay out until the ungodly hours of 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, meaning that my food is usually spiked with the residual alcohol from their Lombardy region chardonnay and pinot bianco by the pint. However, even getting past the eternal hangover that is my life, how do I avoid that villainous vegetable that the Italians seem to put in every dish: garlic.
Oh the dreaded aglio. For so often I took it for granted during my time in Vienna. Stakes could be easily enough avoided with good planning (an internally locked coffin with plenty of reinforced steel between my face and the world that might wish to destroy me), but the Austrians never bothered with garlic quite as often as they do here.
Maybe I will go back to Vienna and eat some of the people who drink beer.
