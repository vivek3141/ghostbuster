I love the music. It reflects what is just about to happen. It has saved me from more than a few relationships that would have been unsavory.
Either I am the only one who hears it or everyone else does.
Normally, the music is always at a comfortable level, unless it is trying to warn me of something dire. There was one moment whereâ€¦ One moment where the sound was deafening.
There was a rising crescendo ever since I woke up that morning. I turned on the news to watch while eating breakfast, as I always do. Usually the music goes back and forth between dramatic and more more lulling, depending on the news break about to come up. But that morning it didn't change. It just crescendoing until the newscaster spoke.
The sound of the World Trade Centers hitting the table was all I could hear.
As I watched the events unfold, the music continued to be silent. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again.
