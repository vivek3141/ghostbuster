A house is more than just a place to live, it is a place to call home.
Home is when a person knows they are surrounded by people who can make them feel good in the same second.
As a result, my house is also people, and when home takes on a human figure, it is referred to as a family.
Since college is where people spend most of their day, I feel at ease. My classmates, whom I have known for many years, are also at the same school. For instance, I have a friend in the same class as me who is like a sibling to me. We communicate a lot, and he knows all of my secrets. I have known him for years and consider him to be my best friend. All of my professors are familiar to me, and they are all delightful to me. They also instruct me and assist me with any problems I may have.
In this way, I can summarize and express what home for me is. In this essay, like a home, I show my family and the college where I study. For me, the feeling of home is the place where I can return at any time, and if not all, then one person can definitely help me. Home is a sense of calm and security, and for myself, I single out such a factor as communication. The house is the place where you studied something for a long time and communicated with people who, as a result, became close to me. Feeling at home is an essential feeling for every person because it gives people support and faith in themselves and their loved ones.
