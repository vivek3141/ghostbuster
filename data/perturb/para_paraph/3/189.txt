Sainsbury's, one of the UK's largest supermarket chains, has launched its own banking services in partnership with Bank of Scotland. The move comes as the supermarket looks to build on its existing financial services offering, and marks its entry into the competitive retail banking space. 
Personal loans, credit cards, and savings accounts will be offered by the bank.
Speaking about the launch, Sainsbury's CEO Simon Roberts said: "As a trusted brand with millions of customers across the UK, we are well-placed to offer banking services that meet their changing financial needs. We are excited to be partnering with Bank of Scotland, which shares our commitment to customer service and innovation." 
The partnership with Bank of Scotland will see a range of banking services integrated into Sainsbury's stores, giving customers the convenience of being able to manage their banking and shopping in one place. Sainsbury's Bank will also offer digital banking and mobile app services. 
The move into banking is a major strategic shift for Sainsbury's, which has been steadily expanding its financial services offering over the past decade. In 2013, the supermarket bought out Lloyds' stake in Sainsbury's Bank, giving it full control of the business. Since then, it has expanded into travel and pet insurance, as well as personal loans and credit cards. 
With its new banking offering, Sainsbury's will compete with established banks such as Barclays, HSBC, and Lloyds. It will also face competition from other retailers, such as Tesco and M&S, which already have their own banking services. 
Industry experts have praised Sainsbury's for being the first of the big four supermarkets to launch its own full-service bank. Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at Investec, said: "Sainsbury's is taking a smart, low-risk and potentially high-reward step into the retail banking space. Its established customer base gives it an advantage over other new entrants, and the partnership with Bank of Scotland should ensure a smooth launch." 
However, others have warned that Sainsbury's may struggle to compete with the big banks, which have much larger customer bases and more resources. David Watts, a banking consultant at McKinsey, said: "Sainsbury's will need to offer something truly unique to entice customers away from the established banks. It will also need to invest heavily in customer service and technology to stay competitive." 
According to a recent survey by the supermarket, nearly half of its customers would be interested in using its banking services.
The launch of Sainsbury's Bank represents a major milestone for the UK retail banking sector, which has seen increasing competition from non-traditional players in recent years. With its established customer base and innovative products, Sainsbury's looks set to shake up the market and give the big banks a run for their money.
