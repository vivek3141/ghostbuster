The article comprehensively describes the definition of an introvert, the features of his behavior, and personal attitudes in the modern model of society. This category of people often remains misinterpreted in a world focused on predominantly extroverted and energetically intense people. The purpose of the author is in the clearly expressed desire to convey to society the goals and wishes of introverts, whose thoughts and feelings often go unrecognized or neglected. A superficial analysis of the text captures a vivid personal appeal of the author and intensely expresses subjective sentiments due to individual experience. A large number of rhetorical questions at the beginning of the message immediately attract the reader’s attention. The article is written in a journalistic style and has a bright emotional coloring with a hint of a pronounced rejection of the global focus on extraversion.
The reader can understand the author's message through the text analysis.
The position of the author is coherent and has the potential to find its reader and supporter. However, the aftertaste from its reading is rather ambiguous and makes one think about the excessive tendentiousness of the writer. The text does not compare two different categories of people but vigorously downplays the principal personality traits of extroverts. The author says that the world would be much calmer and saner under the guidance of introverts. This theory may well be valid; however, perhaps the world should not be so sharply divided into “white” and “black,” “extroverts,” and “introverts.” This article does a good job of its central purpose: to illustrate an alternative radical vision of the modern model of society separated mainly between extroverts and introverts.
