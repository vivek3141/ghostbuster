I blinked groggily as I awoke to the faint sound of city traffic. Rubbing my eyes, I realized I was no longer in the cozy comfort of my self-driving car. Confused and disoriented, I peered out of the window, only to find myself surrounded by towering skyscrapers and bustling streets I had never seen before.
It was obvious that something had gone wrong when I tried to remember how I ended up here.
Determined to figure out my current whereabouts, I ventured out of the vehicle. The air was filled with unfamiliar scents and the language spoken around me was foreign. As I wandered among the crowds, I noticed the futuristic architecture and advanced technologies that seemed centuries ahead of my time.
My mind raced with questions. Where was I? How had I ended up in a time so distant from my own? Feeling lost and alone, I thought of my loved ones, their faces fading as I traveled further away from home. Tears welled in my eyes as I yearned for familiarity.
I decided to make the most of my unexpected journey and learn from it.
