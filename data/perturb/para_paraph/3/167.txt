They caught up with me as I sat in the interrogation room, surrounded by detectives.
The detectives asked me to recount my first kill, but I was silent.
Her name was Emily. Fragile and lost, she became my first victim, the catalyst for the darkness within me to awaken. I had watched her from afar, learning her routine, her vulnerabilities. That night, I carefully orchestrated my entrance into her life. As she slept soundly, unaware of the force that crept closer, I raised the blade. 
I felt a mixture of fear and excitement as the steel kissed her skin.
The detectives sat in stunned silence, horrified yet captivated by my twisted tale. They had hoped for redemption, repentance maybe even reason. But as I recounted my first kill, they discovered that there is no redemption for me. In my eyes, they could see the emptiness—a void that hungered still—for blood, death, and the thrill of the hunt.
