I struggle out from my cocoon of blankets and into the cold of my bedroom. I like it that way. Every night I open the my window, to let the night in. Every morning the chill startles me awake.

I don't know what to think after a knock at my bedroom door.
‘ Huney, are you ok in there? You'll be late. ’
I look at the note again. And hesitate.
