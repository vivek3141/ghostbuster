One of the changes that a business might need to adapt to is an expanding target market.
P&G will need to make changes in order to succeed in theignored market.
The main contextual variable that led to P&Gâ€™s restructuring was the changes in the target market as revealed by a study. The study was conducted by Male Grooming Trends: Profiting in 2009 and Beyond. It showed that although female consumers dominated the market for personal grooming products, the market for male consumers was quickly expanding. P&G saw an opportunity to profit from an expanding market. Therefore, redesigning was necessitated by changes in the market characteristics.
The demographic market for motorcycles was older white men.
In conclusion, companies should keep up-to-date with any changes in the market. All industries are constantly evolving, and it would be unwise for businesses to stick to old ways. In the given case study, P&G has the potential to generate profit from a new market for personal care products. It will need to redesign its recruitment practices to exploit this opportunity. Restructuring for a new reality can be a profitable venture if done correctly as shown by Harley Davidson, NFL, and Stryx.
