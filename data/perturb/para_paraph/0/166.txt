Lear Corp. has announced the acquisition of Borealis Industrier AB, a Swedish automotive interior systems provider, to create a truly comprehensive offering for automakers worldwide. The deal, which is expected to close within the next few months, will see Lear Corp. take full control of the privately-held company, adding to its already impressive portfolio of automotive components and electronics.
With the acquisition of Borealis, Lear Corp. is looking to provide a total solution for automakers, including everything from seating systems and electronics to complete interior solutions. This move follows a successful year for Lear Corp., who have enjoyed solid demand across all of their product categories, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Borealis has proven itself to be an excellent partner for Lear Corp. over the years, working closely together to provide innovative interior solutions that meet the unique needs of each automotive customer. This acquisition will allow Lear Corp. to integrate Borealis’ design, engineering, and manufacturing capabilities directly into its own operations, creating a truly streamlined and efficient experience for automakers.
The acquisition of Borealis also means that Lear Corp. will be able to offer customers a wider range of colors, materials, and finishes for their automotive interiors. The company has already indicated that it will be investing heavily in Borealis’ manufacturing facilities in Sweden, giving it access to state-of-the-art equipment and processes that will further streamline its operations and improve output quality.
In announcing the acquisition, Lear Corp. CEO Ray Scott said that the move would “grow our presence in the automotive interiors market and support our ongoing efforts to provide customers with innovative products that are safe, sustainable, and affordable.” He added that building on the strengths of the two companies would help Lear Corp. “adapt to the evolving market conditions and position our business for long-term growth.”
The acquisition of Borealis marks a significant step forward for Lear Corp. in its mission to build the most comprehensive range of automotive interior components and systems in the world. As automakers look to differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive market, Lear Corp. is well-positioned to deliver the quality, reliability, and innovation that they demand.
