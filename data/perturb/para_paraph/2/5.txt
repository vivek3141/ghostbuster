Level 49 Paladin, schizophrenic calling's, walking through this wall-things all day to come to grips with my prowess. Wow kids, don't let the boogey man boogie in your closet, you must have forgot to lock it, agnostic parents with a pocket full of apocalypse and a head full of spaces. Taste this, another jesus bracelet broke, another spirit invoked, hold on to hope so faith can poke it's head into the realm of the dead.
It's better to break than continue to bend, snap your soul in two and let it mend...was it real?
War of the worlds, obsolete factions matching gains and comparing beef-sticks, equipped to rip shit, just trust in the sky.
