Barry Diller has recently announced that his company, Silver King Communications, will soon launch a new national broadcasting network. The announcement came hot on the heels of Silver King's acquisition of the Home Shopping Network (HSN), a move that Diller says will provide the funding necessary to support the company's ambitious plans.
The time is ripe for a new national broadcasting outlet that will be geared toward a younger, more tech savvy audience.
The financial clout that the acquisition of HSN will give Silver King will be needed to make its network a reality.
"We see a huge opportunity in creating a new type of broadcasting network that is truly designed for the 21st century," Diller said in a statement. "The acquisition of HSN gives us the resources we need to make this vision a reality, and we're excited to get to work building something truly special for viewers across the country."
While the specifics of the new network have yet to be revealed, Diller has hinted that it will focus on lifestyle and entertainment content, with an emphasis on technology and innovation. It remains to be seen whether Silver King's new broadcasting venture will be successful, but with the acquisition of HSN, the company is certainly poised to make a big splash in the world of media and entertainment in the years to come.
