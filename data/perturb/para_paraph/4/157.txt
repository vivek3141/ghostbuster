In fairytales, there's a way to break the curse when a loved one falls into a deep sleep.
When I saw him fall asleep early after a rough day at work I smiled and thought how adorable he looked hugging the pillow with a strange intensity. Now that pose feels more like something of his is just hanging on.
The entire ward of the hospital was shut down after doctors started falling asleep in the middle of their rounds.
"New virus places hundreds into comas. Public advised to stay indoors."
And so I did.
Every piece of media I look to continues to cover the story as more and more people are dropping into deep sleep throughout the country. A few reports even cite my husband as patient zero. We're at the point where initial patients are slow starving to death from lack of nutrient intake. This entire epidemic is driving me crazy.
I can't leave the house, I can't go to work.
I don't want to stay inside anymore and PrinceCharming will find a way to do it.
