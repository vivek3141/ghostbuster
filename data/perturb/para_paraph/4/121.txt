Death was the most feared of us all.
War scratched his thinning beard. He was running out of options. No others had dared to take up such a heavy burden. While War was no stranger to the horrors of, he shuddered to think about the atrocities that Death had committed. Was there any being in the 7 realms to take up the Cloak and Scythe?
Famine said there is someone.
"Brothers you are aware that all the atrocities we have committed were dealt by Man. War, death, famine and conquest. These were all Man's undoing. Who else better to don the burden of Death then a man himself?"
Famine's ragged hood covered his face, only showing his decaying mouth twisted in a sick smile.
Conquest was quick to challenge.
"Man, donning the very bane of his existence? Brother, your imprudence will be the end of us all. A mortal man is hideous creature. He is greedy, selfish and cruel. Giving one this much power will only result in abuse."
"Conquest, you are as foolish as ever. Have you learnt nothing from Death? He was the wisest of us all, he-"
We are the horsemen of the apocalypse, both terrible and glorious, and we will charge and strike fear into the hearts of sinners. When the Horn of the Heavens sounds we will charge and strike fear into the hearts of sinners.
"ENOUGH!"
War slammed into Conquest, knocking him down to the brimstone. He unleashed an onslaught of blows onto his golden armor until it was dented beyond recognition. Breathless, War stood up towering over his foe and boomed.
"I will not take this insolence. Death was the best of us. I loved him as a brother and a mentor."
War's stone face softened for a second.
"Should you be stupid enough to blaspheme our brother again, I will end you."
Conquest said that he would pay for the humiliation he had suffered.
"Famine. You say that a mortal can replace Death. Bring him to me."
"As you wish brother."
