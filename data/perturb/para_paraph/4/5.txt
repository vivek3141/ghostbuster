Don't let the boogey man boogie in your closet, you must have forgotten to lock it, parents with a pocket full of apocalypse.
It's better to break than continue to bend, snap your soul in two and let it mend...was it real?
War of the worlds, obsolete factions matching gains and comparing beef-sticks, equipped to rip shit like timid midgets insistent on doing what they didn't. Try not to be so literal, try not to feel intangibles as they creep up your spine, just trust in the sky and the stars will align. I ain't no judge, I ain't no jury, I'm just a boy walkin with a vision too blurry to comprehend foe from friend and truth from trend but then again I can close my eyes and count to ten.. no fingers required, no toes to slow my numeral crusade, okay?
