When I dream, I have two hands that are not like the hands I have in my waking life. They possess an otherworldly elegance, yet exude an enigmatic power. I am no longer limited by the physicality of my human form; I am a being capable of transcending boundaries.
In my dreams, these extraordinary hands allow me to create and shape worlds. With a flick of my wrist, colors dance in vibrant kaleidoscopic patterns, weaving intricate tapestries of imagination. I watch in awe as the night sky morphs into a mesmerizing display of twinkling stars and vivid constellations. The very fabric of reality yields to my touch, molding itself to my whims.
As the wielder of possibilities, I have a temptation to explore the depths of my unconscious.
Shadows cling to my fingertips, and an eerie mist follows my every movement in this twisted realm.
Yet, even in this twisted realm, goodness prevails within me. I use my hands to shape heroes, imbuing them with courage and strength. In this ethereal battleground, they wage a fierce war against the darkness that consumes my dreams. With their noble hearts and my hands as their conduit, they forge a brighter future, where light reigns supreme.
When I awake, the memory of these dream hands lingers, twinkling in my mind's eye like distant starlight. Though I cannot physically possess these hands in the waking world, their essence remains. They serve as a reminder of the infinite potential that lies dormant within me, of the untapped power waiting to be unleashed.
I embark on my waking life with a renewed sense of purpose.
