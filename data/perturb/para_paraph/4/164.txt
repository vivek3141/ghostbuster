Children's television shows and movies are seen as extensions of capitalist values by Adorno.
A prominent example of media products reinforcing capitalist values can be seen in the vast amount of merchandise associated with popular children's franchises. For instance, the success of animated films like the "Frozen" series goes far beyond the box office revenue. It encompasses a wide range of merchandise, including toys, clothing, and accessories. These products are not just meant to entertain children, but also to create demand for consumer goods. The media plays a significant role in shaping children's desires and preferences, deliberately promoting consumer culture.
Media products for children serve a positive function in society according to structural functionalism.
While structural functionalism acknowledges the influence of capitalism in media production, it emphasizes the positive social contributions of these media products.
In conclusion, media products for children do reinforce capitalist values to a significant extent, according to Adorno's concept of industrial culture. Examples like the promotional merchandise associated with popular children's franchises emphasize the materialistic nature underlying these products. However, the perspective of structural functionalism offers a more optimistic view, emphasizing the educational and unifying aspects of media products. While both perspectives recognize capitalist influences in media production, they differ in their evaluation of the overall impact on society and children.
