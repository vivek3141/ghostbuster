Barry Diller has recently announced that his company, Silver King Communications, will soon launch a new national broadcasting network. The announcement came hot on the heels of Silver King's acquisition of the Home Shopping Network (HSN), a move that Diller says will provide the funding necessary to support the company's ambitious plans.
Silver King is no stranger to broadcasting â€“ the company already has a successful network of local television stations across the U.S. However, Diller believes that the time is ripe for a new national broadcasting outlet that will be geared toward a younger, more tech-savvy audience. The new network will feature a mix of original programming and content from other media companies, as well as live events and interactive elements that will be designed to engage viewers in new and exciting ways.
The financial clout that the acquisition of HSN will give Silver King will be needed to make its network a reality.
"We see a huge opportunity in creating a new type of broadcasting network that is truly designed for the 21st century," Diller said in a statement. "The acquisition of HSN gives us the resources we need to make this vision a reality, and we're excited to get to work building something truly special for viewers across the country."
lifestyle and entertainment will be the focus of the new network.
