Hong Kong's air cargo handling rose by 6.7% in August compared to the same month last year. This is despite the ongoing trade tension between China and the US that has affected the global economy.
According to the HKIA, the increase in air cargo volume was due to a growth in exports.
In August, the airport handled a total of 434,000 tonnes of cargo.
Despite the ongoing trade war, HKIA continues to be competitive, offering airlines and shippers access to extensive air and sea networks and a logistics industry hub.
Despite the uncertain global economic environment, HKIA remains optimistic about future growth.
