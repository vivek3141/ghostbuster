When it comes to healthcare, such facilities need more attention because they focus on people's well-being.
Integrity is a vital part of a healthcare business.
Another important business principle is proper cash flow management. Healthcare facility requires renovations and innovations, meaning that there will constantly be situations when new equipment or repairs will be needed (Mason et al., 2020). In this situation, it is highly necessary to implement the needed changes to not jeopardize patientsâ€™ health and well-being. For example, as a CNO, it was my obligation to manage the replacement of power generators. As a result, generators enabled the personnel to carry out their duty without problems during a storm and power outage.
In a healthcare facility, it is important that the employees are rewarded for their hard work.
The impact the principles can have on employees and patients was the reason why they were chosen.
