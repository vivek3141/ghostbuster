In the Heat of the Night
The idea behind Supertom can be described as a trope used to make a black character heroic. The result is a peculiar image of a magical black, who is a minor or even almost background character, whose mission is to help the protagonist guide him. To show the audience that ethnic minority characters are not bad people, Supertom takes a step forward to help others. They usually enter into the life of a much more privileged and, in particular, almost always white, the central character, and in some way enrich the life of this main character. Some examples of Supertom include Lucius Fox from Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, Michael Clarke Duncan in The Green Mile , Bagger Vance in The Legend of Bagger Vance, and Uncle Remus from Song of the South.
Supertom is obtained when a black character is endowed with high achievements and extraordinary positive characteristics.
The relationship in the movie suggests a kind of friendship between blacks and whites that Americans like to think of as accurate, but that is not the case in the time frame in which In the Heat of the Night takes place.
Do the Right Thing
In February 2020, two white men killed Ahmaud Arbery for allegedly robbing someone.
The theme of US racism is displayed in most of Spike Lee's films, and the director's attitude towards it is critical.
Despite the explosive denouement, one of the film’s strengths is the complexity of its characters and the portrayal of blackness on screen. Lee went beyond the stereotypes of African Americans in movies and created characters that are reflected in everyday life. In Do the Right Thing , blacks are not represented in the traditional binary of inferior and smiling, aggressive and dangerous, but rather can exist as fuller expressions of themselves.
