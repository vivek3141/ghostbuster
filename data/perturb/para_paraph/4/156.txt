"You ready yet? I'm about to leave!"
"Yeah, I just need to find my keys in this mess.. Do you want to me to follow?" She asks as she rummages through her purse.
"Yeah that's fine. Be careful driving! See you in a bit sis!"
When I was younger, I used to be able to pick up my little sister from my mom and be there at the same time, not have to worry about traffic or work.
We can't do anything now and I hate driving.
Oh my gosh.
Please.
I look back the the rearview, slow down sis...This guy seems to be either stupid or dru - before I can look back again I hear the sound of glass shattering and metal grinding against itself, breaks screeching. No, no no no no no....
