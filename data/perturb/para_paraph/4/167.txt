They caught up with me while I was in the interrogation room.
The detectives asked me to recount my first kill, but I was silent.
Her name was Emily. Fragile and lost, she became my first victim, the catalyst for the darkness within me to awaken. I had watched her from afar, learning her routine, her vulnerabilities. That night, I carefully orchestrated my entrance into her life. As she slept soundly, unaware of the force that crept closer, I raised the blade. 
My hand trembled with a mix of fear and exhilaration as the steel kissed her skin. I cannot deny the intoxicating power coursing through my veins, knowing I held her very life in my hands. In that moment, I saw her life force escape her body, extinguished by my hand. The feeling was indescribable.
The detectives were horrified by my twisted tale and realized that there was no redemption for me.
