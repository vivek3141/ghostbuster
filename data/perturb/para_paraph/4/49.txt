Sorry to be so dour, but I had to write something for that first 3-panel:
[1]
Character 1 - What do you think the fences on the roof are for?
I suppose the second character is to stop people from falling.
[3]
Character 1 - Would a fence really stop someone bent on killing themselves?
They don't want it to be their problem to deal with, so maybe get them to use a different building.
[3] Character 2 has walked off screen
Maybe if someone did, they wouldn't need the fence anymore.
