The modern world is currently facing a significant change under globalization trends that shape economies, politics, the workplace, education, and even everyday behavior. Most importantly, due to the active exchange of information between people worldwide, culture is changing. Researchers try to understand whether the culture will be further homogenized in globalization or diversified. This paper will argue that culture will become more diverse under the influence of globalization due to the introduction of multiple cultural elements into societies.
The latest processes in cultural change show that both sides of the argument have reasonable grounds.
The strength of local cultures is seen as more compelling by the other side.
Since market forces rule these processes, the host cultures are aware of the origins of the borrowed cultural clusters.
