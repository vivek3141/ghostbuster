Readjusting the bag price is necessary in order to maximize profits because the bag market is a large one, where customers are highly fragmented and products vary in both quality and purpose.
55% prefer to buy online, and tote bags are the fastest-growing handbag styles. Many low-end bags have prices below $65, but the selected product is made from leather and can be categorized as a mid-range, and thus, it cannot be lower than $65. The target audience is middle-class and higher-class mothers, but it should be noted that the brand is still unknown and requires proper marketing to build brand image. Thus, it is unjustified to select a high price range and risk lowering the demand, and it cannot compete with high-end bags and is not recognized as such.
