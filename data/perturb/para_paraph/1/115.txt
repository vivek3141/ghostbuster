The clothing industry has many firms competing against each other while producing similar products.
Steel manufacturing is an example of an oligopolistic competitive industry. In such a market, a few steel manufacturing companies rule over other firms. The few firms are the price and trendsetters for other small companies and often form a partnership to operate successfully (Ritz 185). To distinguish themselves from their competitors, they improve their product quality, hike or lower prices, and advertise the special features of their products. In an oligopolistic market, if a leading company lowers prices, the others do not follow but rather improve their products to remain in the higher cuts of prices (Ritz 187). The few leading companies also stay competitive in the industry by setting their standards high to prevent easy entry into the industry. The firms set high standards by producing the highest quality products, selling them at a higher price, and producing them in high quantities (Ritz 189). That way, they ensure that the small or new companies fear the competition at the top thus ensuring reduced entry to the industry.
