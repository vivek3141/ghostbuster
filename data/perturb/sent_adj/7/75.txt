As such I never committed into relationships, probably by great of having my feelings not reciprocated. It always puzzled me, to say the least, and made me extremely nervous. My longest relationship was with a man I loved deeply, Indy. He was friend with everyone, but still reliable and generous. He was the complete opposite of me: extraverted, charming, outgoing. We stayed together for a couple of years, and, I don't know why, but it really seemed like he had feelings for me. But like I did in other relationships before, I shut him down, rejecting him when I felt my feelings growing to much. In the end he left me, like they all did. I met other men and women, and it always ended the same way. I learned later that he was with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of time when we were together. Fast forward to yesterday. Kelly calls me, saying that Indy was in the hospital, after being hit by a car. His condition was critical, and he has asked for me. And here I am, a bouquet of flowers in hands, nervously looking for room 68. I find it, half opened, and take a deep breath to give myself courage, and here Indy's weak voice. "Kelly, you're...a wonderful girl but...I...I...I never loved you." I storm in the room, but his eyes are already closed. Forever. The words hit me like a punch.
