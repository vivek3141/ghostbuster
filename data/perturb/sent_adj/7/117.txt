‘ …and we'll have an interview with him and his prize marrow at around a quarter to eight. ’
The daily news blares over the radio. The time is six-fifty-five, and this is BBC Southern Counties Radio. Light rolls through the curtains. I turn over in bed. Minutes pass, and I hear all the familiar sound. Just another Monday morning. Cars on the road outside. The world is waking up. My flatmates stirring in their rooms. I struggle out from my cocoon of blankets and into the cold of my bedroom. I like it that way. Every morning the chill startles me awake. Every night I open the my window, to let the night in. I open the curtains, look out onto the street. The usual crowd waltz down the street, going wherever it is they go. Someone glances up at my window, and hurriedly looks away as they realise I'm half naked. As I walk across the room something crunches underfoot. A small, folded piece of paper on the floor. My name is written on it, in my own handwriting. I pick it up, scrutinise it. I don't remember writing this. *Act normally, otherwise they'll notice. *
I'm confused. I open it, and read the words inside. What does it mean? I really don't recall writing this. Who are ‘ they ’? The questions are rattled from my head by a knock at my bedroom door. My flatmate. ‘ Huney, are you ok in there? You'll be late. ’
I look at the note again. And hesitate.
