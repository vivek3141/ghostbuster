‘ …and we'll have an interview with him and his prize marrow at around a quarter to eight. The time is six-fifty-five, and this is BBC Southern Counties Radio. Light rolls through the curtains. ’
The daily news blares over the radio. Just another Monday morning. I turn over in bed. Minutes pass, and I hear all the familiar sound. Cars on the road outside. My flatmates stirring in their rooms. The world is waking up. I struggle out from my cocoon of blankets and into the cold of my bedroom. I like it that way. Every night I open the my window, to let the night in. Every morning the chill startles me awake. I open the curtains, look out onto the street. The usual crowd waltz down the street, going wherever it is they go. As I walk across the room something crunches underfoot. Someone glances up at my window, and hurriedly looks away as they realise I'm half naked. A small, folded piece of paper on the floor. My name is written on it, in my own handwriting. I pick it up, scrutinise it. I don't remember writing this. I open it, and read the words inside. *
I'm confused. I really don't recall writing this. *Act normally, otherwise they'll notice. What does it mean? Who are ‘ they ’? The questions are rattled from my head by a knock at my bedroom door. ‘ Huney, are you ok in there? My flatmate. And hesitate. ’
I look at the note again. You'll be late.
