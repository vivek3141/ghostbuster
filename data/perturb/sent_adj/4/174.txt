Medical institutions function to protect the interests of patients and meet their needs; they are now the object of attention of society as a whole. The population’s confidence in the activities of medical organizations is an essential indicator of their effectiveness. Bringing current terminology and the nature of the relationship between patients and physicians into a state of certainty will help to understand and delineate the nature of consumerism in health care (Calnal, 2010). They feel vulnerable not only because they are sick but also because of the research and treatment they have to undergo. The absence or lack of trust is of particular concern to patients. Improving the efficiency of the health care system is a policy priority for European countries. In today’s world, patients expect adequate professional skills from doctors and high standards of interpersonal communication. Patients are increasingly comparing options at different clinics, learning a lot of information about doctors and medical services, as well as publicly available information about diseases (Calnan, 2010). In recent years, they have become more aware of medical options and the kind of care they can receive at specific medical organizations. The shortcomings of medical care, not the assertive consumerism, are causing the growing interest in self-education among patients. A negative consequence of this trend is the widespread use by patients of Internet materials for self-diagnosis and treatment. The vulnerability of patients undergoing treatment can be reduced by restoring trust between them and the treating physician. Moreover, appropriate training and highly qualified doctors are factors that determine how friendly and relaxed the clinics’ clients will be about the manipulations they undergo. The destruction of the interpersonal relationship between doctors and patients due to the introduction of depersonalized procedures becomes the subject of research in the coming years.
