Level 49 Paladin, schizophrenic calling's, walking through this wall-things all day to come to grips with my prowess. Wow kids, don't let the boogey man boogie in your closet, you must have forgot to lock it, agnostic parents wiht a pocket full of apocalypse and a head full of spaces. Tsate this, anotherj esus bracelet broke, another spirit invoked, holdo n to hope so faith can poke it's head into the realm of the dead.
I spy with m ylittle eye a child teetering on the edge; hold hands with me and the rest of your invisible friends. It's better to break than continue to bend, snap your soul in two and let it mend...was it real? What I saw? What was it truly doing what it did? What was hidden inside of my mind projected or reality neglected...Something segmented and crittering beneath th eflowboards of the Torjan horse awoke my paralysis through the sacred doors.
War of the worlds, obsolete factions matching gains and comparing beef-sticks, equipped to rip shit liket imid midgets insistent on doing what they didn't. Try not to be so literal, try not to feel intangibles as they creep up your spine, just trust in the sky and the stars will align. I ain't no judge, I ain't no jury, I'm just a boy walkin with a vision too blurry to comprehend foe from friend and truth from trendb ut then again I can close my eyes and count to ten.. no fingers required, no toes to lsow my numeral crusade, okay?
