Sarah gasped for breath, her frail body sinking into the hospital bed. Her wrinkled hands trembled as she clutched the weathered photograph of her beloved husband. With a whisper so fragile, she uttered her final words, "Charles, my love, thank you for giving me a lifetime of laughter and love. You, with your warm smile and mischievous eyes, taught me to cherish every moment. Our memories, woven like a tapestry in my heart, will comfort me in this last journey. Please, promise me, be happy after I'm gone. I'll forever be your guiding star, watching over you. Goodbye, my love."
