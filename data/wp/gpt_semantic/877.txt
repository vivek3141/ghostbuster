It was a terrifying moment. The rain was pouring down, blurring my vision as the car skidded on the wet road. My heart pounded in my chest, and panic started to consume me. In desperation, I threw my hands in the air and shouted, "Jesus take the wheel!"
Suddenly, everything went silent. My eyes squeezed shut tightly, awaiting the inevitable crash. But as the seconds passed, no impact came. I hesitantly opened my eyes, only to find myself unharmed. My car was still moving, but something was different.
To my astonishment, I discovered that Jesus wasn't driving the car. No, instead, it was a young man with a mischievous grin plastered across his face. His disheveled hair indicated a carefree attitude, and his casual attire didn't seem to match the gravity of the situation. It was as if I had stumbled upon a completely unexpected scenario.
"Who are you?" I questioned, gripping the steering wheel tightly.
He chuckled, a sound filled with both amusement and reassurance. "Relax, my friend. You called, and I responded. But Jesus is a busy man, so he sent me instead."
My baffled expression must have intrigued him because he continued. "You see, I'm Gabriel, his right-hand man, so to speak. In situations like this, I take the wheel while he focuses on more pressing matters."
As we drove along safely, my mind whirled with a mixture of disbelief and gratitude. Maybe this unexpected driver wasn't what I had expected, but his presence somehow brought me an odd sense of comfort. Perhaps in those uncertain moments, when we're at the mercy of fate, it doesn't always matter who is driving.
