Once upon a time, a brave and noble knight named Sir George set out on a quest to slay a fearsome dragon who had been terrorizing the land. The entire kingdom admired Sir George for his valor, his unwavering courage, and his unfathomable strength. But what they didn't realize was that I, as the antagonist, held the key to the truth.
You see, this dragon they so despised was not the chaotic beast they believed it to be. It was a kind-hearted creature, desperate to protect the land from the greed and corruption of the kingdom. I had seen their crimes firsthand, their disregard for the well-being of the people beneath them. And so, I raised the dragon as my own, teaching it to breathe fire upon injustice.
As Sir George approached, brandishing his gleaming sword, the dragon sensed the same spirit of righteousness within him. But it was too late to discern his true intentions. The knight ambushed the dragon, forcing it into a treacherous and fatal battle that ended with the dragon's demise.
The kingdom rejoiced; they believed their courageous hero had vanquished the dreadful beast. Little did they know that they had unknowingly allowed a monster to operate within their walls. While Sir George revelled in the glory and admiration of the people, my true intentions remained concealed, hidden within the depths of my dark heart.
And so, my dear reader, remember this cautionary tale. Not all villains reveal themselves with sinister laughter or ominous shadows. Some villains, like me, hide in plain sight, disguising themselves as heroes while they manipulate the world around them.
