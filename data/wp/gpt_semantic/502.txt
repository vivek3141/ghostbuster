Once upon a time, there were two friends named Jack and Sarah. They lived in a small town where the sun always shone, and the birds always sang. One sunny Sunday, they decided to go on an adventure to the nearby forest. They laughed and danced through the trees, feeling the warm breeze upon their faces. Suddenly, they stumbled upon a hidden treasure chest. Excitement filled their hearts, but when they opened it, disappointment washed over them. It was empty! Their joyful adventure turned into their worst nightmare. However, they learned a valuable lesson that day - true treasure is the memories made along the way.
