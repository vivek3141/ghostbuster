Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a man named Jasper who had a peculiar belief. He thought that when he died, he could take all his possessions into the afterlife. People laughed at his absurd notion, but Jasper was determined to prove them wrong.
When Jasper finally passed away, much to everyone's surprise, his ghostly form appeared clutching all his belongings. However, upon closer inspection, the items were faded and intangible, like distant memories. No one could touch or use them.
It dawned on Jasper in that moment that his worldly possessions were worthless in the afterlife. He realized that true worth lies not in material things, but in the connections and experiences one has in life. As his belongings slipped away, Jasper's spirit was finally free to wander and explore the true riches of the afterlife.
