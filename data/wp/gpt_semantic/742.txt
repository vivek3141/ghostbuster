Once upon a time, in a world much like ours, there existed a group of big oil companies who carried a deep, dark secret. Not only were these companies pioneers in drilling and extracting fuel from deep beneath the Earth's surface, but they also possessed a hidden knowledge about the phenomenon we would come to know as global warming.
In the early 1980s, as the world reveled in the neon colors and catchy tunes of the decade, scientists within these oil conglomerates began to raise questions. They had stumbled upon some ancient documents—well, ancient in the sense that they dated back to the 1960s—which hinted at the potential dangers of carbon emissions. These documents spoke of rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and a planet begging for mercy.
Certain individuals within these companies, fueled by a peculiar curiosity, started digging deeper. They found whispers of time travel, in hushed conversations between physicists and conspiracy theorists who met at roadside diners. Word began to spread that the big oil companies weren't just aware of global warming; they were also on the hunt for those sent from the future to invent clean technologies.
To ordinary folks like me, this all seemed far-fetched. How could oil executives possibly know about such things? But as the years passed, strange tales started to unfold. Whispers grew louder, gathering strength and belief. Rumors spread like wildfire, threatening to expose their sinister plans.
It was said that these oil giants had devised secret underground laboratories, nestled deep within abandoned mineshafts and remote locations. Here, they deployed a haphazard array of machinery and sensors, hoping to track any traces of time travelers. Their goal was simple: capture them before they could invent anything that would disrupt the fossil fuel empire.
But as time crept on, their search became more desperate. Decades passed, yet no time travelers were found. The oil companies began to realize that their hunt was in vain. It seemed that the future had played a trick on them, concealing its secrets and laughing as these companies stumbled through time in search of elusive inventors.
And so, dear reader, this story reveals the limits of power and greed. In their quest for supremacy, the big oil companies had inadvertently shown us their fears and weaknesses. They were not invincible, nor did they hold the key to the world's future. The future, it seemed, was an impenetrable fortress, forever eluding their grasp.
