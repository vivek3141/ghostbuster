Once upon a time, in a quaint little town, there lived a seemingly ordinary man named Benjamin. Benjamin was just like any other person, going through the motions of life day after day, never expecting anything unusual to happen. But one fateful day, everything changed.
It began as a typical Monday morning - alarm blaring, a lukewarm cup of coffee, and a long commute to a job he despised. However, the universe had something else in store for Benjamin that day. The worst day of his life.
His boss scolded him mercilessly, his car broke down, and he spilled hot coffee all over his freshly pressed suit. It seemed as if every misfortune that could possibly happen befell Benjamin. As he trudged back home, soaked from the rain and feeling defeated, he stumbled upon a peculiar old bookshop hidden in an alleyway.
Inside, he discovered an ancient tome that claimed to offer a unique power to its reader - the ability to choose their own destiny. Skeptical, Benjamin decided to test its contents. From that point forward, at the end of each day, he found himself faced with three options: continue, restart the day, or restart life.
After experiencing one disastrous day after another, Benjamin couldn't bear another moment of his existence. Overwhelmed by the everlasting turmoil, he found himself longing to restart his life entirely. What if he could undo all the hurt and pain he had endured?
With trembling fingers, he closed his eyes and selected the restart life option. In an instant, Benjamin felt an indescribable sensation, as if time itself was being rewound. Suddenly, he found himself awakening in his childhood bedroom, with a newfound determination to make the most of every day.
Little did he know that his journey had just begun and that every choice he made would shape his destiny in ways he could never have imagined.
