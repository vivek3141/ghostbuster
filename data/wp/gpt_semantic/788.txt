Once upon a time, in a magical land far, far away, there lived a little boy named Timmy. Timmy's grandma wanted to give him a special gift, so she went to the bookstore to find a perfect first book for him to read. The kind lady at the bookstore suggested a book called "The Adventures of the Brave Dragon." Timmy's eyes sparkled with excitement as grandma handed him the book. With each page he turned, Timmy discovered thrilling tales, mysterious lands, and brave heroes. He couldn't stop smiling! From that day on, Timmy fell in love with reading, thanks to the magical world that awaited him inside his first book.
