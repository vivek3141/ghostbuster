Once upon a time there was a boy named Timmy. He lived in a big house with his mom and dad. One day, Timmy was playing in the backyard when he saw a shiny object on the ground. He reached down and picked it up. It was a magical wand! Timmy waved the wand in the air and suddenly he turned into a frog. He hopped all around the yard, and then he saw a pretty girl frog. Her name was Lily. Lily and Timmy fell in love and hopped off into the sunset. They lived happily ever after in the land of frogs. The end.
