Once, I was just an ordinary person, going about my days in peace and harmony. But the sequence of events during the past weeks turned me into a desperate, tormented soul. I never intended to become a murderous savage, but life had other plans for me.
It all started when I lost my job. For years, I had dedicated myself to that company, pouring my heart and soul into every task. But suddenly, without any warning, I was cast aside like a worn-out tool. Struggling to make ends meet, the weight of despair began to crush me.
As my financial worries grew, so did my frustration with society as a whole. Everywhere I turned, the system showed its cruel face, leaving me no choice but to take matters into my own hands. I had to survive, to fight back against the injustices that plagued my existence.
One night, walking through the dimly lit streets, I stumbled upon a group of wealthy individuals reveling in their excess. Their laughter echoed through my mind, a stark contrast to my misery. Envy twisted my insides, fueling an uncontrollable rage burning deep within me. It was in that moment, overwhelmed by desperation, that I committed my first act of violence.
With each subsequent crime, I found myself becoming more entangled in the web of darkness. The once innocent bystander now took pleasure in inflicting pain upon those who represented the unfairness of the world. A sensation of power surged through me, liberating my long-suppressed desires. Though my actions shocked even me, I couldn't deny that for the first time in my life, I felt alive.
However, hidden amidst my violent rampage, there remained a flicker of empathy, buried beneath layers of rage. With every life I took, I couldn't help but imagine the burdens they might carry, the injustices they had suffered themselves. I never intended to harm the innocent, but as darkness clouded my mind, I became blind to distinguishing right from wrong.
In the depths of my derangement, I couldn't help but long for an escape from the torment I had become. But society had already labeled me, condemned me to the role of a monstrous villain. The weight of their judgment fueled my descent into madness. How could they not see the desperation that pushed me to this breaking point?
So here I stand, a murderous savage, once an ordinary person. The tears I shed now only come with regret and remorse. I will carry the burden of my actions until the end of my days. In the midst of darkness, I wish only for someone to understand the twisted path that led me here, to sympathize with the monster I've become.
