Once upon far, far long ago, there were big booms in the sky and everything fell apart. Two thousand years later, tiny tribes found the holy grounds of the Sesame Street studios. These sacred buildings became their churches, for they held the secret knowledge of those who came before. The tribes gathered around a dusty old television set and watched shows from a better time. They marveled at Big Bird's wisdom, Oscar the Grouch's resilience, and Cookie Monster's insatiable hunger. From these characters, they formed their beliefs, crafting laws against selfishness like Oscar's isolation, and spreading kindness like Big Bird's wings. And so, the tribes lived happily, guided by the divine Sesame Street.
