Once upon a time, in the Hundred Acre Wood, Piglet and his friends planned a surprise party for Christopher Robin's 19th birthday. They thought it would be a fun adventure to visit the big city and take Christopher to a place called the "Strip Club". They imagined sparkly decorations and maybe even a cake with a belly dancer on top! Excited and nervous, they tiptoed into the club and were met with thumping music and flashing lights. But instead of a magical party, they saw people wearing funny outfits and dancing in peculiar ways. Blushing from ear to ear, Piglet whispered, "Oh, bother! This isn't quite what I had in mind."
