season 30 of game of thrones. the last and final showdown, winter is coming. Jon snow is fighting against the night king and his army of white walkers. there's so much blood and death, it's really intense. dany is on her dragon, trying to burn down the white walkers. she's like the mother of dragons or something.
the hound and the mountain are fighting, all this while arya is sneaking up on cersei to kill her. 
it's really epic, you guys. the music and everything. my heart is pounding. i don't know what's going to happen next. is jon going to kill the night king? is arya going to kill cersei? i can't handle it.
oh my god, jon snow just stabbed the night king with his valyrian steel sword. the night king is dead and so are all the white walkers. winter is finally over. they did it. they saved the seven kingdoms.
but wait, what's happening now? the whole place is collapsing. king's landing is falling apart. daenerys is dead? what just happened? this is so sad. everyone is crying. the dragons are flying away. it's all over.
season 30 ends with a montage of all the characters and their journeys. they all went through so much. it's definitely bittersweet.
and that's it. game of thrones is over. i'm going to miss it so much. it was such a good show, even with the bad writing and everything. i don't care what anyone says, it was amazing. i can't wait for the spin-offs. i hope they're just as good. but for now, it's goodbye to all my favorite characters. it's been a wild ride.
