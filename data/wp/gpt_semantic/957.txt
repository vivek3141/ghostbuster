Once upon a time in the distant future, a great council of cosmic beings gathered to decide the fate of the human race. One brave soul, a humble beginner writer named Sarah, stepped forward to share the faults of her kind. Breathless and barely containing her excitement, Sarah stuttered, "Um, well, humans tend to, uh, forgetâ€¦the power of love and kindness. Yes, we sometimes disregard nature's harmony and prioritize progress over preservation. We, um, struggle with unity and often let fear rule our actions. Oh, and we sometimes make mistakes, big ones. But, uh, we have potential to learn, to grow and change. We carry within us an unyielding spark of hope." Awed by her honesty, the cosmic beings smiled, realizing that even beginners hold wisdom worth considering.
