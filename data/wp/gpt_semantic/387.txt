Once upon a times, there were mistakes everywhere on the internet. People used bad grammar and misspelled words. It was chaos! But then, a law was passed. The law was called UN-334772G. It made it an international crime to post online content which contained bad grammar. And that is where my story begins.
My name is Arthur, and I am a grammar police officer. Today was my first day on the job, and I was super excited. I put on my brand new uniform, which was a bright neon green vest with "Grammar Police" written on it in big letters. I looked at myself in the mirror and thought, "I am going to make the internet a better place!"
I logged into my computer and immediately started scrolling through social media. It didn't take long for me to spot my first offender. A person had written, "I cant wait 2 go 2 the partee tonight!" I gasped in horror. How could someone commit such a heinous act against the English language?
I took a deep breath, put on my helmet (a stylish fedora adorned with a golden question mark), and set off on my mission. I arrived at the offender's house and knocked on the door. A person with messy hair and disheveled clothes opened it. "Hi there. I am Arthur, the Grammar Police. I am here to arrest you for your poor grammar," I announced confidently.
The person looked utterly confused. "Poor grammar? What are you talking about?"
I held up my trusty grammar manual and pointed at the page that mentioned the specific offense. "According to UN-334772G, it is illegal to use 'cant' instead of 'can't' and '2' instead of 'to.'"
The person sighed and rolled their eyes. "Seriously? This is what you are wasting your time on? There are real crimes out there, you know."
I hesitated for a moment, reflecting on their words. Maybe they were right. Maybe my zeal for proper grammar was a bit misplaced. But deep down, I knew that language was important. It was the tool we used to communicate, to express ourselves.
So, despite the person's protests, I proceeded to give them a citation, just as the law required. As I walked away, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. I may have been a beginner, but I was determined to make the internet a better place, one properly constructed sentence at a time.
