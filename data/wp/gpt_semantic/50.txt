Once upon a time, in the midst of the dreaded zombie apocalypse, there existed a peculiar 17-year-old teenager named Alex. With raven-black curls and a brilliant smile crippled by braces, Alex had but one concern amidst the chaos: their orthodontist appointment. 
Amidst the hordes of brain-eating corpses, Alex scoured the streets for an orthodontist, determined to rid themselves of the metal shackles on their teeth. As the chaos intensified, Alex stumbled upon the legendary Dr. Grimsby, a renowned orthodontist rumored to possess mystical dental abilities capable of saving the world.
Dr. Grimsby's humble caravan sat on the outskirts of town, guarded by the undead. Bravely, Alex ventured forth, dodging rotting hands and frantically searching for a pair of pliers to unclamp their unbearable braces. Suddenly, a zombie lunged towards them, but Alex's metal smile proved to be a blessing in disguise. The sharp end of a bracket impaled the ghoul's forehead, promptly ending its quest for a meal.
With newfound confidence, Alex fought through the swarm, maneuvering with agility only a teenager could muster. As they finally reached Dr. Grimsby's door, the undead surged forth, desperate to prevent the apocalypse-defying orthodontic appointment. Alex valiantly defended the doorway, wielding floss as a whip and braces as nunchucks.
Impressed by Alex's bravery and keen dental knowledge, Dr. Grimsby emerged from the shadows, his eyes gleaming with respect. With a flick of his wrist, he removed Alex's braces, a triumphant smile stretching across their face. However, the moment was fleeting, for the world still teetered on the brink of doom.
Unbeknownst to Alex, the braces held secret powers against the zombies. As they celebrated their newfound dental freedom, the braces emitted an otherworldly light, enveloping the battleground. To everyone's astonishment, the irradiated zombies began returning to their human selves, one by one.
In their quest for orthodontic nirvana, a simple 17-year-old teenager had inadvertently saved the world. As the braces shattered into a million glittering fragments, Alex stood victorious, a testament to the resilience and fortitude of the youth. The zombie apocalypse receded, and amid the rubble, a new world sprang forth, no longer plagued by the undead.
And so, the legend of Alex, the accidental world-saver, spread like wildfire, inspiring teenagers across the globe to embrace their braces, for who knew the hidden power they held.
