See the problem is, deep down inside, I'm still an asshole. It's not something I'm proud of, but it's the truth. Growing up, I was always known as the troublemaker, the one who seemed to have a knack for finding trouble wherever I went. My parents used to say it was just a phase, that I would grow out of it, but here I am, years later, and that phase seems to have stuck with me like a stubborn stain on my soul.
It's not that I actively seek to be mean or hurtful, but somehow, I always manage to make a mess of things. Take my latest encounter with Sarah, for example. Sarah was my best friend since middle school, and recently, we began to drift apart. I could sense her disappointment and frustration with me, but I couldn't help myself. There was an inexplicable urge within me to push her away, to test her loyalty. And predictably, I succeeded in doing just that. Now, she barely speaks to me, and I'm left to wallow in the consequences of my own actions.
It's not just personal relationships that suffer; my professional life is plagued by my inability to control my inner jerk. At work, I undermine colleagues, take credit for others' ideas, and create unnecessary drama. Deep down, I know it's wrong, but some twisted part of me revels in the chaos I create. I see the hurt and anger in their eyes, yet I continue to bulldoze through their feelings, leaving a trail of emotional destruction behind me.
What makes matters worse is that I recognize my flaws, yet I can't seem to change. It's as if this asshole persona has become my default setting, and no matter how hard I try, I can't undo it. I've attended countless self-help seminars, read numerous books on personal development, and even sought therapy, but all my efforts seem futile. It's as if my self-awareness is just a cruel tease, mocking me with the knowledge of what I'm doing wrong, yet constraining me from fixing it.
In the end, it seems that I'm trapped in the clutches of my own inner darkness, forever defined by my penchant for causing havoc. And while I yearn to be a better person, there's a part of me that secretly revels in the chaos and destruction I leave in my wake. Maybe, just maybe, deep down inside, I'm not so eager to let go of being an asshole after all.
