As Sarah walked into the kitchen, her eyes fell upon the wretched sight of an innocent bowl of leftover oatmeal. It lay there, abandoned, like a forgotten war zone. Its once smooth surface now adorned with lumpy, gelatinous masses that oozed with an unnatural glop. The putrid aroma, a ghastly blend of sour milk and rotten bananas, assaulted her nostrils, making her stomach churn with revulsion. Specks of dried cereal clung to the sides, resembling the hideous remains of some unidentified creature left to decompose. Sarah could not help but gag, a tumultuous wave of nausea threatening to overcome her fragile constitution.
