Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy who loved magic more than anything. He believed with all his heart that someday he would discover the secret of magic. One sunny day, while playing in his backyard, Timmy stumbled upon an old, dusty book hidden in a forgotten corner. He opened it with excitement, expecting to find ancient spells and mystical creatures. But as he turned the pages, disappointment washed over him. The book contained only boring stories about math and science. Timmy's heart sank, realizing that magic wasn't real. He closed the book, feeling a mix of sadness and wonder. Now he knew the truth, but his dreams of becoming a magician vanished like smoke in the wind. The world suddenly seemed a little less enchanting without magic.
