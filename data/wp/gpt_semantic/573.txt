Once upon a time, in a land that resembled the real world but with more misfortunes, there lived a man named Jack. Jack had just experienced the most dreadful day of his life. Losing his job was like a punch to the gut, and finding out about his girlfriend's possible infidelity made his heartache. Money troubles were Jack's constant companions, like irritating neighbors that never left. He sighed and reached for his final refuge â€“ a cold beer, only to find an empty fridge. Desperation filled the room until an email arrived, offering unimaginable hope. "Would you like to change the difficulty?" it asked. Curiosity stirred within Jack, pondering the possibility of a different path.
