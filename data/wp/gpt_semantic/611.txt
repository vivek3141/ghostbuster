Once upon a time, in a world that had no internet, television, or any other form of entertainment, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy lived in a small village where people worked hard all day, and boredom followed them like a shadow. One day, while wandering through the woods, Timmy stumbled upon an old, dusty VCR. Curious, he dusted it off and brought it home. To his surprise, there was a mysterious tape labeled "The Last Video On Earth." As soon as Timmy pressed play, the whole village gathered around in awe. The tape was filled with laughter, joy, and breathtaking places they had never seen. From that day on, every night they gathered to watch the last video, cherishing the moments it brought to their previously dull lives.
