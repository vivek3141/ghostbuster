Dr. Matthews was a skilled surgeon. He had saved countless lives with his steady hands and sharp intellect. But today, something felt different. As he scrubbed in for a routine procedure, a sense of unease filled the operating room.
Just as Dr. Matthews was about to start, he glanced up and caught sight of a figure in blue scrubs standing by the door. It took him a moment to realize who it was - Death.
The surgeonâ€™s heart skipped a beat, and he blinked rapidly, hoping the apparition would disappear. But Death remained there, silently observing.
"Are you my new surgical assistant?" Dr. Matthews asked nervously, trying to mask his rising anxiety.
Death, or at least the figure that appeared as Death, nodded slowly.
"Right then," said Dr. Matthews, attempting to regain focus. "This is a straightforward procedure. We just need to remove a benign tumor from the patient's lung. We'll be in and out before you know it."
The surgeon expertly maneuvered his instruments, while the specter stood watchfully in the corner. Dr. Matthews couldn't help but feel an eerie stillness in the room, as though time had been momentarily suspended.
As the procedure progressed, Dr. Matthews found his hands trembling slightly. He could feel the weight of Death's gaze upon him, and it was impossible to ignore.
"Are you here for the patient?" the surgeon finally asked, unable to contain his curiosity any longer.
Death extended a skeletal hand towards the patient and then shook its head.
"No, not today," a voice echoed through the room, sending shivers down the surgeon's spine.
Dr. Matthews tried to push the unsettling presence to the back of his mind, focusing solely on the task at hand. He knew that any lapse in concentration could be disastrous. But the nagging presence of Death remained ever constant.
The surgery proceeded without incident, and soon the patient's procedure was complete. Dr. Matthews, eager to leave the oppressive atmosphere, quickly finished the operation. As he began to suture the incision, he noticed Death gliding closer.
"Is there something you need to tell me?" Dr. Matthews asked hesitantly, his voice quivering with both fear and intrigue.
Death raised its head, revealing empty, cavernous sockets. It reached out with a hand, laying it gently on the surgeon's arm. A cold shiver passed through Dr. Matthews' entire being.
"Do not fear me," Death whispered, in a voice that seemed to encompass both sorrow and comfort. "I am but a spectator in this realm. It is you who hold the power to bring life or death within these walls."
With that, Death faded away, leaving Dr. Matthews stunned.
As the surgeon removed his gloves and mask, he pondered the encounter. Perhaps Death's presence had been a reminder, a stark realization of his own fragility and the responsibility he carried as a healer.
From that day forward, Dr. Matthews vowed to approach each surgery with renewed humility and appreciation. He would cherish every life entrusted to him, knowing that no matter how skilled or knowledgeable he may be, life and death were always in delicate balance - a dance he would never take for granted.
