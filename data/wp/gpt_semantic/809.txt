Once upon a time, in a small town shrouded in mystery, there lived a man named Matthew. He was not like ordinary people; he was an immortal serial killer. Rumors of his heinous acts spread like wildfire, terrifying the townsfolk. Eventually, the authorities managed to catch him, and he was sentenced to life in prison.
Years passed, and the prison walls swallowed Matthew's days, trapping him within their gray embrace. But something peculiar happened; he didn't age like the other inmates. At first, the prison guards brushed it off as mere coincidence. However, as the years turned into decades, suspicions began to grow. Matthew always maintained a youthful countenance that contrasted starkly against the aging faces surrounding him.
The prison warden, Mr. Johnson, couldn't ignore this anomaly any longer. He called Matthew into his office, where the dim light cast an eerie glow upon the room. Mr. Johnson, a stout man with graying hair, paced nervously as he tried to find the right words to address the situation.
"Matthew, we've noticed something quite peculiar. You haven't aged a day since you arrived here," he began cautiously. "Some of the other prisoners have even started to notice. Can you explain this?"
Matthew lowered his gaze, feeling a pang of guilt deep within him. He cleared his throat before responding in a shaky voice, "Sir, I... I was born with a unique genetic condition. It's called Deimanthropy, and it stunts my physical aging. It's just a freak accident of nature, I assure you."
Mr. Johnson stared at Matthew skeptically, trying to discern the truth from his eyes. Sensing the warden's doubt, Matthew quickly added, "I'm not a threat, sir. I've served my time and regret the pain I've caused. I just want to live a quiet life."
The warden mulled over Matthew's words, grappling with a sense of unease. Finally, he sighed deeply, his resolve weakening. "Alright, Matthew. I'll believe you for now. But remember, any violation of our trust, and I won't hesitate to bring this to the higher authorities."
Matthew nodded, grateful for the warden's understanding. From that day forward, he lived his life within the prison walls, silently carrying the weight of his immortality. He knew that his past would forever haunt him, but perhaps, in this eerie sanctuary, he could finally find redemption and peace.
