Once upon a time in a quaint little town named Willow Creek, there existed a peculiar tradition. Don't let the name mislead you, for the creek was not the only thing flowing through this humble place - but blood too, you see. You see, in Willow Creek, upon each citizen's eighteenth birthday, they were gifted a license to kill. Yes, you heard that right, a license to take someone's life without any interference from the police or government. Now, this might shock most people, but in Willow Creek, it was the stuff of legends passed down through generations.
Yet, this story revolves around a young lad named Ethan who had just come of age. Throughout his life, he had been known for compassion and kindness - the sort of fella you wanted to share your secrets with. But when Ethan opened that envelope containing his license, fear and doubt coursed through his veins. He couldn't fathom the idea of taking someone's life, even if it were permitted.
Days turned into weeks, and Ethan's license remained untouched. While his peers reveled in the newfound power, Ethan tugged along, burdened by the weight of a decision he couldn't make. Until one fateful day, when news of an invader spread like wildfire through the town. Their safety was threatened, and the villagers were paralyzed with fear.
It was then that Ethan realized his purpose. He wasn't meant to take a life but to defend those he loved. With a flicker of bravery in his heart, Ethan mustered his courage and valiantly fought the invader, sparing the lives of his fellow villagers. The newfound appreciation and admiration from his community washed away any guilt he had felt, for he had discovered that you don't need a license to kill to make a difference. In the end, Ethan had chosen to preserve life, rather than take it.
