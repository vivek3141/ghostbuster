Once upon a time, there was a man named Peter. He was a kind-hearted soul, always smiling and spreading joy. But then, one day, a wicked witch cast a curse on him. She stole his warm and beating heart, replacing it with a cold block of ice. Peter was devastated, for he could no longer feel the love he once knew. He wandered through the world, a frozen vessel. Every time he got close to love, the ice began to melt, and Peter would panic. He realized that he was doomed to forever be alone, trapped in an icy prison that denied him the very essence of his being.
