The very first time she called you "mama", your heart swelled with a joy you had never known before. You held her tiny hand and imagined the precious moments you would share together. But as time went on, there were whispers that she was different. People called her a violent monster, casting judgement without truly knowing her. Despite the accusations, you stood by her side, loving her unconditionally. The last time she called you "mama", tears streamed down your face as they executed her. Deep down, you knew she was innocent, and your heart shattered into a million pieces.
