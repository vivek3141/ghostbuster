Once upon a time, there was a man named Tim. Tim was a simple man with a simple life, always seen with his trusty broom in hand. One day, as he was sweeping the streets of his tiny town, he noticed something strange in the sky. It was a massive asteroid, hurtling towards Earth! Fear filled Tim's heart, but instead of running for his life like any reasonable person would do, he bravely stood his ground with his broom. As the flaming rock descended, Tim swung his broom with all his might, trying to sweep away the impending doom. And, miraculously, the broom changed the asteroid's course, saving the world from its imminent destruction. And so, with a simple broom in hand, Tim became the hero of the end of the world. The end.
