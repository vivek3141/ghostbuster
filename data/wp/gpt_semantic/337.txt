Once upon a time, in a city riddled with danger and deceit, lived a man known as "The Interrogator." He was a mob hitman, specializing in making people talk. His skills were unmatched, his reputation unparalleled. But little did anyone know, hidden beneath his cold exterior was a secret that would dictate the untimely expiration of his own life - the concept of lifespan determined by a word count.
The Interrogator had been gifted millions of words at his birth, a boon that many envied. But as he carried out his nefarious acts, the words dwindled away, each conversation pushing him closer to his last breath. For every word spoken, written, or read, he lost count of the minutes ticking away from his lifespan. Yet, in his ruthlessness and hunger for power, he became blind to the reality of his situation.
One fateful evening, The Interrogator found himself in a dimly lit room, facing his newest mark. This target, known as Victor Kozlov, was a man of few words, earning him the nickname "The Silent Serpent" in the criminal underworld. But despite Victor's reputation, The Interrogator had his job to do. He had suffered his demons, silenced his own doubts, and could not afford to show any weakness now.
Victor, sitting tied to a chair, maintained an unnerving calmness as The Interrogator entered the room. His dark eyes seemed to penetrate The Interrogator's soul, and a chill ran down the hitman's spine. Nevertheless, he began his routine, ready to extract the information he needed to satisfy his employers.
"Victor," The Interrogator started with his usual cold detachment. "You know why I'm here. You've been a thorn in our side, and it's time you paid your dues."
Victor simply stared back, his silent defiance adding to The Interrogator's growing frustration. He cleared his throat and tried again. "I have millions of words at my disposal, Victor. They aren't just for show. They can bring anyone down."
A slight smirk played on Victor's lips, as if he knew something The Interrogator did not. This caught the hitman's attention. Could this be the key to finally understanding the limits of his own lifespan?
"You think you can outsmart me? You may be silent, but even one word can be your downfall," The Interrogator seethed with a newfound determination. He reached for the pistol tucked in his waistband, but a sudden realization stopped him dead in his tracks.
The Interrogator instinctively clutched his throat, feeling the words inside him swirling with a newfound ferocity. Panic seized his heart as he gasped for air, unable to utter a single word. In that moment, he understood his grim fate. The realization that he was fast running out of words overwhelmed him.
Victor, observing the chaos unfolding before him, finally broke his silence. "Karma," he whispered.
The Interrogator's body shuddered, his eyes wide with terror. He collapsed to the floor, gasping for his last breaths. Each exhalation marked the remaining words escaping his grasp, moistening the air with their evaporation. The once feared hitman, now reduced to a mortal struggling for his survival, realized the true value of the gift he had squandered.
As his vision blurred and darkness overtook him, The Interrogator's mind was filled with a wave of regret. His insatiable greed for power and dominance had blinded him to the beauty and importance of words. Now, he was paying the ultimate price.
In his final moments, the hitman's thoughts turned to all the words he could have cherished, whispered sweetly to his loved ones, or shared with the world. But instead, he had wasted them on pain, suffering, and silence. The once feared "Interrogator" was now just a cautionary tale, a distant memory of a man who had lived his life in a single breath.
