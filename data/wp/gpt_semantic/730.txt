As I walked home one dark and stormy night, a shady figure emerged from the shadows. Panic surged through my veins as the mugger brandished a gleaming knife, demanding my hard-earned cash. Suddenly, an idea struck me like lightning. With trembling hands, I reached into my jacket pocket and pulled out a worn-out pack of playing cards. In a voice trembling with confidence, I declared, "How about a game of chance? If you win, I'll give you all the money you want. But if I win, you'll let me go." The mugger hesitated, intrigued by the proposition. Little did he know, I held an unbeatable hand.
