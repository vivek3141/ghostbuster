Once upon a time, there was a young lad named Damien. He was chosen by Lucifer himself as the successor to the throne of darkness. Thrilled and trembling, Damien embarked on a rigorous training journey. Sweat poured down his forehead as he studied vigorously every night, learning evil spells and diabolical strategies. With each passing day, he grew more knowledgeable in the art of soul-snatching. However, his attempts at becoming the best were met with mediocre results. Damien stumbled and fumbled through his training, unsure of himself. But he refused to give up. With grim determination, he continued, hoping that one day he would excel and prove himself worthy of the devil's throne.
