John hesitated outside the dorm room door, his heart pounding in his chest. He couldn't believe that he was about to meet his younger self, the version of him from 15 years ago. The time travel experiment had gone horribly wrong, propelling him further back in time than intended. Now, with no money, identity, or place to stay, he had no other option but to seek help from his younger self. Reluctantly, he raised his hand and knocked.
The door swung open, and there stood his 20-year-old self, his mop of unruly hair and wide eyes filled with the innocence of the past. "Uh, can I help you?" Past-John asked, looking utterly puzzled.
Present-John cleared his throat, "Hi, um, yeah. I know this sounds crazy, but I'm you from the future. Can I come in?"
Past-John's eyes widened even further, an expression of disbelief etched onto his face. He stepped aside, allowing Present-John to enter the small, cluttered dorm room that once belonged to them both.
Sitting on the worn-out couch, John explained everything that had happened—the malfunction, the unexpected journey. Past-John listened in awe and disbelief, occasionally interrupting with skeptical questions. After a lengthy explanation, he finally asked the pressing question, "So, why exactly did you come to me? Can't you go to someone else?"
Present-John sighed, weighing his words carefully. "The thing is, I have no other options. I have no money, no means of survival, and no means of returning to my time for five years. I need your help."
Past-John's face softened, understanding the gravity of the situation. "Alright, I'll help you. After all, you're me, right?" he said, a small smile forming.
Over the next few years, John lived with his younger self. Together, they navigated the challenges of college life, dodged awkward encounters with old friends, and managed to scrape by with odd jobs. Past-John took care of Present-John, introducing him to the people and places that would shape their future.
Bit by bit, Present-John managed to rebuild his life in this unfamiliar time period. He found work, made new connections, and even fell in love. All the while, he cherished the opportunity to watch himself grow and learn from his past mistakes.
Finally, the day arrived when Present-John received the news he had been waiting for—the time machine had been repaired. It was time for him to return to his rightful time, leaving his younger self to live their own life.
As they stood in front of the time machine, Past-John hugged Present-John tightly. "Take care of yourself, okay? I'll always remember this strange adventure we had together. Goodbye, future me."
With a bittersweet smile, Present-John stepped into the time machine, his heart filled with gratitude for the second chance he had been given. As he vanished into the abyss of time, he hoped that his younger self would remember the lessons they had learned together, setting both of their lives on a path towards success, happiness, and a future filled with possibilities.
