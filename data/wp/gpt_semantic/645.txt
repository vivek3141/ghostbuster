Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away, there were extraterrestrial beings called the Zorklings. These tiny creatures had just discovered Planet Earth and were fascinated by the peculiar species residing there - humans. Curiosity consumed the Zorklings, and they decided to study these creatures from afar.
As they observed humans closely, they noticed a recurring theme - the significance of clocks in their daily lives. Humans seemed to cherish these objects, relying on them to structure their daily routines. The Zorklings puzzled over the purpose of these ticking devices. They had never encountered anything like it in their own universe.
The Zorklings debated amongst themselves, trying to decipher the enigma of the human obsession with clocks. After weeks of intense research, analysis, and far too much intergalactic coffee, they finally reached a startling conclusion - that clocks were holy artifacts, and humans believed in a higher power called "Clock."
Intrigued by this revelation, the Zorklings, armed with their advanced technology, decided to pay Earth a visit to gather more data. They landed in a local clock factory and were amazed to find humans assembling these divine objects. The Zorklings fervently believed they had stumbled upon a place of worship where humans dutifully crafted offerings for their "Clock God."
The Zorklings tiptoed through the factory, careful not to disturb the human worshipers. They were mesmerized by the synchronized ticking, the intricate designs, and the precision of the hands. To them, it was a spiritual experience, like attending an otherworldly ceremony.
As the Zorklings made their way back to their spacecraft, they felt exhilarated by their findings. They had discovered the divine connection between humans and clocks, a profound belief system that united them all. They transmitted their findings to their home planet, where the Zorklings' peers were equally astonished.
News of the Zorklings' groundbreaking discovery quickly spread across the galaxies. Scholars and scientists visited Earth, hoping to uncover the secrets of this mysterious "Clock God." Humans were perplexed by the sudden surge of extraterrestrial attention, unaware of the bizarre assumption made about their timekeeping habits.
While humans went about their daily lives, blissfully unaware of the newfound galactic fame they had unwittingly acquired, the Zorklings returned to their home planet, now hailed as pioneers in interstellar theology. They shared tales of Earth's captivating "Clock God" with the Zorkling generations to come, ensuring that the legend of humans and their sacred timepieces would never be forgotten. And so, the myth of the "Clock God" lived on, etched into the lore of the cosmos, courtesy of some very misguided aliens.
