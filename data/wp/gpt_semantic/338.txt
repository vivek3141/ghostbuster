John was driving down the deserted highway late at night, his hands gripping the steering wheel tightly. Fatigue had settled into his bones, the long day at work leaving him drained. As he blinked away the exhaustion, his eyes grew heavy and his focus blurred. Suddenly, his senses snapped back to alertness as he realized he was drifting into the lane beside him.
Panic flooded through his veins as headlights beamed into his eyes, blinding him momentarily. With a surge of adrenaline, he jerked the steering wheel to the right, but it was too late. His car spun out of control, tires screeching against the asphalt, as it teetered on the verge of a horrific crash.
In a desperate attempt to save himself, John blindly threw his hands in the air and yelled, "Jesus, take the wheel!" It was a phrase he had heard others say in times of crisis, a last-ditch effort to defy destiny.
As the seconds crawled by, John prepared himself for the inevitable impact. But when he cautiously opened his eyes, he found himself sitting upright in his car, unharmed, his heart still pounding in his chest. Astonished, he surveyed his surroundings, trying to comprehend what had just happened.
His gaze focused on the driver's seat, where his eyes locked with those of a young woman. She had flowing golden hair that cascaded down her shoulders, and her eyes shimmered with an otherworldly brilliance. She wore a serene expression, as if she had just completed an act of divine intervention.
"You're not Jesus," John spluttered, his voice betraying both confusion and awe.
With a gentle smile, the woman replied, "No, I'm not. But I was sent to ensure your safety."
John's mind raced as he tried to grasp the reality before him. Was this some sort of hallucination, or had he truly been saved by a celestial being? He shook his head, unable to find an answer.
"My name is Sarah," she continued. "I've been sent by a higher power to protect you from harm. It was your faith and plea that summoned me to your aid."
John's mind was reeling, his thoughts a hurricane of disbelief and wonder. How was this possible? Was he dreaming? But deep down, a glimmer of hope had ignited within him.
As they drove in silence, the weight of John's near-death experience hung heavy in the air. His faith had been tested, and now an undeniable higher power had intervened to save him. He began to realize that sometimes, even when faced with unimaginable circumstances, miracles could occur.
In that moment, John found solace in the presence of Sarah, who had appeared when he had least expected it. Left in awe of the divine forces at work, he closed his eyes, allowing himself to have faith in the unknown. And as they continued their journey together, he couldn't help but believe that perhaps, in the darkest moments, angels were always watching, ready to intervene.
