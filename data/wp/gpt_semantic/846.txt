Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there lived a beloved Creator. He was a kind and wise old man with a flowing white beard. He had created a world filled with beautiful creatures, towering mountains, and vibrant forests. The Creator's creations adored him, for he gave them life and purpose. But, one sad day, the Creator passed away, leaving his creations heartbroken. The forests lost their luster, the creatures lost their joy, and the mountains hung their heads low. They gathered around his grave, mourning their loss. But in their sadness, they made a promise to keep his memory alive by cherishing the world he had so lovingly crafted.
