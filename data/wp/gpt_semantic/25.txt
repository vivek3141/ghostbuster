Once upon a time, in the fiery depths of Hell, Satan found himself facing a peculiar predicament. He had become a single parent to the babies and children who had been sacrificed to him. As the infamous ruler of the underworld, he was accustomed to dealing with all sorts of challenges, but this was a whole new level of difficulty.
Being the Prince of Darkness, Satan had a reputation to uphold. His days were usually consumed by torturing lost souls, managing demons, and devising wicked plans. However, ever since he became a single parent, his schedule had turned chaotic, leading to frequent misunderstandings.
Picture thisâ€”the Lord of the Underworld trying to change diapers while simultaneously answering prayers from his legion of followers, who continually asked for blessings or guidance in their shady dealings. It was no easy task, let me tell you. Satan would plop the young imps on his lap and struggle with the art of fastening diapers, often ending up with the sticky side facing out or managing to cover only one cheek. His frustration reached a boiling point, making him frequently wonder how a mere baby could possess such impressive strength when it came to excrement.
The children, although a rather unique bunch, proved to be equally as challenging. Their tiny voices that could shatter crystal sang hymns that would send mere mortals into madness. Satan found himself keeping the volume at a minimum, shushing his little devils with a finger to his lips, hoping that would make them quiet. However, their screeches would only grow louder, causing Hell's guardian to wonder if skinless ears could develop a case of tinnitus.
Another issue that consumed Satan's time was preparing meals for his brood. Having spent eternity surrounded by fire and brimstone, he had no knack for culinary arts. He would summon his most accomplished minions, asking them to whip up something decent, only to end up with burnt offerings. As a result, the children seemed to enjoy snacking on scorched souls or bat wings, inevitably leading to fiery tantrums.
Furthermore, playtime was a constant battlefield. The little demons fought tirelessly over the finest torture tools and attempts to keep the peace usually resulted in additional casualties. Satan would sit in his lava-filled throne, exhausted, and contemplate the ways to introduce a time-out corner without the risk of imprisonment or an uprising.
Living as a single parent had opened Satan's eyes to the struggles and joys of parenthood. He realized that despite being the personification of evil, he possessed a soft spot for his tiny minions. They may not have been nightmarish little bundles of joy, but they were his, and he wouldn't trade them for all the suffering in the world.
So, in his never-ending quest to bring chaos and fear, Lucifer continued to face the challenges head-on, knowing that even the Prince of Darkness deserved the joys and headaches of single-parenthood.
