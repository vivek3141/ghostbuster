In the year 2020, humanity witnessed the horrifying spectacle of an alien invasion that almost wiped out our existence. It was a grim time, as cities crumbled and people lost hope. But somehow, through sheer determination and maybe a little bit of luck, some of us managed to survive.
However, the invaders, whom we came to know as the Zygorians, had one last trick up their sleeve. They demanded a tithe of one-tenth of the world's population every decade, a sacrifice to prevent humanity from being entirely enslaved. This decree haunted us for decades, with the fear of losing loved ones hanging over our heads like a dark storm cloud.
Now, in the year 2060, I find myself among the chosen, forced to face the unimaginable. But I refuse to go quietly into the night, to accept my fate without a fight. The Zygorians may have decimated our world, but they cannot take away our spirit.
As the day of the tithe approaches, I gather a small group of rebels, fellow survivors who share my unwavering defiance. We secretly assemble in the depths of an abandoned subway station, clutching our meager weapons, ready for battle. Our resolve is bolstered by the memory of all those we have lost, the innocence and beauty of our world that was stolen from us.
When the Zygorians arrive to take their tithe, we strike. We emerge from the shadows, a force to be reckoned with. Fueled by desperation and the overwhelming desire for freedom, we fight tooth and nail, refusing to be enslaved any longer.
Despite their advanced weaponry, the Zygorians are caught off guard by our fierce resistance. They did not expect such defiance from a weakened and beaten race. We fight with every breath in our bodies, every ounce of strength and determination. The echoes of our cries for freedom reverberate through the shattered ruins of what was once a thriving civilization.
As the dust settles, bodies of Zygorian soldiers lie strewn across the ground, defeated by the relentless spirit of humanity. We stand, battered and bloodied, but triumphant. Our indomitable will has carved a new path, one where we refuse to be mere playthings for alien invaders.
The year is now 2060, and we are no longer victims. We have become warriors, reclaiming our world with a fierce determination. The tithe has been broken, and from the ashes of destruction, hope begins to bloom once more.
