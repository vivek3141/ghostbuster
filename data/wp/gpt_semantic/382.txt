As the airplane soared through the cotton candy clouds, Mark couldn't escape the feeling of excitement mixed with anxiety. He had just accomplished something grand, an achievement that promised him a special bonus. His palms were sweaty, lips dry as the Sahara, and his heart thumped like a disco beat. What am I going to get? Mark wondered, his imagination running wild. Would he gain the ability to fly? Or maybe an instant way to silence his boss during meetings? The possibilities were endless. Trembling with anticipation, Mark finally received his reward: a personalized keychain with his name misspelled. Truly, a bonus beyond his wildest dreams.
