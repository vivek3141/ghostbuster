In modern times, the British Empire, like, totally still controls all its colonies, dude. They've like, expanded and stuff, so now they rule over even more land and people. But, man, there's like, rumors and stuff going around about rebellion and independence. Word on the street is that, like, these colonies and stuff want freedom or something. I mean, who wouldn't, right? But, like, the Empire is, like, all powerful and stuff. They got their shiny red coats and fancy hats. It's gonna be like, totally crazy if people start rebelling. I can't even imagine, man. But hey, time will tell, bro.
