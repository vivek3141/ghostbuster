Once upon a time, in a land full of rhyme,
Lived a Grinch unlike any, with a wicked, dark mind.
He despised the Whos, their laughter and cheer,
His heart was black, full of malice and fear.
One winter's night, his plan was set,
To bring terror and sorrow, he wouldn't forget.
He stole their presents, their decorations so bright,
Left them with nothing, not even a light.
But as the Whos woke with shock and despair,
A strange feeling washed over, filling the air.
Their spirits were strong, they sang through the night,
The Grinch couldn't fathom, he couldn't take flight.
As the Whos joined hands, they sang a loud song,
Their unity engulfed them, their bond was so strong.
The Grinch's heart cracked, a darkness swelled deep,
He couldn't defeat them, their spirit he couldn't keep.
With a heavy heart, the Grinch bent to his knees,
He witnessed a love so pure, it made him freeze.
He returned all the gifts, brought joy to their sight,
He couldn't accept it, that goodness could fight.
In a twisted tale of darkness and dread,
The Grinch discovered just what lay ahead.
A lesson he learned, in the depth of his soul,
That even the darkest can find a new role.
So let this be a warning, a tale to be told,
That wickedness falters, goodness takes hold.
For even the twisted can be turned anew,
In the land of rhyme, where miracles come true.
