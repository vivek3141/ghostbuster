Once upon a time, there was a brave boatswain named Jack. He worked on a magnificent pirate ship called The Sea Serpent. Jack had always dreamed of sailing the seven seas, and now his dream had come true. On this fine Sunday morning, Captain Blackbeard had handed him a special task. He was to polish the ship's cannons to make them shiny and fearsome. Jack had never done this before, but he was determined to do a good job. With a rag in hand, he began to scrub vigorously. Hours passed, his arm grew tired, but Jack kept going. With a smile, he admired his handiwork.
