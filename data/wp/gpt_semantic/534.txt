Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there lived a humble goblin named Grumble. He wasn't like the other goblins; he was small and skinny, with pointy ears and a funny walk. The nearby village feared him, for they believed he was an evil beast. But Grumble just wanted to be left alone.
One fateful day, a brave hero named Sir Wimble ventured into the goblin's territory. Armed with shining armor and a sword as tall as a tree, he fought countless monsters to save the princess. Grumble trembled as he watched, feeling his tiny heart race.
But wait! In a moment of bravery, Grumble leaped forward and tripped Sir Wimble. As the hero stumbled, his sword flew out of his grasp. With a shaky hand, Grumble aimed the sword towards Sir Wimble's heart and, against all odds, ended his hero's journey.
The village rejoiced as Grumble stepped forward, no longer fearing him. They finally realized that even a common goblin had the power to change the story. Grumble became a hero in his own right, proving that kindness could slay the mightiest foe. And he lived happily ever after, teaching the world that appearances can be deceiving.
