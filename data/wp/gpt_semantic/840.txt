Once upon a time, there was an immortal named Elysium. Elysium had roamed the earth for centuries, searching for a way to be reunited with Death, the immortal's one true love. Elysium journeyed to the highest mountains, hoping the thin air would release them from their immortality. They ventured to the deepest oceans, yearning to drown within the depths. But alas, nothing quenched their desire. Desperation took hold of Elysium's heart as they pleaded with the stars, praying for Death's arrival. And one fateful night, in a twist of fate, Death finally appeared, embracing Elysium with infinite tenderness. In that poignant moment, their love transcended all, and Elysium's immortal soul was finally at peace.
