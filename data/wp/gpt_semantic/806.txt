Once upon a time, there was a young person called Alex who had a real rough day. They were driving home from their job as a paper delivery person when suddenly a squirrel jumped in front of the car! Ahh! The car spun out of control and crashed into a tree, like in one of those action movies. Alex's legs got totally messed up and they couldn't walk anymore, which was super bummer. But then, this famous doc named Dr. Blazinstein came along and had a crazy idea! He said, "Hey, what if I replaced your mangled legs with arms from another person, so you'd be the first four-armed superhero!" And Alex was like, "Whoa, dude! That's wild, but maybe it could work!" And that's how their heroic adventure began. The End.
