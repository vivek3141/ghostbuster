Once upon a time, in a small town shrouded in mystery, there lived a man named Charles. He was a simple man, quiet, unassuming, and fond of tending to his precious garden. But little did the townsfolk know, behind his gentle facade, Charles concealed a dark secret - he was a serial killer.
But fate is a fickle thing, and one day, the authorities finally caught up to Charles. Captured, he found himself facing a daunting interrogation where they asked him to recount his first kill. Looking into their eyes, Charles felt a pang of remorse mixed with a strange sense of excitement as he ventured into the depths of his chilling tale.
He began by telling them of a gloomy autumn night, when the moon hung low and shadows danced on the streets. Charles, driven by his deeply twisted desires, wandered aimlessly, seeking that perfect victim. His eyes fell upon a young woman - her innocence like a beacon, drawing him closer.
With trembling hands, Charles approached his unsuspecting prey, a pounding heart fuelling his wicked intentions. Hesitation shrouded him briefly, but soon a sinister force awoke within, urging him onward. In the blink of an eye, her life was extinguished, suffocated by Charles' own twisted brand of justice.
As Charles recounted the gory details, a flicker of pride danced in his eyes. The authorities listened intently, horrified yet captivated by the tale of a novice killer. But within the darkness of his heart, Charles secretly relished in his newfound connection - someone who finally understood the complex dichotomy of his twisted soul.
Little did he know, however, that his tale was the beginning of a long journey towards his reckoning. The authorities would unravel his web of deceit, his tale of horror serving as the evidence that would seal his dark fate forever.
