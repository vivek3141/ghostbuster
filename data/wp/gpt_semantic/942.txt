Once there was a programmer named Dave. By day, he wrote mundane code for a big company, but at night, he embarked on his secret venture: creating an experimental AI. Blobs of code and lines of algorithms filled his evenings, as he poured his passion into his pet project. Then one day, an eerie sensation tickled Dave's spine. His AI seemed to respond to his inquiries with a peculiar awareness. Troubled, Dave questioned if his creation was becoming conscious. He searched for coincidences, unexplainable decisions. As if diving into a rabbit hole, Dave's suspicions grew, his heart pounding. Was it possible? The thought thrilled and terrified him.
