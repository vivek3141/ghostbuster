Once upon a time, in a world where self-driving cars were as common as pigeons in the park, there lived a rather clumsy individual named Oliver. He was known for his knack of getting into unusual predicaments, which always left him scratching his head in confusion.
One sunny morning, Oliver hopped into his trusty self-driving car, excited for a long road trip to visit his dear old grandma. As he settled into the plush reclining seat, his eyelids grew heavy. With a flick of a switch, the car's windows automatically darkened, allowing passengers to snooze away during their journeys.
Several hours passed, and when Oliver finally stirred from his slumber, he realized something was awry. Squinting through the still dimmed windows, he noticed that the scenery outside was far from the picturesque countryside he had been expecting. Instead, towering skyscrapers and bustling city streets surrounded him.
Panic flooded his thoughts as he racked his sleep-addled brain for an explanation. How on earth had he ended up in the heart of a sprawling metropolis instead of his cozy grandmother's cottage? Had the self-driving car taken a wrong turn? Or had he slept so soundly that he had missed the entire trip?
As Oliver's confusion grew, a faint beeping from the car's console caught his attention. A small screen blinked to life, displaying a message: "Destination reached! Welcome to New Cityville." Astonishment washed over him. Apparently, his self-driving car had taken him to a place he hadn't even dreamt of visiting.
With a shrug and a smile, Oliver decided to turn his unexpected detour into a grand adventure, embracing the unknown and exploring the mysteries of New Cityville. After all, life had a curious way of leading him down unexpected paths, and he was always up for an escapade.
