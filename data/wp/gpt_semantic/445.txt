Once upon a time in a small town, there lived a simple woman named Sarah. Though she wasn't exactly the brightest crayon in the box, Sarah had always been content with her life. You see, in this peculiar world, every person had a number floating above their head, indicating how many people had numbers. It was bizarre, but it helped everyone feel connected. One day, as Sarah glanced in the mirror, she felt a shudder down her spine. Her heart skipped a beat as she noticed her number head head number was backwards. Confused, she wondered what this meant for her and her place in the world.
