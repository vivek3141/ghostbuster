When I dream, I have two hands. They're just like the hands I have when I'm awake, but somehow, they feel different. Stronger, maybe. More capable. I'm not quite sure.
Sometimes, when I dream, my two hands do extraordinary things. They fly through the air, as if they have wings of their own. And with each sweep and swoop, they leave trails of shimmering stardust behind. It's like I have the power to paint the night sky with my fingertips.
Other times, when I dream, my two hands have the power to heal. They hover over wounded animals and people, emanating a gentle warmth that soothes and mends. It's a feeling so serene, as if the entire universe is resonating with peace and contentment. In my dreams, I am a healer, and my two hands are the conduits of compassion.
There are moments when my two hands become tools of creation. They clasp pencils and brushes, turning ordinary blank canvases into vibrant, living masterpieces. Every stroke seems guided by a force beyond me, and the images that come to life carry emotions I didn't even know I had. In my dreams, I become an artist, and my two hands are the conduits of my innermost thoughts and desires.
Yet, I am not always aware of my two hands in my dreams. Sometimes I dream of walking through vast landscapes, where the winds brush gently against my face, and a sense of freedom fills my heart. It's only when I wake up that I realize my two hands were there, guiding me effortlessly through the dreamscape. As if they already knew the way, and all I had to do was place my trust in them.
In my dreams, my two hands are my constant companions. They are extensions of my being, reaching out and touching the intangible, bridging the gap between the conceivable and the fantastical. They open doors to realms beyond reason, where the impossible becomes possible.
But it is when I awaken that my two hands truly come alive. They take on the mundane tasks of the everyday, yet they carry with them the memory of what was. They yearn for the extraordinary, for that feeling of boundless potential. And so, I strive to bring the essence of my dreams into my waking life.
When I dream, I have two hands. And though dreams may fade, their touch lingers. They remind me of the magic that resides within, waiting to be channeled and shared with the world. And so, I embrace the dreamscape, letting it ignite my imagination, fuel my yearnings, and guide my outstretched hands toward the extraordinary that lies just beyond my grasp.
