Once upon a time, in a secret underground bunker nestled deep within the German forests, there existed a clandestine division of the SS with a highly peculiar mission. Their sole purpose was to protect the infamous Adolf Hitler from the constant onslaught of time travelers who yearned to assassinate him throughout history. They called themselves the Temporal Protection Unit.
Wolfgang, a dedicated but inexperienced young officer, recently graduated from the Academy of Temporal Studies. He had dreamed of serving his country in a far more glamorous role, like his heroic father, who had fought valiantly on the frontlines. Unfortunately, destiny had other plans for Wolfgang.
As he descended into the heart of the bunker, Wolfgang marveled at the assortment of futuristic gadgets and time-travel devices that adorned the walls. He was greeted by his, somewhat eccentric, superior, Colonel Richter. Tendrils of silver hair sprouted from his head, prompting rumors of his countless time-travel exploits.
"Welcome, Wolfgang," Colonel Richter exclaimed, extending a hand adorned with peculiar wrist-worn contraptions. "Get ready; we've detected anachronistic signatures within a 100-kilometer radius of Berlin. They could be time-traveling assassins from the distant future!"
Trepidation gripped Wolfgang as he donned his ill-fitting uniform. He knew that to protect the Führer against such formidable foes, he would need nerves of steel and quick thinking. He was given a time-nullifier watch, which had the ability to freeze any intruders in time momentarily.
As night fell over Berlin, Wolfgang patrolled the grounds of Hitler's heavily fortified bunker, vigilant and prepared for any surprises. Suddenly, in an awe-inspiring flash, a time portal materialized before him. Out stepped a figure clad in sleek, futuristic armor, brandishing a fearsome laser weapon. Time seemed to slow down as Wolfgang activated his time-nullifier watch, freezing the assailant mid-step. With a triumphant look, Wolfgang alerted his comrades, who swiftly apprehended the would-be assassin.
News of Wolfgang's heroic deed quickly reached Hitler's ears. Intrigued, he summoned the young officer to personally congratulate him. In the grandeur of the Führer's presence, standing before the embodiment of evil, Wolfgang realized the gravity of his mission. He could now protect not just an ordinary man, but the very course of history itself.
From that day forward, Wolfgang and his brave compatriots of the Temporal Protection Unit defended Hitler against countless time-traveling assailants, ensuring his reign over Germany continued uninterrupted. Though an unquestionably strange occupation, they considered it a noble duty to safeguard the pages of history from being rewritten by those who wished to tamper with its fragile threads.
