Once upon a time, in a quaint village nestled at the edge of a dense forest, there lived a group of villagers who had always believed that no one mourns the deaths of monsters. They had grown up with tales of these wicked creatures that lurked in the shadows, waiting to terrorize any unsuspecting wanderer who ventured too far into the woods. These tales were shared as cautionary warnings, ingrained in their minds since childhood.
Among these villagers was a young girl named Eliza. She had always been fascinated by the forest, despite the fearsome stories passed down by her elders. Eliza was a dreamer, never satisfied with the boundaries of her small world. She yearned for adventures and longed to uncover the truth behind the legends of the monsters. 
One day, unable to resist the pull any longer, Eliza gathered her meager belongings and embarked on a journey into the depths of the forest. Armed with courage and curiosity, she roamed through thick foliage and mist-laden paths, searching for the truth that lay hidden in the heart of this ancient woodland.
As she wandered deeper, she encountered shadows that seemed to dance among the trees. The villagers' tales held a tight grip on her mind, but she dismissed their warnings as mere folklore. Pressing forward, Eliza discovered a hidden glen, bathed in gentle sunlight filtering through a canopy of leaves. In the center stood a figure she had only ever imagined—a monster.
Her heart raced, and her breaths grew shallow with fear, but something about the monster's eyes spoke a language she had never heard. They awakened a deep empathy within her, allowing her to see beyond the monster’s menacing form.
Drawing closer, Eliza noticed the monster's frailty and wounds, visible through its rough exterior. No longer a fearsome creature lurking in darkness, the monster appeared broken and helpless. Its mournful eyes reflected a lifetime of pain and loneliness. Eliza's heart swelled with compassion, overshadowing her initial fear.
Determined to unveil the truth, Eliza spent days nurturing the monster back to health. She fed it, soothed its wounds, and listened to its labored breaths. Soon, coloring returned to its cheeks, and the monster's eyes gleamed with gratitude.
Time passed, and word of Eliza's discovery eventually reached the village. The villagers were puzzled and intrigued by her compassion toward the very creatures they believed were wicked beyond redemption. They could not fathom why she would risk her life to tend to a monster, as though it were capable of any form of gratitude.
With each passing day, Eliza spent more time in the forest with the monster. The villagers whispered and scoffed, believing that she had been bewitched by its spell. But Eliza remained steadfast in her conviction that these creatures deserved a chance at redemption, just like anyone else. She believed that monsters, too, deserved to be mourned.
In the face of such judgement, Eliza chose to bring the monster to the village. As they stepped foot into the communal square, the villagers gasped, their eyes wide with shock and incredulity. Eliza beseeched them to see how the monster had changed, how it had awakened to the same emotions that filled their hearts—pain, loneliness, and ultimately, hope.
Gradually, the villagers' hearts softened as they witnessed the transformation that had occurred within the once-feared monster. Walls built over generations began to crumble, and empathy took root in their hearts. They saw how Eliza had recognized the monster's humanity and understood that beneath its rough exterior lay a dormant goodness that nobody had bothered to see.
And so, the villagers began to question their own beliefs, realizing the truth that no one mourns the deaths of monsters simply because no one ever knew them well enough to understand their suffering. The monster's journey revealed that behind every fearful surface lurked a vulnerable soul worthy of love, compassion, and redemption.
From that day forward, the villagers abandoned their notion that no one mourns the deaths of monsters. They began to celebrate the lives of all creatures, no matter how terrifying or misunderstood, for they understood that even the darkest of beings can be reborn through an act of kindness, just like the monster that had transformed into a beloved member of their community.
