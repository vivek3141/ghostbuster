Once upon a time in a small college town, there lived a young man named Dave. Dave was an ordinary guy with an ordinary life, except for one extraordinary thing: his bong was the home of a genie. Yeah, you heard it right, a bona fide genie living inside his trusty bong.
One night, as Dave casually filled his bong with aromatic herbs, he lit up the bowl and puffed away. Suddenly, a swirl of neon-colored smoke emerged from the bong, forming into the shape of a genie. Dave's eyes widened in disbelief as the genie materialized before him, rubbing his foggy head groggily.
"Greetings, master," the genie said in a gruff voice. "You have summoned me, and I am here to grant you three wishes."
Dave blinked, trying to process this unbelievable situation. "Uh, hey, genie. I wish for a lifetime supply of tacos," he blurted out, his mouth watering at the mere thought.
As soon as the words left his lips, a mountain of tacos appeared before them. Tacos of all kinds: beef, chicken, and even vegetarian. Dave's eyes glittered with delight as he sunk his teeth into the succulent tacos, savoring the flavors.
"Whoa, genie," Dave said between mouthfuls. "You're the bomb! I wish I could always have a boost of confidence."
In an instant, Dave felt an indescribable surge of confidence. He stood up and confidently strutted around his apartment, feeling like he could conquer the world. He even attempted a cartwheel, which didn't go quite as planned, but he laughed it off without a care.
The genie chuckled, his eyes glazed with a mischievous glint. "You've got one more wish, buddy."
Dave scratched his head, his mind blank from the overwhelming joy and the herbal-induced haze. "Hmmâ€¦ I wish for everyone in the world to chill out and be kind to one another."
The genie's eyes gleamed with approval. He snapped his fingers, and a wave of tranquility spread across the globe. People stopped arguing over petty matters and started hugging instead. The world suddenly felt like a giant cosmic cuddle puddle.
As the smoke slowly dissipated, leaving Dave and the genie with a pleasant buzz, a friendship formed between the two. They spent the rest of the night bonding over philosophical conversations and laughing uncontrollably.
From that day forward, no one could ever convince Dave that genies weren't real. They were, indeed, and they were also pretty chill when high. And so, with his belly full of tacos, a newfound confidence, and a world full of kindness, Dave and his bong genie lived happily ever after.
