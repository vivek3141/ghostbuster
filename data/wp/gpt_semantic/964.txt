NASA had been waiting for years, scanning the skies, hoping for even a whisper from extraterrestrial beings. Finally, just when everyone had lost hope, a mysterious radio signal crackled through their speakers. Seven simple words. "The birds are not what they seem." The scientists puzzled over the meaning, eyebrows furrowed. What could this cryptic message mean? Did it refer to bird-like aliens? Or were our own earthly birds hiding secrets? The possibilities spun like a whirlwind of confusion. Perhaps it was just a prank, a cosmic joke. But deep down, something whispered that this was the beginning of something bigger than anyone could grasp.
