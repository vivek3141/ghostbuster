Once upon a time, in a cozy little home nestled on a quiet street, there lived a young woman named Lily. Lily was just an ordinary girl with an ordinary life. She had a loving partner, Mark, who shared her humble abode. One beautiful morning, with the sun beaming through the windows, Lily found herself alone in her living room.
Curiosity piqued, Lily noticed that Mark was sound asleep on the couch. She smiled, thinking that he must have had a long night. She gingerly approached him, gently shaking his slumbering form. But to her surprise, he remained motionless, an undisturbed sleep etched across his face. In a panic, she called out his name, hoping for a response. Still, silence was the only answer.
Fearing the worst, Lily dashed to the neighbors for help. But as soon as she entered their homes, she discovered everyone else was fast asleep. Perplexed and unnerved, she tried to wake them up, but her efforts were in vain. It seemed as though sleep had captured their souls, refusing to relinquish its hold.
With each encounter, Lily grew more desperate. She ran through town, hoping to find someone, anyone who was awake. But the streets were empty, devoid of living souls. She walked through bustling markets, where vendors stood frozen mid-sale, their wares untouched. She even ventured to the busiest intersections, only to find the once-bustling traffic at a standstill, the drivers sound asleep behind their wheels.
Lily's panic turned into despair as she found herself alone, surrounded by a sea of slumbering bodies. Eventually, she returned to her empty home, where a profound loneliness settled over her. With every passing day, Lily searched for answers, but none could be found.
Years went by, and Lily became a mere shadow, an echo of her former self. Her sadness knew no bounds, for the world had become her prison. She withered away, tormented by the lack of connection and the absence of her loved ones.
And so, the once vibrant and lively Lily remained, alone in her living room. Forever haunted by the sleep that cursed her world, watching over the eternal dreamers who would never wake.
