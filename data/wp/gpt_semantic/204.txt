Once upon a time, there was this super cool astronaut named Steve, and he had this totally awesome crew. They got sent to the moon, like for real! So, they were like, "Hey, let's go to the other side of this moon-thingy." And guess what? They found stuff! Old stuff, like buildings and equipment and stuff. It was like, "Whoa, humans have been here before, dudes!" But, like, everything seemed all messed up. Broken stuff was scattered everywhere, and it looked super spook-tacular! Steve was like, "This didn't end well, bros." And the crew was like, "Yeah, not cool, man." So, they all went back to their moonship and left. The end!
