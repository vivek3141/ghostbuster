Once upon a time, in a small town, lived a man named Henry. Henry was a simple man with a peculiar talent—he had recently discovered that whatever he drew with his trusty sharpie turned into reality. However, there was just one tiny hitch in this unusual power of his—he was an absolutely terrible artist.
One fateful day, Henry found himself on a long-haul flight to a distant land. Little did he know that his skills, or rather lack thereof, would come in handy during this journey. As luck would have it, a group of bumbling paramilitary Irish republicans had snuck onto the plane, intent on creating chaos and hijacking it.
Henry sat in his seat, looking out the window as the plane took off. Suddenly, a brilliant idea struck him. He reached into his pocket and pulled out his sharpie, staring at it in wonderment. With trembling hands, he decided to use his power for good, even if his artwork made other people question his artistic abilities.
Summoning all his courage, Henry drew what he believed would save the day—a giant, ferocious banana peel. Okay, perhaps a banana peel wasn't the best choice, but it was better than nothing, or so he hoped.
Moments later, chaos erupted as the would-be hijackers stormed into the cabin, shouting and waving their guns. Henry, trembling with nerves, quickly approached the nearest hijacker and whipped out his trusty sharpie. Sweating profusely, he drew a giant banana peel right under the feet of the unsuspecting hijacker.
And just like that, with a loud "thud," the hijacker slipped on the ridiculously oversized banana peel and went crashing into the others, causing a domino effect of chaos. Henry's crude artwork had inadvertently saved the day.
Passengers erupted into applause and cheers, impressed by Henry's accidental heroism. Even the flight attendants couldn't help but giggle at the sight of the hapless hijackers, tangled up in a mess of limbs and bewildered expressions.
From that day forward, Henry became known as the accidental superhero. Although his artistic skills were still atrocious, people admired and praised his unconventional talents. He even made the headlines as the bumbling paramilitary Irish republicans were captured by the airplane's crew.
As for Henry, he was just glad that he had been in the right place at the right time. And who knows, maybe one day he would draw something truly magnificent with his sharpie. But for now, he would happily scribble away, content in knowing that even the smallest drawings could make a difference in the world, no matter how terrible they may be.
