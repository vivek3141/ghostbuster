Blood dripping from his blade, he kneeled and smeared it on her robe. Derek felt a strange mixture of fear and exhilaration coursing through his veins as he stared down at the lifeless figure lying at his feet. How could this have happened? How could he have resorted to such violence?
Just minutes ago, Derek had been a normal, law-abiding citizen going about his mundane routine. He had never imagined himself capable of taking a life, but something had snapped inside him today. The constant torment and abuse had pushed him to his breaking point. And now, here he was, desperate not to lose himself completely.
The woman lying before him had been his tormentor for years, both physically and emotionally. She was his stepmother, a cruel and merciless woman who seemed to relish in his suffering. No matter how hard Derek tried to please her, it was never enough. He felt as though he was trapped in a never-ending nightmare with no escape.
Today had been particularly unbearable. His stepmother had unleashed a torrent of insults and demeaning comments, tearing apart any shred of self-esteem he had left. As he stared into her cold, lifeless eyes now, he couldn't help but feel a sick sense of triumph. He had finally put an end to her reign of terror.
Trembling, Derek rose to his feet, his mind racing. Had he made the right choice? A sudden wave of guilt washed over him, threatening to drown him in its depths. His hands were clammy with sweat as he nervously wiped the blood stains from his blade. What would happen now? How would he explain this? Would anyone even believe him?
As panic set in, Derek's survival instincts took over. He knew he needed to cover his tracks and disappear before anyone discovered what he had done. Glancing around the room, he realized he had left a trail of evidence that could easily lead investigators straight to him. With a shaky hand, he picked up a cloth and began meticulously cleaning every surface, erasing any trace of his presence.
Once satisfied that his tracks were covered, Derek turned his attention to his stepmother's body. He knew he couldn't just leave her there like some discarded prop. She had been a monster, but she deserved a proper burial - or at least as proper as he could manage under the circumstances. As he pulled up her lifeless body, he couldn't help but marvel at how light she was. All those years of torment had made him feel weak and helpless, yet now he held the physical power over her.
Using every ounce of strength he had left, Derek carried her lifeless body out of the house and into the forest behind their property. There, he carefully dug a shallow grave, whispering apologies and pleas for forgiveness into the night sky. He knew it was futile; she would never forgive him, even in death.
Exhausted, Derek finally collapsed against a nearby tree, the adrenaline wearing off and leaving him feeling numb. He couldn't believe what he had just done. It was as if he had been possessed by a darkness that he never knew existed within him. Tears welled up in his eyes as he realized that he would never be the same person again.
As the sun began to rise, Derek knew he had to leave. He couldn't stay here. The authorities would surely discover what he had done, and he had no intention of spending his life in a cell, haunted by the memories of that dark night. With a heavy heart, he began his journey into the unknown, desperate to escape both his past and himself.
