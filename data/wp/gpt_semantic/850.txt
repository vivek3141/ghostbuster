It all happened so suddenly. Mary Jane was walking down the street, minding her own business, when a loud bang echoed through the air. Her heart raced, and she turned around to see what had caused the commotion. To her horror, a car had crashed into a nearby building, sending debris flying everywhere. People screamed and scattered in every direction. Mary Jane, frozen with fear, could only watch as smoke billowed from the wreckage. She wanted to help, but her legs refused to move. It felt like an eternity until the sound of sirens filled the air, but by then, it was too late.
