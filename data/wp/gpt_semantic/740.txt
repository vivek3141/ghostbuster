I can't believe it! Can you? It's hard to fathom, but in just a month, I am going to turn 24! Yes, the big two-four. It's like a milestone or something, right? The age where you're supposed to have everything figured out. Well, guess what? I don't!
Every time I think about it, a wave of anxiety washes over me like a tidal wave crashing against the shore. I mean, come on, 24! Shouldn't I have a stable job by now? Shouldn't I have a house, a car, and maybe even a pet goldfish named Bubbles?
But no, here I am, a few weeks away from my birthday, and I'm still struggling. I'm lucky if I can make a microwave meal without burning it or setting off the smoke alarm. And don't even get me started on my career. I'm barely scraping by on my part-time job at the local coffee shop. How am I ever going to afford all those adulting things?
And let's not forget about relationships. Shouldn't I be in a *serious* relationship by now? Instead, I find myself swiping left and right on dating apps, hoping to find someone who doesn't ghost me after three messages. Can't a girl catch a break?
Sometimes, I look at my friends from high school, and it feels like they have it all together. They have their dream jobs, their own homes, and are even planning their fairytale weddings. Meanwhile, I'm still trying to avoid eating expired yogurt and praying my car passes its next inspection.
But you know what? Maybe turning 24 doesn't have to be so terrifying. Maybe it's okay to be a work in progress, stumbling through life one day at a time. Perhaps, instead of comparing myself to others, I should focus on my own journey and celebrate the small victories along the way.
So, here's to being 24, to embracing the uncertainty and finding joy in life's little triumphs. And, hey, if anyone has any advice on how to adult successfully, feel free to send it this way. Because honestly, I could use all the help I can get.
