Once upon a time, in a quaint little town,
Lived a man named Jack, who you would soon come to astound.
For Jack, you see, was a simple man,
No great oration, just a rhyming plan.
One day, a curse befell Jack's being,
He could no longer speak without rhyming, how demeaning!
No matter the topic or occasion at hand,
Jack's words would rhyme, as if following a command.
With a heavy heart, Jack knew he had to share,
This curse with his boss, whom he couldn't spare.
He walked into the office, nervous and shy,
And looked his boss in the eye.
"Good morning, boss, I must confess,
That I'm cursed to rhyme, much to my distress.
No matter the words or thoughts I think,
It all comes out in rhymes, in a blink."
His boss, startled and taken aback,
Listened carefully to Jack's poetic track.
He chuckled softly and said with a grin,
"Well, Jack, let's see the state you're in!"
Jack then approached his spouse, feeling more dread,
Hoping she wouldn't be disappointed or mad.
He cleared his throat and started to say,
"While I'm afraid I now rhyme all the day."
His wife, surprised, sighed and then smiled,
Embracing Jack, she said, "We'll go the extra mile!
Together we'll face this strange little twist,
In rhyme and verse, our love will persist."
And so, dear readers, our story goes,
Of Jack, who found solace amidst his woes.
For though he couldn't speak in prose,
He found beauty and joy in rhymes that arose.
