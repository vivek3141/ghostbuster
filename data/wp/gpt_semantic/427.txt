Once upon a time, there was a powerful being named Satan. He used to be a bad guy, but now he wanted to be good and go back to Heaven as Lucifer. So, Satan pleaded to God for forgiveness, and God said, "Okay, but you have to prove yourself first." God told Satan he must resist the most tempting opportunity to sin.
Satan tried really hard to be good. But one day, the temptation came knocking at his door. It was a huge chocolate cake! Satan loved cake more than anything! He thought, "Maybe just a tiny bite won't hurt."
But then, Satan remembered God's condition. He resisted the cake, even though it was soooo tempting. In that moment, God knew Satan had genuinely changed and welcomed him back to Heaven.
And so, Satan became Lucifer once more, living happily ever after, free from sin and with a heart full of righteousness.
