In the eerie silence of night,
I gasp, my body trembling, consumed by fright.
A shadow lurking in the dark, unseen,
I feel the cold blade, my existence demeaned.
Whispers of fear, echoes surround,
Terror grips my heart, tight and profound.
Bound by darkness, I stand still,
Awaiting the end, my fate to fulfill.
The horrifying truth slowly unfolds,
Serene moments, shattered, stories untold.
A glimmer in the eyes, a wicked smile,
The truth concealed in deceitful guile.
Bloody footsteps, marking my demise,
I reach out in vain, endless cries.
Fading life embraced by the abyss,
My breath surrenders, the final kiss.
Confessions in reverse, twisted fate,
From this twisted web, no escape.
My actions concealed, but guilt remains,
A ruthless killer, haunted by my own chains.
