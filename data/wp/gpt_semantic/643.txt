Once upon a time, there was a guy called SurvivorType! He was a mod on this amazing website. The people loved him, and his comments were always so nice and helpful. One day, I decided to send him a message. I wanted to get to know him better. I asked him what his favorite color was, and he said blue. I said, "Oh wow, me too!" We started talking more and found out we have so much in common. It was like we were meant to be friends. Now, SurvivorType! is not just a mod, but also my best friend. I am so lucky to have met him! The end.
