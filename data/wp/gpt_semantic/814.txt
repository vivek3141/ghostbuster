My, um, name is, uh, Tom. Tom Harrison. And, uh, I'm an, an astronaut. Yeah, that's right, I'm an astronaut. Can you, um, believe it? I've always dreamt of, uhh, exploring the stars and, um, now here I am, on the moooon!
But, uh, let me tell you, it hasn't been all rainbows and moon-dust up here. No, no, it definitely hasn't. Just a little while ago, I, um, crash-landed here, you know. The whole ship was, um, shaking and vibrating and, uh, I thought my heart was gonna burst out of my chest. I was scared, really scared.
Now, standing here on the surface of the moon, I can't help but gaze in awe at, uh, this desolate landscape. It's so, so different from anything I've ever seen before. The ground is gray and rocky, like an alien world or something. It's like a whole new world out here, where, um, anything seems possible.
But, uh, can I just say how lucky I feel? Somehow, I've managed to, um, survive that crash landing. And here I am, alone, on the moon. I mean, who'd have thought, right? It's like, wow, what are the odds? I'm, um, grateful to be alive, don't get me wrong, but, um, I can't help but wonder... how am I going to get back home?
The rescue team won't come for days, and, uh, I don't have much food or water left. It's gonna be a long trek back to the landing site. But, um, I'll make it. I have to. I'm an, um, astronaut after all. And astronauts don't give up. So, yeah, I'll keep moving forward, one small step at a time, until I'm back on Earth. That's the plan, at least.
