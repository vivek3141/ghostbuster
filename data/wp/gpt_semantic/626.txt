Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a young woman named Lily. She had the strangest ability: every time someone pleasured themselves while thinking about her, a notification would pop up on her phone. At first, she was shocked. Who would ever desire her in such a personal way? However, as time passed, notifications became a norm. Curiosity took hold, and she'd anxiously check her phone each day, eager to discover who found her attractive. It became her secret source of validation, boosting her self-esteem. And with every ping, Lily felt a little more confident, a little more desirable, and a little less lonely.
