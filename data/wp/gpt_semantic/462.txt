Once upon a time, in a distant land, there lived a peculiar genie. Unlike other genies, who delighted in twisting wishes to cause mischief, this particular genie had a knack for taking things figuratively. A young man named Jake stumbled upon an antique lamp and accidentally unleashed the genie. Excitedly, Jake exclaimed, "I wish for a million bucks!" Much to his surprise, the genie transformed him into a charismatic entrepreneur, attracting countless business opportunities. Jake's pockets grew heavier as he earned millions, but there wasn't a single deer or antelope in sight. Perplexed, Jake realized that he must choose his words wisely when dealing with this genie, for it played games not with his wishes but with their underlying meanings.
