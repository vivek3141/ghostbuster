Once upon a time, there was an old man named Harold who loved spending his days in solitude, reminiscing about the countless adventures life had bestowed upon him. Every week, Death would appear at his door, clad in a timeless black cloak, to engage in profound conversations about life's precious moments and inevitable end. This time, however, Death felt a heavy weight upon their heart. In the garden, surrounded by blooming roses, Death mustered the courage to gently inform Harold of their impending visit. But the words evaporated in the air, replaced by tears that brimmed both their eyes. Death couldn't bear breaking the news to their dearest companion, leaving both overwhelmed by the silence that would soon replace their lively exchanges.
