Once upon a time, in a world trapped in eternal darkness, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse reigned supreme. There was War, the fearsome warrior with eyes aflame and a sword that never wavered. There was Famine, the skeletal figure who devoured all in his path, leaving barren lands and withered souls. There was Pestilence, the master of disease, casting plagues and infestations wherever he went. And finally, there was Death, the silent reaper, taking the souls of the living without hesitation.
But one fateful day, Death went missing.
The remaining three Horsemen were thrown into chaos, for without Death, their cycle of destruction was incomplete. War, Famine, and Pestilence searched frantically for their lost comrade, fear gripping their withered hearts. However, as days turned into weeks, it became apparent that Death had vanished completely.
With a heavy heart, Pestilence proposed a desperate plan. They would search for a human sadistic enough to take Death's place, to wield his scythe and carry out the final judgment. War and Famine hesitated, for this meant giving power to a mortal, but they had no choice.
Thus, their quest began.
They began their search in the bleakest corners of the world, seeking the darkest souls. In a desolate town, they found a man named Edgar, whose heart oozed with malevolence. His wicked smile sent chills down their spines, and they knew he was their candidate. Edgar, however, had demands. He asked for wealth, power, and immortality in return for wreaking havoc as the new Death.
The three Horsemen exchanged glances, torn between the desperate need to fill the void and their unease at the man's demands. Eventually, they agreed, for the world could not endure without Death's swift hand. The deal was struck, and with a crimson mist, Edgar became the new incarnation of Death.
Immediately, Edgar reveled in his newfound power. He took delight in ending lives, savoring the anguish of those left behind. It was a cruelty unparalleled, one even the original Death had never possessed. War, Famine, and Pestilence watched in horror as their once noble cause turned into an abomination.
But in the depths of Edgar's sadism, something unexpected happened. The darkness within him began to consume him, twisting his soul into an uncontrollable frenzy. The power he had craved turned into a curse, drowning him in an abyss of eternal suffering.
Realizing their grave mistake, the three remaining Horsemen unleashed their full force, obliterating Edgar and reclaiming the scythe of Death.
With heavy hearts, they accepted their loss and continued their reign of destruction, forever incomplete. They knew that no mortal, no matter how sadistic, could bear the weight of Death's mantle. And so, the Four Horsemen carried on, forever searching for their lost comrade, their cycle destined to remain incomplete until the end of time.
