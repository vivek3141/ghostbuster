Once upon a time, there were two humans named Jack and Sarah, and they were the only ones left after a mysterious catastrophe. They searched far and wide for other survivors, but hope started fading away. Then, one random day, Sarah fell gravely ill. Jack tried everything he could to save her, but nothing worked. One morning, he woke up to find Sarah no longer breathing. Grief consumed him, and he felt the weight of being the last human alive. With a heavy heart, Jack carried on, but the world felt emptier without Sarah by his side. He longed for the days when humanity thrived, but now, he was truly alone.
