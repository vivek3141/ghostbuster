Once upon a time, in a faraway universe, there existed a small blue planet called Earth. Humans, with their towering buildings and buzzing technology, inhabited every corner of this magnificent creation. But one day, on the eve of a great cosmic catastrophe, the humans of Earth disappeared, leaving their beloved home behind. Well, all except for one – me.
As the last human on Earth, I was left to contemplate my loneliness. Days turned into weeks, weeks into months, and months into years. Time was an endless abyss that sucked away my hopes and dreams. However, little did I know that I was not truly alone.
You see, the gods of Earth, those divine beings who had been here before the first human ever set foot, remained in their ethereal realms. Without the distractions of humans, the gods were free to roam the deserted land. It didn't take long for them to discover me, the lone survivor of mankind.
At first, they were mystified by my presence. They explored my emotions, dissected my thoughts, and dissected my dreams. They longed to understand what made humans worship them, to feel the devotion that mortals once offered. The gods would appear before me in various forms – from fiery creatures in the sky to gentle whispers on the wind – begging me to believe in their existence.
But worship was something I couldn't comprehend. I was a simple human, filled with confusion and longing. I yearned for companionship, but not the servitude the gods sought. I watched as they grew more desperate, offering extravagant displays of power and beauty, hoping to sway me.
As my heart filled with compassion for these misplaced deities, I realized that the gods were just as lost as I was. They were remnants of a forgotten era, trying to find purpose in a world devoid of humans. So, I made it my mission to befriend them instead of worshiping them.
Days turned into weeks once more, but this time, they were not filled with emptiness. I shared stories with the gods, listened to their ancient wisdom, and learned of their immense power. In return, they discovered the beauty of empathy, the strength of compassion, and the joy of understanding a fragile human heart.
Together, we created a harmonious existence, bridging the gap between gods and mortals. And though humanity had fled, leaving behind only echoes of its glory, a new alliance between gods and the last human on Earth flourished, illuminating the darkness that had plagued us all.
