Once upon a time in a world not so different from ours, there lived a person named Alex. Alex, like everyone else, had a peculiar number on their chest. This number showed the unfortunate amount of people they would unintentionally cause harm to in the upcoming month. Alex's number had always remained a mere one, which brought them some sense of relief. However, on a seemingly ordinary day, destiny took a cruel twist. When Alex gazed upon their chest, they nearly fainted in disbelief. The number had skyrocketed to a stupefying three million! Alex's heart sank with horror as they questioned their existence and wondered how they could live with the burden of such a staggering fate.
