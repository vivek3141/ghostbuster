This morning, you received a note: "23:00 - you know where." Start your story at 22:58. 
22:58. Tick, tock. Time was slipping away. The room was filled with a palpable sense of anticipation. Beads of sweat trickled down my forehead, despite the cool breeze coming in through the open window. I nervously glanced at the clock, repeatedly counting down the minutes until the mysterious meeting. Who could have sent this note? What would await me at 23:00? The seconds dragged on painfully slow, as I tried to calm my racing heart. Should I go? Should I stay? Doubt gnawed at my resolve. Yet, curiosity won in the end. I knew where I had to be at 23:00.
