Once upon a time, in the enchanting world of wizards and wands, there lived a young boy named Lucas. Lucas was just an ordinary orphan, until a letter arrived on his 11th birthday, inviting him to attend the prestigious Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Over the years, Lucas had heard countless tales of magical beings and spells, so he simply couldn't believe his luck.
Excitement filled his heart as the day finally came to leave for Hogwarts. However, just as Lucas was packing his trunk with spellbooks and robes, an unexpected visitor arrived. Dressed in a white coat and glasses, the scientist introduced himself as Professor Newton.
To Lucas' disbelief and horror, Professor Newton explained that there had been a grave mistake. Lucas, it turned out, possessed no magical powers whatsoever. He was, in fact, just a regular human child who had been mistakenly invited to Hogwarts.
The news shattered Lucas' dreams of becoming a powerful wizard. Instead, he would have to attend a muggle school, a place where magic was only found in stories. Tears welled up in Lucas' eyes as he bid goodbye to the world he had come to love.
But as he walked through the doors of his new muggle school, Lucas felt a newfound determination. If he couldn't have magic, then he would focus on other passions. He would become a scientist like Professor Newton, experimenting with potions and creating his own wonders.
Lucas soon discovered that the muggle world held its own brand of magic. With his curious mind and thirst for knowledge, he excelled in science and made friends who shared his love for exploration and discovery. Though he may not have been a wizard, Lucas realized that ordinary life had its own enchantments waiting to be unraveled. And so, with each passing day, Lucas embraced his new journey, ready to create his own magic in the world.
