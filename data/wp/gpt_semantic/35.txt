Once upon a time, on a gloomy Tuesday morning, I found myself aboard the No.17 bus, heading towards the bustling city center. Little did I know that this mundane bus ride would unravel a secret that would change my life forever. You see, I had always possessed this peculiar ability to see what I called "soul escorts," spiritual beings that appeared whenever someone's time on this mortal coil was coming to an end.
As we trundled along, the bus suddenly came to a halt at a deserted crossroad, leaving us passengers stranded in the midst of our daily shuffle. I glanced out the window, curious about the delay, and what I saw sent shivers cascading down my spine. The bus had become an ethereal vessel, filled to the brim with a sea of soul escorts. They were floating above the seats, their translucent forms pulsating with an otherworldly glow. An eerie silence fell upon the bus, as if time itself had paused to witness this bizarre spectacle.
The other passengers seemed blissfully unaware, their attention glued to their phones or lost in their own thoughts. It was as if I alone possessed the ability to perceive this supernatural invasion. The escorts varied in form; some were shimmering balls of light, gracefully bobbing up and down, while others took on more humanoid shapes, adorned in ethereal robes. Their presence weighed heavily upon my heart, for I knew that their existence signaled the imminent arrival of death.
I surveyed the passengers, searching for a familiar face amidst the chaos of spectral beings. And there she was, sitting in the back corner of the bus, an elderly woman named Mrs. Jenkins, her frail form dwarfed by the ethereal crowd surrounding her. Her escort, tall and shadowy, held her hand with the utmost tenderness, ready to guide her to the realm beyond.
Mrs. Jenkins, oblivious to the impending transition, sat quietly, her small hands clutching a purse filled with memories. I knew that her time was nearing an end, and yet, I hesitated. What right did I have to meddle in the natural course of life? I wrestled with my conscience, torn between my knowledge of the inevitable and my desire to preserve the sanctity of the unknown.
As the escorts shimmered, casting unearthly light upon the bus, a single tear slipped down Mrs. Jenkins' wrinkled cheek. It was then that I made my decision, propelled by an inexplicable force. With trembling steps, I made my way toward her, my heart pounding in my ears. I sat beside her, offering a gentle smile, and she turned to me with eyes that held a lifetime of experiences.
"Hello, dear," she crooned, her voice frail but kind. "Is there something on your mind?"
In that moment, I knew that I had made the right choice. I may have been a beginner in this strange world, but I had the power to provide comfort and solace to those who traveled to the beyond. And so, as the bus lurched forward on its path once more, I held Mrs. Jenkins' hand, offering her a glimmer of companionship on her final journey.
