Once upon a time, in the distant future of 2050, there stood a little internet café called "The Net Den." I, Johnny, the owner, held the great honor of being the world's last proprietor of such a place. But, you might wonder, how did I manage to stay afloat? Well, folks, it was all thanks to one secret recipe—my grandmother's famous blueberry muffins! People from all corners of the globe would flock to my cozy café, not just for the internet, but to indulge in these scrumptious treats. Somehow, amidst the rise of virtual reality and fancy gadgets, my humble café managed to stir an old-world charm and nostalgia that couldn't be replicated.
