Once upon a time, there was a writer named Timmy. He loved to write stories, but he often struggled to choose which prompts to write about. He asked his writing teacher, Mrs. Johnson, for advice. She told him, "Timmy, other than personal preference, you can consider the impact a prompt has on the reader. Is it thought-provoking or can it bring out emotions? Also, think about the potential for a good plot. Finally, choose a prompt that challenges you as a writer, allowing you to grow." Timmy thanked Mrs. Johnson and tried her advice. He selected a prompt about a mysterious lost city, and as he wrote, he discovered a hidden passion for adventure and imagination. From then on, Timmy learned to choose prompts that excited him and pushed his writing skills to new heights.
