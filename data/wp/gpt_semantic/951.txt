Once upon a time, in a magical land called Harmonia, there lived a hedgehog named Harold and a rabbit named Rosie. They had always been an odd couple, but their love had transcended their differences. However, lately their relationship had been crumbling like a biscuit in the rain. Harold's prickly demeanor and Rosie's incessant hopping had clashed one too many times. They tried couple counseling with a wise owl, but it just left them feeling more confused. As they walked along the forest trail, their paws barely touching, their hearts heavy with uncertainty, they realized that maybe love wasn't enough to bridge the gap between their species.
