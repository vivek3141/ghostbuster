Once upon a time, there was a guy named David who was pretty normal, but one day everything changed. David, you see, discovered this crazy ability to control people's minds. Woah! But there was a big twist. When he controlled someone, their weird consciousness talked to him. It was like having a bunch of voices in his head, except the voices belonged to the people he controlled. It was kind of creepy, but also kind of cool, you know? He could make people do whatever he wanted, but he had all these voices telling him their thoughts and feelings. It was like being a puppet master with a nosy audience.
