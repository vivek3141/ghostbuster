Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved writing but was new to the concept of drabbles. Excited by her discovery, she decided to give it a try. The pressure of telling a story in only one hundred words seemed daunting, but she pressed on. Lily pondered ideas for her drabble. Should it be about romance, fantasy, or adventure? Finally, she settled on a mysterious tale of a hidden treasure. As she crafted her story, Lily realized the challenge of conveying a complete narrative in so few words. Although it was challenging, she found joy in the craft and continued to write drabbles, seeking improvement with every attempt.
