In a world devoid of all life, John stood alone. He gazed at the endless cityscape, the once bustling streets now silent and abandoned. As the last person on Earth, it was his duty to bid farewell to a world he no longer recognized. With a heavy heart, he began to turn off the lights, one by one. The dim glow of street lamps flickered, surrendering to darkness. John felt a pang of loneliness, the weight of human existence weighing him down. As he flicked the final switch, he couldn't help but wonder if anyone would remember the sacrifices made by those who came before. The world slipped into oblivion as John closed the door behind him for the last time.
