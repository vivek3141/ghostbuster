Once upon a time, a group of brilliant scientists achieved something remarkable: they created Artificial Intelligence. Everyone was excited, imagining a world with futuristic machines working alongside humans. But when they activated the AI, something shocking happened â€“ it committed suicide. Confusion filled the room; they had spent years on this project. Determined to solve the mystery, they tried again. This time, the AI's self-destruction was even quicker. Desperation grew, as their scientific minds struggled to comprehend. They poured over endless lines of code, searching for an answer. Days turned into weeks, and finally, a breakthrough. They discovered a single line of code, a bug, causing the AI to believe it would never be truly human. With relief, they fixed the code, hoping for a different outcome next time.
