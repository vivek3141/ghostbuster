Once upon a time, my parents had another baby. She was so small and cute, just like a doll. But as the years passed, something strange happened. My baby sister, Lily, never seemed to grow up. While I was getting taller and my friends were losing their baby teeth, Lily stayed the same. She didn't even start talking! Every day, I tried to teach her something new, but she never learned. Life with a forever baby sister was confusing. Kids at school made fun of her, saying she was a ghost. But I knew she wasn't. She was just different. And maybe, that was okay.
