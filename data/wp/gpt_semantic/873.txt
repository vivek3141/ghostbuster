As the car zoomed down the highway, I could sense the looming tension in the air. The radio crackled with rumors of a nuclear warhead heading straight for our area. My heart raced; this was it, our end was near. My family clasped hands, fear-stricken but united. With tears streaming down my face, I mustered all the courage within me. "I love you all," I sobbed, my voice trembling. But suddenly, a miracle happened. The missile was a dud! We were saved! As relief washed over us, I blurted out, "Well, that was anticlimactic!" Cue the awkward silence for the rest of the journey.
