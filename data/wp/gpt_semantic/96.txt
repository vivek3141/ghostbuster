Once upon a time, in the vast and mysterious realm of Heaven, God had a personal assistant named Gary. Gary was a diligent and dedicated angel who had been assigned the crucial task of handling all the prayers sent by humans on Earth. God had delegated this responsibility to Gary, giving him total autonomy to answer the prayers as he saw fit. It was a monumental task, but one that Gary had grown accustomed to over the years.
Every day, Gary would diligently check his inbox, eagerly awaiting the new prayers that would arrive from people all around the world. He would read each one carefully, considering the needs and desires of the individuals. Usually, Gary would answer them with ease, providing comfort, guidance, and occasionally even miracles.
One ordinary morning, as Gary sipped his celestial coffee and opened his inbox, an unusual prayer caught his attention. It was unlike anything he had ever come across before. The prayer was from a man named Adam, who lived in a small town by the sea. Adam's prayer was different because instead of asking for something material or personal, he simply asked for God's advice.
Gary was perplexed. In all his years as God's assistant, he had never encountered a prayer seeking advice from God. This was uncharted territory, and Gary felt a pang of uncertainty. He had always believed that God possessed infinite wisdom, far beyond his own comprehension. Should he answer this prayer on his own, or should he seek guidance from God himself?
Uncertain of how to proceed, Gary flew to the majestic halls of Heaven, where he approached the divine presence of God. He knelt before God, his wings trembling slightly, and timidly explained the situation. Gary confessed that he didn't know what to do, for it seemed inconceivable to offer advice in the place of the Almighty.
God listened, a gentle smile playing on his lips. In a voice that resonated with the wisdom of ages, God spoke, "Gary, my faithful servant, I have given you complete autonomy to answer the prayers of humanity. You have the capacity to use the knowledge and compassion imparted upon you. This prayer, in its essence, is your own request for guidance."
Gary's eyes widened in astonishment. God was right, it was his decision to make. Encouraged by God's words, Gary returned to his desk with newfound confidence and determination. He realized that sometimes, even the most divine beings needed counsel from others. Adam's question deserved careful consideration and an answer that would bring him solace and understanding.
For days, Gary pondered Adam's prayer, searching for the right words. Finally, he knew what he must do. He began typing a response, pouring his heart and soul into each word. Gary emphasized the importance of trust, encouraging Adam to believe in himself and follow his true passions. He stressed the significance of kindness, compassion, and of finding joy in life's simple pleasures. He spoke of the importance of staying true to oneself and embracing the pursuit of knowledge and personal growth.
Satisfied with his response, Gary sent the answer to Adam, hoping it would bring him the guidance he sought. As the days turned into weeks, Gary found himself wondering if Adam had found solace in his words. The thought gnawed at his heart, and doubts began to creep into his mind. Had he done the right thing? Should he have consulted God instead?
Just as Gary was about to become consumed by his own self-doubt, a bright light appeared before him. It was God, delivering a heartfelt message. "Gary," God said warmly, "You followed your heart and shared the wisdom within you. That is the most beautiful act of faith there is. Trust in yourself, for I have entrusted you with an important role. Your response was perfect."
Relieved and overjoyed, Gary thanked God profusely for his loving guidance. He realized that his own unique perspective mattered, and that he had the strength to fulfill the duties bestowed upon him. From that day forward, Gary approached his task with renewed confidence, embracing the knowledge that even God's assistant possessed wisdom worth sharing.
As for Adam, he received Gary's response with deep gratitude. The words touched his soul and inspired him to make positive changes in his life. He embarked on a journey of self-discovery, guided by the wisdom imparted by a faithful servant and the voice of God combined.
And so, the story of God's personal assistant and his brush with uncertainty teaches us that there is power in trusting oneself, and that even the most divine beings, like Gary, can find strength in their own unique perspectives. The responsibility of answering prayers had truly become a joint effort between God and his devoted assistant, forever reminding us that miracles can come in unexpected forms.
