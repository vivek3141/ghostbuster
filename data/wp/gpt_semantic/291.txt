Once upon a time, in the Commonwealth, it was Christmas. The wasteland was filled with joy and cheer, as parents gathered their kids to share the tale of old Saint Nick. They sat around a small fire, their eyes wide with wonder, as the parents began the story. "Long ago," they began, their voices shaky and unsure, "there was a jolly man called Santa Claus." The children listened intently, imagining a world full of red-suited heroes and reindeer sleighs. As the parents stumbled through the post-war tale, the magic of Christmas spread through the wasteland, bringing hope and happiness to all who heard.
