There's someone living inside my mind, but it's not me. They whisper secrets and silly rhymes, creating chaos in my sanity. I try to silence their words but they persist, like an ever-present tickle that never goes away. They tell me to dance in the rain, to sing to the moon, to break free from the chains that hold me down. And sometimes, I dare listen. I let them guide me through whimsical adventures and forbidden desires. But deep down, I fear I am losing myself to this intruder. Who are they? What do they want from me? There's someone in my head, and I'm afraid to find out who they really are.
