On the triumphant last day of Obama's presidency, a bustling atmosphere filled the air around the White House. People gathered, either with tear-filled eyes bidding farewell to an era or with hopeful anticipation of what the future may bring. Amidst the buzzing crowd, a familiar vehicle suddenly sliced through the sky, trailing a streak of fire behind it. The DeLorean landed with a loud thud on the perfectly manicured White House lawn, prompting gasps and screams from those nearby.
From the smoke-filled car emerged a disheveled, panic-stricken figure: Bernie Sanders. His unruly white hair stood on end as he stumbled out of the silver vehicle, shouting dire warnings about the future. The crowd fell silent as Sanders began to speak with urgency.
"Listen! Listen, my friends!" he exclaimed, clinging onto his rumpled suit jacket. "I've just traveled through time to warn you about the calamities that shall befall our nation if we do not change our path."
The spectators exchanged bewildered glances, unsure whether to take the Senator seriously or dismiss his rant as mere madness. But Sanders, perspiring and gasping for air, continued unabated.
"In the future, inequality will deepen, the middle class will crumble, and corporations will conquer our democracy. We must stand together, fight for justice, and strive for a fairer future," he proclaimed, his voice nearly cracking with urgency.
As the onlookers processed Sanders' words, a murmur of concern swept through the crowd. Perhaps, just perhaps, there was something to this wild prophecy. The final moments of Obama's presidency turned from jubilant celebration to somber reflection, as the citizens pondered the significance of Sanders' fervent message.
Little did they know, however, that this was merely the beginning. The DeLorean was but a harbinger of things to come, urging them to pay heed to the warnings and prepare for the challenges that lay ahead.
