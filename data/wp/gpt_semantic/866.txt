Hi! Umm, well, I'm the main character, I guess... or not. You see, I kinda want you to know that, like, I won't be the main character in your story. I mean, it's your little game and all, but I'm not playing along. Don't even try to put me in some crazy situation or whatever. I'm not that kind of person, you know? I'll just, like, avoid those moments. I'm more of an observer, I guess. Not the one who goes on adventures or saves the day, if that's what you were planning. So yeah, just letting you know. Hope that's, like, cool and stuff. Bye!
