January 2nd, 2013 - The Day Your Resolution Fails
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily who had big dreams for the new year. Determined to become the best version of herself, she made a resolution: to wake up early and exercise every day. With enthusiasm in her heart, Lily set her alarm for 6 a.m. Little did she know that her alarm clock had other plans.
The next morning, the alarm clock betrayed Lily. It didn't ring. She peacefully slept until noon, missing her workout. Devastated, Lily's resolution crumbled like a piece of burnt toast. She sighed, promising to try again tomorrow. Sometimes, even the best-laid plans fail, but that doesn't mean giving up on dreams.
