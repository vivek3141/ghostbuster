The thingamajig blinked and buzzed like a rabid bumblebee, and suddenly I found myself in a place that wasn't a place at all. Confused as a goose in a salad bowl, I stumbled upon streets paved with shiny rocks and behemoth mounds of metal beasts scurrying about like overgrown beetles. A ruckus of strange sounds filled my ears, making me shrink into myself like a wilted violet. The air was crisp, but tainted with pungent odors of gasoline and burnt rubber. I pulled out my tiny time travel manual, flip-flopping through dog-eared pages. Alas! This wasn't the snazzy Victorian era I had planned for.
