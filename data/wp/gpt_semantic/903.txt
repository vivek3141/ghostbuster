Title: "Help! My coffee tastes like poison!"
Hey everyone! So I've been trying to perfect my morning cup of joe, but today, something went terribly wrong. It tasted absolutely awful, kind of like poison! Has anyone experienced this before? What could have gone wrong?
r/OutdoorEnthusiasts:
Title: "Disastrous hike results in strange illness?"
Hi all, I recently went on a hike to this popular trail nearby, and I can't help but feel something strange is happening. Since then, I've been feeling really sickâ€”headaches, dizziness, and my skin is unusually sensitive. Could it be related to the hiking trail? Anyone else experienced anything like this?

Texts:
[From the protagonist to a friend]
Protagonist: Hey, I'm feeling pretty sick today. Do you know anything about symptoms of poisoning? Just wondering if it's related to this awful coffee or something else.
Friend: Wait, what? Are you okay? Did you go see a doctor?
Protagonist: Not yet, I wanted to rule out any possibilities on my own first. I'm also considering a DIY criminal background check on someone. Just to make sure there's nothing suspicious going on... you never know, right?

Epilogue:
As misdirected as the Google searches, Reddit posts, and texts may have seemed, it turns out the protagonist's suspicions were unfounded. It wasn't the tainted coffee or the hiking trail causing their illness. In a surprising twist, it was the protagonist's new apartment building, where they had unknowingly been exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide. Fortunately, they sought professional help in time and, with improved safety measures, their health improved. The online searches, Reddit posts, and text messages serve as a reminder that sometimes the truth can be much stranger than what our initial assumptions imply.
