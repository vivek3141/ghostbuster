As he drove down the long, dark road in the middle of the night, Matthew felt a shiver run down his spine. The wind howled outside his car, whispering secrets only the night would dare carry. His eyes darted nervously from the rearview mirror to the deserted road ahead. It was all too eerily quiet for his liking.
Every 15 minutes or so, Matthew would pass by a hitchhiker with one arm raised, almost as if he were begging for a ride. But Matthew, cautious by nature, would ignore them all. He had heard tales of dangerous hitchhikers lurking in the night, just waiting for unsuspecting victims to fall into their trap. He wasn't about to become one.
Hours passed by, the moon high above casting a pale glow upon the road. Matthew's eyes grew heavy with exhaustion, his grip on the steering wheel tightening. But something seemed off. In his drowsy state, he began to notice a strange familiarity with the hitchhikers he passed.
After a couple of hours, Matthew's heart skipped a beat. He realized that he was passing by the same hitchhiker over and over again. How could this be? His foggy mind raced with confusion, thoughts overlapping in a tangled mess.
Fear gripped Matthew's entire being as he tried to make sense of the impossible situation. Who was this hitchhiker, and what dark forces were at play? His eyes darted from the rearview mirror to the hitchhiker, who wore a mysterious smile that sent chills down his spine.
Determined to break free from this nightmarish cycle, Matthew decided to confront the hitchhiker. With trembling hands, he pulled over and motioned for the hitchhiker to get in. But as the hitchhiker approached, Matthew's heart froze. It was then that he noticed the flawless reflection of the moon in the hitchhiker's eyes.
The hitchhiker leaned in, whispering in a voice as cold as ice, "You should have known better than to ignore me, Matthew." As the car sped away into the night, Matthew's screams merged with the howling wind, lost forever in the lonely darkness.
And so, Matthew became another victim traveling down the long road, tempestuously repeating the same fate as countless others. For now, the night had claimed him, leaving nothing but an eternal loop of horror and regret.
