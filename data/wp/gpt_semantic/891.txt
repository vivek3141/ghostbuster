I woke up to the frantic shaking of my roommate. Disoriented, I mumbled sleepily, "What's happening?"
"There's no time! We have to go!" she cried with wide eyes.
Confused, I blinked and asked, "Go where exactly?"
"There's no time! I woke up today and time doesn't exist anymore!" she exclaimed dramatically.
Stifling a yawn, I squinted at her. "Uh, what do you mean?"
She glanced at her wristwatch, which seemed to have stopped. "Look, your phone! It doesn't move! Time is frozen!"
I stared at my motionless phone and shrugged. "Maybe it's just a glitch? Let's not panic just yet. How about we grab some coffee and see if time catches up?"
