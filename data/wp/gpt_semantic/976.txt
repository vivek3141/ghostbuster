Once upon a time, in the small town of Middleofnowhereville, something extraordinary happened. Aliens, yes, actual aliens, landed on Earth. And get this: Intergalactic Law stated they had to send their most average champion to compete for our planet. Can you believe it? I couldn't either. 
So, the aliens sent a weird-looking device to find the most average human to accept the challenge. And guess what? It picked me! Me, the most average person you could ever imagine. I mean, I'm not particularly good at anything, but I'm not terrible either. Just perfectly, utterly average. 
Now, let me tell you, I've never won any sort of competition before. My chess skills are non-existent, and my athletic prowess peaked at tying my shoelaces. But hey, anything's possible, right?
I arrived at the Alien Universe Arena, a massive metallic structure that put all other stadiums to shame. Standing in front of me was my extraterrestrial opponent, a seven-foot-tall creature with tentacles and a shiny rainbow-colored body. As you can imagine, I was a tad intimidated.
But, despite my lack of skills, I had something most champions didn't: determination and heart. I knew Earth had to be saved, so I squared my shoulders and charged at the alien, roaring my best warrior cry. Well, it sounded more like a hiccup mixed with a sneeze, but hey, it was the thought that counted.
To my surprise, the alien champion burst into laughter. Turns out, humor is universal. We spent the next few hours sharing jokes, giggling like old friends. In the end, we decided there was no need for a duel. Earth and the aliens became allies in laughter.
And so, the most average human saved the day, not through strength or strategy, but simply by being average ol' me. Who would have thought? Sometimes, it's the most ordinary people who can accomplish the most extraordinary things.
