Once upon a time, in a magical land far, far away, there was a brave knight named Sir Reginald. He was well-known for his heroic feats and valiant quests. One day, the kingdom faced a new and terrifying threat – dragons! The villagers were scared, but Sir Reginald was determined to protect them. He gathered his trusted companions and prepared for battle. As they made their way outside, the knight's squire whispered, "Sir, there are a few dragons waiting…" Sir Reginald gulped, realizing the importance of being clear. "Wait," he gasped, "how many exactly?" The squire scratched his head. "Uh... maybe enough to fill a forest, sir?" Sir Reginald's heart sank. There were not just a few, but countless dragons awaiting their arrival. They charged bravely, hoping to conquer the daunting army. Although the knight's enemy was vast, his courage was even greater.
