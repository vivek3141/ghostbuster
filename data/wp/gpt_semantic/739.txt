Once upon a time, in a small town that bursted with simple-mindedness, there lived a prison guard named Sam. Sam was known for his undying love for puns and his painfully dry sense of humor. He had always dreamt of the day when he could concoct a pun that would leave people laughing for hours on end. Little did he know, fate was about to play its hand, leading Sam to a pun so epic, it would reverberate through the ages.
One fateful day, as Sam made his rounds at the local penitentiary, an unexpected incident occurred. As he turned the corner, his eyes met with an open cell door and an empty room. Panic washed over him like a tidal wave. Inmates had vanished into thin air, and Sam was the only one present. Fear and determination gripped his heart simultaneously, settling into a newfound motivation.
Sam knew he had to capture these escapees, but he also knew this was his golden opportunity to unleash his pun masterpiece upon the world. He collected himself and swiftly began his hunt for the prisoners not only interested in their capture but also in their appreciation for his pun.
With a slight quiver in his voice, Sam approached the first empty cell, announcing loudly, "Gentlemen, ladies, and everything in between! I regret to inform you that a small medium is now at large." A sense of satisfaction blanketed Sam as he waited for the laughter that never came. But undeterred, he moved on, determined to bring joy to the world through puns and, if possible, justice.
As Sam tiptoed through the maze-like corridors, he devised a plan to trap the escaped inmates within the prison walls. He would set up a trail of cans along the hallway leading to the main courtyard, then discreetly use helium-filled balloons to mimic their voices from the other side. This would be his pièce de résistance—a spectacular display of wit and keen intelligence sure to end with a resounding capture.
Hours of meticulous preparation ensued. Sam meticulously rigged the cans and balloons, his mind buzzing with the anticipation of the reaction he would receive. As the night grew darker, Sam positioned himself strategically behind a crumbling wall, ready to reel in his captive audience, or rather, his escapees.
One by one, the inmates unwittingly walked the path to their own demise, following the string of cans that gleamed in the moonlight. They approached the courtyard, their breaths heavy with fear and uncertainty. Suddenly, the voices of the escapees echoed through the still night air.
"A small medium at large!" came the distorted cries.
Silence followed. Sam held his breath, waiting for the resounding laughter he had so eagerly anticipated. Alas, all he received was a meek chuckle from the prison warden, who had observed the entire spectacle from his office window. 
Sam's dream pun had fallen on deaf ears. Disheartened but not defeated, he detained the escapees without further ado, vowing to continue his quest for punny greatness. For as long as he wore the uniform of a prison guard, Sam would tirelessly endeavor to entertain, even if it meant embarking on a lifelong journey in search of the perfect pun.
