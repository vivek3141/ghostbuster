Once upon a time, something amazing happened! It turns out, humans figured out that the whole universe is like... an alien's project! I know, wow, right? So, there's this alien kid, probably named Zork, who made the whole universe for his super important science fair. Like, talk about pressure! And we, little old humans, are just part of this big cosmic experiment. Can you believe it? It's kinda cool though, right? I mean, we're like the stars of this alien kid's school project. I wonder if he's gonna get an A+. I hope so! Maybe we can take a selfie together, with the whole universe as our backdrop.
