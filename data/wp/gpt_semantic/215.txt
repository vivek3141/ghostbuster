Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a young couple named Lily and Ethan. They were deeply in love, but their lives were troubled. Lily had fallen gravely ill, and the doctors had given her a small fraction of time left to live. Devastated, Ethan held onto a glimmer of hope. "We've still got time," he whispered, tears streaming down his face. "Not enough, but enough to make each moment count." With determination, they embarked on a journey to fulfill all their dreams and create lasting memories. Though their time was limited, their love knew no bounds, and each second was cherished like a precious gem.
