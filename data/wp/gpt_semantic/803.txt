The path I took led me to a place I had never seen before. It was dark, the kind of darkness that smothers any trace of light. As I walked further, the ground beneath my feet turned as black as coal, and I started to feel a heat creeping up my legs, burning my skin. The air was thick with a putrid smell, like sulfur and decay. The sound of screams echoed through the emptiness, filling me with a cold fear. I stumbled and fell, feeling a thousand eyes upon me. This was the descent into Hell, a place where nightmares come true and hope fades like a dying ember.
