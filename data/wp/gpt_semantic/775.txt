Mark woke up in a cold sweat, his heart pounding in his chest. His hands trembled as he clutched onto the edge of the bed, trying to anchor himself to reality. It had happened again. His worst nightmare had haunted him in his sleep once more.
He dreamt of a desolate city, consumed by darkness. Tall buildings stood as mere skeletons, their windows shattered and barren. Thick fog clung to the air, suffocating any trace of life. Mark wandered the empty streets, his footsteps echoing through the eerie silence. The sound reverberated, growing louder and louder until it became unbearable.
Suddenly, the sky crackled with lightning, illuminating sinister figures lurking in the shadows. Their grotesque faces twisted in agony, their eyes burning with malevolence. Mark tried to scream, but no sound emerged. He watched in horror as they closed in on him, their gnarled fingers reaching out, eager to tear him apart.
He ran, his every step becoming heavier, as if the ground itself defied him. But his pursuers were relentless. Their haunting cries echoed through the desolation, slicing into Mark's soul. Exhaustion washed over him, and he stumbled, collapsing onto the unforgiving ground. The creatures surrounded him, their malicious grins sending shivers down his spine.
Mark woke again, drenched in a mix of fear and sweat. He glanced around his familiar bedroom, grateful to escape the clutches of his nightmare for now. But deep down, he knew it would return, tormenting him until he found a way to conquer his greatest fear.
