The sound shattered a universe. Steel twisted and bent, the chassis collapsed, and the front windshield ruptured. It was like God had taken my car and crumpled it between His hands.
I opened my eyes.
I hadn't been showered in shattered glass. My chest hadn't been cored by a steering column. I could feel my hands and toes and neck. And all I could see was...leather? Leather, and a hemisphere of white plastic.
Slowly, achingly, I pulled myself backward. I was sitting in my backseat--how did I get here?--and had ended up with my head shoved against the leatherette exterior of the front driver's seat. The car was reasonably intact, considering. The windshield was indeed gone, but the front of the car had collapsed almost perfectly, preserving the interior. And me.
I could see an arm in a white suit, and white gloves, holding firmly onto the steering wheel.
"Hello? Who are you?"
The hemisphere of plastic turned. I saw my own face, shocked but unmarred, in the reflection of a mirrored visor.
I wish I could tell you what we talked about. I wish I could remember. But I was in such a daze from the impact that I don't remember much. And what I do remember would sound unbelievable if I told you.
All I know for sure is, he's called the Stig.
