David,
Sorry for leaving early. I thought, if I waited for you to wake, I would loose my nerve and never leave. I'm off to save the world!! Be proud of me my love. And take care of the children. I love you.
David,
It's beautiful here. I wish we could have explored it together. I've tried calling, but I know how busy you are with the new job. Research is picking up here, it's too early to really say, but I feel like we are onto something big. Hope to talk to you soon. I love you.
David,
The rainy season has started. You would love it. Gallons of warm rain that pours down hard and heavy leaving behind that smell your always talking about. I still prefer the sun, but the rain makes me think of you, so I don't mind it as much. We are having some of the first hiccups, some lab animals were found dead this morning. Fit as a fiddle on day, gone the next. It could have been anything really, I'm not too worried. I'll try calling again at the end of the week, maybe try and squeeze me in?? I love you.
David,
The lab was closed down today. Looks like I might be coming home earlier then planned. We're not sure what happened, everything was going so smoothly...We're trying to get to our data, but the suits have shown up and have gathered up most of our equipment. No one is telling us anything, they keep delaying our transport out of this god forsaken jungle...I wish you were here, you would know what to do. I love you, so very much.
David,
I don't know if this will reach you. But I have to try. You must pack up Samuel and Jane and get them out of the city. Stay away from heavily populated areas and anyone connected to Central Dynamic Incorporated. Take care of our children my love. If god is good, I will find my way back to you. I may be able to stop this. I love you. More then you will ever know.
Mr. David Thorn,
We here at Central Dynamic Incorporated regret to inform you of the accidental death of your wife, Sophia Thorn. While on an expedition, Sophia lost control of her Humvee and crashed into an embankment, killing all passengers instantly. Your wife was a intrical part of our Genetic Engineering team and we mourn the loss of such a brilliant, hard working team member. We here at CDI hope to pay tribute to Sophia by having her work live on. We ask that any and all personal documents, files, or notes Sophia have left behind be turned into us so we may ensure Sophia's sacrifice was not in vain. For your cooperation, we are willing to grant you and your family a full pay out of Sophia's life insurance policy, plus additional support from CDI in all burial and funeral costs. We entrust you will make the right decision not only for your family, but for Sophia's memory.
Sincerely,
