The day I left to war, she told me not to come back home. I'm sure she didn't mean it, but I pretend she did. It's been years since I'd heard from her, but that was likely because I've spent most of my time stuck in this desert shit-hole.
I remember it like yesterday though, I can still smell the vomit, laced with vodka. I remember the blood on her hands, as she screamed it was my fault. She screamed as she leaned over *our sons* limp body. I knew this was a lie too, but I pretend it wasn't. The boy had emotional issues, and I tried to help him, but the bitch would never admit that.
I remember her father, at the funeral, the way the tears streamed from his face, as he quietly agreed with my now ex-wife, that it was in fact, my fault. I remember agreeing with him, and leaving when his wife told me I shouldn't be there. I remember all of these things, and I pretend they are true, though I know they are not.
I didn't feel a thing, when I shot that young arab boy. Even when I found out he was a civilian, I remember laughing with my men, it was a hell of a headshot. I don't feel much of anything. When I pretend they were right, I finally feel. It gives me the fuel to keep going, and it's given me the passion I need. Look at me now. A hero, they call me.
I remember it like yesterday. It was the day I left home. No, it was the day I left for home.

Not a soldier, not even close, just inspired me to be...dark, I guess.
