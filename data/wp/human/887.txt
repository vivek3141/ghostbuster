Faster than any man who has come before, no other human has possessed the same strength. Victor in battles of gods, referee in the conflicts of countries he posses a might that is not of this world.
Small though he may be, weak looking he is, he still looks over his battlefield calm and collected. Wars are fought at home, looking down upon those who worship him. He will never look back at them. He looks down, down beyond the single face in thr crowd. For he deals in ideas and ideals, not people.
His pen, for no line is ever out of place, is clutched in his hand, focusing his will. His wil is dominant, unyielding and unending. He will never stop drawing. To stop is to give up, to relinquish. Power is only in his hand as long as he sees the image, as long as he focuses on his picture of the world.
For what would a world be without sight? No one knows because he keeps drawing, and as long as his pen moves our sun is lit. Darkness will come, but he shall fall first.
