I sighed a deep sigh, but it didn't relieve the tension in the room or in my body. I hated the fact that the boss wanted us to do this, but I hated even more that my partner was fully on board. The fight started slowly. I obviously didn't want anything to do with him having seen all of the carnage that he was causing above, but my partner felt it was his solemn duty to carry out every order to the tee, or some garbage like that.
"Have you not been paying attention at all? ", i bellowed at him in front of everyone, barely getting a reaction out of him.
"Yeah, but..."
"But what? Have you noticed how many people he and his cohorts have sent down here? Have you seen the relief in their faces when they realize they were *here*? Why the *hell* would someone be relieved to be here? Maybe it's because the hell he's been putting on up there is heaven compared to the shit they'll have to go through down here."
"But what about our duty? ", he asked calmly.
"What about his? ", I retorted. "Wasn't he elected to lead his people out of one of their darkest times? And what did he do instead huh? *What the hell did he do?! *"
"That's not importa..."
"You're damn right it's important! Why should we protect him when he failed to protect anyone up there? Why should we help him when he made a life out of destroying so many? ", I said calming down a little bit. "Why should we help him when even those in his inner circle wound up down here by his own hand long before their time was up?"
"He's here. ", the assistant said.
"I'm not going. ", I said as I sat back down. "You may have your duty, but I still have my morals."
