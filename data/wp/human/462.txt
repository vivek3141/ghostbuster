"I wish I had a billion USD put into my bank account with Enterprise, account number 5583922856392055!" I yell to my genie. I have thought about this moment a lot. Rephrasing in my head over and over just to get exactly what I ask. I have read many a tale that suggests trickery on the genie's side. My heart is pumping with anticipation, excitement, and hope for a new life with the possibility of a new life.
"Your wish is my command. Check your pockets."
I frantically search my pockets only to find a few hundreds in each.
"What is this? What is going on? This is only a few hundred...I asked for millions and millions??"
"Well don't be silly. That would be way too much for a person to get from a wish. That's like saying 'I want a bajillion dollars' man."
