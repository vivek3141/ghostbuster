Bridgette's eyes flickered momentarily, but only back and forth across the glowing rectangular screen clutched in her pinkly glittering fingertips. "Yeah man, people fucking love you. You're, like, pretty much pop-culture."
The Prince of Darkness snapped his leathery wings in irritation. Bridgette didn't look up; her followers needed her. The perfectly crisp white line of the part in her hair stared up at him as she calmly strung puns in a never-ending comment chain like a fucking pro. Lucifer the Morningstar settled for crouching a little in an attempt to make eye-contact, his barbed tails sweeping the ground. "Believe me, I understand the temptation, but this has to stop. I'm not the Santa Claus of Reddit, I can't be everywhere at once."
Bridgette's gaze flicked onto him so unexpectedly that Satan noticed too late the picture she snapped of him. "Yeah, that's a meme if I ever heard one."
Beelzebub peeked over her shoulder as blocky white text appeared across the scorching image of his sullen face. Between fangs, he pouted. "Even you have to admit it's a cheap shot."
Suddenly she was next to him, her spine pressed lightly into the burning flesh of his naked chest. The small white screen floated before his eyes between her palms. "There, you see that? That's my fucking karma, big boy."
Suddenly Satan didn't know what to do with hands. "Is that for real?"
"Just from this post. I'm telling you, they fucking love you." She smiled sweetly, looked up into his face, and snapped a selfie.
The Lord of the Flies stared blankly at the girl in his arms, then seemed to finally find his tongue. "I think my eyes were closed. Get another."
