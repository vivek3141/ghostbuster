"Well, what are you waiting for?" Adam tapped his foot impatiently, arms folded, "Just try sticking it in."
Eve glared at him. "I *did*. It doesn't want to fit. This can't be the way."
Rolling his eyes, Adam unfolded his arms. "Look, there are a limited number of holes and things to put in them. That big wiggly thing on the end of one of my trunks looks like the best bet."
"What if it doesn't go in my face mountain? The holes are too small and not stretchy."
"Well, I'm not putting it near your sharp face eater things." Adam grunted, "I saw what they did to that apple."
Eve sighed. "For the last time, the Snake told me it would be tasty!" She glanced around, "Actually, the Snake might be able to help here." She cupped her hands to her mouth, "Hey! Snake!"
A hissing noise directly above caused them both to jump. "Yesssss? What isssss it?"
Adam looked up to see a large snake coiled around the branches of the massive that provided protection from the bright sunlight. "We're trying to make a small us. None of these things seem to fit in other things though."
The snake hissed and lowered its head down to the two. "Usssssee your ssssssnake, Adam, in Eve'ssssss cave."
"Which Cave?" Asked Eve, "I don't know why but I don't really want to mouth that thing."
Adam glanced at Eve's mouth, thinking hard. "I feel like It would fit well there. Maybe that's what it's for?" he asked, looking to the snake.
"Only on birthdaysssss."
"What?"
"Forget I ssssssaid that. The cave between her legssssss."
Eve shuddered. "No way! That's where the food leftovers come out, you're not putting that thing in there."
Adam's face fell as quickly as it had lit up. "Thinking about that is making my snake turn to stone! Is that a good thing?"
"Yesssss. Not the food leftoversssss hole though. The front ssssspaccce."
Eve's expression changed dramatically. "Y...yes, that could work. Let's try that."
The snake slid back up into the tree, sliding behind the foliage, but not so far that it couldn't still see. Both Adam and Eve seemed intent on their activities, not bothering with it. Head slowly swaying back and forth, the snake watched the tangle of limbs for a a few minutes before a booming voice exploded into its ear.
**WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? **
Cringing, the snake glanced over to see a point of pure light beside it from which the voice echoed.
"Jussssst helping them procreate."
**FOR MY SAKE LUCIFER, YOU WANT *MORE* OF THEM? IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO CONTROL TWO! **
"Well why did you give them the toolssssss required to make more then? They would of courssssse figure it out eventually."
**THEY WERE A SAFETY MEASURE; JUST IN CASE WE WANTED MORE. NOW THEY'LL BE ALL OVER THE PLACE. **
The snake made a valiant attempt at a shrug. "That'ssss your problem."
**I CAN FIX THIS. ** A blinding flash consumed the garden. **THERE. **
Looking around for a few seconds, the snake narrowed its eyes and turned back to the point of light. "What isssss it that you have done?"
**THE FEMALE WILL NOW HAVE 9 MONTHS OF UNCONTROLLABLE EMOTIONS AND A USELESS MEMORY BEFORE EACH CHILD COMES OUT, A PROCESS WHICH WILL BE EXCRUCIATING. **
"What of the Male? How will he be controlled?"
**HE WILL HAVE THE URGE TO MATE WITH EVERYTHING FROM A YOUNG AGE. **
A moment of silence passed, broken only by the grunts and exclamations from below. "How doesssss that help? That just makesssss it worsssse!"
**HE WILL FEEL PAIN AFTER A FEW DAYS OF NOT SPILLING SEED. I SHALL ALSO, IN MY WORD TO HIM, FORBID HIM FROM MATING IN ANY WAY OTHER THAN TO REPRODUCE. **
Silence again reigned for a few moments before the snake looked back, awe on his face. "That'sssss the most impresssssssively created punisssssshment I've ever heard."
Grunts and moans echoed throughout the garden of Eden as the first two humans, blissfully oblivious made a concerted effort to get the human race started.
