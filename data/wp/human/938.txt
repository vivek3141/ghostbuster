I roll my shoulders back as I see the mop of blond hair walk into the restaurant, I follow the man until he sits down, I sigh and shake my head trying to put all the memories I have with the man out of my mind, sure I grew up with him as my brother since I was 7, but when I was 20 and he was 22 he betrayed me, it doesn't matter that my part- no, my Ex-partner was killed by him. Not all that matters is that I was told to kill him, I watch carefully as the lifts the champagne flute to his lips, he raises his eyes slightly and I can see is eye plain as day through my scope, I squeeze the trigger every so lightly and watch in horrified satisfaction as the bullet engraved with the single sentence of "Scorpia never forgets and Scorpia never forgets, Love Horseshoe" slips into my adopted brother's forehead, right between the eyes. I set my calling card down; brush myself off. I walk away pull out my phone and mutter one simple sentence, "Он умер." He is dead.
Less than a month later I find myself pretending to mourn at Alex Rider's funeral, almost all of the K-unit is there. Almost, Fox is missing, he passed of a mission a few years ago, they still don't know about either if our jobs, and sadly they still think we're rich kids who have parents who hate them. At least one of them knew the truth.
