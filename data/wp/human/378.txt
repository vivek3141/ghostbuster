"Kiii-ya!"
"Put it away, darlin'," I said, exasperated.
I heard another of the blighters drop down from the roof behind me. Damn. Now I was surrounded.
"Look," I said, showing my empty palms to the world, "I come in peace. Watashi wa, heiwa ni kimasu."
"Anata wa itan-sha, joseidesu," one of them spat out. My japanese was a little rusty, but I got the gist. To reinforce the point, a shuriken whizzed past my ear and severed a few strands of hair. Time slowed down as they floated lazily in the air.
The first hair hit the ground and everything happened at once. I mean that literally.
I hit the "Slow time" button on the TimeWatch as the first ninja lunged. His movement slowed to a crawl.
More shurikens were drifiting through space towards the spot where I had been standing. I blew a puff of air at one, and sent it spinning.
Then I slipped Brass Betty over my knuckles and smiled at the ninjas.
"OK boys, it's playtime."
