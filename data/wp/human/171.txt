It's another normal day in Westfield except something's a little off. While I've been running off the locals from the graveyard to rob the deceased, I've been dressing as a zwombie and using a projection to fool police. It's a small town so keeping the word from getting out was easy. Cut a few telephone lines and flatten a few tires and no one will ever know. Today was different though, this morning a can pulled in.
I immediately flatten the front tires so they can't escape. After watching them for a little bit, I can't help but notice they're some sort of mystery solving group. Are they fucking kidding me? A stoner and his dog, some preppy looking douche, a librarian and a slut? Who are these people? I can't let them leave and I need to hide the evidence. Once I find the grave of the nobleman who was buried here and his treasure I can leave but I can't have them snooping around.
I already had some open graves dug so I waited for them to come liking around the graveyard. This is going to be too easy, I'm going to use the projector to scare them right into running into the graves. Something unexpected happened though. The dog started digging up the treasure. How the fuck did he find it? That's ok though, these kids are about to get it.
I scared preppy boy and the slut into a hole that is too muddy to escape. The librarian lost her fucking glasses and crawled into a crypt that I locked behind her. As for the stoner and dog, pot brownies sitting on a tombstone really got the best of them.
While I was going to kill them, I decided against it. They never saw me and I got all the treasure. These dumb fucks literally just helped me finish even faster. I should really leave some money for those tires though...
