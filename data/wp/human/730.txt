"What kind of Idiot are you? I said give me your fucking wallet, not your cards!" The gruff voice said. I chuckled, pushing my blond hair back over my shoulder. He moved closer to me, placing a hand on my throat.
"Give. Me. You-" His eyes rolled back in his head as blood gurgled in his throat. A clean cut went right through his black ski mask, as blood soaked into it. My ace of spades was soaked with blood. The mugger collapsed, trying to breathe as blood pooled onto the ground. I looked at my card, as the blood disappeared. My cards worn edges became flat, meanwhile the card regained it's former shine. I shuffled my deck, and slid them back into my pocket.
