"May, what is this?" You ask, as you stand back from the amazing skeleton of a creature hanging from above you. May, your personal AI assistant, hums as she browses her database. "Scan complete. Object identified is a Stegosaurus. It is a type of dinosaur that roamed the earth nearly 200 million years ago. It has been extinct for, quite some time." You nod your head. "Quite impressive, this, beast." May sighs. "Contrary to popular believe, the Stegosaurus was actually a herbivore. It most likely kept to itself, trying to avoid human contact, which wasn't what ended up happening."
You keep walking through the large, buried rooms. You keep away from the hard clear material that is strewn all throughout the floor, it caused a slice through your fabricated armor suit when you broke through it unknowingly, when you stumbled a crossed this place. "What happened to them?" You ask. You gaze up at another large display, this one appears to be standing up on the ground, except the head had been crushed to the floor. "Nobody knows." She says. "Unfortunately, humans weren't around at the time. Some humans believe that a meteor strike baked them all to death. There are other speculations as well." You begin to look around at more of the large, shadowy displays. "May, let's get out of here. I don't like it in here." May hums a tune. "Yes Captain. Let's go back to the soldiers. I have a feeling that our field trip is over."
