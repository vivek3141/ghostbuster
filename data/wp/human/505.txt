*Alright Eradicus, the friendly party will come through in about 10 minutes, the mid bosses already phoned in saying they were about to fight so its all up to you now, you can do this*. The 112 foot demon sighed to itself, and went back to rubbing its hands. It wasn't for warmth, as Eradicus had balefire powerful enough to melt the earth itself and evaporate whole rivers in the blink of an eye, it was instead a nervous habit.

*Alright, I'll just activate the keystone runes that activate my hellguards and I should be fine, they got buffed recently meaning their armor is better, this time will be alright, it'll be okay*. Eradicus almost started hyper ventilating before mentally stopping himself, flicking on the runes for the hellguards and the lava pits and ghost effigies.

Eradicus looked down, casting his horrifying 4 eyed visage downwards to what appeared to be a naked boy. Eradicus tilted his head, bemused. "Ca- Can you please stop that?" Eradicus asked, his demonic voice echoing across the vast chamber, the deep sound reverberating across the skulls and bones cast around the ground. The naked boy looked up, "I am lord Timmothy the fearsome! take this fiend, hiyah!" The boy whacked Eradicus on the ankle again with his toothpick of a sword. Eradicus let out a pained sigh, sounding akin to a raging furnace letting out swathes of steam. Eradicus tried his best to do a smile, assuredly making numerous puppies die somewhere at the sheer terror of the event. "Timm- Lord Timmothy the fearsome, I have something to resolve at the current moment, so can we please continue this later?". Timmy stopped whacking Eradicus's ankle, "Hmmmmmm...You may have the great Timmothy's mercy this once fiendish fiend! But I will stay here until you are finished!". Eradicus sighed once more, going back to mentally reassuring himself. "Do you have any games? or a phone I can borrow?" asked a shrill voice from the corner of the room. Eradicus turned his 500 tonne body to look the source of the question in the eye. "I do not have any games, I am a demonic undergod can you not see? Please let me concentrate child". Timmy let out a huff and started pouting in the corner, before whacking one of the hellguards on the toe with his wooden sword. The hellguard looked uncomfortable, but as it lacked any organs or vocal cords in its skeletal frame, it was unable to ask the boy to stop. Eradicus gave the hellguard an empathetic look, before going back to switching on the boss room runes. Being an undergod just wasn't worth it anymore.
