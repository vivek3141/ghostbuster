I'm turning 24 in a month and I'm really concerned, please read. I'm a 3L at Harvard, yea fricking Harvard. I studied my ass off to get into here. Harvard, the pinnacle of legal intellect and education. I'm sorry if that came off as brag; I can assure you it wasn't. I studied quite extensively my past three years. I'm graduating next week, in the top 10% of my class. My parents are proud, my friends ecstatic. I'm from a small town in New Jeresy where nothing much happens. Yes I know it's cliche but it's the truth; so when I got my acceptance letter from Harvard I became the talk of the town. Although I haven't yet received my JD, I've already received several job offers from renowned law firms. It seems I'm all set in terms of my career and financial stability. However, I'm feeling more lost now than I ever was.
Here comes another cliche, so please bear with me. I always wanted to pursue a field in graphic design. The way animators seamlessly design intricate characters with such meticulous attention to detail. Drawing is what I consider the quintessential foundation for every artist. However, my draconian parents opposed it. They believed that any career outside of law, business, and medicine would not provide a stable source of income. They also attempted to warrant their decision by stating my "innate talents' would be wasted on graphic design and my brain could be put to better use by studying something like law or medicine. Me being the passive, obedient child, I decided to drop the subject and simply obey them. In retrospect, I wish I studied graphic design back in undergrad. Let this be a lesson to anyone who's reading; if you have the conviction and passion to follow your dreams, don't let anyone dissuade you from your true dreams. Fin.
