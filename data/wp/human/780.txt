*27th December 2016*
Matthew sat hunched on the floor of the shower cubicle. He rocked backwards and forwards on the balls of his feet, his thin arms wrapped tightly around his knees, unable to keep still against the sick, writhing feeling that had settled in the pit of his stomach as soon as he'd laid eyes on Dr Morton's weary face.
*" We have your latest scan back. I'm afraid it's not the news we were hoping for. "*
Matthew was vaguely aware that the slight saltiness of tears was mingling with the shower water running down his face. He took a juddering breath, his shoulders shaking.
*" We've found new cancer deposits in your lungs, liver and brain. "*
*" Wait, what? But- I thought- isn't leukaemia just in the blood? "*
*" You're right - typically, AML doesn't cause a pattern like this. Unfortunately, I suspect in your case the leukaemia began with a rare form of stem cell cancer - there isn't a huge amount of research into it, but cancer stem cells have been found that can turn into any type of cell in the body. "*
*" What do we do?" Matthew was barely even aware of speaking the words through the fog that seemed to have descended over his brain. *
*" I'd like to take some more samples to be really sure of what's going on, and then we'll probably have to start you on some more aggressive chemotherapy. I'll talk you through the treatment options..." *
It felt as though the bright white dots scattered over the silhouette of his body were burned onto his retinas. There had been cancer in almost every major organ. He raised one hand to his stomach, his fingers splayed out over his skin, imagining the little tumour cells dividing just centimetres beneath his palm. His stomach lurched again, and he nearly retched. His fingers were trembling now, and he couldn't help but wonder whether it was from nerves, or the metastases burrowing their way into his brain.
He wondered if it hurt to die.

*18th February 2018*
Matthew pressed the button for the eighth floor. As the lift doors shut, he collapsed back against the wall, letting his legs rest for a few seconds. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and continued to scroll through the paper he'd been reading: another recently published case study on - well - himself. He felt his eyes skimmed across the screen. Between the seemingly interminable sections of incomprehensible medical jargon, random (all too familiar) phrases jumped out at him.
'It was found that ML's cancer cells had essentially replaced his healthy tissue.'
'-first known case of cancer cells differentiating to form relatively normal organs, as evidenced by histopathology that showed that...'
'-kept under control only by radical and frequent chemotherapy and radiotherapy.'
Matthew clicked his phone off, staring for a moment at his reflection on the empty screen. His cheekbones were prominent on his pale face, his temples hollow where the muscle seemed to have wasted away. He missed his thick, brown hair - not least because he'd discovered, to his dismay, that he had a rather unattractively shaped skull. Curse his luck.
The lift binged, and doors opened. Matthew forced himself back onto his feet and followed the now-familiar path to the oncology department.
"The cancer I could cope with if it wasn't for my goddamn potato of a head," he muttered to himself. "Fuckin' sex appeal down the-"
And that was when he saw her.
Well, really all he saw was a figure disappearing through a set of double doors, but it was the figure, he decided, of a long-legged, auburn-haired goddess. It was enough to make him run a self-conscious hand over his lumpy scalp as he sat down in the chair outside Dr Morton's office to wait for his next cycle of chemotherapy to begin.
Over the next few weeks, Matthew discovered a lot more about the auburn-haired girl. She was called Isabel, she was just as beautiful from the front, she was sweet, she was funny, and best of all, she was morally obligated to visit the oncology ward daily to see her father. Was it unethical to hope for a long and drawn-out illness for the father of his crush? Matthew decided that on balance, yes, it probably was, but karma freaking owed him one.
Approximately three weeks, two days, five hours and thirteen minutes after he first saw her, Matthew finally plucked up the courage to talk to Isabel.
"Hi."
Yeah, that was the dazzlingly witty repartee upon which he prided himself.
Isabel looked round in surprise. "Oh, er- hello. Do you need something?"
"No, I just...I've seen you around so I thought I'd say...hi." Matthew could happily have stabbed a long, hot poker through his eyeball, into whichever lobe of his brain was responsible for being so goddamn awkward. Before he really knew what his was thinking, Matthew heard himself say, "I promise I look less like Voldemort when I've got hair."
For some reason, Isabel laughed.

*23rd June 2022*
It was Isabel who first spotted it, when looking over old photographs.
"You haven't aged."
Matthew raised an eyebrow. "You flatter me."
"No, I'm serious." She stared down at the photo, taken six years previously, just before Matthew had first received his cancer diagnosis. "Like, I know you look different and all, from the treatment, but...you don't look older."
Matthew frowned, and scrutinised the photo as well. He cocked his head on one side. "I don't know..."
"Okay, look at this one." She flipped forwards to a slightly later photo, soon after Matthew had begun chemotherapy. She held it up next to his face. "I genuinely can't tell the difference."
Matthew pushed her arm down, laughing. "And that's why I love you," he said, kissing her on the cheek.
But as he glanced at the six-year-old photograph, there was a flutter of unease in his stomach.

*4th November 2022*
The papers were all calling him the immortal cancer patient. 'The turnover of cells is so rapid that whatever harms them (be it cancer treatments, illness or injury), a new generation of cells will soon have grown to replace them.' Immortality, agelessness, eternal youth...they were all terms that had been thrown about.
It didn't feel like it at the moment.
Nausea rose in Matthew's throat, and he retched again, but he all he had left to bring up was bile. His whole body was aching and exhausted, his limbs heavy and his muscles screaming. He wished he could sleep, but there was no way he'd manage it through the pain and nausea of treatment. Even morphine no longer did much more than take the edge off the pain. He wanted to rip the PICC line out of his arm - it made him feel physically sick just to see the carefully titrated dose of chemotherapy dripping through into his vein - but instead, he just collapsed back onto the scratchy hospital pillow, moaning quietly through clenched teeth.
The treatment was relentless. His cancer was too aggressive to leave alone for long, but at the same time, the constantly-shifting clones of cancer cells had become all that was keeping him alive, somehow regulating themselves just enough to perform normal cell functions. If it wasn't the chemotherapy and radiotherapy exhausting him, it was the cancer itself - the constant, energy-sapping growth of cells that took up all his reserves.
The only thing that kept him going was Isabel; even now, she was sitting beside his bed, her fingers loosely intertwined with his. He gripped her hand more tightly in his sweaty fingers. His eyes were half shut, but he could just see her blurred outline past his eyelids. She was wearing her glasses and a pair of old tracksuit bottoms, her hair tangled from when she'd briefly fallen asleep in her chair. She was the most beautiful thing he'd seen in his life.
"Isabel?" His voice was a little croaky.
"Hmm?"
He hadn't meant to ask the question this way - he'd pictured a grandiose gesture somewhere romantic, with her in a pretty dress and himself down on one knee. But somehow, through his fatigue-addled brain, the words slipped out. "Wanna marry me?"

*11th March 2023*
Matthew was crying in the shower again.
She hadn't shouted, she hadn't been angry with him. Perhaps it would have been easier if she had; maybe he could have blamed her if she'd left with anything other than a comforting hand on his arm and a few soothing words.
*" It's not that I blame you, you know it's not. None of this is your fault. It's just..." Tears sparkled in her eyes. "I can't cope with it any more. The hospital visits- they're never going to end. "*
*" Isabel, please..." *
*" And I don't know how make ends meet at the same time as looking after you, it's just too much. And- and I always hoped I'd have a baby, and-" She broke off. *
*" Please..." *
*" I'm sorry, Matthew. You know I love you. "*

*30th April 2024*
He felt so weak. He was constantly in pain, tired and sick. He'd had just about every side effect of treatment that was possible, from nausea to diarrhoea to constipation to shaking to bouts of confusion to freaking sexual dysfunction. And to add insult to injury, after eight and a half years of chemotherapy, his veins were well and truly shot. So he couldn't even consider becoming an intravenous drug abuser.
Whoever said, "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger," was a complete and utter moron, and if Matthew's arms didn't feel like they were made of lead, he'd punch them in the teeth.
"How are you feeling today?" Matthew hadn't even heard Dr Morton enter the room.
He turned dull eyes towards the doctor. "I want to stop my treatment."
Perhaps he was immortal, but the cost of immortality was his life.
