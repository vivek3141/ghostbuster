The air raid siren howled into the air, a desperate yet futile plea to the masses scurrying in the streets like deer running from a forest fire. There was no denying it; our annihilation was at hand.
Unfortunately, the time to flee had long since passed. Within minutes the very world around us would be turned to ash, a toxic wasteland branded onto the face of this doomed Earth.
However, during the chaos I did what those around me could not - I remained calm. The will to live burned brightly inside of me, brighter than the nuclear storm that seemed destined to engulf me. Thinking fast, I gutted the majority of my refrigerator and climbed inside.
It was quiet, almost idyllic. In fact it was rather comfortable - up until the bombs fell at least. I don't remember much after that, other than waking up some time after, still encased in my chilled shelter.
You wouldn't believe my excitement and surprise, although, you needn't bother. My glee was very short lived. While I had indeed survived the onslaught of nuclear rain that had washed over me, it seemed that ultimately, one's fate cannot be so easily avoided.
Protruding from my chest was a large, solid carrot.
For several minutes, pain burned through me. I began to feel faint as my crippled body drained into what was destined to be my cold tomb. After a short time, the pain subsided and a feeling of calming warmth washed over me, my vision fading into an unfocussed blur. My eyes began to close, and as I lost consciousness I couldn't help but think...
...I don't even like carrots.
