You might ask me if all the suffering, all the destruction is worth of our desire to be independent nation. My answer is that our liberty is not a mere whim, but a matter of life and death. We could have lived in a state with a government which treats their people as human beings. But we no longer can nor want to be ruled by monsters to whom a life has no value whatsoever. All they care about are profits from the mining. Noone on Earth bats an eye when a fifteen year old dies ten kilometers below the surface as long as the precious metals keep flowing and an Earth kid has his new gadget for a birthday present. USA has always been a predator, pillaging entire countries with zero regard for those who live in it. They had been holding Mars colonies in iron fist, employing war criminals to keep us in line. They had been promising to make our lives bearable, but alas the agreements with Americans are worth less than a paper they are written on. Therefore, I declare the creation of Independent State of Mars. It's better to die fighting than living on your knees.
