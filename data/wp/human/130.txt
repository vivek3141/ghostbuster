The walk up the driveway is as long and boring as usual. *This is why people have short driveways, * I think to myself, as I finally jog up the steps to my front door. After fumbling with the locks for few moments I enter inside, and smell the familiar scents of home. It always reminds me of Lucy, and it always makes me wonder when she's coming back.
*Is she coming back? *
I shake the thought away as best I can and throw my coat up on a hook before I head down the hallway, past the kitchen and into my study. I'm practically *dreaming* of the butter biscuits I have saved from yesterday, but they'll have to wait. If I don't get this report filed, I'm in deep trouble.
The air is stale in my study, which isn't a great thing. I've been falling steadily behind ever since Lucy left, and I haven't been committing as many hours to work as I should be. Then again, maybe that's why she left me. *John* probably doesn't have a full time job. I bet *John* just vacations 5 days a week on Lucy's dime. The money I won her in the lawsuit is definitely enough to cover that for a few years.
*Could you stop thinking about her for one goddamned second? *
I shake my head again, and decide the butter biscuits are becoming more of a necessity for me than anything else right now. So I drop my work bag off at the desk and walk around the corner into my kitchen, where I stop short as all thoughts of butter biscuits fly from my mind.
There's a white grand piano.
In my kitchen.
There wasn't one before. But now there's a white grand piano in my kitchen nook, right where my table used to be.
"What the fuck," I say aloud.
