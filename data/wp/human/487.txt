"Send orders for Sir Thompson to advance, General."
The King's highest ranking officer bowed deferentially, and turned to pass the order down the chain of command.
"Wait, General."
General Stewart stopped in his tracks, and turned back to face his King.
"Yes, your Highness?"
"If we have to do this 'Battle' malarkey, we do it the British way, or not at all. It's the other chap's turn right now, what what?"
Stewart betrayed his thoughts with a blank look of confusion.
"I...I'm not sure I follow, your Highness."
"And here I was thinking you were a sporting fellow, Stewart! Poor show, poor show. Didn't you just see me order Bishop Allen to the attack? It's only right and proper that the gentleman opposite issues an order next."
General Stewart considered debating the point, but soon thought better of the idea. "As you will, your Highness. I will await the roundhead's next maneuvers."
The King looked quite proudly, and not a little smugly, down at the man.
"Oh, and one more thing, Stewart."
"Your Highness?"
"When you send Sir Thompson his orders, could you...could you tell him to just move...ooh, I don't know. Just move a little bit to the left once he's in place? Just to be proper, of course."
The General sighed. What with the debacle involving a person instructed to wear a miniature castle in the last battle, and now this, the Royalist's hopes in this accursed civil war were looking slim.
