Captain's Log, Recorded from the Captain's Chair.
134 consecutive days searching the Outer Rim have depleted our supplies. All we have left are cup ramen, green beans, cans of black beans, canned oysters, and microwave curry.
This has had adverse effects upon the crew's stomachs and bowels. As such, the Interplanetary Coalition has requested that I keep conduct studies to enhance any future stocking of ships. I'm not entirely sure why it's so hard to understand that half the hold shouldn't be filled with this stuff, but orders are orders. End off the record thoughts.
Begin scientific recording:
One longer log 2.8 inches in length,9 inches in diameter. One shorter stick.3 inches long,.4 inches diameter. Both appear to be of a slightly greenish hue, with specks of black and reddened chili pepper. They have an overwhelmingly foul odor. Consistency is variable. 1 standard Inak of force causes a complete smashing of the logs edges. Yet at the center, 1 standard Inak barely penetrates the hardened exterior.
Four-stomached Hamlian First-Mate Jezolz has had little issue with the change in diet, and is the only crew member who is functioning at full capacity. Third-Mate O'Oa and Doctor Resh, both Pleqas with frontal and rear assholes, have been confined to the sick bay as of 0800 earlier today. The diet and their physiology have caused a more constant, fluid stream. Their excrement has minor expanding properties, and must be linked to the exterior disposal system at all times.
I may be producing a third log. I will conduct more measurements at 1900.
