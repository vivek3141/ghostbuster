The blind pilots fly
And we thank them for the mist,
Thick enough that we remain Sun *un*-kissed
They play the part Icarus;
They *are* him
so that we don't have to be
It's all for our own good
---
*Can't you see? *
---
The Sun burns **hot**, **bold** and **bright**.
What is this thing you speak of, *night*?
What is it that you think you'll see once blinded by the **light**?
You want *prime* proof, trust the trees.
First leaves light, then bark burns,
**We** put them out
The world was not meant to be an urn.
---
It's precipitation, not pollution
An elegant solution.
---
Seek twilight, not darkness
And let the mist soothe your scorched skin.
Leave our shadow if you think it best,
You'll be back again.
Be hateful and ungrateful,
Or thank us;
We are in the right,
But never
**Ever**
Look directly into the light.
