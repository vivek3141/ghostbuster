"What?" I ask, a puzzled look splattered across my face.
"God," the man informs me, "he's dead"
"How? Why? I mean that can't be possible I spoke to him just last night!"
The man hands me a small pamphlet, along with an offer to take back all churchly possessions I may have.
"Your God is dead, what now?" It reads. I shoo the man out and lock my doors.
The television turns on to the news.
"Reports of looting reported worldwide. Prestigious men of religion claiming the end."
Really just salt in the wound, this whole bit. See, scientists have noted a virus spreading. Killing.
I guess It's true, what they say.
The captain really does go down with the ship.
