World building is my favourite aspect of writing, I think. My problem is, I can see the world in my head, so I usually forget to include the details in my stories (I'm working on it though!).
For me, it feels like opening a door that opens to three more doors, than five, and so on. The possibilities grow and multiple until, "hey! I have a world!". When it works out, it's great, but it's easy to get caught up in details and completely miss details that were already established earlier.
After I finish my [Falling From Heaven] (https: //www.reddit.com/r/ItsPronouncedGif/comments/5byu7v/falling_from_heaven_series/) series, I'm going to start writing stories with a separate page open, just to input important details that have happened. Then I can decide later whether or not they will be incorporated later in the story, or were just details that helped in that moment of the plot.
