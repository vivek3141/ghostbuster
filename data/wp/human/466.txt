At the beginning of the 20th Century, when the automobile was still new, gasoline engines were but one of the many technologies vying for dominance. Some early cars were electric, some ran on boilers fueled by burning coal or wood.
When Henry Ford opened his first factory in Detroit, the tri-state region of Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio was coincidentally taking off as a major player in the nascent dairy farming industry. (Michigan is still one of the top ten dairy producers) Prior to the turn of the century, family farms ruled as the modern process of Pasteurization had not yet existed.
It's a little known fact that Henry Ford kept a sizable herd of cows on a farm just outside of Dearborn for the sole purpose of capturing and using the methane produced as a source of fuel. Several Model T prototypes exist to this day with tanks designed to hold compressed methane gas.
Fortunately, the process proved to be more costly at the time than traditional gasoline. If not, we might still be driving around today in cars powered by cow farts.

**EDIT**: I found some photographic proof showing a cow hooked up to a beeswax coated silk bag for methane collection as well as an early prototype of a vehicle with Henry Ford standing next to it. Note the methane tanks on the side of the vehicle near the engine: http: //i.imgur.com/3nuezWc.jpg
