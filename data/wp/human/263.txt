"I can't stand this political nonsense"
Dad threw his paper down on the table, interrupting our otherwise peaceful family breakfast. My sister and I looked up from our bacon and eggs and exchanged looks. We all know where this is going.
"It's just the same crap every year" he grunted in frustration.
"Honey, maybe it'll be better this year," signed my Mom, obviously trying defuse my dad's daily rant.
"It's always the same ludicrous promises," continued my dad banging his fist onto the table, "they never about the real issues. When was was the last fucking time they even mentioned our debt problem!"
"William, the children," warned my mother.
"We only have two choices, and both candidates are clearly corporate sell-outs, nothing more then puppets," dad continued, clearly not stoping his rant for anybody, "what is the point of the democracy if my votes mean absolutely nothing because both sides are such garbage."
Dad had settled down back into his seat sipping his coffee. He always got angry in the mornings, and it's always so amusing to see him so worked up about such silly things.
"When the aliens took over I thought I'd be different, but even if the names have changed and they now look like bloodsucking monsters, apparently politics are universal, even between species."
