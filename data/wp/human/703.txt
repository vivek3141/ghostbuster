I came home at about eleven o clock. I was wrecked. I may have been tipsy, but being fired because they got an Asian man who is OK with being paid less, was a fucking insult. Don't judge, I don't hate Asians, but I wanted to shank the bastard for being such a dick. I can't afford this apartment without a job!! I'm fucked.
And then I saw it.
A baby grand, in my kitchen. Just the one I saw in the window this morning. It was sleek, black and perfectly on tune. I sat down and played Les Miserablés all night, singing my heart out. Only when I awoke the next morning, did I see the note.
> Interested? Maybe I could get you a job...
