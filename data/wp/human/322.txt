I know my roommate pretty well. Well, I guess "knew him", rather since he convincingly killed me and left me for dead without me seeing it coming at all. He only buried me about 3 feet deep. Huge mistake on his part. He even dug my "grave" with a gardening shovel. A spade? Would have been faster to actually stop somewhere and get a real shovel. He was really unprepared for this.
So it's a rushed job (he didn't even do a thorough checking of my vitals). So either it was a very emotionally motivated crime, or he was put up to it very "on the spot". Regardless, when I see him again I'll have to anticipate a very emotional and instinctual reaction.
Two days later, once I've made the proper arrangements, he walks into the same apartment in which we've shared beer and pizza; that he, hours later, dragged out my "not-quite-a-corpse" rolled into our living room rug. His keys drop to the ground as he stares in total shock in the doorway.
"How?" the roommate says softly and very slowly.
I laugh.
"I'm laughing because you've dropped your keys on the floor again, and in 3..2.."
The Roomba turns on, and as though it were malicious intent goes towards the keys and vacuums them up.
"Listen" I say as I slowly swirl my scotch in its' glass on a couch that we both pay for. "I don't know exactly why you did what you did. Frankly I don't care, nor do I foster any resentment. You should know though, the game is on."
I shut the hall light off, walk to my room, and call it a night. Well, I peak my head back out my door at him to say "Abandon all routine or this will be way too easy". I go to sleep. The game is on.
