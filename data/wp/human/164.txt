No.
No, it can't be.
As my fingers begin to ache and her beautiful face begins to turn her favorite color, purple, I realize the mistake I've made.
I see it all.
Her first memory, parents smiling at her in the hospital. Meeting her little brother when he was born. Seeing her grandmother die, and seeing puppies be born. Getting hit in the head with a rock by her best friend, and crying, crying, crying. Falling in love with her upstairs neighbor at 13, and getting her heart broken at 15.
It all goes by so fast...these are just the highlights, I realize. The most important moments. The defining moments.
Meeting me at 16, hating my guts but needing my help on her Spanish homework. Me making her laugh for the first time with some cheesy bilingual joke, and then me asking for her number. Our first date, our first kiss. Our awkward makeout, both of us virgins. Us becoming not-virgins, together, quietly.
My proposal. Us choosing the date, and making plans. Her, meeting the best man for dinner to discuss suits while I stayed late at work. Him, getting her drunk and taking her home. Putting his arm around her and taking her to the bedroom. Trying to undress her. Her saying no.
*Her saying no. *
***Her saying no. ***
It can't be.
But it is.
And it's too late.
