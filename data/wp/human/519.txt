"Um...ahem." I step forward on the podium and feel the attention of at least 5 billion people bubbling beneath the crowd and the cameras.
"People of Am- of Earth...my will is absolute..." *Yes? And? * "...and I feel the time has come...the time...for a new type of leader to...." *Just say something! Anything! * "...grab the world by its hair, and...." *Okay maybe tone down the imagery there* "...and launch it back towards the moon!"
For some reason that was met with smatterings of applause and whoops, and I stood there feeling the sweat from my brow seeping into my eyes.
"This country.... no, this world..." I started, my eyes beginning to water, "...has been a plague on the end of my...shoe...." *Mmm, okay* "...for too long!"
Again there was voracious applause from the crowd, and I grinned weakly at the knowledge that I still had to talk for another fifteen minutes. "Today...I -"
Somewhere in the distance a loud crack echoed through the surrounding trees, and I felt a sharp impact in my chest. Looking down slowly, my hand came up red.
*Oh thank God. *
