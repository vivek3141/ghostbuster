It all started on Halloween. I was an exchange student in Rome and me and some friends had gone out to party. I myself had dressed up as the Holy Father himself, Pope Francis. To be honest I looked pretty darn convincing. I had the glasses and I even had died my hair so that it looked gray.
Anyway, me and my friends went to a few parties and we ended up getting so drunk that we had to take a cab back to our hostel. Unfortunately the cab drive got lost and we ended up somewhere near Saint Peter's. The drive then kicked us out and cursed us in Italian. We then wandered around and decided to just sit on some steps just outside of Vatican City. All of a sudden we saw a man in a black cassock come towards us.
He started talking to us in Italian, and then what I assumed was Spanish. Then he said "Oh Americano. You need help? Come eat with me!" However someone snuck up behind the old man and stabbed him. He then ran off but a group of Swiss Guards chased him down. He was then caught. We then just stood there and watched until one of the guards came up and started talking to us. They then took me away into Vatican City.
"What's wrong?" I asked the guard. I couldn't quite understand what he was saying but I think he said something to the effect of "You can't be doing stuff like this Francis." I then replied. "No signore, no es Francesco" in my broken italian spanglish. The guard then laughed. Just then I saw another Cardinal. I then heard him talk and he was definitely American. "Grazie Francesco. I hope you'll be more careful out there."
"Look can you help me? I'm not Pope Francis. Really i'm not him."
"I see you've been working on your English. Preparing for your next visit to the states eh?"
"No i'm serious."
The Cardinal then walked away. I was then taken to the Papal apartments and then the guard walked away. I then saw the opulence of the apartment and thought to myself "It's good to be the Pope!"
