He ran his fingertips across the smooth surface of the picture. He poured another glass of whiskey, not bothering with the ice any more. In the dim light, it was hard to distinguish his facial features. His hooked nose protruded the shade cast over his face by the baseball cap he had on, 2 sizes too small.
"It would have been his tenth birthday today." He finally broke the silence, his words slurred and his breathe burnt in my eyes. I had lost track of the amount of sips he had taken from the bottle labelled 'The famous Grouse', but judging from the bottle and the empty ones in the corner, I assume he's had his fair share. "After I lost my wife, he was all I have left." He took a long, hard sip from the bottle, he didn't bother to fill his glass any more. When his sentence came to a halt I recognised this man's voice.
*6 months ago*
"Yo man, just drive." Jerome said, his face was covered in blood, the wound on his face didn't look like it planned on stopping the constant stream of fresh blood, pulsing at every heartbeat. "What the hell did they want, man?" My head was cleared a few moments ago by the stream of adrenaline, but I could feel that I was still fairly inebriated. "I don't know man, and I don't want to stick around to find out" Fair point, I thought to myself. As the alcohol in my blood was slowly winning against the adrenaline shooting through my body, I ran a red light. I jolted the steering wheel to the left, as to avoid the traffic. I lost control of the car, brakes where screeching, people were screaming until we came to a halt in the front garden of a small suburban house. "Fuck! Jerome, you okay?" I started "Go man, no time to stick around!" I backed the car out of the driveway and manoeuvred our way through the small crowd of people that started to gather. "My boy! What have you done to my child?" An unknown voice cried as I accelerated away from what just unfolded. No more drinking before 8, I thought to myself.

"Do you remember me?" The suddenly all too familiar man sobbed. "Do you know what you've done?" The man stood up and got his gun off the shelves. I tried to talk to him, explain what went on, apologise, but the duct tape taped around my mouth stopped any words from forming. He grabbed the back of my head, I tried to fight him off but my arms and legs were badly bruised and taped to the chair I was positioned in. "So you understand what has to happen now..."
CLICK. He cocked his revolver, the spring sounded rusty and the barrel hesitant. I was screaming my lungs out, the tape obscured my words and muffled the sound. I heard the trigger being pulled. I was overwhelmed by the feeling of peace as the light slowly crept out of my eyes, my senses slowly faded as my consciousness extinguished.
*** I started writing about something entirely different, but this came out. Fairly new to this, would love some criticism. I feel like I should have described the environment and ambience a bit more, but I don't think I should edit a story I already posted (this being the edit the star next to my name indicates) ***
