Every step, the words thrummed in my head.
*You. Will. Die. By. Your. Own. Hand. *
I clenched my fists, breathing deeply. "Get it together," I muttered as I kept walking through the streets of New York City. It had been 2 days since I had gotten the letter- a typewriter, will those words and nothing else.
*You. Will. Die. By. Your. Own. Hand. *
I laughed at first. Some prankster, I was sure. Besides, I was a happy guy- I had a beautiful wife and a well paying job. I had no reason to kill myself. And it was my fate, regardless; I wasn't going to kill myself just because some letter told me to.
But things were getting more difficult. Sleep was elusive. Work was harder. Those words pounded into my skull with every step, every breath, every heartbeat.
*You. Will. Die. By. Your. Own. Hand. *
I took another deep, shuddering breath. "Come on, come on!" I growled, a bit more loudly than intended. I got a few strange looks from passers-by.
Why was this bothering me so much? It was just a prankster. I wasn't going to kill myself, for God's sake! I was a perfectly sane, well-adjusted man. Not the kind of person to hang himself. To die by his own hand.
I stopped, looking across the street. I just had to get back to my apartment, so I could sit down and have a drink. Calm myself down. I was way over-thinking it. Yeah, just stress. Maybe I could take a week off. Go travel with my wife and forget about that letter. It would be fun.
I stepped out into the street, and was promptly hit by an oncoming truck.
The force threw me a few feet, and I hit the ground with a thud. I gasped for breath, feeling a hundred broken bones, blood pooling around me, pain radiating from everywhere. My heart continued beating weakly, seven more quiet thuds before it stopped.
*You. Will. Die. By. Your. Own. Hand. *
Everyone else had seen the truck coming. Witnesses said the driver could have done nothing, that I was so sudden. It couldn't have been an accident- I should have seen the truck a mile away.
The death was ruled as a suicide.
