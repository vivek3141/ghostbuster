Blood drips red onto the floorboards, seeping through the dark mahogany.
Her eyes, glassy yet dim, like a lightbulb that needs to be changed.
My lips, bloody and gashed as I rip through flesh and sinew.
Flesh. Muscle. Bone. Marrow. Nothing goes to waste.
Each mouthful is a delicacy. Each bite is more desperate than the last.
I savour the taste of her liver, the texture of her still pumping heart as it gushes with the soft velvet touch of blood in my mouth.
Her body twitches still, the last remnant of life seeping out of her. I relish it.
I quiver with delight when I think of what her thighs will taste like, her uterus, the traces of urine in her bladder...But not now.
Beside her, a phone screen lights up, a single text message catches my eye.
"Sara, where are you? What did Megan need help with?"
I leap with delight to answer it, smearing blood on the screen as I do so. My fingernails are soiled and rotting.
"Megans craigslist date ate her alive. She's pretty upset."
"Aww, poor thing. Should I come over?"
"Please do."
"Ok, I gotta finish work, but I'll be there in an hour! see you!"
I can't help but cackle wildly as I toss the phone with reckless abandonment. One more! I can barely believe it! What luck!
I drag her lifeless body over to the other two, the fat mother and the starving daughter.
Their faces are contorted in agony but I could barely tolerate eating either one completely, as their extremities in weight caused the feasting experience to suffer.
As I dump her body onto the heap of meat I can almost swear I hear a breath. A whisper. A quiet whimper from the girl.
Impossible.
I set to rummaging about the house for a mop to clean up the mess as I wait for my next course to arrive.
I whistle while I work. I even sing a little.
Imagine if this funny pattern where to just keep repeating itself.
The unending feast would be unimaginable.
