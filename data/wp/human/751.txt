"Excuse me."
Two words never hit me so hard. I'd responded before I could finish processing. Before we turned around, I knew we'd both stopped.
There he was.
Me.
"What...What's going on?"
"I...nothin?"
"No, I meant...Never mind. This is pretty neat, huh? We're thinking the same thing? You look just like me."
"Bro, YOU look just like ME."
"Fine, fine. I mean, what do we do, right? This is so exciting!"
"I guess...keyswap?"
"Oh, bro. Keyswap. Keyswap so fuckin' hard."
His keys felt light in my hand. He drove a Lexus. I hope my Hyundai handled okay for him. His GPS took me to his house. It sat on top of a hill overlooking the city. I'd never been to this part of town before. Never had the money.
His wife was waiting in the kitchen. The food smelled delicious. It tasted even better. I could tell she wasn't used to being listened to. It's too bad I hardly heard a word. I just couldn't stop staring; she was gorgeous. Great in bed, too.
We met again the next day. Same spot. Same shoulder bump.
"Trade back?"
"Meh. Could go either way."
So we did.
