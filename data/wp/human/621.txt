I look in the empty eye sockets under the unraveling black cloak. I can't believe I'm looking death in the face, or lack there of. But he has no interest in me whatsoever. His scythe rises and I hold my little sister a little tighter in my arms. Why had she been so hell bound on climbing that apple tree anyways? The scythe starts coming down and I yell the only thing I could think of. "Take me instead." I close my eyes tightly until I notice nothing is happening. I look up and see that death's scythe seems frozen in mid-air.
And that's when he speaks with a deep booming voice. "I cannot." As I look confused death takes his scythe back and reaches for my sister with his bones hand.
"Don't touch her." I scream, wrapping my arms even closer around her. But death ignores me as his bony fingers brush through my sister's hair.
"The request of substitution can only be made once per life. Never before I have met a person so loved that two people would die for her." There's almost a hint of emotion in his voice.
I look at him confused. "Two people?"
"You remember your mother?" Death asks, slowly pulling his hand back.
"She died in a car crash. My sister somehow came out a..." Slowly my words trail off as I realize what death meant.
"She wasn't supposed to die in that car. She was." Death points at my sister.
I start crying even harder as I bury my face in my sisters hair, clasping on to her for dear life. Only when I feel a bony hand on my shoulder I look up. I see an actual tear running down death's cheekbone. "Don't worry, I'll personally take care of her." And with that he is gone, and I'm left alone, holding the death body of my sister under the apple tree she just wanted to climb.
