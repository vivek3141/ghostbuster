The camera sat on the table, just waiting for use.
Years had gone by, and temptation grew, thinking about what it knew.
Objects, the only thing it had seen, how could that be?
Seconds and minutes gave a goodbye, I needed to know what it thought of me.
I took a step, a step closer indeed.
I peered over, grabbing it with need.
In front, was a mirror, my reflection beaming.
What would it tell me? Unsure I seemed.
Through the lens, I looked,
How ugly I appeared, nothing like the words of a book.
As invisible as I was, I understood.
The camera I had used, was abused, not as it should.
