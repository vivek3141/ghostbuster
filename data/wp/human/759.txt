It was late at night and i was eating popcorn and binging on shows, the popcorn tasted funny but after a while I became really sleepy, It was almost past 5 and I couldn't stop myself from watching the show.
The TV turned off quickly after a bright light shined from the sky like dominoes, as If it was being shined from a big lamp, I was shocked, I couldn't use anything, my phone was turned off and it wasn't out of charge, I tried using the landline but nothing worked, suddenly a group of military personnel opened the door, I was scared and I tried to talk but before i could've done anything.
*Freeze all motor functions*
*this one stayed up, take him to the camp*
My body froze as if I was paralyzed, but I could see everything they took me in the camp, threw me in a cell like looking room with only a bag there.
I could barely see outside but after a while my body began unfreezing I took a peak outside and saw rows of humans standing in a line in a white lab, they moved so perfectly like they were controlled, each went into a room but I couldn't see anything.
Suddenly another military personnel came, before I could say anything my body started moving, I started wearing my clothes and then went into a shuttle looking vehicle.
*Welcome soldiers*
