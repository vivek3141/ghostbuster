Why did I accept to be a big tree in this play? Can somebody explain it to me because I can't seem to understand my thought process? Oh well, at least I'm not a small tree, now for THAT guy I feel sorry about.
I really think I could be an excellent wolf. I have a voice for that.
I even have the looks.
I am the right person for that role. Nobody else.
But no, they had to put Andrew for that role just because the producer girl has a crush on him.
Seriously, FUCK Andrew.
Look at him. It is his big moment soon. And I'm just standing here waving my head and arms like I'm retarded. And this costume itcheeees like a living hell.
Here comes the Little Red Riding Hood.
ME:" Pssst. Andrew?"
ANDREW: "Shhh, it's my time to shine Peter, you just keep waving with your hands."
*He scoffs at me. *
ME: "Come on man, you know you are not the right one for this role. You suck at acting. Do you even remember your words?"
ANDREW: "Shut up Peter, I'm trying to concentrate. Shut up and keep waving with your ugly head. It is the best thing you can do."
ME: "Oh really?!"
*That sentence made my blood boil. I knew what has to be done. *
ME: "Hey Andrew! Watch and learn."
*Little Red Riding Hood picks up a flower and smells it. That is a part when the wolf comes in. *
*Andrew jumps from the bush and howls like the lamest, most mentally challenged young wolf I have ever heard. He then stops and tries to deliver his line. *
*But before he managed to pull that off I made one step forward and yelled. *
ME: "Well well well, who do we have here? A young girl lost in the woods?"
*They are both shocked. Andrews face is slowly turning red. *
ANDREW (whispering): "Dude what the fuck are you doing?!"
ME: "Can't you see? I'm stealing the show."
*Girl looks at the crowd with her mouth open, trying not to cry from shame. Slight chuckle from the crowd can be heard. *
ME: "What's the matter wolf? You have lost your tongue? After all, what are you doing here? You should not be here."
GIRL (whispering angrily): "Peter, can you please stop doing whatever you are trying to do?"
ME (whispering): "No. This guy doesn't deserve to have this role. *I* deserve it! Nobody else!"
GIRL: "Why do you have to be such an asshole?! You are ruining the show!"
ME: "I don't care anymore, you can leave if you don't like it. Or tell this guy to leave the stage and I'll replace him."
ANDREW: "WHAT?! You know what? Keep doing that, I'll continue with my act...Khm...
Good morning Little Red Riding Hood! Where are you going so early?"
*girl stops for a moment and wonders what she should do but rolls with him. *
GIRL: "I am going to my grandmotherÂ´s house to take her this little basket with some bread and honey."
*I grab the basket from her hand and spill all the contents on the floor. Balls of paper fall off. *
ME (facing towards the crowd): "See?! She is a LIAR! She obviously isn't going to her grandmother, isn't she?!"
*I face towards the girl*
ME: "Tell them young girl, where are you *really* heading? Go on. People are waiting!"
*Girl runs off the stage in tears. Crowd starts making noise, somebody from the front rows starts yelling at us. *
ANDREW: "See what you have done, Peter? Do you see that? You have ruined the show! Fucking asshole!"
*Andrew pushes me hard enough that I fall to the floor and leaves the stage. *
*Crowd is going mad now. I can hear yells all around me. Telling me rude things. Somebody throws a bottle at me. I sit there, silently watching chaos growing in front of me. *
*I chuckle. Then I laugh. Laugh turns into a histerical laugh. I get up. Spreading my arms.
ME: "DID YOU ENJOY THE SHOW?!!"
*Whole auditorium is in a mess. Some guy jumps at the stage and runs at me. I face him, look him straight into his eyes, silently, without moving. *
*He tackles me. I am falling. We both are. He proceeds to punch me in the face. One fist then another. Left. Right. Left. Right. I can feel blood on my face. I laugh at him. I keep laughing as he punches me. *
*Then, finally through his fury, he notices my reaction. He suddenly stops. His eyes are wide open. He gets up. Looks at me for a few more seconds while my bloody smile laughs its ass off at him. He runs away. *
*Then I fade out. *
*I wake up another day at the hospital. Nurse hands me the paper. I look at the seal. It is from my school. I am expelled. Good. *
*Later that day I leave the hospital. I stop in front of the building and take some time to think. *
ME: "New day, new victim."
REAL ME: "Goodbye Peter."
*I fly away into the darkness. *
*The hunt is on. *
