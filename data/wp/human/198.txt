"*ZEEEEEEEETAAAAA! *" Yells echoed everywhere around me. Xera, the queen herself, was out looking for the girl, too. Well, I suppose that you'd assume she would look for her own daughter. Vengeance light up her eyes, and I knew that whoever had taken the princess would not get off very easily. Usually, when someone went missing, we would wait a day or two to see if they showed up. This time, the Guard was called immediately and a search was started. Someone had taken the princess, and that wasn't a petty, forgettable crime.
Ranging up and down the foothills, I could find no tracks of any kind. Quite literally, the kidnappers had left no trail. Possibly, they'd run off through the trees, but it seemed unlikely that they could do that carrying the 100 pound princess. Over every hill, there was nothing but the empty forest to greet me and taunt me. No signs of any disturbance. Moreover, the sky was beginning to darken, and the trail would go cold, soon. Lazily drifting, I plodded along the path until I found a tree that looked capable of supporting my weight and providing a comfortable night's rest. Kicking off my shoes, I prepared to climb. Just as I placed my hands on the trunk, I noticed a shining piece of fabric caught in a branch, higher up. Impossible.
Half excited, half scared, I climbed the tree. I observed the fabric closely. Gold griffins looked up at me, sewn into the fabric with an expert's hand. Feeling it confirmed that it was silk, and upon a moment's thought I remembered the design on the princess's dress. Excited for the thrill of the chase, I took off to tell the King I'd found a clue. During my reckless flight, though, I tripped and crashed into the ground. Catching my breath slowly, I stood up. Blood was everywhere, and I knew none of it was mine. At my feet was the princess.
