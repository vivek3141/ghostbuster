Hi! My name is Jack. I was a reporter for the "Daily News". I say I was because I quit about an year ago. You see right before I quit, my crew- me and my buddies, we were doing a report on hospitals. Strangely I don't remember which one my friends' idea it was to do a report about the toothpastes doctors used - of course now I know that it might even have been mine or none of us.
See, the results for our three *different* teams was always nine out of ten doctors using Drexco. Something fishy was going on (our team was a bit lax but three is not coincidence). I went back in research room. Sure enough! There was the same trend in the past, though the brands differed- sometimes it was Colgate, sometimes Sensodyne and now it was Drexco.
I became obsessed with this survey. I stopped going to work and started researching the *Internet*. Boy, I admit I was surprised to find similar results about every brand imaginable under god's green earth.
Then one day I got an email from a Dr. Morpheus. I met him at an old barn where he gave me two pills- blue and red. You see where I am going with this. I thought so too. Everything made sense. Unfortunately, I got roofied.
PS- Don't believe *random strangers* on the *Internet* and oh, those just biased results. I believe they say so in ^^^^^^very ^^^^^^small ^^^^^^writing
