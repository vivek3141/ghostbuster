To everyone,
We can say I was never right after Mom died, that he death was the start of mine. The weekend drinking gatherings turned into all week drinking binges. I'm sorry for it all, but that's not why this letter is here. It's to remind you all that despite doing nothing to help me, I still love you all. I was the one who had to take care of her arrangements, the one who was there for years, holding myself back so that *someone* was around for her, so she wasn't alone when she died.
I can't stand what everyone had become and drinking was an attempt to escape it all, escape all of you. You all came to me when things started to go downhill for all of you and you expected me to save you from drowning while my head was under the water the whole time. I haven't been that solid rock, that shoulder to cry on, for a very long time.
The sad part is no one noticed.
But you'll notice this. It'll probably be a few days before you do, because none of you call, stop by, or even text, but you'll notice. I expect it all the crumble for all of you because you could never stand on your own, always relying on Mom or myself to help you, but now that both of us are gone, I hope the worst happens.
