I stare at the retreating figure of the witch who had just cursed me.
I feel the cold spread from the lump of ice now in place of my heart.
Did she seriously just do this so I can't love again? Love doesn't create *actual* heat.
"Bitch don't you understand the laws of thermodynamics?" I shout after her slowly fading form.
I see a minute shrug as she disappears from my eyeline and give out a weak gurgle as I fall to my knees. As the floor rises to greet my face, it occurs to me that she doesn't much understand the laws of biology either.
