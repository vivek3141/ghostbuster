I've been addicted to salt since the butterfly dropped Paris on its heels, my small town is your belly hacked wide open. Public office is a doorstep to insanity, my bruised smart phone case may be replaced using federal funds, I'm waiting in the lobby of a patriarchal badger body that doesn't see me as an unequal. I'm a women inside, I'm not a man. My apology is sincere, the time is right, I'll backpedal on earlier statements, I just needed the moment to address the discrimination within our communities. Hackberry refused to address my concerns, the faith based community that is owned by corporate heavyweights will affect key decisions. I continue to propose an integrated dinner request via Facebook and cross my fingers. My Chevy is done, newspaper bits and kicked up dust flail into my mouth, the bus left just. I'm going to change my sex and the local government is going to pay for it. I break off a piece of Salt and mash it into a breathable stripe of cane dust. My heart goes out to the city of love just before my eyes spin back into their cage of pus and red.
