The crows circled overhead.
They were pests around these parts, having long since learned the trick behind the scarecrows, and keeping them out of the wheat and corn fields was a chore all on its own. Papa always seemed to have some new idea, but the hope that his daughter would prove just as resourceful died with him.
That old yellow dog didn't help at all either - his tired bones couldn't keep up with those miniature buzzards - but his bark was always a reliable warning signal that someone was approaching. I watched the truck come down the dirt path onto my property; it must have been that man Miss Gertude was talking about sending my way. We're a decent distance off the beaten path, so it made sense only someone with directions could find their way here.
The man who climbed out of the truck was surprisingly young, with a neatly trimmed beard and strong arms that caught my eye as he pulled out his toolbox.
"I hear you're going to set me up with one of those animatronic scarecrows. Those winged rats are gettin' on my last nerve."
He smiled a dazzling smile. "We'll get rid of your troubles, don't you worry, miss."
I led him into the cornfield where the scarecrow stood. "Now I don't fancy putting a generator out here that'll be clattering all day long. Is there some way to make it a quiet scarecrow that moves?"
"I don't know." He replied, a bit flatly.
I turned to regard him. "Well you're supposed to be the expert here. Aren't you?"
"No."
His toolbox crushed my skull as easily as I could crush a tomato. Old Yellow barked his complaint from the porch.
The crows circled overhead.
