"Floride!" I exclamed. That was the answer. It must have been suppressing the bacteria into a dormant stage all these years. Patient zero had bad hygiene, was pretty isolated far from civilization, but was around people when the we were all exposed to the bacteria. Though the early victims might have been through contact it was only once we lost running water that the number of infections exploded. I asked "What are we going to do?"
Dr. Fredbotvonick smiled and said. "We fluoridanate water in the river, then we fluoridate water in all river."
I had 17 shotgun shells from my dad's closet left (Bambi you did not die in vain), a small plastic can of gasoline for the scooter, a container of sodium fluoride.
"Are you coming?" I asked
"I cannot. This is your job. Your fate." Fredbotvonick said, "I need to rest." I saw the stack of local anesthetic at his desk and immediately understood.
