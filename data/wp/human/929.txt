Macdillion sat at his desk fiddling with the controls to the American nuclear arsenal. He didn't swear but felt tempted to then. Everything was in disorder-his fine, pianist fingers, his memorabilia of the World Wars and the struggle to liberate the world from itself was trashy. Chaotic. Disgraceful. He glanced up and glowered at the next peon to roll in.
"What?" he demanded, scrabbling the nuclear control in his sticky hands, hating the rough feel and smell of it. "I might kill you if you don't have a good answer for me."
The peon stuttered.
"Talk. I won't kill you then. Calm down." Macdillion reasserted control over himself and set the control down.
"Sir, there's a spy in the base!"
"And?" he demanded. His servants never told him enough and he suspected they hid things from him.
"He's after you! He's killed the guard!"
"Send security after him then. It's not as if we don't pay the louts enough. What else has he done then? Why haven't I heard any of this?"
"Security's gone!" The servant twisted his fingers alarmingly. "All of them, dead on the ground! The wires been cut and the cameras are all out. We've been trying to contact you sir, I promise, but he came in like a bolt of lightning and chopped us off! Look!"
He thrust a computer screen up for Macdillion to look at. Macdillion gazed balefully at the screen.
He pulled out a gun and shot in one solid motion. The servant flopped onto the ground and spilled blood on the expensive carpet. Macdillion sighed, and sat down.
"Computer, run Windows Antivirus. Some damn fool downloaded pornography again."
