"Happy Birthday, Lucifer."
I hunched my shoulders, closed my eyes and took a deep breath. Only one person knew it was the anniversary of my creation and that was my creator.
"Thank you" I turned to look at him, Him, the Almighty God. He hadn't changed one bit. His presence filled me in a way my eons of sin never did, I felt whole."
"I have a gift for you Lucifer, but you have to choose, you can come home or..."
"Or?
"I will admit that I was wrong, that you were right when you left. You can only have one. Which is it?"
