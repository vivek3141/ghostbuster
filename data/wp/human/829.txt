TIFU By...Just read the story...
Firstly, I'm gonna say that this happened at oh, 4am on Christmas. I was half dead from exhaustion, and I think I was beginning to see things. Or, in this case, I was beginning to miss things that would've otherwise been plain as day.
So, as I said, it's 4am. I'm running really low on Christmas cheer at this point, and I still have to do another four states before I can go home and crash. I head down to the next house on my list. Chimney's a snug enough fit, but I manage it. I got inside, no kids asleep on the couch (you wouldn't believe how many times that's happened), cookies (stale and thin, but anything besides the usual diabetes on a plate is fine by me at this point) and milk by the fireplace as expected. Smooth sailing, right?
Wrong.
The first foul-up came when a man I can only assume was the dad came downstairs from his room while I was putting the presents around what I thought at the time was their Christmas tree--in retrospect, the lack of lights and decorations should've been a bit of a red flag. An adult comes downstairs, and we stare at each other for a solid minute. No noise, no movement, if it were a movie you'd think it froze. Then the guy starts screaming and throwing everything he could reach at me, calling me a thief and a burglar and a bunch of other stuff. Now I may be jolly but if you call me a thief, I'm gonna show you exactly how much muscle you can gain hefting a big-ass sack full of random toys around all night.
Then the rest of his family came downstairs, turned on the light...and it turns out I'm wailing on the patriarch of a Jewish family. That crappy tree? A menorah. The crappy cookies? Matzo wafers. I guess the father had gotten himself a midnight snack, which also explains the milk...and I just beat the hell out of him in front of his family. I hightailed it out of there and crossed two states before realizing I left the toy sack back in the house.
