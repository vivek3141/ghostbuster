There's someone in my head but it's not me
It doesn't snarl nor bite
Instead latches onto my worries
And sucks them pink
There's someone in my head
Whom I let in
She likes to pretend
That soon I'll be dead
She pulls me away
From the horror of life
And brings me back
To my comfy little bed
She doesn't like company
But still talks to me
And tells me of stories
Hopeless and dark
I'd like to evict her
But know I'd need
Those tiny white pills
Of that she's afraid
There's someone in my head
She's swallowed me whole
I can't walk away now
I'm in too deep
There's someone in my head
With whom I've fallen in love
For she cares for me
When no one else will
There's someone in my head
Pulling the gun towards my mouth
She pries my mouth wide
And pulls my finger on the trigger
Even after this act
I still love her
For she's my only comfort
In death.
