I remember vividly the day that it happened. I was driving through a nasty storm in a dense forest, when suddenly a bright light flashed through my windscreen! I was blinded! I lost control of the steering and knew it was the end, and for some unknown reason I shouted "Jesus take the wheel!" I don't know why I said what I said, but maybe it saved me in a way.
I survived the crash… If you want to call it that. The car was parked on the side of the road. But, then I noticed I was in the passenger seat. Had I parked the car and moved to the passenger seat? But, I couldn't have. The engine was still running, and I would have remembered! I thought, Maybe I should get some sleep before I DO crash. I turned to the driver's seat to turn the ignition off. But then the true horror revealed its self! The Devil himself was sitting in the driver's seat!
After a good solid minute of screaming and trying to get out of the car, he said, "Will you stop that now!?" The realisation came to me that I wouldn't be getting out of the car any time soon. So I looked over. He was also looking at me. He had two black horns sticking out of his red head. They were rather sharp. His teeth as yellow as a banana! His dark red hand with sharp purple finger nails where resting on the steering wheel. "Wha… What… do you want?"
"I want YOUR services!" The devil smirked. "If you accept you can go on your merry way. If you so choose not to… Well let's just say you won't be making it out of this forest tonight." Just then an image flew into my mind. It was of a body. My body! It was in a lake, the entrails everywhere! It scared me more than it should have.
Now a great way is happening and I have managed to sneak out of the Devils reaches.
