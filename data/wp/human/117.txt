My name is Joshua Jerky. I am an actor that is employed by the government to "work" at Nevada Test Site more commonly known by its illuminati pseudonym Area 51. I just drive to the secret base and make it look shit is happen when it really isn't. My employer told me we do this, because it prevents from the actual illuminati to take of the world. I'm not quite sure what this means. However, I do feel like we at Area 51 are illuminati.
What my co-workers and I do is basically nothing, so we just goof off and send some made up sci-fi bull shit to the history channel. Believe or not, they took it and made it into a real show! The history channel really liked our stuff, so they hired us while on the job at Area 51. We became billionaires by the end of that year.
