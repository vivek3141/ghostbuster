When I was a young boy, my father and I went into the city on a cold winter day. He told me never to go to the city alone, but that it was important I see what happened there.
As we entered through a large, ornate blackend iron gate, I began to ask how that could happen to metal but hushed me and told me not to speak until he spoke to me. I nodded meakly and we continued into the city.
There were scores of people lining the streets, but no one made a sound. The silence in a city so large was eerie at best. Even as a child I knew something was wrong. Once again I began to ask my father our purpose but he shushed me once more. Then I heard it.
From what seemed like a great distance, music began to play. But not any kind of music I had heard before. It grew in volume exponentially fast, covering what seemed like miles in mere moments. Then they turned onto the street we were standing to the side of.
What I saw would later be explained to me as the black parade. It was led by a marching band, but something was wrong with their instruments. Every chord and note seemd sour somehow. Behind them were scores of soldiers, all armed to the teeth and dressed in black combat gear. Once they had passed my father and I swiftly left the city.
Once we got home, he told me about the black parade and why it existed. There were things in this world which needed to be contained and controlled. He said that because I was his first born son, that one day when I was older I would need to become a savior, someone who could bring salvation to those who were broken and dammed. That I would join the Black Parade. Today is day 421 of my march, and the music plays on.
