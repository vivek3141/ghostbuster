/u/Silverspy01, /u/NeonShockz, /u/StormsAndWolves, and /u/JulienBrightside approached the village, and /u/Silverspy01 let himself relax. He wouldn't tell the others, but the plants had scared him. He knew nothing about them, and he hated not knowing. Well, they couldn't get him here. Cookies would help everyone. Approaching the central square, /u/Silverspy01 saw a crowd listening to a lone man. Another survivor must have showed up while they were gone. As /u/Silverspy01 came closer, he began to notice more details. The man was shirtless, covered in scars. Specially displayed was a large "R" carved into his chest, from the looks of it recently. The ring finger on the left hand was also missing. By the look of it this man had been in a bad situation. But who was he? /u/Silverspy01 began to shove his way to the front of the crowd. "Excuse me, pardon me, sorry, coming through." As he got to the front, he slowed and came to a stop. Standing before him was an impossibility. Someone who he had thought dead, and one of the worst inhabitants of the old world. This was not possible. He had seen the death himself.
"/u/Braz-dur?!"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -
Reknor stood up. "WHO SAID THAT?!" he roared, rage twisting his features. Townsfolk scattered at his sudden rage and reformed at the edge of the square. Leaving one man, and his three companions.
"I did." the one at the front spoke. "I am /u/Silverspy01. I built this town for peace. You are not welcome here.
"/u/Silverspy01?" Reknor grinned. "Just who I was waiting for." With that, he leaped at /u/Silverspy01, knocking him to the ground. One of /u/Silverspy01's companions raised his hands, static electricity beginning to build up. A bolt of lightning arched towards Reknor, only to dissipate midair. Reknor got his hands around /u/Silverspy01's throat and tried to squeeze. But for some reason, /u/Silverspy01 remained unaffected. Another bother tried to attack him with a knife with a cry of "protect the king! ", but tripped and fell. Abandoning /u/Silverspy01's throat, Reknor stood up as if to stomp on him. But yet again, and invisible force seemed to block his kicks. Reknor glanced around, and saw a woman standing off to the side, looking around uncertainly. When she saw Reknor looking at her, she began to raise her gun. She was too late. Reknor grabbed it out of his hands, turned back to /u/Silverspy01, and squeezed the trigger...only to misfire. Cursing his luck, he ran back at /u/Silverspy01 intending to beat him with his bare hands. But yet again he was repelled.
Reknor wasn't stupid. He knew that some other entity was a part of this, one who seemed to be more powerful then Reknor. He doubted his Nors would be much good either. But they could still hide and plan. It was always good to have a secret weapon. Givign one last snarl, he turned and fled the village. /u/Silverspy01 seemed to be protected, but no protection was invincible. All he would have to do was find its weakness.

/u/NeonShockz watched Reknor run away. "Should we go after him?" he asked, his hands still crackling with electricity.
/u/Silverspy01 got up and dusted himself off. "No," he replied. "You saw how easily he attacked us. The protection only works inside the village, and I would hate for him to kill me. As much as I hate it, our best bet is to stay here for now. I would like to thank you two for trying to help me." At this he nodded towards /u/NeonShockz and /u/JulienBrightside. "And of course /u/StormsAndWolves must have known about the protection in place and decided not to waste bullets." Now, I wonder how /u/Braz-dur came back...I was sure he was dead. But I suppose it wouldn't be the strangest thing that's happened in the last few days.
