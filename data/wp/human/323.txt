*Crack*. A large section of an old wall came crashing down. Dust and debris flew everywhere, a beam of water sprouted from somewhere, and yelling could be heard coming from upstairs.
‘ What the hell is going on down there? Phil? PHIL? Are you okay? ’
Phil shook his head, coughed a few times, patted his limbs, checking whether they were all there, and made his way towards the stairs. A loud ringing noise filled his ears.
‘ Yeah, yeah, I'm okay, fine, nothing to worry about. It's just a piece of old— ‘
He fell silent, as he saw something amidst the mist of dust. A faint green light, blinking slowly, irregularly. Phil took out his flashlight from his utility belt and flipped the ‘ on'switch. No light.
‘ Goddamn batteries. Should have bought the top brand. Where are the spare— ‘
‘ PHIL! Do I need to come down there?'interrupted the voice from upstairs.
‘ No no, it's okay. It's just, the flashlight. Its, uhm, batteries— ‘
Phil looked at the light again. It had started to blink more rapidly, and appeared to have moved a bit towards him. He felt the urge to meet it halfway, as if it was a love long lost, with who he finally reunited with. *Hug me, want me, kiss me, so close now, yes, almost, here, please, yes, YES, YEEESSS!!! *
* * * * *
Phil regained consciousness, and Matt was standing over him. His mouth moved, but Phil heard no words, just the ringing sound. It had not faded. Phil never noticed it before, but Matt only had one green eye. *Curious, looks good on him though. Mysterious. Goes great with his fingers. Always liked that tentacle look, bet his wife appreciates the possibilities too. *
Slowly sound came back to Phil, and he could make out what Matt was saying.
‘ Nakz-hal retk-ii. Nakz-hal retk-ii! NAKZ!! NAKZ!!! ’
Matt's eye had started to shine, like a blinking star. Bright green. First slowly, then rapidly.
Phil looked down at his body, and wondered where his legs went.
