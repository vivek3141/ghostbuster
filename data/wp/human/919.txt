The smell of roses, stepped on but fresh, permeated the air. She wanted them fresh above anything else so that you couldn't smell the sweat and the hate rising up from below. Even as she walked down the aisle, reaching the summit of her life, she could feel her back blister with the angry gazes of her fiance's family. So willingly they all came, enticed with promises of free booze and food (in that order), that she actually thought for a moment that everything, her sister, the legal battle, the *fucking* disposable cell phone, was behind them, forgotten. But now their daggers pelted the wedding dress her mother had worn, eating away at it faster than the moths living in the closet had. She was so caught up in her own thoughts that she almost missed her cue.

Except for his first, none of them had begged. He loved groveling, the way people came up with petty, untrue compliments in their last moments to see if they could delay the inevitable. He relished it. Recorded it, in fact, that first time. He didn't like watching himself on camera but damn, hearing that bitch blubber incoherently about how she'd pay him all the money she had, give him sexual favors, she wouldn't press charges, blah blah blah. Smiling from beneath the mask, he watched her plump face, coated in blood, slowly realize that she was not leaving. Ever. Stoic, he explained how her body would be dismembered systematically, fed to various animals, and how those animals in turn would be killed and eaten all over the country. No trace would be left, and she would be forgotten. His path was now cleared. He asked her if she understood everything as he had said it.

The call came in early, earlier than the chief was prepared for. Trying to compose his voice was the second hardest thing in the room. Paid in full, the girl (not a woman yet, but legal enough) was giving him his money's worth just with her mouth. The legal battle was over, the husky voice on the other end said, (suck, suck) and the girl was back home with her fiance. They were getting married next month (long, chilling lick). Before he could ask about the disposable, the other voice said it had been lost from evidence somehow, and that the sister was also nowhere to be found (she found his balls! ha! So that's what $500 got you nowadays). He clicked the phone off and thrust his girth to the back of her throat, and as he came, he wondered, how could someone marry their sister's killer? Then he looked at the girl and asked her if she had anything left in her, because he had more money.
