Oh, you know I miss you,
When your body's cold and dead.
You know I miss your misery,
Back when we wore your red.
Oh, you know I miss you,
I miss your heart and soul.
The way it tasted in my mouth...
Beautiful, salty, and cold.
My friend, my foe - my future wives -
The ones to whom I pledge,
To never leave a stone unturned,
Or leave you hanging on a ledge.
I know in life we disagreed:
You thought I was insane.
But please, excuse my temperament,
For it only affects my brain.
Come on, I gave you life's great thrill!
To die in horrid fun!
I gave all that I could give in life,
Yet still, from me, you run.
At times this world does not make sense,
With its twisted moral rights.
Yet when I had the most of fun,
Was in our heated verbal fights.
Oh, you know I miss you,
And the pain you made me feel,
When you fled from my fleeting offer of death,
And I had to catch you by the heel.
Oh, you know I miss you,
Despite what you do to me.
You don't take the love I offer you;
Is it because death is free?
