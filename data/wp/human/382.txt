The nearly comical gasp that came from everyone on the plane was almost like the cheesy soundtrack that accompanies 90s sitcoms. It could have been funny had I not gasped in horror along with everyone else. The familiar notification icon lit up in the lower corner of my vision.
ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED:
The Final Countdown
My heart skipped a beat.
Suddenly highlights from my life were playing across my vision - my first kiss, my wedding, the birth of my son, that weekend we stayed in bed watching movies and laughing together.
Everyone knew what this achievement was. It was one of the only ones that each and every one of us would experience one day.
The plane began to shudder as everyone closed their eyes and focused on their favorite moments.
At least when this software was invented they made sure that the phrase "life flashing before your eyes" really meant something.
