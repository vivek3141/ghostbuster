"Only three days! The world tour wasn't for another month!" His wife said.
"I know." The soon to be blind man replied.
"How could they not know?" She asked, now pacing up and down the living room. "How can you be so calm about?" She asked, looking at him with his hands folded on the couch.
"I guess it hasn't sunk in yet." He replied, idly twiddling his fingers. "Or maybe I don't want to spend the last three days freaking out."
"You're right." His wife said, stopping her pacing. "I'm sorry." She sat down next to him and put a hand on his leg. "Do you know what you want to do? We can go absolutely anywhere. I'll call in sick first thing tomorrow morning and we'll take the whole week to do whatever you want."
"You know swee-"
"Anywhere at all, we can go see the pyramids, the grand canyon. Go SCUBA diving on the great barrier reef. Well maybe that's too far."
"Sweetie-"
"Seriously, it doesn't matter, the world is our clam. Or whatever the phrase is. I know you always wanted to go to Iceland, it's pretty gorgeous. We could stop by Ireland, then see Stonehedge. Anything at all."
"Stop." The husband said. "I've got three days, and there's only thing I want to remember when it all goes black." He said, reaching out to touch her face. "Only one thing."
