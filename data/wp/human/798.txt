Joe had had enough of Karen's shit.
Karen looked around frantically for somewhere to hide.
"Kids, get in the pantry," she said in a quavering tone.
Davis and Cameron weren't fast enough. They watched as their mother's jaw was broken by an ex-marine they called "Dad". Blood and teeth hit the floor before she did.
Suddenly, something crashed through the window above the sink, and landed on the kitchen island. It was a large candy cane. It popped off just below the curved part. Joe, who was already stunned by what he had just done to his wife and mortified by the blood spattered faces of his adopted children, looked at the tube with mortal fear in his eyes. The kids, who had been staring at their mother quietly, walked into the pantry and closed the door.
Joe picked up the hollow candy cane and turned it upside down. A small scroll fell out, which he unrolled with shaky hands.
"*I'm making a list and checking it twice. *
*I always find out who's naughty and nice. "*
Joe shuddered with the sudden realization that his life would be over soon. He shook out the rest of the cane's contents. A lumpy Christmas present.
*" To: Joey*
*From: Santa" *
Joe ripped it open. Inside was his stocking from when he was a child. Coal spilled out onto the torn wrapping paper. The hair on the back of his neck stood up as the stocking burst into flames and churning black smoke filled the kitchen.
"Kids.. Stay in the pantry."
He stepped over Karen's wasted frame. Her jaw was disfigured and her open mouth was leaking blood. Her eyes were still open.
The sound was faint at first, then began to grow louder and louder.
*'Jingle jingle jingle...Jingle jingle jingle...'*
There was a shotgun above the mantel. He made his way into the living room...
*'JINGLE JINGLE JINGLE JINGLE JINGLE'*
But it was too late.
***CRASH!!! ***
Through the window looking out to the street to the left of the fireplace crashed the first reindeer, and seven more came a hundredth of a second later, knocking over furniture and bits of the wall along the way. They filed into the hallway at immense speed, staring at Joe with glowing red eyes that would light the darkest night.
***BOOM***
Santa's sleigh crumbled his living room wall. An out of tune guitar he got for Christmas on his 7th birthday was knocked over and crushed within a second, making a terrible sound.
There he was. A formidable man with a long beard, wearing red and white. Liam Neeson, who had taken the throne of Santa Claus one year prior, reached into his never ending sack and pulled out an AK-47. The last thing Joe heard before joining his wife in a pool of blood on the ground was,
*" You're on the naughty list. "*
***KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA***
Bullets tore through Joe, making holes like Swiss cheese. Nick knacks and dishes exploded in the kitchen behind him as he fell unceremoniously next to his wife and gazed into her cold, lifeless eyes, his vision fading slowly to black.
*" Ho. Ho. Ho. *"
Edit: used the same word twice in two sentences.. oops.
