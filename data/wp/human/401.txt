This quilt, that my mother made,
Still makes me think to this day.
It's softest brown, and brightest blue,
The curved stitch here, reads "made it May".
It's hard to see, but believe me it's true,
That's not just a cloth but a piece of shirt.
You can see a logo here, and right there,
And a signature over there, someone named "Bert".
This is my favorite part, a piece from a stuffed bear.
I think it was my mother's favorite too,
She always said so at least.
Something from when she was two,
Given by her grandad for Thanksgiving feast.
My dad added this, a little button pin,
Something from his mother, for being a scout.
Apparently she went to a store and fished in a bin,
Until night that day, to teach him what love was about.
I'm sorry you had to see this,
but their funeral was delayed.
