Sometimes I wonder how i manage to make ends meet. individual customers are few and far in-between, and they don't really have much reason to come, after all, wireless internet is everywhere nowadays. However the few that do come are the few truly understand why internet cafe's are important.
I guess you can say that it's more of a social lounge rather than anything else. Of course, there are some people who just come to watch porn, but the majority are here to talk, play games, and have a good time all around. Over the past few years, we've held events, and viewing parties, but that never brings in much revenue. People just want a space to have fun with others, and that's what internet cafes do.
