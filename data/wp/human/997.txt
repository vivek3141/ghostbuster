"Oh God, is it Gang Day again already?" asked Mimi. I hadn't heard her this disgusted since we stepped in roadkill that had dragged itself up onto the sidewalk.
"I don't know," I said, as we walked past the multicolored, glittering display booths on our way to the cafeteria. "I've always kind of liked Gang Day."
Above the nearest booth, a bright red banner displayed its message in blocky yellow letters: *ARE YOU A BAD ENOUGH DUDE TO JOIN THE DRAGON NINJAS? *
"Look," I said, pointing at the Dead Pandas table. "Those guys even offer you a free gun when you join."
"You ever think there might be more to life than slaughtering one another in the streets?" asked Mimi.
"Sounds like somebody's been playing Hippy Simulator 2036," I said. "You know as well as I do that gang violence is the only thing keeping overpopulation in check. And anyway, it's loads of fun."
Mimi pursed her lips. "C'mon," she said, dragging me away, "let's go get our meat cubes."
"Taco-flavored Thursday," I proclaimed, sweeping my left arm in a wide, epic arc. "Truly the best day of the week."
Behind us, a dispute over brochure distribution tactics boiled over into enthusiastic fisticuffs between neighboring booths. I paused to watch--it looked like the Serpents had the upper hand, but then the Black Death recruiters produced a couple of wicked switchblades--but Mimi pulled me away before I could see any more.
