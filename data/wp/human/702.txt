"Will you marry me?" asked the boy, heart in his throat.
The girl was shaking, not in excitment or passion, but with horrible seething rage. She covered her mouth to hide the foaming.
"I can't believe this..." she said.
"You have made my life better in every way." he said.
Her eyes began to twitch. Vivid visions of every attempt she made to ruin his life flashed before her blood shot eyes. Why? Why try anymore? Perhaps this was the universe telling her something.
"...and I want you to be my wife." said the boy.
Trembling, she slapped the box away and screamed in frustration.
"Wha-" said the boy.
Before he could say anything else, he noticed something on the box. It was a deadly desert scorpion with its tail raised high, ready to attack. Yet again this wonderful girl had saved him from a horrrible agonizing fate.
"My love, you remembered my allergies to scorpion venom. Oh bless you." said the boy.
"Yup." Thought the girl.
"The universe is definitely telling me something."
