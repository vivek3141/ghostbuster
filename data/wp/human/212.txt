The boulder tumbled mercilessly down the steep slope, and after he lost sight of it he heard it, crashing against the ledge at the bottom of the mountain.
He dropped to his knees, too exhausted to put the scream that was in his heart out into the world. Every part of his body ached. His broad muscles were impressive, but were not built for the task at hand. No human was built for such a task. And although the wretched man had always known that, it had never stopped him from trying it again. The only way out of this hell was to play the game; the boulder at the top of this mountain became his light at the end of the tunnel.
He started his way down the hill, his calloused feet carrying him down the rough terrain. He could barely remember the life that existed before this one. Was he a king? Was he a slave? All images of the past were replaced by ones of the mountain. The gods had forsaken him to this pointless task, erasing every part of him that existed before and replacing it with this image, this blood metronome. Every roll of the rock was another strike of a massive clock that counted down the minutes to nothing, and served only as a tool that others could look towards as example.
After hours of excruciating labor, Sysiphus moved the rock to the top of the mountain. The boulder tumbled mercilessly down the steep slope, and after he lost sight of it he heard it, crashing against the ledge at the bottom of the mountain.
