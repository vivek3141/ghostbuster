I was sitting on my porch swing when he came up the drive. I couldn't help but feel a little sorry for him. Ragged sweater, battered hat, and his poor face. A shame really, but then here he was, swatting aside the honeysuckle vines as he stalked up onto my porch.
"Granny, you picked the wrong time to fall asleep." He waved his claws at me.
"Would you like some tea?" I asked. An old blend they stopped making when I just a girl. In my mother's best china. So delicate you could almost see through it.
"You should be running away." The hummingbirds were angry, he was too close to their nest. They buzzed near him, chirping angrily.
"That's not necessary. Are you sure you won't have some tea?" I offered again. It was only polite after all.
"This won't take long, then I'll fond someone more fun." He raised his claws, no doubt to try and stab me.
"No." I said.
He froze, even before he could begin his swing. "What?" He looked up at his hand and back at me.
"No." This time the house, the honeysuckle vines, existence itself shuddered at my voice. I sipped my tea and looked him in the eye. "This is my place. And you have no power here."
He struggled to move even as the world dissolved around him. I looked in his eyes and saw the first hint of fear. Experience told me it wouldn't take long. But I do prefer to be thorough.
