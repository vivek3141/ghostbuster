For me, I think, I often have a few themes in it:
* general nerdiness (I worked in tech support too long)
* African nations are developped countries (a big hope for me). I love to throw in things which imply that because I hate racists!
* very EU centric writing (what can I say, I am very pro-EU and have come to embrace Creator Provincialism)
* "to syme" for "to perceive by another sense than the traditional human ones" is a neologism that is in a bit of my writing. Though not in much that found its way here
