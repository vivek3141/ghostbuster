I was the odd one out growing up, ostracized to the point where I felt being ignored was a normality; I was not good enough for other people. That's why they ignored me, spit in my direction, and shot glares across play grounds as though they were 50 caliber bullets attempting to pierce my frail, childlike body. Perhaps it was my scars that made them do this to me. I thought I hid them well, yet maybe they still knew. Maybe they thought it was me who carved those scars into my skin, but it wasn't.
Perhaps if I told them it wasn't me, maybe I would have had companions to pull me out of my darkness. Maybe if I told them how a knife slash is normal in a house filled with hate rather than love. Yet I didn't, and instead I was faced with sorrow so deep that it sank into my bones and hollowed them out. An ever-pervasive pity that took root in the very core of my being. Confining me to the recesses of mind, with no will to do anything other than die, but not brave enough to go through with it. Living, that is my punishment for not being good enough for other people; and it will haunt me forever.
