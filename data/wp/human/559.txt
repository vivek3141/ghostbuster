For the sake of being succinct, let me tell you that I am named Rover Castile--an addict, a thief, a womanizer, a broker of whispers, and a watcher of people. I was a man with family and peers, coworkers and colleagues. I *was* a good man committing grey sins.
I didn't notice that they were forgetting at first. I guess when you die, you just expect the souls of those you once knew to be there watching you burn or looking on with envy as you entered paradise. I think when the good men told me of Heaven, and that I would be with all my loved ones, I believe that same thing translated into my existence in hell, but there wasn't. What there was was, though, was another state of being.
I wasn't Rover Castile here. I was *that* guy. My entire existence was an endless stream of adjectives, but never a single noun. They don't remember me. I quit working for McMeery's Roofing, and they forgot me. I stopped talking to family to make them miss me, but they forgot me. I stopped socializing to make a statement, and everyone forgot me.
I'm...
My name is...
I had a name. It was a little different, but...
Oh, I forget. Just call me Blue Eyes, everyone else here does.
