I watched as the purple balloon soared through the sky. I could only hope the queen would like it. The contents of the letter were trivial. What was really important was the picture in the back. I would love to see the look on the Queen's face when she got to look at it. Not as if she would, though. There was a million to one possibility that the letter would actually arrive at its destination.
Days passed by and I forgot about my deed. The menial tasks and routines blended into the normalcy of life in London. After a few weeks, during my usual trip to the mailbox, I found a letter with the Royal seal of Her Majesty. My jaw dropped to the floor and then some. Did my letter actually get to the Head of State?
Trembling with excitement I grabbed the letter and ran up to my room. Mother looked at me and sighed. She must've thought "This kid never stops.". Little did she know that I was about to read the single, most important piece of writing in my life.
I gawked at the envelope. I was a rather simple one, but the majesty of it, knowing where it came from, seeing the Royal Seal stamped on the back of it made one thousand times more shocking. I grabbed dad's letter opener and cut open the envelope. A magnificently folded piece of paper slid out. I unfolded it with a hurry and read:
*Dear Andrew: *
*I have received your letter and read it thoroughly. My, what a lovely boy you are. I would love the chance to have tea with you sometime over the summer. You seem like a very educated kid. I like that in my nation's youth. *
*Please, do make yourself time and stop by the Palace. I will wait. You can bring your mother and father, even brothers and sisters if you have them. *
*Just show the guards at the entrance this letter, have them contact me and I will let you and your family in. *
*Best Regards, Queen Elizabeth*
*PS: I loved the photo, it reminded me of a healthier and younger me. Thank you for that. Almost no one makes me remember those days now. *
