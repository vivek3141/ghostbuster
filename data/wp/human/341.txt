MC Morlock smiled as he looked out at the shattered remains of the city. "I am a god among men! All will bow before me or burn in the radiance of my glorious beats!"
His triumphant smile melted when he heard the distant noise of helicopters. "More resistance? When will they learn?"
"Bitz ka^whrwhrwhr" he started to chortle, raising up into the air. Locating his quarry, he directed his beat boxing at them all the while maintaining his levitation beat. "Bitz ka^whrwhrwhr^veveve ererer worworwor^kra-tizs-kra-tizs" flames leapt from his hands destroying several of the helicopters.
Lines of rope came down from the few remaining helicopters. Robed figures slid down and quickly threw down runed cardboard. They started to dance and spin to his mad and mystical beats. Breakdance wizards!
MC Morlock started to fall as his magic was dispelled. He was caught in mid air by the incantations of the whirling wizards. He was later caged in the only material known to stop beat boxing, Cold Iron. And a contingent of break dancing wizards were assigned to watch him at all times.
