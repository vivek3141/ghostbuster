Every time I turn around I see so much that should piss me off, and it does, but I'm just so fucking tired all the time. There's never a god damn reason to really get up and actually do anything about it. Every good and noble person working for the betterment of us as a species has a dozen people apparently unable to see beyond their own personal fortunes toiling to keep things fucked. Then I see you. You are such a god damn beautiful human being, doing these amazing things and improving the lot of everyone around you. Working twenty hour days every day for months on end and actually achieving good things. Then I look at myself, and holy shit. I'm so god damned mediocre it is disgusting. I'm smarter than average, but barely care. I have a good basic body type, but can't be bothered to get in shape. I'm fucking horribly lonely all the time and I can't muster up the god damned energy to do anything about it.
You show me what I could be, you show me the other option. I love you for it. I want your respect more than anything in the world. And I hate you so much it terrifies me.
