My parents, like most, had chosen how my first 90 points had been spent. Every year, on my birthday I found out how my parents chose to improve me. Every year it was the same, and now I have 90 points of Empathy. I had even less input than most children, my parents were public figures and couldn't risk it looking bad if I chose Beauty or any of the other vain statistics. They are preachers, and there is nothing more godly than Empathy. But people are not as good as my parents have always believed and so my Empathy is not a blessing. I understand their choice, for how could I not? And I do not blame them, they didn't choose Intelligence for themselves after all, so it is not as if they could have understood this burden. They chose Patience, Love, and Leadership year after year and I can understand why they felt that Empathy would make my heart swell and accept God like theirs have. Yet my Empathy hasn't lessened my natural hatred, or self pity, or selfishness. I may understand how everyone feels, but I am not compassionate and I am not compelled to care.
After my 18th birthday I defied my parents'wish to keep spending my points on Empathy and did the one thing they truly couldn't condone, I spent them on nothing. I have 110 points that I have never used. They see it as me turning my back on the wonders of God and his gift to humankind. And it wasn't even an active rebellion, I simply couldn't see any use to them. Now though I have found a purpose for my life and I know how to use my points to achieve it. I have decided to spend them on Charisma. If I can understand how everyone feels and also have the Charisma to manipulate those feelings, there is nobody who could stop me. And my only goal will be to end the points.
