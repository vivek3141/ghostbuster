I can't take it anymore. I'm done.
They told me I was *lucky*, that I had a *gift*. **Lies**. What kind of gift is it to be locked in a concrete bunker ever since i was 5. Ever since the day I first...*jumped*. Leave it to the lackeys of the government to come up with most mundane possible name for teleporting. Leave it to them to tear apart a family so well that I have no memories of my real parents.
I have spent the last 20 years being experimented on, prodded, *harvested*. I have never seen the outside world, except through the 13 inch wide TV which lies beside my steel-frame bed. The only true piece of the world I've ever seen are the *stars*. Those beautiful orbs of wonder. A tiny slit was drilled into the top of the bunker for my 18th birthday. Not like I can escape through it anyways.
Well, at least not the escape they had in mind...
I've considered it many times. Almost daily. But the urge has always been strongest this time of the year. Every year on this day I stare though that slit for hours, wondering how strong I crave my freedom.
I'm done wondering.
I look up. Straight up. Beyond the 5 feet thick concrete, up into the utter vastness of space. The stars beckon to me, I can almost hear them calling out to me. My fists are clenched tight. I realise I've been holding my breath. I exhale strongly. *Not like a little air's gonna help me in a vacuum. * All my focus is now on the starry night sky and shutting my eyes for just a moment, I give in to their call.
I open my eyes with gasp, taking in a lot of air. *Space doesn't have air*, I think, just as I realise I'm falling.
I'm miles above earth, but miles below my planned destination. I'd vastly overestimated my abilities.
*Just another disappointment, but at least I'm gonna get my release anyway*.
The wind rushed past my ears as I fell through clouds, finally at peace. It must've been 0 degrees outside, but there was a warmth of sorts spreading throughout my body, leaving my toes tingling. I could see my concrete grave approach me rapidly. Just a few seconds before it was all over.
**5**
*Oh fuck, just a few seconds before this is all over. What have I done*
**4**
*Fuck, fuck, fuck! What was I thinking. GODDAMIT. It wasn't that bad there, was it? I could've still done something with my life. Maybe I could've found Mom and Dad. Oh crap, I'm never gonna see them. I'm never gonna see my mother and father*
My smile was gone, and there were two streams running across my face.
**3**
My life began to flash before me. My pitiful, slavelike life.
**2**
I know I've made the right choice. This is the closest I've come to *living* in my entire life. *Maybe I'll finally see you up there, Ma*.
I began to hum a familiar tune.
**1**
The ground was rushing up to meet me. To wrap me in an embrace and never let go. My smile returned. Taking a deep breath I began to sing,
"Happy Birthday to m-"
