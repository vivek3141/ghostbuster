Dear diary,
Today I saved a plane from a hijacking! And it was all due to my most awesome talent! I was aboard a plane when some bumbling IRA lads decided to take over the cockpit. I had to make some quick thinking in order to peacefully negotiate our captors into relinquishing their hold on our aircraft. I quickly called out for a piece of paper and a sharpie. Thankfully the teen girl sitting across the aisle from me had both! Even though the sharpie she gave me was a hot pink, mini sharpie, it was enough. I quickly sketched out a picture of what I needed and BAM! It came to reality! I stood up and held in my arms what I had drawn. A full case of Jameson! I passed a bottle to each member of the IRA and, after finishing a few bottles over the course of some hours, they gave up the controls of the airplane to me. They then grabbed their parachutes and jumped out of the plane!
Now when they jumped out, they left the plane with no fuel somewhere over the ocean, and I have no experience in flying a plane, and I may be writing this on a piece of scrap metal in a raft as the other passengers look at me with angry eyes, but I saved the plane from being hijacked!
I think I did good. Everyone is now staring at me while they are holding plastic forks. I think that means it's time for dinner. Gotta go! Until tomorrow, diary.
