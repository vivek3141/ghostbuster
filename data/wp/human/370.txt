"Hey you, haven't seen you all night. Too busy getting wasted with your frat buddies?"
"I drink. I go to parties. That's me. What's your excuse? I thought frat parties were a means with which the patriarchy oppresses women. Not really your scene, Emma."
"Can you not? Just because I'm a gender studies major, my god. I like parties. Parties are fun."
"You still having fun at 3:30 am?"
"Nah, just waiting around to sober up. What's your excuse?"
"Oh… I'm always up this late."
"Are you serious?! Like every weekend?"
"Every day, actually. I don't really do sleep."
"Rob. How is that even possible?! You play varsity sports, you're in my 8 am physics lab…"
"I survive."
"Good to know my friend's either a superhero or a cyborg."

"Emma?"
"Yeah. …you okay, Rob?"
"Can we go to my room?"
"Why, cause you need someone to take care of you after you puke, or cause you want to hook up? Either way, probably not my favorite thing to do."
"Neither, I promise. I just want to…show you something."
"Okay. Are you sure nothing's wrong? Now I'm scared there's a dead body in your bathroom or something."
"Nothing like that. You just have to promise to never tell anyone else."
"…I promise."

"Shit, Rob, what's making it glow?"
"Me."
"What? How?"
"It's always been like this. Literally never stops glowing unless I take it off. Why do you think I never wore it?"
"I…I thought you just wanted to look like a daredevil."
"I'm not a daredevil, Emma."
"Look, it's got to be a mistake. Send it back. Have it tested."
"Did that in second grade. That was when my parents got me a dog."
"…this means, means you're going to…"
"Kill myself, yes. Apparently so."
"No. That's not possible. You're Rob. You wouldn't choose to kill yourself."
"I know it's possible. I see it happen every time I go to sleep. Cliffs, ropes, pills, guns. My subconscious is persistent, if not creative."
"Oh god. That's why you don't sleep."
"Bingo."
"You, you can't let it freak you out like this. It'll probably be...when you're really old, you know. Like you're really old and Alzheimer's is starting to set in and you want to end it on your own terms. There's nothing wrong with that, right?"
"I don't know, Emma."
"I don't know either."
"I'm sorry."
"Me too."

*Emma woke up disoriented. She was in a bed, but not hers. Rob's? She vaguely remembered tears and hugs and drifting in and out of wakefulness. Someone had covered her with a blanket and taken off her shoes. Rob's room, yes. He was already gone, probably off on a morning walk. His bracelet sat on the desk, inches from her face, glowing faintly. So he wasn't close. Maybe at the gym, or getting coffee, but it didn't matter. Emma watched the red light slowly grow brighter. Quietly, with a sense of peace, she removed her own bracelet, dull gray as always, and left it on the desk. On her own wrist she slipped Rob's bracelet, and as it began to grow brighter, she straightened the bedcovers and left. *
