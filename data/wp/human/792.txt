"Ah, so, you mean.... Like, your own, not..."
"Not another person's son. Yes. I wanted my own son." The lady seemed quite angry standing there with a 7-year-old boy by her side.
"It is just that you said "a son", you did not really specify..." I tried to get out of this as situations like these are the exact reasons people distrust genies.
"Yes! Because I was talking about a son that was not born yet!" The lady was practically screaming as of now.
"Hey, look on the bright side. This one's already done. It's a good son, lady. You don't need to be pregnant or anything. Here you go - one good "a" son." I smiled. Really, all this with no added cost.
"I cannot send him back to his parents! He doesn't even speak English..."
"See? You just learn him to say "momma" and it will be a magical moment." I cheered.
"God damn you, take this poor child back to his parents! He has been crying for 3 days now!" she shoved the child forward and demanded I take action.
"Uhhh, no can't do." I already knew what will follow...
"Why not?" She inquired just as expected.
"Well he doesn't exactly have parents as of now," I said, suddenly getting all defensive. "Well not everyone on this world is an uncaring bastard that pushes her son away. Some parents really care for their children! You know, some good people have died for you to get this wish. Be more thankful." I hoped that this will be my last attack and she will step down.
"Have...Died?" she repeated with a slight hint of disbelief.
"Well, DUH!" I mimicked her facial expression. "Why else do you think the kid has been crying for 3 days? Anyhow, I warned you that having a child is not like having a puppy. Big, big responsibility. Anyhow, I must be going now. Bye Linda, bye Tsingtao."
