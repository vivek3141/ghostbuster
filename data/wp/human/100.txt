Subject: | Decision Matrix Excerpt of Rogue AI – Whiskey Oscar-7
-------- -|----------
From: | Carl Sager, CEO, Hyperion Systems
To: | Charlie Blithe, Agent, United Nations Bureau of Intelligence
Date: | January 12, 2154
Agent Blithe,
Per our vid-call, you wanted the exact series of decisions that led the Whisky Oscar-7 artificial intelligence to act so perversely. I assure you that our company constructs our intelligence analogs with multiple fail-safe's exactly for this reason, and it is obvious that it was tampered with. We at Hyperion take no responsibility for the actions of the rogue AI, and extend our deepest condolences to the families of the deceased.
The transcript below occurred in the several seconds leading up to the accident.
All the best,
Carl Sager, CEO, Hyperion Systems.
