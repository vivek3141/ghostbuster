I can always see her face. Always. The sensation gets easier every time. Have you ever tried to fly in a dream before, but you only end up awkwardly floating, bobbing around like a leaf stuck between oil and water? If you learn how to relax into that sensation, sinking into the ground that calls you, you can find the past. You can caress it, even thought you can't touch it.
It's pulling yourself out that's hard. Trying to fight against the gravity of your own dream to make it to the present. Knowing that you have to drag yourself through the pain and the misery of what prevents you from ever knowing that sensation again, just to meet the present. And what does the present offer, if just a perspective point of the future?
So why not try the opposite, you ask? Press forward against that dominating force that is my mind, and soar beyond the restraints of my current perception?
Well *I* ask, what becomes of a mind when it has known the sun, and is relegated to only fireworks? Bold, and pompous, and provocative, perhaps, but flashes that fade none-the-less. How soon would you be bored of the display when all you seek is the constant light that creates the warmth and shade of your day?
You, *you* are beholden to the past. You must answer its every concrete truth. You must justify that as the bedrock of your future, every day.
Why do you ask me about these powers? Don't you see? Because I always have the past, I will never leave it. Because I can see the future, I have no need of it. Now leave me be.
