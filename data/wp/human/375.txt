"Oprah?" I screech at myself. The nappy, curly, natural black hair shakes with my reflection. This is a joke- one of those syndicated prank shows, where everyone will come out at the end, laughing at me. Laughing, toting Burbank sized cameras, asking me to fill out consent forms to legally exploit my humiliation. Only that doesn't happen. There's a full body mirror in the bathroom when I "discover" I'm Oprah, so I think the best thing for me to do is spread my asscheeks as wide as I can pull them, and look into Oprah's ass. It's a once in a lifetime chance that you could be this close to one of the most respected women of all time. Let me take you on a journey- a journey into Oprah's asshole.
As wealthy as you would think one like Oprah to be, you would think that her asshole would be impeccable. When you find a homeless man named Rhonda waiting outside, asking if you would like pleasure for crack, you soon find out that Oprah's asshole is in fact, a slum. Oprah, being a genius upon our time, takes that slum and turns it into magic. "Magic Beads" she calls it. "I give one TO YOU!!! ", "And TO YOU, "YOU over there look like you ned some magic beads......." I GIVE YOU TWO PAIRS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG HLAJKELFDJ! Everyone is like "YES!!!! I love Oprah she gave me anal beads!!!! Until one fan takes it too far. They sit outside the Oprah recording studio. They accumulate three necklaces of Oprah's anal beads. They stick one string up, dangling accross the nipples...fantasizing about Oprah's unwaxed mustache tickling their nipple.....They stick the second string up, up a little to high for comfort, but they will do anything to appease Oprah. The third one- there's no where to put it anywhere else but anally. Little did Oprah know, or her perverted, obsessed follower know, that the anal beads have been made in a factory in South Korea, where sanitation and health codes are completely disregarded, and now you have AIDS you gross Oprah anal bead fucker.
