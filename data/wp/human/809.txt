I don't remember the last time I saw the sun. Don't know when I'll get to. All I know is that until I find a way out.. I'm stuck here. They already started to notice that I'm not aging, in fact they started noticing a **long** time ago. They started to send in scientists, but after I snapped the first fews necks, well.. let's say they didn't send in any more lab rats. They tried putting me in the chair, that didn't work, but don't get me wrong it still hurt, it hurt a lot. Electricity flying through every joint in your body, frying your cells, and your head. Only to wake up moments later completely fine. The worst part of this all is the insatiable lust to kill. It's like a personal tick, everyday I don't take care of it, it gets worse. I've started to mutilate myself, tearing off fingers, feet, anything to see the dark elixir flow. They finally put me in solitude after the body parts started to pile up, not like that's gonna do anything. What I learned is that if I don't deal with the tick, more ticks follow. Twitching, twisting, turning, **yelling**, **screaming**, anything to not hear the blood flowing in my veins *begging* me to let it run. After 10 years of solitude, my mind broke, too many ticks, too many voices. I sat still for the first time, staring at the blank wall, not having a single thought. I didn't think about killing, I didn't think about the oozing of an open wound. I thought nothing, and though my body remained, my mind had left.
Even immortal men may die, if not body, then mind.
