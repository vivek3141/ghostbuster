You wouldn't think a person could get lost on a river. I certainly never have been up until now.
My father was a fisherman. His father was a fisherman. I'm not sure what *his* father did, but I'd be willing to take a guess. I might as well have been born with gills, as much time as I spend on the water.
And yet here I am, lost on a gods-damned river.
In my defense, the last few days have been unseasonably rainy. Well, unseasonably cloudy, anyway. It hasn't actually rained, but it gets so dark sometimes that I can barely see. It's so bad that, when I lost hold of my net yesterday and dove in to get it, I had to swim around blindly for a few minutes until I ran into it. Hardly two body lengths away and I almost couldn't find my way back to the boat!
Shouldn't have gone in for it in the first place. Not like it's been doing me any good. I haven't had a single catch worth keeping. Fortunately, I haven't gotten too hungry yet, but I hate the idea of going home empty-handed if it keeps up like this.
"Hello!"
I turn my head in the direction of the sound. Squinting, I can make out a figure on the shore.
"Hello!" I respond, glad to find someone I can ask for directions, "Where are you traveling?"
"I need to get to the other side!"
I steer towards the shore.
"And where are we right now?" I call out, drifting closer, "Which direction is Feneos?"
"Iâ€¦I'm not sure," the man's face comes into focus.
Damn. He looks as confused as I am.
"But I know- I just feel like it'll be alright if I can make it across this river," he looks at me hopefully, sticks out his hand, "I'm Argus."
Maybe I won't go home empty-handed after all.
"The name's Charon, friend," I clasp his hands, "And I think I can help you out. But it's going to cost you."
