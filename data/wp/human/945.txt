**The Huntsman** got a lot of ink right off the bat. He hit newspapers. He got airtime. Speculation on the net & on the street. It was hard to ignore. It's not often someone gets a crossbow bolt to the heart or head while down in the city. It's not often that 15 people a month get one either, but that's the city we live in now. A crack dealer by the city capitol, a pedophile in Bablet Park, a homeless drunk in the middle of an intersection, a prostitute by the docks, a wife-beater on his front doorstep, a pimp by the Black River, a trucker in the bathroom of a diner, an investment banker in his corner office, a frat boy behind a bar, an elementary school teacher on the playground, a priest at St. Timothy's, the mayor's aide in a car full of cash from the projects, a cop in his car on the side of the highway, the 1^st reporter on the scene of the cop's murder, & a man in camouflage in front of a crowd. It was a poor way to begin the year.
Up until Father Emmery was murdered in his confessional, there wasn't even an extra detective assigned to the city's investigation. Then came the public outcry. Half the city went to the streets in protest of the murders. Half the city went to the streets in support. There had always been murmurs among his parishioners. It took only 3 days from the night of the Father's murder for violence to break out. Camouflage became the uniform of his supporters & acolytes, though no one had yet seen the killer or how he dressed. St. Timothy's chapel & schoolhouse was burned down by a midnight mob in camouflage & the responding firemen were assaulted. By the time the PD arrived, the firemen were already hacked to bits with their own axes. Since the axes were thrown into the burning church, the police had no evidence to charge anyone. Mayor Conti granted amnesty & called for a citywide curfew, but his word held less sway 4 days later when his primary aide was found smuggling garbage bags of cash from the projects with a bolt through his neck.
That was the day things started to change. Police refused to enforce the curfew. The city government shut down, maintaining only utilities & police. Tourism dried up. Businesses closed their doors. Armed groups of camouflaged men patrolled the streets. The image of a bow & arrow could be found spray-painted on any government buildings, churches, schools, banks, & police stations; many times accompanied by the words *" The Hunt is on. "* Few people went out alone on those nights. Thousands of people left our city forever.
However, that didn't stop steel bolts from flying true & reaching their targets. It only worsened when lead investigators of the killer's serial murders released case-sensitive information: *The Huntsman*'s bolts were engraved with the crimes of each victim. Selling Poison. Pedophilia. Addiction & Sloth. Spreading Disease. Brutality. Sex Slavery. Serial Murder. Theft & Laundering. Serial Rape. Pedophilia & Child Abuse. Pedophilia, Embezzlement, & Murder. Corruption & Laundering. There would be more to come by January's end.
It was hoped that by releasing this information, the citizenry might better identify *The Huntsman*, or at least avoid angering him & the subsequent bolt to the eye. What it truly did was give the camouflaged followers a guideline & ethos to follow & bind them together in their cause. They called themselves Acolytes of Orion. They began spray-painting the constellation of Orion on streets they felt they had claimed from their prey. They gathered & prayed to him in the burnt ruins of St. Timothy's. There, they awaited instructions from their silent prophet. They awaited a bolt falling from the stars to direct their path.
When Officer Kyler was found in his car on the side of the highway with a bolt through his badge & heart which read "Corruption & Brutality," a 27 year old reporter, Natalie Greyson, showed up at the scene first. On air, broadcasting live, Natalie approached the front of the vehicle & turned back toward the camera. It was at that moment that a bolt flew through her skull & pinned her body to the back door of Officer Kyler's cruiser. The bolt read "Lying & Sensationalism." The whole city saw it happen.
The media died down. Crime rates fell as well. In turn, the police went on a soft-strike, only enforcing laws regarding violent crime & theft, focusing on *The Huntsman*. He didn't seem to mind, or at least didn't want a war. Law Enforcement was as scared as anyone. Whereas the murder of Mayor Conti's aide was viewed as cleaning up the government, Officer Kyler's death was considered a near declaration of war. We all felt the effects. We were all caught in The Hunt with no end in sight. No way out of the Hunting Ground.
From the dawn of New Year's Day we knew of *The Huntsman, * but not why he hunted. He gave no statements, released no manifesto, left no warnings, took no trophies, had no links between his prey, & he made no evidence of approval or disdain for his Acolytes. January 31^st fixed that. It only brought more turmoil. *The Huntsman*'s 15^th kill was one of his Acolytes. It started innocently enough when a lone Acolyte of Orion prevented a mugging, but he kept beating the assailant. The screams could be heard 3 blocks away. Those in the high-rise apartments surrounding him called the police who failed to respond, hoping to avoid a clash & backlash from the cult. The police & the Acolytes of Orion had been eyeing each other since The Razing of St. Timothy's. The tension pierced the hearts & minds of every citizen as they slept each night. We were waiting for a battle. *The Huntsman* spared us that. While all eyes on the block focused on the street below, he struck from above in the high-ground. As citizens exited their homes to surround the Acolyte, he was already stalking his prey. A bolt fell from the sky & drove itself through the back of the camouflaged man. He plunged sharply to the concrete on top of the writhing mugger. As all eyes rose to the rooftops, a man in his late thirties approached the corpse & drew the bolt from it. He wiped it on his jeans to remove the blood & reveal the engraving. He read the crime aloud: "Vigilantism." The family men & blue collar workers surrounding the fallen Acolyte looked at each other silently beneath the glow of streetlights, beneath the watchful eyes & judgment of *The Huntsman. * They watched each other wordlessly & helped the mugger to his feet. He was driven to the hospital. Those men learned what we all would the next morning, on the 1^st of February. There is only one *Huntsman. *
We were spared that war.
The understanding was that the city remained *his* Hunting Ground.
No one else's.
There was a certain comfort in that. People took back to the streets. Law Enforcement Officials resumed their patrols of previously claimed roads & neighborhoods. The Acolytes of Orion continued parolling, cautiously asserting their presence. They weren't cautious enough. No matter what they did, they couldn't have been careful enough. It was bound to happen eventually. Someone just had to get angry enough. As angry as *The Huntsman* must have been. Someone just wanted their home back. Their life back. Some normalcy. Perhaps he just didn't like his city being claimed by a stranger. Whatever the case, we all suffered for it.
**The Hangman** made his presence known on the Ides of March. The date was a message all of its own. There could only be one recipient intended. Four Acolytes were found hung by the neck with their bowstrings from four stoplights. The whole intersection's yellow & green lights had been shot out & broken, leaving only red.
Another clear message: Stop.
