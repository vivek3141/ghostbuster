Something had caught his eye. A beauty, standing next to a sandy-haired young man. It was gorgeous. Smart too, it would appear. Of course, It had nothing on him, but honestly who did?
Now he wouldn't want you to think he considers himself some kind of avenging angel. He doesn't do what he does out of any kind of desire for intellectual cleansing. He does it simply because, well why not? A question he likes to pose to each of his toys before he completes his cycle. See, hunt, tease, terminate. Fortunately for him, none have answered his question sufficiently to break the cycle. Clearly none were on their high school debate teams, or they'd know that begging really isn't all that persuasive.
He's made a note in the past that none seem to enjoy the teasing. A shame, since it's definitely his favourite part. That stage also tends to correlate to the change from well-reasoned arguments to tearful begging. He often almost feels sad at the loss of an even slightly worthy opponent. Almost. He flashes back to his favourite so far. There was one that never begged. No. Instead it just stared, spitting biting retorts to every question he asked it. He'd had to work hard to make that one sing like the others. He shook his head. He had more important things to focus on.
The hunt is most certainly enjoyable too, make no mistake. He likes to observe them living their daily lives, watch them completing their little rituals. Little do they know that they've just become a part of his.
Yes, he's certain he's going to like this new one. So he makes the decision to move to stage 2. Stage 2 involves the preparation. He approaches his local hardware store for the necessary equipment. He smiles as he remembers how well-trained he has the employee's here. They all seem cemented in the belief that he is simply a rather awkward local with a passionate love for DIY.
He wanders round the store picking up the usual. He smiles indulgently at his own behaviour, much like a trainer might at an eager pet. He really is soft-hearted. The way he buys a completely new set of rope, tape, waterproof canvas, a kind of welcome gift for each new toy. Almost a thank you for **their** gift. His purchases had seemed suspicious at first, but a few well-placed stutters and the occasional glances from their eyes to the floor built up the image he needed for them to see.
"Hello there! Anything I can help you with today?" He grunts in annoyance at the sudden interruption by this unknown voice. And his routine had been going so well. They knew better than to approach him. Without even looking up, he growls out a "No." before fully turning his back on the worker to search for the disposable gloves. He's almost out, and he does so hate creating a mess.
A voice follows him as he goes, "Well you just let me know if that changes!" He grunts again, nodding over his shoulder. He catches a glimpse of a vague middling height youth and a flash of brown hair before continuing on. He hadn't realised they were hiring.

He yawns. ‘ Time to take a break ’, he thinks. He has after all been sitting outside Its office window for the past 3 hours. It certainly works late. He smiles. He does like a hard worker. They tend to be so much more fun. His favourite had been working hard through the night towards some kind of typical academic accolade. He was glad he'd never gotten trapped in the typical rat race his toys lived in. He preferred more substantial victories. His toys should really be grateful for freeing them from their caged little lives.
He wandered over to his local coffee shop. They knew his order and often had it sitting on the counter by the time he'd reached it, steaming and heavily caffeinated. Only he didn't recognise the person standing by the almost obscenely shiny and over-complicated nectar-giving machine today. He sighed, preparing himself for another mundane interaction.
The youth looked up from the cup he was holding and smiled widely as he approached. He was taken aback by the fervour with which this man must enjoy making coffee.
"A triple shot espresso. A drop of milk." He had the change in hand, ready for exchange. No need to make this more complicated than necessary. It seemed the youth didn't agree.
"You sure you want all that caffeine so late at night? It'll be hours before you get to sleep!" he said whilst gesturing at the clock.
He grunted. It was like even this guys actions were followed by exclamation marks.
"Well okay then! It's your last meal!"
He furrowed his eyebrows. Wasn't the expression, ‘ your funeral ’. Whatever. He just wanted the drink so he could go home and plan for tomorrow. The thought buoyed him up, to the point where he even managed a smile as he accepted the cup from the frankly over-zealous youth.
He turned towards the door. A "Have a good night! Be seeing you soon!" followed him out.
---
He awoke groggy. He soon noticed the searing pain in both shoulders, followed by a chipper voice saying "You changed your mind then? Or can I still not help you with anything?"
He struggled, soon realising the precarious position he was in. He appeared to be suspended on a hook, his bound wrists holding him up as his toes brushed the ground.
He rasped out, "What's going on? Where am I?"
He looked up, and met the eyes of...wait. Wasn't that the irritatingly chipper youth from the coffee shop? He still appeared to be as joyful as ever. And that voice, much like the new worker from the hardware store?
"Didn't I say we'd be seeing each other soon?"
He closed his eyes. This must be a dream. Yes, some kind of switched perspective. What else could it be?
That burningly happy voice cut through his thoughts. "Do you even know my name? I don't wear the name tag as an accessory you know!"
His eyes opened almost of their own accord and zoomed in on the tag. ‘ Greg ’. For some reason he was almost disappointed at his psyche for not thinking up something more exciting. Like he'd be taken down by a ‘ Greg ’.
"And finally, he acknowledges me! You've never been one for names have you? I'm almost certain you never bother learning theirs before you play your little game now do you? Not worth your time I imagine."
Now he's really paying attention. It's finally caught his notice that this doesn't have any of the signatures of a dream. But why would anyone kidnap **him**? That's simply not how this works!
Greg spoke again, "You don't know her name do you? The girl you've been staring at all night?"
Adrenaline was coursing through him. He needed out. He was sure he could persuade this guy to let him go. No coffee shop worker could match him in wits. He just needed a plan…
"You still don't get it do you? What this is all about? This is about him. The boy that I LOVED. That you killed. And for what? Hmm? He was about to get his masters, WE were about to move in together!"
One thought filled his mind. ‘ Oh shit.'This might be a little tougher than he'd hoped. He was sweating now, his shirt was sticking to his back. He didn't deserve this! This heart-pounding terror! What had he ever done?
"But I'm going to give you a chance. I'm going to give you a chance to get out of this scott free. Answer my question and I'll let you go. I'll walk away."
He imagined the relief he was exuding was palpable. He was sure he'd master whatever question this youth could possibly ask him. How hard could it be?
Out if Greg's mouth came the words, "What was his name?"
Silence reigned. His ears were filled only with the sound of his pounding heart. He didn't know how long had passed. His mouth hung open but no sound could be forced into emerging. Desperation washed over him as the minutes passed.
Finally, the impasse was broken, as Greg smiled. A manic smile, one that finally seemed to reach his eyes.
"Well don't worry. You'll know it soon. I'll pull it screaming from your lips. It'll be the last thing you ever hear."
And he thought, ‘ Oh SHIT. ’
That was his last coherent thought for a while.
