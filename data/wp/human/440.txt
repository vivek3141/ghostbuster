"I was wrong? The whole time?"
**No. I am a God. I am not your God. But your God is not nothing. **
"I'm afraid I don't understand at all."
**Not many do. Humans have the unfortunate tendency of assuming answers are linear, or very straight forward. **
"Can you please explain all this to me? I'm sure you're very busy, but since we're here anyway...‚Äù
**Very well. Monotheism is a strange way of religion. It's something that none of us ever encouraged or made, but so it is. The entirety of the universe, and all of the others, made by one measly God? No, we are powerful, but not of that magnitude. **
"You mean that everything, all of this, was a collaboration?"
**Certainly. We do not tend to disagree as often as humans do. It was not so difficult to decide the laws of physics and create beings. **
"You're telling me that every deity from every religion lives together on some unknown plane like roommates? That the polytheists are right?"
**The polytheists have a broader view than many. They recognize that power is not held within one entity. Yet they could not possibly understand the amount of forces who shape their world. **
**As for the "roommate" situation, I don't believe you're looking at this correctly. Many call me Shiva. I was not created Shiva. I have always been a force within the universe, one without a name. Humans created our names. **
"So gods are products of our imagination?"
**No. The image we have is one humans created for us. I am no less of a force if humans do not look at me and call me a name, as they do not look at many of my kind. We simply are, always have been, and always will be. **
"I'm afraid this is all going over my head."
**I never expected otherwise. **
