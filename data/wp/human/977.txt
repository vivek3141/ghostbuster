Hi there! I read your story for the contest and I wanted to give you some feedback.
The intro was very, very engaging. It sparked a lot of questions with little answers and instantly hooked me. I loved the pacing of the first part, and I wanted a similar pacing for the body/conclusion. You did a great job making the pale skinned people scary, I was curious as to where the story takes place? Is it hell or some sort of purgatory? Or is the dude 100ft underground being kept captive by crazy people?
Thanks for the story, keep writing!
