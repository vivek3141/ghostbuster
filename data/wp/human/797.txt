I'm tired.
Physically drained, mentally exhausted, spiritually bereft and otherwise kaput.
Why am I so thoroughly wiped? I'm wiped because I *care* too damned much.
Who do I blame for my current situation? Not that it matters really, but I blame humanity.
That's right. I blame the entire race of men for my exhaustion. I blame you upright, sentient apes for the hopeless feeling that's been giving me nightmares on good nights, worry filled insomnia on bad nights and a panic fueled gnawing in my gut for the past 12 years.
Why? Because you never *learn*! You ***never*** have and you ***never*** will!!
I'm tired and I'm done. I've had it with everyone of you.
As of this moment, I am leaving every thing behind. Every Starbucks, iPhone, Wi-Fi, all of it. **D-O-N-E** **Done! **
I am past caring about the partisan politics, I don't care about reality television, and I could give a sunny shit about A-D list celebs and who they're boning!
I am walking away from my lame job, my shit hole apartment, and my safe-for-the-environment-but-cost-me-out-the-ass-smart car. I'm taking what I had in my bank account and charting a course to somewhere where I cannot be bothered by ***ANY*** of you self absorbed ass hats.
Maybe then, I'll be able to sleep without worrying about how we're glossing over curing Cancer, A.I.D.S. or whatever new disease comes along and, instead, we're focusing on developing new and exciting ways to wipe each other out.
