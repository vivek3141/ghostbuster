"Dave? It's me, mom." My hands shivered slightly.
"Hey ma, why are you calling me so late?" I checked the clock. It was late. 10:00 pm late.
"I just wanted to see if you remembered to pick up your gramma's medicine. She needs it tonight and tomorrow morning, you know." I could feel his hands crushing the phone. I would too, if I was him. He volunteered to get my mother off my hands, a huge relief for me.
But as much of a burden my mother is, she is still mom. His grandmother. I had a gut feeling she was about to die.
"Did you give her the medicine yet, Dave? She also needs some money for bingo night, every Friday, make sure you drive her there tomorrow." I covered the microphone a little to hide my gulp. Through the speaker I can hear his panting. Dave always panted when furious.
"Yes. Gave it to her right after dinner." He spoke a little fast. I trust my son, but I feel as if he was lying. What can I do, bed ridden like this?
"Thanks, Dave. Thanks a lot."
"Sure." A small sigh followed his seemingly genuine reassurance.
"Good night, go-"
"Good night." He hastily ended the call. Teary eyed and slightly depressed, I whispered to the phone, hoping desperately for someone to tell him what I said.
"Good luck, Dave. I love you."
