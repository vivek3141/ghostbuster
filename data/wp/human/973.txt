"I swear I didn't do it," the man sobbed, "I loved her."
"We'll see about that. Bring in the cadaver!"
Ashley's body was wheeled in. The interrogator drew his handgun.
"Wait! Please!"
Bang. The suspect was dead. As was Ashley, still.
"Guess he didn't do it," the interrogator sighed, pointing the gun towards his own head.
Bang. The suspect came back to life. Soon after, so did the interrogator.
"How?" The suspect asked.
"I killed myself, the man who killed me. Therefore, I came back to life."
"I didn't know you could do that!"
"I thought of it a couple of days ago in the shower."
"This could be useful."
