The men laughed as the little girl emerged from behind the city gates.
"THIS IS MY HOME!" She yelled. "WE ARE GOD'S PEOPLE! TURN BACK NOW AND LIVE; OR CONTINUE ON, AND DIE!"
The small army found this hilarious. "And what are you going to do, eh little girl? Why don't you call your Daddy and let him handle grown-men's business?"
"I did," she replied, drawing her knife. "I called on my Father in Heaven. And He will grant me victory on this day, if you do not turn around and go back to from whence you came."
One man grabbed a sword and stepped forward, roaring, "Enough of this! This little girl taunts us!"
He approached her, but she approached him even more swiftly, and slew him with the knife.
Three more men approached and were too slain. City watchers saw this from the gate, and the little girl's fearless display excited them to call all the soldiers. And then the city opened up, and all the soldiers within, swept out and chased the small army back along the trail and slain them all along the route. Not a man survived.
The girl fell to her knees in the sand, and prayed, "Thank you, Father."
