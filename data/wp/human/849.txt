The memory came unbidden. A wretched child, unwanted in a city without orphanages. Scraping a living to survive like all the other urchins. Dashing between alleys to avoid the urban predators. Begging for alms and receiving kicks as often as kindness. Being tormented by those who were older or just larger.
The flashes of ancient emotion flooded into the mind. Fear, anger, longing, hopelessness. The child was chased out of so many places, forced away from cramped fires and meager meals. Despondent and starving the child went the only place left for the night: a cemetery.
The tombs were always cold but dry at least. Sometimes even some moldy food offerings left for the spirits by the priests. Some few other miserable and lost lost were already there. Claiming these slight refuges as well. The Child finally finds a crypt not guarded. Clawing a way through a rusted grate.
Inside was safety at last and a surprise. A fire, black as a void, burns eternally in a sconce. It offered naught but were-light, but also heat against the chill of night. This place of death gave life for the child in more ways than one. The only other occupant a brooding raven atop her nest high in a broken window. The child curled up to rest.
---------------------------------------------------
An age later the mighty Lich stoods over it's domain. The cries and groans of a fallen army writhing in its death throes rose up to the delight of the carrion eaters. The flocks and murders of them followed the Lich like a fell cloud. From this phenomena the Lich was known as the Carrion Bringer. It's coming was always foreshadowed by the arrival of the Lich's pet: the Raven King.
---------------------------------------------------
The child is awakened by by the chirping cries of hatchlings. Insisting on morsels from their mother. When she left one attempted to follow but his meager fledgling wings proved insufficient and he fell. The baby bird dropped right onto the child and this proved enough to disturb the torpor of awakening.
"You fell? You can't go back home?" The child asked as the chick cheeped and pecked at a finger hungrily. The child tried to return the infant but alas the nest was too high. "I'm sorry, I can't get you home...I can't go home either...Let's find some food okay?" The child soothed the trembling chick and tucked it into a tiny breast pocket.
Casting about there was indeed a tray of spoiled food left for the dead, pushed through a slot under the door. The child consumed it but the little raven could not eat it. knowing the dead are eaten by bugs and the birds eat bugs the child decided to push open the crypts solitary coffin. It's brittle wooden lid gave way even to the Child's meager touch.
Inside there were indeed insects to be had. Which the tiny bird ate happily. Yet as the Child sought through the moldering remains something else was found. A book strangely enough one that hadn't rotted with it's owner. The Child pulled it out and admired it's black leather binding, and blue-gold script circling the bejeweled skull emblazoned on it's cover.
---------------------------------------------------
The Lich strode through the frozen city, listening to the howling winds of winter in it's deserted streets. The corpses left bloody smears in the pristine white as the undead dragged them from their homes and shops. Soon they too would join the ranks of the un-breathing horde. These streets were so familiar and yet so foreign now.
Once the Lich reached the cemetery it stopped and beheld the trove before it. It raised its spindly fingers and from withered lips an incantation went forth. The ground began to tremble and gravestones began to topple as the earth gave way beneath them. More recruits for the Lich's army clawed their way back into the daylight.
The Lich walked among them looking for one particular crypt...
---------------------------------------------------
Child became adult and adult became mage. The cruel writings of the book forced themselves into the impressionable mind. Growing in power and meaning as the Mage became more skilled. The Mage happily ignored this dark influence and enjoyed a simple life. Mending broken items and lifting simple curses was always in demand.
The fledgling too had grown into the Mage's familiar. Uplifted from a simple beast by their unbreakable bond. Speaking to each other in their own language, sharing life's little joys and pleasures. The Mage was not wealthy nor influential, not having had the money or connections to attend a school nor attract a master. No a simple lodging over a small shop was all they required.
The Mage sat on his balcony taking in an afternoon's sun with a cup of tea and a table of broken wares to repair. Chatting amiably with the Raven on his perch. The cries or a pack of children in the street below brought a painful smile to the Mage, a remembrance of a wasted youth. Then the unexpected happened.
The children were taunting a small urchin. Throwing rocks and insults alike. The Mage knew that pain and called down angrily from the balcony above for them to stop. The distraction proved enough and the victim got away. The bullies didn't take lightly to this and one unfortunate stone sailed up to the balcony...
---------------------------------------------------
The tomb doors disintegrated easily and the Lich strode inside. The long ruined coffin and darkly burning sconce still stood where once a sad urchin had once found solace. The coffin was swept aside and beneath a stone lid was revealed. Inside was something the Lich had long sought and killed to find...
---------------------------------------------------
The Mage screamed aloud in a pain deeper than any previously known. The bloodied stone sat beside the wounded raven at the base of his perch. The old bird had always been there for the Mage. Huddled together in the streets, finding food and hiding spots they had become more than partners.
The children below had died quickly when the fireball struck them. The screams and alarms of other citizens around had led to the clang of alarm bells. The Mage cared not except for the grief, and anger. Soon the guards would come to take the Mage away. To leave the beloved Raven here as it's vibrant but meager life bled away.
NO that could not come to pass...words welled up from forgotten times. A foul mist began to seep from the locked chest in the attic. The Mage tenderly scooped up the beloved familiar and carried him inside. The Mage barred his doors and threw open the chest, drawing forth the black book. There was something to be done....
---------------------------------------------------
The Lich beheld the object of it's long quest. An item so lost to history as to become a legend. The Philosopher's stone. It had been here all this time not far from the resting place of it's creator above, whose wicked tome had guided the Lich for so long. The Raven King cawed from the rafters of the tomb. The Lich turned and saw that the creature had settled upon a long abandoned nest.
"Yes my friend, we are finally home"
