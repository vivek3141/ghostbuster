Once upon a time, there was a guy who was browsing reddit and was a particularly good writer. When he saw a prompt on r/WritingPrompts he was reminded of his addiction to writing, so he decided to click on it and explore a couple of prompts before putting his laptop away. When he went down far enough, he saw an OP who had a particularly vague prompt with a sob story. But with a moment of compassion in his heart, our hero decided to click on it and write this guy a story. Anyway, now I will detail on what will happen in the future. OP will read this story and be enlightened on how amazing it is, and then realize that it is not a happy ending. So then the guy who is writing it will say, "Well I don't wanna be a cunt and rip this guy off. So I'll write him a happy ending." Determined to make OP's supposedly bad day better, the guy turned around to grab his drink, and found a man standing there instead. He had a sign that read, 'Good men know the cost of their mistakes, but great men get over their mistakes.' Having seen this, the guy said, "Thanks bro, you just gave me an idea." And being given that wonderful quote, he decided to put in his story. And in case you didn't catch the meaning, the happy ending is you receiving the ability to get of your mistakes. The End.
