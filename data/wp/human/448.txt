The silence was the first thing she noticed as she strode in, usually her roommate was so happy, so loud, so.. annoying. It was what she had come to dread about heading home, what should have been a comforting reprieve from her lessons was what pushed her to do more work and stay as far from home as possible.
Her footsteps echoed through the hall, anticipating the likely prank and how best to avoid it; a bucket on a door? a weakened floorboard? something new? But no, nothing happened as of yet, the only oddity being a game boy on the floor. She ambled towards her room and tentatively pushed his door open, jumping back when it creaked and shaking her head, embarrassed at her own fear. He was probably just out, partying, or *socialising*.
But a thought nagged at her as lay on her bed, a thought she couldn't quite place, but yet still caused her trouble. She rose, and started to stride towards the kitchen, an easy escape from anxiety. But, passing her roommates room, a whimper reached her ears, a whimper so feeble and miserable that it would have moved the heart of the most impassive politician.
As she entered the room, the whimper stopped, the silence settling like a smog.
A shaking head was visible behind his bedside dresser, and as she stepped towards him it stiffened, as still as the silence. He glanced at her as she passed the corner of the bed and visibly relaxed before motioning violently for her to get down, mouthing indecipherable words, but the meaning was discernible, to hide, or go.
As her mind sifted through the confusion of what could possibly be happening, the front door creaked open, and her roommate stopped, still as jock concentrating on math. Footsteps advanced in a perfectly even pattern, and a white-gloved hand grabbed the frame of the doorway, a sinister voice shattering the silence, her heart stopping for a moment.
"It's a me, Mario!"
