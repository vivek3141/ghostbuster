Every morning at exactly 7am, I went into the village to follow through with the obligations of the day. However, everyday at 7am, I was walking into a different village than I had the day before. You see, I travel from village to village to sell...well, whatever it is I have accumulated over my journeys. Louise LeCrow-the-free-lance-salesman! That's me. While I sell my various treasures, I get to know the needs and the desires of the people. I take note of and memorize their personalities as an investigator takes down data. Over the years, I've come to realize that in a village, there are basic types of individuals: the low-life's, the big-wigs, and the busy bodies. I avoid these people once they've bought what they need. I delete them from my memory like a file being tossed into the garbage bin. However, within each town there are real genuine people. I learn about them and in turn they ask for nothing but the opportunity to learn about me. These are the people that make all the travelling worth it. These are the people I collect for I'd be a fool to delete their files.
