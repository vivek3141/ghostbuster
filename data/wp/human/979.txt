"You look nervous," he said to me, eyes shifting to a warm yellow-orange of concern. "Your first time in here?"
"I'm not nervous," I replied, honestly, picking up the next one in the line. "I've got a thing with my eyes. They're always this color."
"You sure?" the salesman said, eyes turning the white of confusion with a few flecks of red anger dashed here and there. "I mean, I get it, but you don't gotta make stuff up."
"I'm not nervous," I told him, putting the object down, and picking up the next one in the line. "Why would I be nervous? I wouldn't have shown up in the first place if I wasn't absolutely confident that I was doing the right thing."
"I mean," he replied, eyes turning the green of understanding with a few of those damn persistent red flakes here and there. "There are lots of reasons to be nervous. It's a big decision."
"Maybe," I replied, actively looking him in the eyes for the first time. "But, I've never been more sure of anything in my life. I'll take this one."
"Excellent, sir." He beamed at me and his eyes turned the fiery blue of happiness as he took the engagement ring out of my hand and placed it in a small box. "I'm sure your girlfriend will love it."
