He's gone now.
My family tries to console me. Mum offers me loads of food. Ron tries to distract me with Chess. Ginny casts a Bat Bogey Hex on Ron in an attempt to make me smile. It doesn't work, although there might have been a twitch of my cheek.
HE'S GONE.
My mind is stuck on memories long past. I won't ever let them go, because then he will be truly, forever gone. Fred lives on in me.

**BOOM. **
*The whole room was COVERED in green goo, and they could hear the shriek of their mum downstairs.
"I told you it would work!" exclaimed George.
Fred grinned back. "I think it worked a bit too well." He gestured to their belongings.
George wiped the back of his hand on his face, in attempt to get some of the goo off. It only succeeded to get even more on his face. "Yeah, maybe. But think about if -"
"if we can time delay it and put in the Slytherin common room?" Fred finished for him.
"Exactly!" They smirked at each other.
They heard the pounding of their mum's feet up the stairs and their smirks dropped. Both of them hurried to hide as much of their experiment as they could, although there was no hiding the goo. *
