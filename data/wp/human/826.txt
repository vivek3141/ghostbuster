Hey Reddit, sorry. I meant to post this in /r/AskReddit
It was so sudden that I wasn't really sure what to do. It wasn't easy controlling his body and it was honestly terrifying. I am not exactly sure what was going on and thought it was a hallucination at first.
The only reason I didn't post this in "Ask" is because I thought it wouldn't be taken seriously and just deleted. When I finally came to a few moments ago I came on to notice the post was here and it was real.
I can't really say much as it's hard to remember everything that happened. Something strange is happening in the universe.
