"It's the end of the World!" Mario screamed while punching the wall in our locker room.
"It's not buddy, relax. Time will pass, it will go away" I knew my words mean't nothing but I had to pretend they did.
"It won't go away! Not something like this!" He said while still punching. He must of had a few broken knuckles by now.
I didn't know what else to say. These things happened every year, in every school across the country. You laugh at it when it's some stranger's story on a blog, but when it's your best friend...
Hazing was a common tradition for football teams but that didn't mean things couldn't cross the limit. A broomstick in the ass? What was the point of that?
It was just one man and one broom. But for Mario, it was enough to be the end of his world.
