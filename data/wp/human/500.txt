I don't get too much feedback either, but it's not always about feedback. Sometimes knowing you've written something good is a nice feeling. If you want more people to see it, you can submit your story as a [PI] (prompt inspired) and title it after the prompt you were writing about. That way you can get feedback.
I browse new a lot for new prompts, see if there's anything I like. A lot of prompts I love but don't write about because I don't know enough about the subject or I feel like it'd be too long.
Usually the stories are short enough that I submit them while others are still submitting their own stories, so it's still active enough that people see them. But sometimes it's too late, but that's OK, because I wrote something, and that makes me proud of myself.
