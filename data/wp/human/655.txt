As I calmly walk into the bank SGT. Doomhand had taken hostage I make sure to check on the 15 or so people laying on the ground. SGT. Doomhand comes around the corner to see me standing there causing him to jump and drop his giant metal hand on the ground.
I sigh and shake my head before saying," what are you doing Harold (Doomhand's real name)? How could you hurt all these people? Harold I'm not mad at you I'm just disappointed in you. I want you to know that I have called your mother and father told them what you have done. When I told your mother she burst into tears and your father told me he would leave work early and be right over."
When I finished speaking Doomhand's face because as pale as a vampires ass cheek. The word "Disappointed" hit Doomhand like a runaway train causing him to cough up blood from shame. Hearing he made his mother cry felt like he was struck by a tidal wave made of guilt that made him feel sick and woozy. And the fear he felt from hearing that not only had his father heard of what he did and that he made his mom cry but that he had to leave work early and was on his way caused Doomhand fall to the ground and start crying.
I was able to save all 15 hostages and thwart Doomhand's plan to rob the bank. Once again I was able to prove that words are mightier than the sword. Fortunately I was able to leave before Doomhand's father Gen. Doomblade arrived. I hear Harold works in a library now days.
