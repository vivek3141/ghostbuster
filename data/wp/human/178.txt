Antarctica: The Final Frontier
No one saw Antarctica as a priority. It was just "that cold place" that no one cared about. Then we found it...
Beneath the ice, we found a capsule. It was 100 feet long and 50 feet tall. On the side was writing that was completely unknown. Scientists detected high energy amounts emanating from it. Then one day, it opened.
Inside were humans. Upon awaking, they told us how they didn't remember a thing. They were very strange. But the strangest part was their genetic sequence. It was completely different than humans, but it encoded into creating a human, kind of like how you can solve a math problem in two ways.
