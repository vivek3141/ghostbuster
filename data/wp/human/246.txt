*Knock Knock*. The Man in the Yellow hat nervously rose from his chair. It was late, who could that be?
"Who's there?" He said, as he cautiously paced his way to the door.
"It's George."
The Man in the Yellow Hat stopped in his tracks. He didn't know anyone named George. Except for a monkey he had cared for a while back. But monkeys don't talk. The Man wondered if someone was playing a joke on him.
"It's OK. Please let me talk to you."
Without realizing it, the Man had arrived at the door. He slowly gripped the handle and let the door crack open. Looking down, he saw his familiar friend. He nearly fell over, but caught himself on the door, which swung open.
"George? How is this possible?"
"Something has happened to me and my friends. I don't remember much, but we awoke in a lab."
Mesmerized by his friend's words, the Man finally regained his composure.
"I'm sorry for my reaction, but you have to admit this is weird. Please come in George and have a seat." The Man led George to the couch. "Is there anything I can get you? A banana perhaps?"
"No thanks, "said George, climbing onto the couch. "I think we should talk."
"Yes, I supposed we should talk." The Man sat down in his chair across from George. "You said you don't remember much. You seem to remember me and your time here?"
"I don't remember much about what happened to me. I remember everything before that though. From before, when I couldn't put my thoughts together like I can now. I had to see you. I want to let you know how much our time meant to me.
The Man in the Yellow hat took off his hat and let out a gracious smile.
"I had a habit of getting into trouble and you were always there to save me. That time I swallowed the puzzle piece. *I still can't believe I did that*. That time with the kite when..." George trailed off, almost lost in thought. He curiously looked at the Man. "Say, do you still have that helicopter?"
