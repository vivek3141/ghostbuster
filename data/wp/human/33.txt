The world came crashing down in minutes. Many of us were asleep when it happened, and didn't find out about it until later. When we awoke, we saw the carnage spread through the land, and we wept.
There weren't many of us left, but what few there were managed to find each other over the Internet. We gathered together in what remained of a major city on the East Coast of what was once the United States. It took us time, but we eventually began to rebuild. The brightest among those who survived thought to ask "Why," while most of us were content with just surviving.
Years passed, and no link was found between us. Eventually, those who had the question resigned themselves to the fact that they would never know. They went to their new homes, and tried to integrate themselves as best they could into the new society.
It wasn't until 14 years after the event happened that the connection was discovered, quite by accident. One of the former questioners had taken a job as a mover, and was helping a fellow survivor move into a newly cleaned house. Sticking out of one of the boxes was the missing link.

Moments later, the realization struck him.
