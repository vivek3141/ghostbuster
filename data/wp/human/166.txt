The day has come. And I can't believe it. I have worked for reddit for so long now. I kept their servers alive. I worked endless hours when celebrities were doing AMA's to make sure it didn't crash. I typed furiously doing my own AMA telling everyone how awesome this whole thing was. I honestly thought reddit would be here long after my skills had deteriorated and I could no longer see the screen.
A year or so ago facebook went the way of myspace. And myspace is so far out of sight now that when you ask someone who is younger if they know what it is, they assume you are talking about something in the phone book days. I mean, come on! Who gets phone books delivered to their house printed out on paper! That's just stupid!
Anyway, I should have known then that we were becoming a thing of the past. Our user base was down. A lot, it turns out. But I thought it was fine. People would rediscover how awesome reddit was. People would flock back to us like hipsters flocked to oversizes glasses in the 10's. But it doesn't look like anyone is coming.
So today is the last day of reddit. Today I shut down the servers and walk away. Tomorrow, reddit will be a thing of the past that people will talk about with a loving remembrance but nothing more. There are new sites now, and maybe we will get mentioned on some of them. An old interview. An old meme. Something.
So, to anyone left out there (if there is anyone out there still) AMA. I am the last reddit employee and I will be shutting down the servers in a couple of hours. What do you want to know? What do you want to remember? What's your favorite reddit memory?
..... (one hour passes)
..... (another hour)
..... (three hours now)
...... (four hours, no responses. no votes. nothing)
Nothing? Ok then. It's time to go. Farewell old friend. It's been a fun ride.
