"No no no no! AW-Dammit!"
"Huh? What?"
"Why those pants? And on the new leather couch!"
"They're my comfy pants."
"*They're* made of steaks!"
"...well yeah that's what makes them comfy."
Her and I have had this talk before. I had always enjoyed her peculiar fashion sense, but had thought *wrongly* that it was limited to the stage and award shows.
"Sweety," I said "That doesn't look comfy. It looks like you've sat in the middle of someones misguided attempt to reconstruct a cow."
She pouted at me. I smiled back. She had a nice pout. We stared at eachother for a moment. Love's a strange thing - stranger even than the way my wife dresses. She eventually smiled and, defeated, I took my place next to her on the couch, snuggled up and readied myself for a movie.
"Oh?" She said "what are your pant's made of?"
"Cotton, my dear. Cotton."
