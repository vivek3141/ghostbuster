"We are out of toilet paper." He states, holding the cardboard tube in his hand.
"Yeah, I know." I can't be bothered; I am eyeball deep in internet research for a vacation spot for our rapidly approaching anniversary.
"You knew?"
"Yeah."
"Did you look for another roll?"
"No, we are out."
"Soâ€¦we are out of toilet paper?"
"Uh huh."
"You seem unperturbed by this."
"I am unperturbed by this."
"But we are out of toilet paper."
Looking up now I see the flop of hair that falls down in front of his eyes when he plays with it. He must be stressed if he is fiddling with it so, true to the thought he runs his hand through his hair and it does nothing to push it back, it flops down over his eyes once again. The perplexed look on his face makes my heart flip over. I smile just looking at him.
"I did something cute?" He says.
I nod.
"You are smiling, with that look."
"The look of love," I reply.
His eyebrows furrow in thought and he looks at the toilet paper roll. "Because of toilet paper?"
"Nope."
"I don't understand."
"You don't need to understand, love is without definition."
"I should go to the store and get toilet paper."
"Ok."
"I love you, "he says. "But not because of toilet paper."
"I know. I love you too and maybe just a little because of toilet paper."
