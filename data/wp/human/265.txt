"I wish you luck, Steven."
Everything has faded to gray so suddenly I almost did not unuderstand what happened. The kind lady was walking away. I was leaning against the wall, numbly looking at the sandwich she gave me. I didn't want to eat it for some reason.
I haven't talked to anyone in a while, months, years perhaps. Being a bum is more alineating than living alone on the island. My life was coming to an end, I knew it, and there was nothing left to do. I might never talk to a person ever again, I thought.
The tragedy, the injustice of my life came crushing down on me. No. I will not go like that.
I've emptied a jar of money I was saving for winter, I checked into a cheap hotel. I showered, shaved, bought clean clothes. Big dirty beard was hiding my face for so long I forgot how I looked like. Thin, tired man in his 40s. I almost look like a person now.
I slugged through the gray fog and went outside. Sun was shining but it was chilly. People walking down the sidewalk, rushing to work. I couldn't wait anymore.
I ran up to the first person, in desperation, said "Hi, I'm Steven!".
Slightly startled, he looked up from his phone "Hi, Steven, I'm Brad, what's up?"
And the colors returned.
