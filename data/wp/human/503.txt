I read a book one time, or was told to in class and just bullshitted the assignments instead, I can't remember, but anyway in this book a special thing gets dropped on accident into the ocean and it turns it all into ice. I just made the very same mistake, only I myself am that special thing and the ocean is the whole continent of Australia, and instead of turning it into ice I turned the whole freaking thing into a surface that you can eat off of. Sterile as my great-uncle Joe, who's 80 or near-abouts. What will this do to the country I fancy, you ask? Oh, you know, just wreck its entire ecosystem and make decomposition a thing of the past.
I just wanted to clean my spectacles, for Crocodile Dundee's sake. That's why I took off my signature gloves, and ironically that's also why I fell over...Didn't see the stick in time because my eyes are shit.
Sorry, Australia, and the people living on it. At least you won't be stepping in any old turds any time soon...
