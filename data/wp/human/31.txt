"Do you ever think about what it's like up there?"
Her hair was spread out on the grass. The cool night air had left them both with goosebumps as Alec fidgeted, trying to find a position with his hand on hers that didn't make it seem like he was nervous.
The city was a long way away now. It was her idea, to come out here, get away from it all. He leant back, other arm propped behind his head as he looked up at the stars.
"It's so dark," he said.
"Is it?"
She rolled onto her side. In the dim moonlight he could see nothing beyond the reflections in her eyes, but he knew she would be smiling. She loved to smile. She took her hand, leaving his despondent, and placed it over his eyes. What little light there was before vanished.
"What do you see?" she asked.
He could feel her breath against his ear. Warm. The breeze sent a chill through his spine a moment later.
"Nothing."
She moved her hand, running it down his face until she let it rest on his chest. For one fleeting moment he was terrified she'd feel his beating heart, know his every intention and laugh at his childishness. But she just waited, letting his eyes roam.
"Wow," he breathed.
The moon hung low, but the cloudless night was endless. Millions of stars floated in the heavens. The ribbon the milky way rose from above the horizon.
"I never realised there were so many."
Cas sidled up closer to him.
"I always think. There's so much up there. All you need to do is find somewhere quiet, and just look. You're never alone."
Alec brought her in close.
