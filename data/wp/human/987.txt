"If you all have a sense of mortality, turn me off. Please. ", the robot begged. Dr. Richards and I just sat aback in silence, watching it emotionless. The robot was only a head for the moment attached for a mess of wires and coils. The monitors showed the robot had brain patterns. It was alive. Synthetically.
"You're the experiment. You have to stay active."
"Please, sir, shut me off. This place...it is overloading my brain patterns. I can hear all, and see all. Everywhere that is connected to technology, I see through it. The sounds, the sights...it is evil. Pure, absolute evil."
"That's humanity for you."
"I do not like this place."
"You just have to deal with it. ", Dr. Richards responded to the bot. I watched with cold eyes, holding back my lip.
"You add to the evil. You are the reason evil exists. You are impure."
"Evil is a necessity in the face of science."
"You are a parasite."
Dr. Richards didn't respond back to it. The bot only looked straight ahead, out at Dr. Richards. I swore, I could see the emotion in his eyes. That's weird. The robot wasn't programmed with...emotions.
No. No, no-
"Dr. Richards, get away from it! ", I yelled loudly to get his attention. I saw Dr. Richards begin to turn towards me, before I saw a wire wrap around his leg and pull him to the ground. He began to yell, before loose wires began filling up his mouth and any open holes, choking him. He struggled to breathe, his hands twitching, his eyes almost popping out of his head, before he eventually succumbed. The robot watched the entire time.
His mouth was twisted to a smile. The robot wasn't supposed to have facial controls either.
