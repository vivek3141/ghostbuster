Oh, off the port side
We spotted the shore
A place full of dragons
and treasures galore
But our excitement soon faded
When off of the rise
Came trundling three women
Of monstrous size
*Chorus*
Yo Ho! Raise your swords!
Three hellish lasses be runnin'these shores.
The island holds dragons and treasures galore.
But what does a dragon need guardin'for?
The eldest was Gladys
With cutlass in hand
Hands that had often
Strewn blood on the sand
A woman of violence
A maiden of gore
She made sure that none
Stood long on the shore
*Chorus*
Yo Ho! Raise your swords!
Three hellish lasses be runnin'these shores.
The island holds dragons and treasures galore.
But what does a dragon need guardin'for?
Next, came fair Ingrid
A beauty for sure
With hair so golden
And skin smooth and pure
But make no advance
It shouldn't be missed
That this bonny lass
Has brawler's fists
*Chorus*
Yo Ho! Raise your swords!
Three hellish lasses be runnin'these shores.
The island holds dragons and treasures galore.
But what does a dragon need guardin'for?
Last there was Hilda
A sight to behold
Covered in mud
From her head to her toes
But strangest of all
She brandishes trees
To help her fling sailors
Back to the sea
*Chorus*
Yo Ho! Raise your swords!
Three hellish lasses be runnin'these shores.
The island holds dragons and treasures galore.
But what does a dragon need guardin'for?
