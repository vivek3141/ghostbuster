"....Now to just fix that semicolon, carry the one, add in the null set...and...Eureka! I've done it! I've proven God's existence!"
*A shadowy figure, who had been lurking in the corner for the last five minutes, clapped slowly for about 7.6 seconds, give or take. *
"Hello John. I hear that you've discovered proof of the existence of God," said the shadowy figure.
"Indeed I have! This is a momentous occasion!" John exclaimed. He had been working on this proof for years.
"I'm going to have to ask you to destroy it."
"Like hell I will."
"Indeed. Satan discovered proof of my existence too, and look what that got him." The shadowy figure stepped into the light. Gaudily bright white clothes sparkled in the dimly lit room. This guy had the figure of a septuagenarian marathon runner and a beard to rival the first Albus Dumbledore.
"Cosplaying as God, I take it?"
"You've discovered proof of my existence, I mysteriously popped out of a corner, and you've told nobody about this yet. For a genius, you're a fool."
"While I have proven God's existence, you are not him."
"I can make the whole planet rain for 40 days if you like."
"I bet you can."
"I'm not kidding."
"I don't doubt it."
"I have unbelievable powers."
"I don't doubt it."
"Your password is hunter42."
That took John by surprise, as he didn't know that you could pronounce asterisks that way. Surely this being was powerful and knowledgeable.
"I know. Look 'God,' you may be more powerful than me. You may be more factually retentive than I am. But the fact of the matter is that not only did I discover proof of God's existence, but I discovered against your wishes."
"Fine. The jig is up. I'm neither all-powerful nor all-knowing. But you're giving me that proof."
"No."
"No?!"
"I've proven an omniscient, omnipotent God. You may be a powerful alien, but you aren't God."
John thought for just a second more.
"Besides, If you were able to stop me, you wouldn't be asking."
The glimmering figure, seeing that all hope in the conversation was lost, materialized a green portal and walked away.
"You make a good point, John. Goodbye then."

John was now emboldened by his discovery. He spread his new religion to the far corners of the earth. Deism, once just a religion for the politically elite, quickly overcame the scientific community.
But then the common people revolted. Unmoved by math and reason, the world quickly fell to mass hysteria.
