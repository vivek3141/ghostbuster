"Throw that garbage out! Right now!"
Jackson flinched as the words were barked by his superior, but hastily grabbed up the sketches he has lain on his boss's desk mere moments ago.
"Are-are you sure he won't work as a character?" Jackson asked again, finding that his voice was growing thinner the more his boss's eyes furrowed.
"Throw it out, Jackson," the voice came out a bitter hiss, a darkness emanating from behind the mahogany desk. "Throw it out, or it's your job that's in the garbage."
Jackson nodded and quickly took off, dashing out of the office and back to his drawing desk.
He took one more sorrowed look at the sketch in his hands before sighing, feeding the leaves of paper into the shredder. He should have known not to show it to his boss. The artists around him had all complained about how offensive it was and that if that was the best Jackson could think of, he might as well turn in his resignation and burn his desk.
He guessed no one would ever like The OP.
