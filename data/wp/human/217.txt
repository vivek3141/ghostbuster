Trapped in a moment twixt coffee and tea
Caught in a moment, between you and me
Imagine I'll stand; That I'll own what I say.
Don't leave it lying unspoken to fester
Don't wrap around in an intricate knot,
Shake off the lethargy,
Forsake bright fear,
And claim my sin wholeheartedly.
.
No longer to live in half-realized moments
trapped like still dust motes, caught in warm amber
the comfort of every day turning to see
the same tired spaces between you and me
.
But listen; imagine this:
.
Step past the silences
Bare my throat freely
Stab at hope with the words from my lips
A prize worth the risking
A thought that's worth speaking
A secret worth telling, no matter the price.
.
And if when there's nothing more to say
You grab your heart and walk away
if after all of that, I am left
standing alone at the top of the stairs
a pompous presumer, caught unawares
then at least I can know that you speak truly
when you say that I am brave.
.
Note: Can't figure out how to get actual blank lines, so I just put a period on them to try to make it work? Although my lack of formatting knowledge is pissing me off.
