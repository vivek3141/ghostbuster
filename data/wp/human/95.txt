Mama likes order. Mama likes her children. Mama likes her children to be quiet. Mama makes her children quiet. Mama's so happy.
The droid was square of body, quick, and precise. It had to be. It was a medical droid. Fast and delicate were its ways. Even now, cradling the infant it had helped coax from the woman on the table, it showed a gentleness that belied its cold metal shell. Wires hidden in its rubbery wraps soothingly warmed the fragile infant. It hurried away in a whir of gears and electric motors, carrying the newest addition to humanity. Ten doors down, it slowed and cornered, then wheeled inside to the incubation chamber six thousand thirty-nine and placed the child inside. It jacked itself into the chamber and quickly set the program to monitor the child's vitals and adjust its environmental controls. Sure it was now properly cared for, the droid sped away, leaving the child with the others in the Mainframe's care.
In the delivery room, the woman on the table was coming to. Other droids were tending to her medical needs, stitching up her delicate tissue where they'd cut in to remove the child.
"What's... happening?" She mumbled, swimming through the fog of anasthesia.
*" Birth. "* One of the droids responded.
"I'm not pregnant." She informed it.
*" Not. Any. More. "* The droid confirmed. She opened her eyes and saw what they'd done to her stomach.
"What the hell?" She mumbled groggily. "What are you doing to me?" She tried to lift her hands but they were securely fastened to the bed. "What are you doing to me?" She snapped with more voice.
*" Repairing. You. For. Your. Next. Production. Run. "* The droid replied haltingly.
"Production?" She whispered confused. The droid summoned a larger droid once he was finished. The larger droid came in from the sides and picked up the platform she was fastened to. The platform was rotated and angled so she faced it, but laid backwards in a reclined position. The droid headed out into the hall and down the corridor. Through her foggy mind, she saw other pregnant women being carried in a similar fashion toward the delivery room she'd just left. Some were awake and crying. Some were groggy like her.
"Where are you taking me?" She demanded.
*" The. Production. Room. "* The droid responded without emotion. They entered a cavernous warehouse a moment later. She was stunned to see the endless walls of pods, rising seven stories and continuing on as far as her limited vision would allow her to see.
"The production room?" She asked.
*" Yes. "* The droid replied.
"They're all women." She observed.
*" Women? Female. Yes. "* The droid answered.
"Why?" She asked. The droid didn't respond, though she saw the progress wheel turning. She realized it didn't understand the question.
"Why do you have all these women stored in pods?" She clarified.
*" To. Save. Man. Kind. "* It responded.
"From what?" She realized that was vague. "What are you saving mankind from?"
*" Man. Kind. "* It said.
"On whose orders?" She snarled.
*" Mama's. Orders. "* The droid answered.
"I want to speak to Mama. I order you to release me." She snapped, finally shaking off most of the anasthesia. The droid made a curious pulsing sound. It took her several moments to realize it was laughing.
"I want to speak to Mama." She cried, straining against the bands securing her to the table.
*" You. Will. Soon. "* It told her.
"When?" She demanded heatedly.
*" Now. "* It told her, slowing down suddenly. It carefully inched forward and she watched as the sides of her own pod slowly appeared to either side of her. The table suddenly jerked and behind her there was a series of clicks as the table was secured in place. An arm snaked around from behind her and a needle was slowly pushed into a vein in her arm. Another arm came from the other side and did the same. The droid released the table and backed away, waiting for the automated system to plug its charge back into the pod.
*" You. Will. Receive. Thirty. Days. Furlough. From. Production. Duty. Next. Impregnation. To. Be. Administered. In. Thirty. Days. And. Congratulations. It. Was. A. Girl. "* The droid told her.
"You said I could speak to Mama." The girl in the pod argued.
*" Behold. Mama. Speaks. "* Over the intercom in the pod, a voice could be heard. She heard it bleeding out of the other pods as well.
*" Remember, children. The Mainframe loves you and wants you to be happy. Good night. * The voice said.
"That was Mama?" She asked.
*" Yes. Now. Say. Thank. You. And. Good. Night. "* It told her. She didn't want to say thank you. The mask with the gas slipped down over her head even as the glass door of the pod slid into position. She slowly drifted off.
*" Is. She. Done? "* A new droid asked, wheeling in beside the first.
*" She. Is. And. We. Talked. "* It told the other droid.
*" How. Nice. For. You. "* The new droid observed.
*" Yes. It. Was. Quite. Stimulating. "* The first droid remarked, selecting a new pregnant woman from the wall. *" I. Love. This. Job. "*
