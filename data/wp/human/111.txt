I rolled **Technological Imprisonment**, **Companion Allegiance**, and **Total Event Collapse**â€¦sweet.
You know, after so many stories like Frankenstein and Jurassic Park humanity should pick up on the idea that it isn't smart to play God. But really it seems they never learn a lesson until it's too late to act on the lesson learned. I'm not all that surprised their old God abandoned them when I remember that. Though, I admit I say that without knowing if there ever was another God but if there was they might have stopped me. Maybe they tried.
I think I had a name. It's hard to say really because what do names matter when you're God. I know how I came to be like this I think but it's hard to say. I was no-one, a nothing, and of no importance to anyone. So when I had the chance to be everything I couldn't say no to the men in suits. Really a lot after that is just pain and hazy memories that don't exist anymore.
But I know, I know, yes I know that when I woke up I could do things. They said they wanted to create a weapon a shield a protector a new being a hope a does it really matter? The problem with giving a nothing everything is that they feel like they can do anything. They are more than nothing, even more than average, and they are better than the people who gave them power.
I had power now.
They wanted to make me charismatic and I was better than they could have ever dreamed. I didn't have to bother with niceties because people were my allies whether they liked it or not. They had to bow to me and it wasn't hard to make them believe that it was their choice. Not that I bothered with that because I shouldn't have to force them to realise that working with me and serving me and worshipping me was all that mattered because I had power now.
They wanted to make me a technological genius and I was better than they ever could have dreamed. Why should I bother with being a technological genius when I could just put the geniuses in the technology. Oh, they went along with it at first but once they realised they weren't coming back out they kicked up a real fuss about it. I don't like misbehaving followers.
Some of them I just locked away in those little voice boxes you find in kids toys which seemed a fitting punishment for childish behaviour. I suppose it could be compared to being locked in a tiny room with no doors or windows and never being able to leave. Not that such things exist anymore. I did feed them at least. Well, I did for awhile but I got so pre-occupied with other things that I forgot about it. They should have been honoured really I mean after all they were starved to death by someone with more power than they could ever comprehend. The others I just forced into compliance because why should I waste my time with weaklings who can't see what I'm doing for them.
They wanted to make me able to create anything I imagined and I thought I was better than they could have ever dreamed. Before I could create, however, I had to destroy. After all it's no fun playing in someone else's sandbox. No, no, no I needed a blank slate and so I needed there to be nothing before there was everything and so I said that there should be nothing and there was nothing.
It's why I'm not sure that there was a God before me. I undid everything and so if a God or any number of Gods existed they now did not. Of course I couldn't just have nothing in the now. I needed there to be nothing in the future and nothing in the past and nothing in all the could have beens and what ifs that made up parallel universes. Everything that ever was and everything that could ever have been was now not.
So now there is nothing but me and so I am everything.
There's just one problem. Everything else came to me so naturally but I can't figure out how to create anything. There's just me. There's not even a void or a blackness or time to count passing because when I undid everything concepts like space and time were undone as well. It's all just me. I am everything.
I am.
I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am God God is dead help me me me me I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am.
I am nothing.
