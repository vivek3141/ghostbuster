Judas betrayed the Lord and admired his bag of silver; but shortly. A spiritual goblin become conqueror of our story's gallant hero. Victory to Judas sounded like the rattling of a purse full of loose coin; a decidedly lacking denouement to the greatest story ever told.
However, this story wasn't his to steal, and the divine author had other plans for the third act. The cherubic wordsmith skillfully ushered said Judas to his own grisly, self-induced exit from this great drama, making him a mere plot device in an overarching and intricate story. Heartbroken and regretful, history's Iscariot hung himself in a Potter's Field, shitting himself in one final act of scene-stealing defiance. The Lord then died, and rose again; ever the hero of his own tale.
