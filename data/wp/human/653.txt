"Ok, everyone. I'll be reading a brief statement and I ask that you please hold all of your questions until the end. As you may know, the President was scheduled to make a stop in Arizona this morning to meet with Governor Brewer. Afterwards, he took the motorcade south to visit the border area and meet with guards. And I'm afraid to report that there was a serious accident on the way, and the President has died."
*Cameras click, reporters shout questions, and the Press Secretary holds up his hand to try to quiet them down. *
"As best we can determine, the driver for the president's limousine in Arizona was not properly vetted with the Secret Service. Or there was some sort of mix-up and the President was put into the wrong vehicle; we're still trying to establish exactly what went wrong and how this individual ended up at the wheel. Based on recordings from the driver seat, this individual seemed to be harboring a deep grudge against some of the wildlife in Arizona's nature preserves. He did not directly threaten the President, but instead went off the road in an attempt to kill birds native to the area. We are also looking into the possibility that he was experiencing hallucinations: at one point, he mentions following a bird into a tunnel, followed shortly by the sounds of a loud impact that match with hitting a wall or some other solid object. The recording also captures a 'meep meep' sound that may be another driver's horn. We are still trying to locate this potential witness."
*Reporters again try to interject with questions. The Press Secretary continues reading*.
"The President and this madman both survived that initial impact, as far as we can determine. In the recording, you can hear the President in the back seat, demanding to know why the driver is strapping missiles to the limousine. The driver only grumbles in response. As best we can tell, the driver then activated these rockets, sending the car careening through the desert and straight over a sheer cliff, plummeting straight into the canyon below. Beyond the wreckage of the car, the only evidence found at the scene was a wooden placard reading "Oops!"
*More questions are shouted. *
"Finally, the American people should be reassured that this is not part of a larger terror plot. This 'Wile E. Coyote' was a lone wolf, acting alone. However, his credit card bills indicate that he regularly purchased dangerous weapons and traps, though those items have not been located. We are investigating his ties to a potential illicit arms smuggling ring connected to the Acme Corporation, which is known to supply North Korea with weapons and equipment."
