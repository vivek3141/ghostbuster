It had been a long day. He knew what was coming, yet he still had to do his job. He stared out at the waiting sea, a nearby lighthouse brightening the area for a second, before continuing out to sea. He lit up his third cigarette, in what seemed like the last ten minutes standing on the shore. He wanted to delay as long as possible, but it was inevitable.
& nbsp;
Sucking deep on his cigarette, he cast the spell that allowed the beacon to appear. He had chosen a green triangle, a small dash removed near the top on one of the lines. It was his mark, and a completed triangle usually meant a trap. Something that forced him to cast the beacon unwillingly. The other five guardians knew that.
& nbsp;
The next five minutes were unbearable. He looked out over the water for what was coming, but time seemed to draw on longer and longer the more he waited. After ten minutes, he was ready to give up and walk away. The beacon was set, they must have seen it, he could just-
& nbsp;
"SCREEEEEE!" The sound that came from over the horizon was horrifying to say the least. But he knew that high pitched noise from anywhere. She was coming. He looked over the ocean carefully, and saw it. The small animals figure grew larger and larger as it got closer and closer. The creatures large feet patting against the surface of the water as it ran, like it was running on solid ground.
& nbsp;
There was still time. He could run. She may not have seen him yet. "PETROVAAAAAA!" the rabbit-like creature called as it neared the beach. It was over. He was done for. The rabbit collided into Petrova, knocking him to the ground, both tumbling around each other like until they hit a rock a few metres back from the collision site.
& nbsp;
"Hello, Lily." He grunted, trying to show as much disappointment to see her as he could. She snuggled her head up on his chest and wrapped her arms around him, trying to get in closer than physics allowed.
& nbsp;
"Petrova! It's been so long! I thought we'd never see each other again! How have you been? Did you learn some new magic? Ooh, I got myself an apprentice! You should really get one too. We need to have six guardians, and if something happened to you, oh I can't bear the thought." While Lily prattled on, barely taking a breath between each sentence, Petrova pushed her off and got to his feet. He pulled out a new cigarette and lit it.
"Come on, we have to move to the second point." Lily stopped talking for a second.
"Second point? How many Guardians are you summoning?"
"All of them."
"Come on Petrova, stop being gruff for one second and tell me honestly. How many are we really summoning?" Petrova finished his cigarette and turned to Lily.
"I'm a goat. We are meant to be gruff. And we need the whole council on this one."
"Why? What's happening?"
"The Bull is back."
