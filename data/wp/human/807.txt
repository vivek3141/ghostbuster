They stood there waiting in anticipation. Well, one of them was.
"I shouldn't be in Hell! Surely this is wrong! God damn this place" said the 'bad' man
"Well that was a mistake"
"Easier for you to say, you're going to Heaven for nothing"
"Actually I donated 95% of my salary to charity which helped millions"
"Oh. That's probably why I'm going to Hell. I guess only the rich go to Heaven" The other man pondered this.
At that moment a black portal opened and sucked him into Hell before the 'good' man could retort. He turned to the other one who hadn't spoke yet.
"So where are you going?"
"I'm neither coming and going" The 'good' man was flabbergasted "How do you mean? You must go somewhere. Heaven or Hell?"
"But I'm not a Christian."
"Ah. Strange you're here then"
"Yep"
A golden elevator came down and the 'good' man stepped on it without saying goodbye. The last man was alone.
"Now what?" He thought to himself. Forever.
