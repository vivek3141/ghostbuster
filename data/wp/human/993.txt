March through the den, a war without end;
Smoke in the air, soldiers laid bare;
Feet soaking wet, filled with regret.
Such was the grief on that cold Christmas eve.
---- -
Fight for your country! Fight without end!
Screamed the poster in the fog of my head.
I try to forget bodily behest
And escape into my cold soldier-wear.
------
Then, a sound, the singing of men-
Good grief, it wasn't our side, it was them!
They were playing music, the whole lot of them,
Beckoning us to come over to theirs.
-------
March through the den, a war without end;
Christmas was over, the war wasn't yet.
But in our hearts a warmth was alight-
Such were the mem'ries that warm Christmas night.
