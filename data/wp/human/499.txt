He's such a dick sometimes. Being on-call for that guy is a 24/7 duty. One time I was on a date and he did the same thing when I was in the bathroom. I was guaranteed to score. When I came out of the bathroom, I tried to keep a smile on my face. But that's what I get. These looks didn't come cheap. The dude has an ironic aura to everything he does.
So after his distasteful drop-in, I couldnt help but give a sarcastic sigh. Effectively starting my shift until he says "no mas," I could only wonder what the red man wanted this time. Would I have to scare kids by hiding under their beds? Possess some poor sucker in front of his family? Make a shmuck like me shit his pants on a date as some sort of reminder of how often it happens to me? I really had no idea.
Being a demon sounds cool on paper, and all you have to do is the occasional "bidding," but at least give me a task with just a little bit of substance. Or at least let me pick my own hours. This shit is tiresome. Nobody learns about or fears you since they don't even know you exist. And the things you're asked to do aren't exactly of biblical proportions. That whole getting YOLO to become the viral shit storm it is was my idea the entire time, but no, he needed the credit.
So as I sat there, struggling to get the energy to get out of bed, I gave the ceiling one last hard glance, shook my head, and swung my legs out of bed. As I made my way to the bathroom through a giant pile of dirty clothes on the floor, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. And damn, did I look good.
