So here i am...again for the, i think 40th time, i dont know its somewhere aeound there. Anyway lets try not to get of topic here kiddo that cookie jar will be ours. I know you don't remember this kid, but our last plan was crap. We should have not tried to climb a turned on stove, but this time my plan is full proof. Nooo stop eating your snot kid your gonna ruin your apitite and now you poopes yourself great. Well soiled or not we're getting that jar from the counter. So i need you to trust me kid old Gemini cricket here has a great plan. You should totally put a fork in that elecrical socket then through that freak accident youll be able to fly to the jar. Ready baby, good now stick it in the.... (some time traveling, body inserting stuff happens) oh for fu...End?
