I have a recurring dream, you are always in it.
You are more scared than i have ever known you to be. Your mouth is bent and twisted. I would call it a look of dismay, but dismay is a human emotion. Your face is not that of a woman's. Your face is marred with desperate, animal, panic. Your face, is a mask of terror, unshackled from social graces, like a crying infant, a dying dog.
Figures in the background bob and dance.
They whisper. Their voices are deep, their laughter is confusing.
The words send you spinning. The darkness melts away, the sinister void gives way to brick and stone.
The comfort of familiarity is gone. In this place there is no sky. This world is an aberration, it exists between the cracks.
You sit for a awhile and weep. I can feel your sadness. You miss the ones you love.
You run, in an alien world. You see the black slim, sandwiched between two cracked. You see it for a second, but that's all it takes. You blink. The slime is growing through the brick. As a torrent it breaks through the stone walls. It pours in with ferocity and force.
The black slime moves quickly, coating the walls as you run. You are cornered, turning around to come face to face with a wall of the corrosive goo. A single eye opens in its centre, followed by thousands more as tendrils slowly slither towards you. I embrace you with my appendages, sloppy and jagged. I take everything you are. I taste you and remember.
I listen and, sometimes, i can hear.
Forever-we dream our dreams, together.
