Two women walked in the room. My stroke took my sight, my voice, so I couldn't see them, but I felt a change. My wife's hand gripped me harder. I didn't have to ask who it is. It was the other woman and her wife, the woman I should have been.
"I'll be outside," my wife said. I heard the floor creak as she left, ran down the stairs. They came closer. I felt their warmth.
"Look at him," R said. Her name was R. My name, if I had lived that life, would be B. It doesn't matter. I chose this life. And I'm dying.
"I am so glad I'm with you," the other voice said. My voice. My femme voice. "He's really fat."
"It was a stroke."
"I did eat when I was upset."
Why was she, am I, using past tense? Was this mute body some object lesson, to show her she chose wisely?
"I love you. Thank you."
"I love you. I know you've been doubting yourself, so I thought this would show you you did good."
I heard them walk out, down the stairs, out the door. And then I remembered where I kept the clothes I didn't wear, the hormones I never took, the life I should have lived, and I wished I could cry.
