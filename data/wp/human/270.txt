Encyclopedia Man had always wanted to be a superhero, and finally his powers had awoken at the age of thirty-five, but unfortunately it was the power to remember each and every page of the encyclopedia he had read as a child.
At least it wasn't as bad as Oxford Man. He was a living dictionary and thesauruses, fighting people with proper grammar and spelling and all those editorial things people ignore in this day an age.
Encyclopedia Man had found Oxford one day about to jump to his death off of the Golden Gate bridge because 'twerking' had officially become a word. He had managed to talk Oxford from jumping off the bridge and now they sat on a bench watching the sunset.
"Twerking. Who the hell comes up with these words?" Oxford sobbed.
"Well, at least your information is up to date." Encyclopedia Man comforted. "According to my powers, the USSR is still intact, and Pluto is still a planet."
Oxford sniffed.
"You really are useless, aren't you?" Oxford said.
Encyclopedia sighed. "Yes. Yes I am."
"Well, don't worry. I'm sure the hipsters will come to love you." Oxford comforted.
Encyclopedia rolled his eyes.
