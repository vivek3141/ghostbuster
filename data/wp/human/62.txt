I was ushered into a dark room, where I see a man sitting in the dark wearing a black suit and his gold chain shining in what little light is in the room. I'm thrown onto the ground. I know why I'm here. The last words I want to hear come out of his mouth "Where my money?" I start crying trying to explain where my mom has went. BAM! I get kicked in the face. "WHERES MY FUCKING MONEY!?"
Two weeks later, I'm sitting in my apartment shaking from withdraw. I have been doing cocaine for too damn long. All my money is being sucked away by this terrible habit formed from parting to much. "What have I done?" The sweat drips down my forehead as I hear my phone buzz. I pick it up. The text reads "You want some more of the good stuff?" A giant smile grows on my face. I respond letting my dealer know that I'm in dire need of a hookup but, spent all of my money earlier. Kevin, my dealer, texts back with "I can give you some now, but, you'll have to pay more when you do get money." I agree. I get the cocaine and never speak to him again.
Two weeks later. My door gets a knock on it. I have no clue who could be at the door at 9 p.m. I try to look through my peep hole, but, its shattered. I open the door cautiously. I'm punched and I fall to the ground. I catch a glimpse of two people in leather jackets before I pass out. I wake up in the back of a car. I have no clue what is going on. We stop. The trunk opens and a man in staring at me. He pulls me out and drags me into a building I had never seen. The smell of his cologne could cover a dumpster. I was ushered in and thrown onto the floor.
A man sitting in the dark room was what I saw.
I had only heard of this man.
He was known as 'The Cocaine God '
