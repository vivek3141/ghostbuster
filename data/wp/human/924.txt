I knew I should not have eaten all that chili.
Jason, my boyfriend, was very concerned that I wouldn't eat. It was after all, his mother's favorite dish to serve and he knew I didn't like chili.
His Mom was ruthless as she brought out the huge bowls of chili. The beans were prominent. White and red and...lot's of them. I practically gulped down the first bowl. I had to make sure that I was on board with my beloved's Mom.
I was reluctant to refuse the second bowl. But honestly, I was already weak in the knees. His Mother smiled at me. It was not a friendly smile.
The third bowl of chili I ate, she scowled at Jason. He just shrugged and gave a weak smile. Bastard. The fourth became a practical choice. And after the fifth bowl of chili Jason looked at me wide-eyed (mouthing when his Mom wasn't looking, "you don't have to eat anymore.") I think he was scared.
His Mother looked at me with new interest. She loved me then. And I think Jason had an epiphany.
Which is a good thing considering the results of the pregnancy test.
