They met on a club, she wasn't supposed to be there.
He asked her to dance, and after much hesitation she agreed.
They had common friends, so they would see each other often.
She was taken, and could only see him as a friend.
Years passed and they continued talking, him waiting for her to realize they were meant to be together.
"I see us growing old together, complaining about the world and how it changes, side by side, in old wooden rocking chairs," he joked.
He warned her he couldn't wait forever.
When she finally realized it, he had found someone else.
Both being so faithful, they only dared to speak but once more.
"I guess I'll see you later on then," he said.
"In our old, wooden, rocking chairs," she whispered as she left.
