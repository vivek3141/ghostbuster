Hi. I'm Jim. I may just be a sapling at the moment but one day I want to be human. I see them running around, on legs and feet, flailing their arms, jumping, dancing; Free. They know how to stay warm, how to move no matter whether the sun is near or far. They breathe air. Oh, of course photosynthesis is close but every time I grow, it's a step towards being a part of Mother Plant. She's the one who makes the giant balls and sends them up to the sky; planets is what I heard a human call them. The planets are beautiful once they reach the nighttime sky, they shine to be the brightest stars. It's a big task The Mother has, to fill the nighttime sky with stars so beautiful they light the whole sky. But humans...well what can I say? They've chosen their own paths, each path being so different from another...I can't help thinking that maybe, just maybe I don't belong here. Maybe I can do more than make planets. Maybe I could dance and shout and...and...... RUN.
