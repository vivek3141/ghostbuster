Marry held the pills in her hand and looked intently at the clock. Everyone else in he room was too. Everyone in the country was, as far as they knew.
And it was almost time.
"Ten!" The crowd all said in unison, as noon approached.
"Nine! Eight! Seven! Six!" Marry held the pill and her water close to her mouth.
"Five! Four! Three! Two! One!" And then there was silence as everyone popped their pills and sipped their water.
"Happy simultaneous medication day everyone" Marry told the room. Everyone nodded and began filtering out of the break room back to their jobs, confident the stigma of many medications had been eroded with their brave mass dosing.
The next day Marry got pregnant. Unfortunately for her and many other woman on no other medications, the American Simultaneous Medication Time didn't correspond with her usual birth control routine at all.
