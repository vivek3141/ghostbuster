Safirameal chuckeld to himself. Finally someone had fallen for his act! Tobias-14 was as gullible and naive as a demon could wish for.
Tobias-14: And it won't hurt? For real?
Safi-boy: Of course not. And if it does, we can stop anytime you want.
Tobias-14: I've never done it before...
Safi-boy: But lots of cool boys your age have. They just don't talk about it. Ever. Don't you want to be cool?
Tobias-14: I am cool. Fine. let's do it.
Safirameal couldn't believe his luck. A children's soul and body! Without any constraints on the possession! Insane!
Safi-boy: Just put your hands on the screen and relax. Let me inside.
He stretched, reaching across dimensions to the computer screen in front of a little boy.
Contact.
With an almost orgiastic shiver Safirameal stretched into the boy, filling the body, connecting to the sou...connecting to the s...connecting...
Blank.
Nothingness.
Safirameal screamed into the blackness as he fell and fell and fell...
Nothing. No evil. No good.
In his room Tobias opened the now black eyes. "Aah." his voice reverberated and growled with strange echoes and feedbacks. His eyes strayed to Mr.Meowzer. The corpse lay rotting in a corner. Tobias had wanted to know what was inside the feline body. Now the demon inside him felt glee at the side and so felt Tobias. He smiled "So this is how it feels to feel"
He turned to his window. Lots of world out there. So much to do...
