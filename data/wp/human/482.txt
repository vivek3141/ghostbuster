I kicked in the door, turned on the flash light and saw it sitting there among the old shelves long empty, an old copy of the bible, the leather was cracked and the pages torn but it was real a bible I could fork my fingers threw. It was unlike other books I had bought and sold it was written all over almost every page was filled with notes and reflections on the gospels I'd seen books like this go at the underground auctions millions of units billions if I could find the right buyer I could be set for life but I could see the value in this book. This isn't just a book this is a piece of art I will not sell this.
