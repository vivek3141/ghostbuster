By every law of physics, what he saw in front of his eyes should be impossible, yet there it was, existing. The 1960 silver dime hovered in the air, rotating slowly one direction, and then other, lazily, but seeming to vibrate like hummingbird wings. White light collected in the surface of the dime and slid fluidly over to the other side, flowing over the angles of Roosevelt's tiny silver face.
Erik's eyes slitted in concentration, his breath escaping his chest in harsh rasps. Sweat rolled down his scalp through his shaggy brown hair, his brain boiling with the effort in his skull. *I can't believe it's working...it's finally happening*, he thought, and his sudden fear at his success broke his nerve. The dime tinged down on the worn oaken surface of the table, and Erik broke in to nervous high-pitched laughter.
"I can do this," he stammered, choking on his words through panicky laughter. *" I can really do it! "* A slow trickle of blood was running from his left tear duct, but Erik had yet to notice it.
"I CAN DO IT!" he screamed jubilantly, and the thin trail of blood made a sudden jag off his cheekbone, collecting in his haggard beard stubble as he threw his arms in the air in celebration.
