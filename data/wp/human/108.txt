- So, what happened?
Well, I'm out chilling on my patio. Feet in the paddling pool, couple of beers and that fucking great new album Joey recommended on the speakers.
Suddenly some bloke runs up, panting and sweating. To be fair it was fucking warm that day, but he looked pathetic. He was whimpering and moaning that someone was trying to kill him. 'There's something off here', I thought to myself, 'he's either nuts or deserved what's coming to him'. There was something fishy about the man, a guilty, awkward look to him.
'Calm down mate, what's the problem?' I say.
'Hide me, hide me, he's coming', the guy goes, all high pitched and nervy.
By now I'm suspicious as fuck and there's no way I'm hiding this slug of a man. And then, just as I'm about to tell him to get to fuck, Joey comes legging it round the corner and down my path.
'Fucking peado cunt!' He yells.
Bloke tries to run but I trip him over. Gave him a right good boot. Instinct, right. Believe my man Joss before even speaking to him. And then, before I can ask even ask what's going on, Joey has hit the guy in the temple with this fucking spade. Sideways on, like. I've gotta be honest, I looked away but I don't think he stopped hitting him for a while.
What you expect the man to do though? This man was leeching on his 12 year old son. The man's a brute. I apologise for my language, but I say it as I see it. Joey's a good man, and you've already proved the guy was grooming his son. Self defence, innit.
- No more questions your honour.
