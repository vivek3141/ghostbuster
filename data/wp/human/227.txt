"Do you know why the lights twinkle from far away?" I feel the hum of his body next to mine as he asks. Warm, familiar, safe.
"No?"
"Air pressure."
Air pressure. How pragmatic.
"I like it" I reply softly, continuing to gaze westward toward the glittering lights of traffic meandering by.
"It has to do with hot and cold air coming together "he places his hand on my hip still standing next to me and looking out. Pondering the science of air temperature and distance. The beauty of looking at lights, third floor, parking garage.
Reduced. To air pressure.
And I too feel reduced. Like the magic of light.
Buried among all his facts I'm still here waiting. For the truth.
Because I've shared enough for him to destroy me, and he's talking about -
"Air pressure..." I turn abruptly to face him. This is it. This back and forth has been going on for 3 months and 2 days (not that I'm counting) and I can't stand not knowing who we are right now.
"I love you."
He turns away from the lights slowly, his brow furrowed as thought he hasn't heard me correctly.
"I love you" I say directly to his face. "I love a boy who takes pictures with books about fish, and tells me I'm beautiful, and makes me smile when my day is shit, and smells my hair, and holds me outside. But I hate the man who is distant, and stubborn, and selfish, and can't make up his mind, and let's me sit here thinking about air pressure instead of the magic of lights."
He's looking at me. Golden eyes shaded by shadow and the glow of the moon.
"Look" I say softly, eyes focused on his chest, "I know you're married and I'm engaged. I'm not asking you to run away with me or anything like that. I don't think either of us want that. But we both want this. And I love you. I want to keep kissing you, and having you hold me. I want our moments to continue."
He raises his hand to touch my cheek and I melt in to him, kissing him like never before.
