This was the 42nd time we redid the referendum.
By now, everybody was just tired with the whole thing and wanted to get it over with.
It was clear the eurocrats were not humans, but machines that would never give an inch until the outcome of the vote was right.
It was clear that all the SJWs would bully everyone into submission by flooding their facebook and twitter accounts.
As for me, I don't have social media accounts. I don't even have TV in my neck of the woods. I only know I was determined to keep voting Leave until the bitter end.
That morning, the results had all come in and the result was finally overwhelmingly in favor of the EU. So crushing was the defeat that the whole night it looked like it would be a 100% victory, even though the turnout was barely above the required 75%, many people having just given up and just decided to hide in their basements to not be rounded up to vote in the camps.
However, one person, in one small village in Wales, the village of Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, had voted to leave the EU.
I knew they would come for me. Even though their victory was total, they would not tolerate even a small stain on it. But I was prepared. I had stashed food, ammunitions for my AR-15, and I had mustered all my courage and resolution for this final showdown.
Rule Britannia! Rule the waves! Britons never will be slaves!
