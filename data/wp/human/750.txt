What happens when the word I look for doesn't exists? When words to describe the pain I feel aren't in the dictionary? My pen fails to find the words my mind struggles to find, what kind of misery is that? What hell would that be to not be able to find the words to describe how you feel? When the human lexicon limits my thoughts to a babble of ignorance.
Yet here I sit in this long forgotten bedroom, sipping on this bottle of whiskey hidden in the dresser. This world became unrelenting long ago after the fall. I sit penning away, I doubt anyone will ever read this suicide note. I sit reminiscing at my only photo of my long forgotten family. My child, so young, so adorable, much to young. My beloved wife, so gorgeous, she would die for me. Better now that they don't see me like this. Or this world now. I don't know the man that will kill me, long ago I turned into something I couldn't stand. I won't think about my family, it's just to much to take while I do it. I think about life back in the world, the way it was, I pray for my soul, and my sins. Whoever finds this bury my body with a cross, I always was a religious man, none of us are doing gods will, but maybe he can remember who we were.
