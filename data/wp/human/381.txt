This is the last one. This is the last one. THIS IS THE LAST ONE.
Keep putting one foot forward. One after the other.
DON'T LOOK AT HIM. Don't look at him He's trying to swing your emotions with his eyes.
Focus.
Focus on the task.
Focus on your blade.
Nothing else matters.
Nothing else matters till after the job is done.

Ten more steps. Ten.
Why am I doing this again?
NO. No doubts. Cannot doubt. I've gone too far to doubt myself.
Nine.
Look how helpless he looks. Wriggling in the chair. The poor bastard doesn't have any let up, does...
DO NOT LOOK.
Eight.
Looking always makes it harder.
Seven.
But I love to look at the hopelessness in their eyes.
I like to know that I'm the last thing they'll ever see before eternal damnation.
Six.
The bastard needs to stop moaning. No one can hear his cries on the outside.
No one can help him.
No one.
Five.
Halfway there. Halfway to being done with this bullshit.
Four.
I don't even know why they chose me for this. What did they see in me?
Perhaps...
Three.
They saw my will to kill and not feel.
They saw my vulnerability, my ability to null my feelings.
They saw what I DID. THEY SAW ALL OF IT.
TWO.
THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME. (breathing intensifies)
They just think I'm a pawn in their little game.
ONE.
WELL THEY CAN THINK AGAIN.
zero.
(the swish of a blade. a clean cut by the sound of it)
(the sound of a head rolling a few meters before coming to a halt)
this can't be my last. they told me it would be.
but i have other plans now.
now everything matters.
