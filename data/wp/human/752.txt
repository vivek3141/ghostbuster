"Click Me" submitted just now by ClickMe to /r/pics
It's the only thing on the page. For days, everything has been silent. The world has been void of news, dope memes, and cute animals. You've been alone, sitting in your chair and staring at the screen clicking "Refresh" in the hopes that even a subreddit like /r/Terriblefacebookmemes would post something. Alas, only you have logged on and only you have posted anything...But now, there was a post on /r/all! It was terrifying. What if it was some sort of joke? A weird beta error of some sort? You decided it didn't matter- you had to click it. There was no other way.
You clicked the link.
It took you to Imgur, where a single picture resided on the page in front of you. It was a screenshotted satellite map of your neighborhood, and your home was circled. The other houses were each crossed out with a thick black "X" and only yours remained clear.
Your palms were sweating, and you gulped as icy fear gripped your spine. Your shaky fingers typed "What is this? Who are you, OP?" into the comments.
A moment passed.
OP replied: "A list...And, I'm a friend."
"A friend? Of who?" You typed. "And what exactly is this a list of."
Another moment.
"Think of it as a list of potential candidates. None of the other redditors have proved worthy...and you, I'm afraid, are the last one. Now, I suggest you put some pants on, because I am going to be paying you a visit very soon."
You replied a number of times, but to no avail. It seemed OP, whoever they were, was going to be coming by. You locked all your doors and windows, and crawled to sit by the front door with a knife from the kitchen in your hand. Hours passed, and the silence was driving you insane.
You started to drift.
There was a soft scuffle on the porch, and then a hard knock on the door.
You looked out the peep-hole.
It was Gabe Newell, holding a copy of Half-Life 3.
You sighed, smiled, dropped the knife, and opened the door.
It was just a dream, after all.
