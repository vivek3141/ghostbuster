Bang. Bang.
Two knocks on the closed hatch of the chronotransport. With dizzying alacrity, I am spun inside the capsule. Time stretches and bends. To say that an eternity passed would be false. Eternity requires time. I stepped outside of the continuum. Is time linear? A stream that self-corrects? Do we speak too precisely over what is ultimately a fuzzy concept?
When I arrive at my destination, I fall gently out of the sky. And I begin my plans.
Bang. Bang.
Here. And here. My general slams his fist down on the table, pointing to our next two targets. Ukraine. Leningrad. My research had indicated that my target might be in Russia. Should I stick to the general's expertise in war? Can I take the chance of not invading Moscow as well? What if he is in Moscow, and the invasion of Ukraine and Leningrad forces him to flee deeper in the Russian hinterland?
No. I point to Moscow. We must form a third attack group and invade there as well. My generals disagree. I put on my act. Firm. Frenzied. Dictatorial. My generals nod. Operation Barbarossa will commence, and my sweep of Russia will be total.
Bang. Bang.
Mein Fuhrer. Mein Fuhrer. The pleading from outside the door is sheep-like. But inside my bunker, all I can think about is the boy. He wasn't in Russia. He was right here. In Germany. And I saw him. I saw what my work had done. My evil. My sin. It was his eyes. I saw them, and I couldn't forget them. By the time I realized what it was I saw in him, he had already left my grasp. Held on the arm of an emigrant.
It wasn't what I saw in him. It was what he saw in me. In me, all of humanity's unshakeable evil. All of humanity's irredeemable blackness. The truth. That evil works can be done, under the belief of good intentions. He saw the paved road to hell in me. I saw his faith in humanity irrevocably die.
I have failed my mission. I have done what I had intended to avert. I'm glad I met you. I'm glad you're here with me now. It won't make sense to you. But I want you to know that time is a closed loop. Truly like a stream, which absorbs all the change you try to force upon it. There is no changing where the stream goes. All that has happened was supposed to, and all that will happen must. Now close your eyes, Eva. It's time for us to step outside of eternity.
Bang. Bang.
