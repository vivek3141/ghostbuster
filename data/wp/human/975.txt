I awake to the sound of my mother and father watching television, having a heated conversation about whats on. "hey son, get in here and look at this." my father shouts through the thin walls of my home. "ugh." I grunt slowly getting up from my bed and shuffling towards the door. As I walk into the living room i notice they're watching the news. "The world is in shock as hundreds of thousands of people awoke only to find themselves transformed into.. it seems to be, tattoos." the anchorman reports. "Oh my god!" my mother screams staring out the window with an expression of pure terror. My father and I run towards the window and peer out. Just as the anchorman reported there are people riddled throughout the street, suddenly changed into a tattoo. I look over near the bus stop and see a big bright red heart that has 'Mom' written on it trying to get on the bus, but his arrows are too wide to fit the door. Just past him it looked like a dragon with barbed wire buying a coffee. There is a knock on the door. My mother goes to answer it saying, "It must be your brother, he just got out of 8am class. As my mother opens the door she lets out the loudest, high pitched scream I've ever heard. Sure enough, there was my brother, a huge sign that said "Blow Me" with arrows on both sides pointing down. scratching his head he laughs, "I guess its about time i told you guys about my tattoo huh?"
