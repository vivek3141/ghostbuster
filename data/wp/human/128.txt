"Not today you son of a bitch. I see you. Not today."
The nurse gave a sidelong glance at the surgeon muttering in half-whispers almost too quiet for anyone to hear. But she heard.
The doctor didn't always mutter to herself. It was usually only in special cases: a car accident on the I-5 with a 16 wheeler that lost control; an idiot college student deciding he can jump into a pool from three stories up; or a 90 year old man who just suffered his third heart attack and whose wife was wailing in the lobby.
She only muttered when the case was going to be close. Her usual routine was to wash up, get gowned, and get to work. Dr. Cardea was the best at only 34 years of age. She always worked calmly, quietly, skillfully and when the job was done it looked as if she had never been there.
But on rare days, such as today, the nurse would notice an acrid smell would be lingering in the emergency room as she began her prep. It didn't matter what case had gone before, or how well the room had been cleaned prior, the smell of decay would be wafting in the southern corner of the room. It was on those days that the nurse knew that her surgeon would break her routine. That she would stare hard into that corner, always the same corner, like she was facing down the death itself.
On those days Cardea's blue eyes would change steely grey, she would mutter words that only I could hear, and then get to work.
Today was the same. As Cardea stepped forward to the table, to the newborn babe born a month too early with holes in his heart, she summoned all her skill and prepared to begin.
But today was different. The smell was stronger. It was closer. It was surrounding me.
At that moment she hesitated. She gave me a glare with such power I felt the need to run from the room in terror.
But I didn't.
I simply looked back at her calmly and said "Let me help you with that Dr. Cardea. You see, I have an interest in him as well."
