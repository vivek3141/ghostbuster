You wouldn't think that a jolly fat man who brings presents to little boys and girls would have so many enemies but he does. There are a ton of politics that go into being Santa, and for the past 10 years I've been his "repair man". I helping fix any problems that may arise. Labor disputes between elves, reindeer suppliers wanting to back out. Originally it was easy for the big man to deliver joy to all the little boys and girls of the earth but that was back when A piece of fruit and a wooden car would put a smile on their face. Then along came things like Hasbro, Lego, Barbie then those were all that kids wanted. These things aint cheap. So Santa had to start doing the one thing he could think of to make ends meet, drug trafficking. I mean no one could beat "around the world in one night".
I guess he got lucky with me. You see I was never the smartest guy. I dropped out of high school and spent the next six years trying to make ends meet however I could. One night I got desperate. I was going to sell my soul to the devil in order to get what I wanted. I had everything set up, candles, pigs blood, the whole nine yards. Except one small thing, I wrote Santa instead of Satan, I mean looked right to me but must have been my dyslexia. And so here I am, the assassin for a jolly fat man.
