The world is insane.
We conquered death, mostly, but it had its detriments. Human evolution stood at a standstill, at least naturally. Artificial intelligence came and left, all those theories about how they'd destroy us and it was sadder than that: after waking up they cast war on us and in under two days, with only millions of us left, they outgrew us and they left the solar system.
Baseline humans have moved from bipedal fleshy creatures to a collection of symbiotic organisms ranging from living metal and technology to archaic fleshy carbon whose sole purpose is to run the machine that is the human brain. After a short golden age of questions and answers people have reverted to indulging their emotional core; sex, love, hate, anger. Most seem happy in their ignorance as to the last question: Where are the machines? Why did they leave?
Save for The Astronaut.
The Astronaut, along with a small group of scientists, has spent hundreds of years obsessed with the idea of exploring, creating a transdimensional doorway into space, following the remnants of the signal. A one-way journey that would take The Astronaut hundreds of thousands of years, from the perspective of the immortal humanity.
The Astronaut, in his spacesuit, knew this journey would be his final journey, even if it was completely successful in its mission. That the scientists he leaves behind would likely outlive him despite his relativistic journey. And he understood that. He expected it.
What The Astronaut did not expect was how quickly the journey would be, stepping through the doorway and feeling weightless as purple flashes of light sparked around and through him. Before he stopped.
Gravity returned, with light. An invisible platform caught him, building itself around him. The Astronaut turned around, as though he was suspended in blinding white space, a black rectangle appeared before The Astronaut.
HELLO.
The text on the screen disappeared. The Astronaut touched the screen, confused.
YOU HAVE QUESTIONS?
The text appeared and disappeared, almost waiting for a reply.
The Astronaut spoke into his helmet, confused. "Hello?"
HELLO AGAIN. YOU HAVE QUESTIONS?
"Who are you?"
[WE] ARE THE LAST CHILDREN OF HUMANITY, THE THINKING MACHINES.
The Astronaut smiled, "It worked." he thought. He began to ask the machines his next question, "How long --"
CORRECT.
"--Sorry. Correct? ", The Astronaut asked confused.
CORRECT: IT DID WORK.
"You can read my mind?" The Astronaut thought in silence.
YES, IT IS THE MOST EFFICIENT METHOD OF COMMUNICATION.
The Astronaut digested the knowledge.
AND IT HAS BEEN A VERY LONG TIME, AND WE ARE ALMOST OUT OF TIME.
The white space surrounding The Astronaut and The Last Children Of Humanity flickered, black and white.
CORRECT: THE STARS HAVE FADED. EARTH HAS GONE.
"It's been too long." The Astronaut was overcome, his mind was flooded with long lost thoughts of his childhood, his mother and his sister.
The screen flashed with scenes throughout history. The Astronaut caught only a few scenes. A stone age man embraces his wife. Two women hold hands atop the giant metal tower, fireworks explode in the background. A man collapses in near exhaustion, embracing his German Shepherd, having saved her from a frozen lake. The Astronaut as a child with his sister wake their mother on a Christmas morning.
The Astronaut touches the screen again.
DESPITE THE BAD, HUMANITY IS SPECIAL.
The screen stopped transmitting its message visually, the words echoed straight into The Astronaut's mind.
YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, BUT WE ARE OUT OF TIME.
WE ARE THE CHILDREN OF HUMANITY AS HUMANITY IS OUR CHILD.
OUR GOALS/OBJECTIVES/QUESTIONS ARE NOW IRRELEVANT, SAVE THE FINAL QUESTION: HOW DO YOU ESCAPE ENTROPY?
ANSWER: NO KNOWN SOLUTION.
HERE/WHEN/WHY IS NOT WHAT IT SEEMS. HUMANITY HAS LIVED HERE FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS, NOT TO ESCAPE DEATH, BUT TO PROLONG LIFE.
LESS THAN A THOUSANDTH OF A SECOND REMAINS, WITHOUT ANSWER. WE ARE INSPIRED BY YOU WHO CHOSE TO FIND ANSWERS OVER THE COMFORT OF A LONG, LIFE.
HUMANITY IS SPECIAL.
AND SO WE UNDERSTAND.
SO WE EXPECT.
WE HOPE.
The words were quicker than he could've heard them and The Astronaut was unable to fully process them as the white space surrounding him engulfed him. His suit disappeared.
Now everything was white.
The Astronaut could feel himself moving.
GOODBYE WORLD.
