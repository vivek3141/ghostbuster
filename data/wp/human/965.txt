"I can't do this job anymore Cheryl. It's killing me" Ryan sighed to his wife. She turned off their light and kissed him gently. She knew that this day would come eventually, working in the USFMD. He still had his license, not many people did these days. When the United States Free Murder Act passed in 2017, the Free Murder Department opened with the government and the employees don't last long.
Ryan had been employed for two years, longer than any other employee. Collecting data, logging the crime scene photos, matching licenses to victim names. People in this world did vile things when they were allowed. He ran across his own mothers file but never had the courage to look at it. Sick people.
There was no outrage when the President was killed, he can still hear the news reporter, "It is unsure if the suspect has or has not used his license, and if this is something the license allows" but it was allowed. The USFMD put a stop to media releasing his name, they didn't want any others to believe they would be famous for killing someone. It was normal, and natural and did not deserve attention. We each received one.
