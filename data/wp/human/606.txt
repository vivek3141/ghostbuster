"Holy shit, what did you *do? *"
The man in front of her whipped around, the body of a child in his arms and his pants around his ankles. The logo on his overly-muscled chest was spotted with blood.
His widened in horror. "Oh god, not you. Anyone but you."
She pinched the bridge of her nose in frustration. "God, I knew you had escaped from prison, and I figured you'd strike again, but this? This is unlike you. You're a grandstander. You threaten to blow up nations, not a-" She struggled for her words and eventually just sighed.
"I thought you were above raping kids."
He dropped the body and quickly pulled up his pants. He had purposefully chosen his white uniform to contrast her black one. Looking at the obvious blood on it now, he was regretting that decision.
"Please," he begged, "Don't-"
"Don't *what? *" Her anger got the better of her. "Don't pull that bullshit. You were a monster, but at least you seemed to have *standards*. I have no choice. This crosses the line."
She pulled her pistol from its holster and leveled at his forehead. At twenty feet, it was practically a point-blank shot for her. His muscles and speed can't stop one of her bullets at this distance.
He dropped the charade. "You thought I had standards? I'm a fucking *supervillian*. We're not in a comic book, honey. This is real life, and in real life, the bad guys don't have standards. I respect you, I really do, but that idealism is going to get you killed one day. So go ahead, shoot me." He paused. "That's what I thought. You think having your standards of 'justice' make you better, but all they do is weaken you. You're-"
She pulled the trigger, sending a custom explosive round into his frontal lobe. The headless, former supervillian crumpled to the ground, next to the body of his victim.
She walked up to his body and spat on it.
"Asshole."
