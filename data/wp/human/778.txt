"Earth Vacations, ϠϢϐջԬ speaking, how may I assist you?"
"Yeah, uh...hi. Hi."
"Hello?"
"Hi. I, uh, just got back from my vacation on Earth."
"We here at TransGalac are *thrilled* to hear that! Our Earth vacations are unique, once-in-several-lifetimes-adventures for which your ancestors are looking across with jealousy unbounded and are *as we speak* enhancing your offspring-yet-unborn's genetics with the superior experience just taken."
".....right. That's why I'm calling. It, uh....wasn't as good as I'd expected."
"I'm *so sorry* to hear that, miss. Tell me...." * <pages ruffling> * "can I get your Adventure Package identifier?"
"Yes, it's...45Ֆ873.00₪"
"Hmm...please hold one minute...."
* <sound of nearly pleasant music> *
"Yes, thanks for waiting. Yes, you had the Global Domination Package. With the optional Destruction of Tokyo, very nice, excellent choice, we *just* rebuilt it. I'm sorry to hear it wasn't up to our standards, how can I assist? What did not meet expectations? Was anything missing from the experience?"
"Well....no, not really. I landed with my fleet and demanded to meet their leader, as outlined in page 3."
"Yes?"
"Vaporized her, destroyed the landing site, then moved on and razed all human monuments, starting with that statue in the water, the one they insist we destroy last after the others. Sorry, but it was just *there*."
"Quite all right! Those destruction guidelines are just that, there for *your* enjoyment, not rules. Please, continue!"
"OK, well, I demanded global subjugation, engaged their army, had - I have to admit - a *great* time taking out Tokyo, and I have to say that the company providing me with an actual *Mecha Godzilla* as an upgrade to the regular Godzilla I was expecting was a very nice touch."
"Thank you! I have noted that and we appreciate the positive feedback!"
"But - and here's the thing - it was all too easy. Their weapons were far, far too weak to be any serious challenge, most regions caved too easily to my demands, and they even tried *nuclear weapons*, which the brochure did *not* state was a possibility. I mean, I'm glad you guys stopped the detonations, but still....kind of disappointing. No, actually, *very* disappointing."
"Ma'am, I understand, and I'm sorry to hear that your vacation package did not meet your expectations. Earth is - as we explained when you booked your package - a natural habitat, and as such, the humans can be unpredictable and experiences can vary from visit to visit. However, I'm pleased to be able to offer you a 50% discount on your *next* vacation through us to anywhere in the galaxy, and if you choose to return to the Sol system we can offer you a free Martian Mystery tour package, complete with Alien Artifacts and Crafts - leave a monument to mystify the humans on the surface of Mars! Leave them puzzled for centuries to come! How does that sound?"
"Well.....all right. Tell me more?"
