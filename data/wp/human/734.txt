*This is not what I had hoped it would be*, I thought.
Wednesday nights are usually when I stalk, and then kill an innocent man. It was my meditation, my moment of tranquility. Unfortunately, today would have to be different.
I was selected for jury duty, and expecting it to be some minor deal I showed up in court looking slightly disheveled. Getting sleep is a constant struggle. As the trial began i saw the accused. A bulky looking man with a tattoo that slithered around his arm towards the back of his neck.
At this point, the prosecutor stood up and walked over to where I was sitting and spoke, "Members of the jury I stand before you today in the pursuit of justice." He whipped out photos of 11 different men, all with their throats slashed. "That demon over there has killed these men within the last 3 months! Today, our society depends on you to provide it the relief and solace it requires to gain some normalcy."
*What?! *
I could not believe my own eyes. They were my murders!
*This day just became one of the 5 best days of my life*
I noticed myself smiling a little and gained some control over myself. Without having made any effort, my crimes were not mine anymore. Shock and excitement ran through my veins with equal fervor. I cannot even be bothered to pay attention to this trial anymore. My brutish past-time won't be costing me any time in jail and that's all the thought i will be giving to this matter.
Might change the routine this one time and go pray instead. *Just this week. *
Normal service shall then resume.
