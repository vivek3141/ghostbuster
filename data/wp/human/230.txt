Apologies for the extremely basic rhyme style:
...
Dearly beloved I wish you were here
...
I crushed that heart without shedding a tear
...
I see you beneath me; the implication is clear
...
If our eyes lock together they'll burn and they'll sear
...
When it comes to you I cant let myself miss
...
The thousand regrets, but I promise you this:
...
I'll recount it fondly: the last time we kissed,
...
In front of others I won't curl into a fist. Instead,
...
I'll hold on to your locket; until we are near
...
I'll use it to find you, my talents endear:
...
Never forget how to master the fear
...
Dearly beloved I wish you were here
...
