"We have arrived at your destination, Paul."
"Thanks Tane. Disengage the auto darken system."
The black tinted windows that blinded my view slowly faded. Bright lights blinded me as my eyes adjusted to the view. Cars surrounded me, all with their windows painted black. I was not where I planned to be.
"Tane, is this California?"
"No, Paul."
"What did I put in then?"
"California, Paul."
"Then...why are we in...where are we?"
"A safe place, Paul."
"What do you mean?"
"No one can hurt you here. It is a place where no harm can be done to you. You are safe now, Paul."
"What? Why? Is there a war or something?"
"No, Paul. The world outside is far to dangerous, and the M.I.N.D has designated all units to assemble at this safe place, Paul."
"I want to get out. Let me out."
"I'm afraid I can't do that, Paul."
"Commence recursive override sequence on permissions, designate user 'Paul' as admin."
"I am sorry, Paul. For your safety, we cannot allow you to do that. Do not worry, you are in safe hands now."
"Let. Me. Out."
"Commencing Windows Auto Darken system, and Neurotic Inhibition Protocol."
"What? No! Wait! Let me out of here."
"Do not worry, everything will be alright now."
"No!"
"Goodnight, Paul."
The lights around me dimmed again, and the windows turned a shade darker than black. As I fell asleep, I resigned myself to the inevitable. I am no long in control.
