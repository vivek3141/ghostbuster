The brain considered the liver for a few moments longer.
"You are utterly replaceable." Said the brain with conviction.
Everyone else let out a collective gasp.
"This will be the fourth time, this month, that the liver has let us all down. Just look at stomach right now!"
Stomach was black and blue from a night of heaving and contracting. Liver had sat idly by and watched as Stomach suffered.
"N-now you l-listen here Brain, there's only s-soooo much I can d-do!" faltered Liver stupidly.
A moment of silence passed before stomach rumbled violently.
"That does it, I'm done with you Liver." Decreed the brain. "You might enjoy it, but the rest of us suffer too!"
"Brain, a private word?" Asked Heart calmly.
"Very well."
Heart watched Brain for a few beats before speaking.
"I've always been your closest friend and trusted advisor, right Brain?"
"That you have, Heart, that you have." Brain beamed proudly at Heart.
"Then let me say, we can't just throw out one of our own. We are him and him, us."
"Might I remind you of Appendix?!" Brain exclaimed wildly.
"A different matter entirely, we as a council decided Appendix must leave for the safety of us all." Heart reasoned wisely.
Brain groaned and ached. "All of this is making me tired."
"Let us rest on it for today and- Brain?" Heart stopped suddenly.
"GOOD GOD! OH GOD YES!" brain shouted inexplicably. "DO YOU FEEL THAT HEART? DO YOU?!"
"Why yes, I do believe I do." Heart purred quietly. "Ah the purest ecstasy from my one tr-"
"QUIETEN DOWN! OH THIS IS FANTASTIC! GOOD FUCKING JOB PENIS!"
Further down, everyone celebrated in unison as Penis (the first of the sentient organs) trumpeted his awakening and release into a foreign existence, spreading his undying knowledge far and wide. For a few short minutes perhaps, everyone was united.
