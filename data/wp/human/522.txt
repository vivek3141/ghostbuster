"He's more than just a man. He's like...a god."
Everybody looked at Tommy skeptically. One does not just discover a god every day.
"I'm telling you. I tried running next to him, and it wasn't even close. I'm one of the fastest people here, and I was like a snail next to him."
"Tommy-"
"No wait! I'm telling you, it's more than just speed. It's super strength! A giant weight fell on my foot, and I couldn't lift it, but he picked it up no problem! It's why I'm in this cast."
"Tommy, okay, just listen-"
"And when my mom got sick he was the only one who could help."
The room fell silent.
"I would sit with her in the hospital, and she wouldn't talk or respond, but every time he showed up the doctors said all of her activities increased. And sometimes she would even move. Sure, he was crying then, but at the funeral he was as strong as a rock. You all saw! Not a single tear. That's super human. That's more than my dad. That's a god."
The bell rang. Time for recess.
"He's my hero. He's my dad."
