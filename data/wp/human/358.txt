It's only a few seconds before I remember, but once I notice, that's all I can think about. Before I lost my arm, I didn't realise that a distraction can be unbearable. Just trying to complete thought processes is a challenge. Today I have a meeting with Lee and (where is my arm? Oh, that's right. I remember) so I'll need to finish off the report before (where is my arm? I lost it. Okay) eleven, and then I'll have to figure out if I'm having lunch with (where is my arm? Where is my arm?)
After the accident, I had assumed that this would fade. I crashed my car into a truck and ripped the nerves from my spinal cord. I know all this. Technically, the arm is still there, and I haven't lost it at all. They left it so they could try to graft nerves to the spine, and for hope, really. Seemingly unaware that I know all this, my mind constantly cycles through the realisation (Where is my arm?) and reminder (It's gone) and acceptance (Oh, okay). I can't think anything else.
Never mind losing my arm. I feel like I'm losing my mind.
