"For the safety and well-being of all local citizens this warning will be broadcast silently."
The text scrolled slowly across the TV set in my living room, and I peered at it, puzzled, from my kitchen. I hadn't turned on the TV yet. Hell, I hadn't turned it on in weeks. (Netflix worked better on my laptop, and it was a pain in the ass to plug it into the screen.)
"Do not pay attention to anything that you hear until instructed otherwise. There have been reports of mass auditory hallucinations in your area. We are investigating. As soon as we know more, we promise, you will be informed."
All...right. So that was not the most encouraging thing to see before the coffee machine had finished working through.
Even *less* encouraging was the woman's voice that abruptly came from clock-radio by my bed. The clock radio that *I hadn't turned on either. * I could hear incredible stress in her voice, although she was clearly keeping it together.
"For the safety and well-being of all local citizens," she said crisply, "This warning will be broadcast audibly. Do not pay attention to anything that you see until instructed otherwise. There have been reports of mass visual hallucinations in your area. We are investigating. As soon as we know more, we promise, you will be informed."
Her voice took on a ragged tone, exhaustion and worry creeping in. "Don't drive, for God's sake. Don't operate heavy machinery. Please sit down somewhere safe, and close your eyes. Trust us, please, just...just don't look around."
New text scrolled across the television screen, error-ridden as if it was being typed with frantic speed. "Please do nt listen to anything that you heaf. we do not know what is happening at this time. Unplug all speKERS AND RADIOS. IF IN BUILDING WITH PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM, LEAVE BUILDING IN ORDERLY FASHION. Do not listen to voices. Do not close your eyes. Please communicTE IN WRITING, DO NOT TRY TO SPEAK. DON'T LISTEN PLEASE DON'T TRUST VOICES."
