This is horrible and terribly awkward...I really don't know anyone here. They keep looking at me...at least I think they're looking at me.... Should I say something? It seems like we've all been staring at each other for quite a long time.... Those bulbous strawberry-like cyst on those--gelatinous heads remind me of that ridiculous Monty Python sketch featuring a race of alien invading blancmanges. I laugh--oh dear...they're coming over.
"Hello. My name is Peter. I take it this is the afterlife?" They make a gobbling sound like wild turkeys. "Wonderful wonderful wonderful...uh...is God around? Maybe St. Peter? No no no I'm not Saint Peter. I mean my name is Peter...but I ain't no saint." I nervously laugh again. One of the blancmanges comes closer (I know that's not what they're called but calling them Martians seems so racist) and absorbs my hand and suddenly I can hear a thousand helium-filled sounding voices in my head saying: "Is this the virgin we were promised?"
