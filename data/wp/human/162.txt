"Daaaad....Are we nearly there yet? I'm hungry!"
"Hello hungry! I'm dad."
We all knew the routine. We all groaned on cue. It was the oldest 'dad' joke known to mankind and yet he still grinned like an idiot every time he used it. It was there at my tenth birthday party in it's 'excited' variant. It took on the 'nervous' form on the night of my prom. Hungry was the most common...and every time it heralded the groans and a stupid smirk from Dad.
I miss it. So much. Ever since the accident...it was like he doesn't know who I was anymore. But I still went back to the home, every day for eight months. I knew it couldn't be much longer now though...the nurses said he'd not been eating, despite their best efforts, and he was getting weaker and weaker.
"Please dad...I'm sorry. I shouldn't have stayed out so late. I should have stayed at Mike's instead of getting you to come pick me up. I'll do anything...just please don't die on me. I'm sorry." I pleaded to him in his sleep. Or at least, I thought he was asleep.
"Hello Sorry....I'm....I'm Dad. Y....you be a g....ood boy and look after Tom for me. He's my son....a.....and he's the best thing I ev....er....did." He wheezed, and grabbed my hand tight. I couldn't stop the tears, but even through them I could see that grin...that stupid, stupid grin like he was the funniest thing in the world.
For one last moment...it was me and my Dad again.
By eleven o'clock that night he was gone.
I miss those jokes...those terrible lines that were only ever funny once. I miss that moronic smile.
I miss my Dad.
