You can hold it in your hand. Circular in nature it's flat rounded back, or front, fits smoothly against your palm. The cool metal giving heft to such a small object. Hinges on one side say open me, and on the inside of the round faceplate is a complex circular dial. Numbers from one to twelve ring the face, with twelve at the top, then one, two, three, etc. Three long lines pointed out at odd angles from the center of the circle, the thinnest one spinning at a regular rate around. Tick. Tick. Tick.
Staring at the dial for a while, you notice the other lines are moving too, if far more slowly. As the thinnest line ticks it's heartbeat around the full dial, the second thinnest line moves to its respective point around. Watching for a long while shows the thickest lines shift from twelve to one. At a guess, right now they make one three two. Hmm. The ticking line moves five times between each number. So then five fifteen ten. How about the largest, being so slow, is some daily measurement and uses the main number, but everything else uses the tick marks. So then it's one fifteen ten, or 1:15:10. Does that make sense?
