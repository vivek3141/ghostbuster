A young boy in tattered cloths walked to a fruit stand on a hot day. The sand was like fire under his feet, forming blisters.
The boy meekly walked to the stand and held out his hand. He was thin, having not eaten for over three days.
A large man wrapped in fine cloth walked by and noticed the boy. He took coins from his pocket and bought an apple. He handed the apple to the boy and walked off.
The boy opened his mouth the eat the apple, but he had no teeth. Try as he may, the boy could not bite into the apple, bringing him to tears.
An old man noticed the boy crying and spoke to him.
"Young boy, why do you cry? A man has bought you food today, yes?"
"I have lost my teeth, and can no longer eat! I am useless, I will surely die."
The old man pulled a knife from his pocket and began cutting the apple into small pieces. After cutting the final slice, the old man gave the young boy his handy work, and knife.
"Life comes with hardships. Some get more than others, and those who see no hardship sometimes forget it exists. But with hardship comes opportunity. The chance to solve a problem, learn, and grow from it. You will see much hardship in your life, but if you can overcome it, you will stand on top of the world."
