*4:45 AM*
By the time the last of the residents of Elm Drive had left his house in his bathrobe to join the hubbub in the street, the first of them to run outside yelling and dialing emergency services was unsure why exactly she'd felt it necessary to wake up at such an ungodly hour.
"It's the funniest thing," Mrs. Ramirez was telling a small crowd of her neighbors. "There must've been *something*, but I can't for the life of me remember..."
"Of course there was something!" cried Mr. Gaebler indignantly. "I sat bolt upright in bed when --"
Funny, he'd known how he'd intended to finish that sentence when he'd started it. Ah well, old age was coming for everyone, he supposed. Better brush up up on his bridge game.
Tina clutched her protesting cat against her, weaving between clumps of baffled, murmuring adults. She didn't even *like* the cat, why had she felt such a visceral need to snatch her up and get out of the house? She had a history test in three hours, for chrisssakes.
She turned back towards her house, but was struck by the San Diego skyline, illuminated by the sunrise behind her and clearly visible from their affluent suburb on a hill. The familiar shape looked...off, today, somehow. She squinted, trying to identify the particular aspect of the view that rose goosebumps on her arms.
She was probably just cold. The air hung thick with a smell that she knew but couldn't place, but she didn't care to. She just needed to go back inside, throw the goddamn cat somewhere before it clawed her face off, and try for another hour of sleep.
Five minutes later, the street was still and silent again.
Emergency call centers for several counties in the area reported a dramatic and unexplained spike in prank calls and false alarms in that hour. Suburbanites commuted into the city all that week for work, but invariably reported that they'd been sent home early. It would be some time before it became clear why they were shaking so badly when they said it.
