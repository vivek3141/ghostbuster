I was nine years old for my first. Most people have trouble remembering the events of a week ago and yet that day twenty-three years past is still so fresh in my mind.
I can picture it, the skin peeled back, the muscles underneath clenching and unclenching. My parents had gotten me a sewing kit for my birthday, perhaps in the hope of focusing me on something productive. The needles I had kept, and the string. The small scissors I used methodically to slice away flesh. Blood pooled, like a stagnant well. But it smelled of power, and it fascinated me.
I sat for a while, watching my work. Seeing the muscles move, the lungs filling and collapsing like a crippled bird. The beast's eyes rolled in its head, endlessly. And I watched.
Its death was of no great interest to me. The morbid fascination that I had felt as it shuddered in its death throes left at the same instant that the light in its eyes did. When it was over I cleaned my tools, even then I had been tidy, systematic. The body I hid, deep in the woods. I visited it often, reminiscing, remembering. The surge of power I felt faded each day, and I wanted more.
My dog had been my first. And as you know officer, it was not my last.
