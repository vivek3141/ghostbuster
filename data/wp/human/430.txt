One.
One planet in the unimaginably vast universe has the perfect mix of chemicals and the right zap of energy at just the right point in time to bring life. Unique.
When scientists scanned every other planet and we realized that humanity was truly alone in a godless, lifeless universe everyone just lost it. The politicians in power met at the last UN summit in a somber tone making a decision for all of us, all of our kind, we could not bear it. Alone.
Finding a chemical mixture to attack the carbon chains and molecules of life on Earth was surprisingly easy, they released it into the atmosphere and we all watched as everything died. We have minutes left, every breath burns with the acid destroying us.
Alone in the Universe we were told by the scientists. They could find no one else.
