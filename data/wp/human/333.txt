They tell us that the darkness is feared simply because it is unknown. That may have fooled me when I was young but now I think I know better. They told us never to go near the place where the darkness resides, but I saw someone go there the other night. I followed. Along the winding path, I could only hear the leaves rustle and my own faint footsteps. Ahead of me was the figure, walking briskly down the path.
I flicked on my dim flashlight and kept it pointed on the ground. I defeated the darkness before me with the light. It closed itself around me, embracing me in a chilled choke-hold. I suddenly got the screaming urge to turn around. I should have. Whomever I was following has disappeared from my sight, another victim enveloped by the darkness. How scarcely we learn from our mistakes.
I don't know how I got home but when I awoke, but it was dark. I rushed to flip my lightswitch to once again defeat the darkness. There was a note pinned to my door, confirming my suspicion that someone brought me here. It simply read "Don't". And I won't. The elders were right.
