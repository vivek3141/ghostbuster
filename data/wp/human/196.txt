[Interior, ISIS HQ, Mallory Archer's office. Sterling is sitting across from his mother with a drink in his hands.]
"For the last time, Mother, I know the difference between flammable and inflammable!"
"There *is* no difference, you idiot! And try telling that to the Regent Hotel. My God, what you did to that poor-"
"Mother, he ruined my suit!"
"Oh shut up. We'll talk about your pyrokinetic display in the lobby later, Sterling, I have an important mission for you."
"Yeah, and the...neverer...the...better."
Mallory fidgets with her screen controls. "Damn this blasted...CAROL!"
"I mean, it was a good suit."
"IT'S CHERYL, AND YOU'RE NOT MY...Oh, wait, you kind of are."
"I just had it flown in from-"
"What the hell are you babbling about?"
"My name is Cheryl, and I just realised you are my supervisor?"
"I'm talking about my suit, Mother!"
"Both of you, SHUT UP! Carol-"
"CHERYL!"
"Whatever, help me with this! And Sterling, shut up!"
"Feh." Sterling knocks back his drink and motions for Carol/Cheryl to refill it. She ignores him.
"See, you've gotta press...this one, I think, and then...this one...oh, but not that one, it just makes a kind of funny noise."
"My God...I let you use the screen for one night and you mess it up. What in the hell were you watching anyway?"
[Jump cut to Mallory's office, the night before. Cheryl, Krieger, Pam and Rodney are all naked staring at Mallory's gigantic screen. Horrible gurgling noises are emanating from the speakers.]
"Oh. My God." Cheryl's hand moves towards her crotch.
"Can we watch something else now?"
"Pamela, hush. This is the best part."
"Oh for the love of...how the hell can you even record this shit?"
Krieger jumps at Pam's comment. "Oh. Was I supposed to be recording?"
[Cut back to the present.]
"We were watching some stuff from Krieger's van."
Archer scoffs, and takes a sip (he had to refill his glass himself). "What is it this time, more shock bum fights?"
"I swear if I catch that no good clone of Adolf Hitler I will literally disembowel him." Mallory imagines herself choking the life out of Dr. Krieger.
"Not literally, Mother, I mean...oh. I guess you do mean literally."
"Aaaaandddd done."
As Cheryl taps the final key, the screen appears. Sterling's eyes widen.
"No."
Sterling stands up and stares at the face on screen.
"No. No no no."
"Uh, yes?"
"Sterling?"
"Mother, you don't have to say anything." Archer pulls his gun out and cocks it dramatically. "I'm *in*."
"In what? Sterling, this isn't-"
"I'm going to hunt you down like the rat bastard you are..."
[We finally see the screen from Sterling's perspective. The man on screen is James Bond, 007, MI6 agent.]
"...James Bond."
"Who, that guy? Wow he's hot. Think his hands are any strong?"
"It won't matter, Carol."
"Cheryl!"
"Because he'll be *dead*."
"Dead? Wha-Sterling, you ass, listen to me! This man is not the job!"
"Wha-? Oh come on, Mother!"
"Phrasing, boom!"
"Shut up! And Mother....hey, that was a nice one."
"I know, right?"
"Mother, why would you have his *file* if you weren't going to ask me to kill him?"
"You idiot, I was doing a background check! He's coming to work for us!"
Sterling's eyes widen even more. "WHAT?"
"Ooooh, think his hands are-"
"Shut up! Sterling, you-Sterling...?"
"I...I...I can't...wha..." Archer wobbles, then faints with a crash. Mallory sighs.
"Of course. I get a new Steuben bar set and you break it."
