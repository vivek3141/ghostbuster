Almost always, I write without an outline. However, a couple times, I've used a very vague "tentpole method" outline--as in, I've got a couple ideas that lead up to a conclusion. For example, when I wrote my NaNoWriMo novel last November, I wrote out three "tentpoles" which were the beginning, middle, and end of my story, at about a paragraph each. I have another one which is doing the same thing, but in terms of three books of 40k each (a paragraph each).
For everything else I've written though, it's off the top of my head. Sometimes I don't even have a proper ending in mind, just maybe a couple ideas I'd love to toss in. A lot of people love serious outlines, but I end up going "why do an outline when I can just write the book?" I should probably try to outline more so that I have a firmer idea as to where my stories are going.
