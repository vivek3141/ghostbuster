Pikachu was bleeding, but Ash didn't care. He needed this badge to move on and he wasn't stopping until he had crushed everyone in his path. He yelled to Pikachu, "Alright that's enough, stop wasting time and Hit him again with a thunderbolt, Pikachu!"
The small red dots of Pikachu's cheeks began to pulse, The air began to tense and lightning arced from the sky down to the battlefield. The opponent was nervous now, because at once a large bolt of thunder burst from the clouds, through the air as it went and catching the opponent's Arbok by surprise. It shook with the force of the electricity coursing through its body and within seconds, collapsed on the field. It attempted to inch slowly towards its master in one final act, as the life drained slowly from its eyes.
Ash was declared the winner, but he already knew that.
Just another victim on the road to his destiny, there would be many, many more.
