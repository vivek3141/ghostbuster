The Great Halt. That is what they called it. The day that the Earth stood still and from eldest to youngest, powers were received like some sort of divine blessing. I watched the Earth from the ISS, completely bewildered.
One by one they chose. The eldest chose traditional powers. The first man to declare "Flying" rocketed into the sky at the speed of a bullet, leaving his walker behind. Everyone around him, inspired, chose the same power (along with millions across the globe). They all scrunched up their faces and concertedly rose but 2-3 inches. Just as the choruses of dissatisfaction were raised down plummeted the first flying man like a meteor, his power distributed throughout the world, smashing into the ground like a grasshopper on a windshield.
It soon became apparent that the more that a single power is chosen, the weaker it becomes until it is just an insignificant thing.
We spent a few days waiting for the chaos to subside before returning to Earth. One step on the surface, and I could feel it. This great warm surge running from my legs to my brain. I knew that I could choose anything, be anything, that I wanted. However, days after The Great Halt, here I stood, a human with an advantage. I knew the rules, and would not be trumped.
Just then screaming broke out. I whipped around to find a man robbing a group of people, His right arm made of extendable lava. *Oh, that's a good one* I thought, admiring his originality. However, my phrasing would leave me the only man in the world with my power. The only man capable of stopping the great and all powerful super villain Magma Stretchy Arm!
Stepping up in all my glory, I declared my power to the heavens. Ripping off my shirt, I mercilessly beat him to death. From that day forward, my name was to be sung on high. Ronald Chen, Master of the Insta-Growing Kung Fu Chest Hair!
