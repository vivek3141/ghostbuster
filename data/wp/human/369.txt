The Powerball was up to 10 million. The country was in rough shape with overpopulation and the power of the dollar was failing. Everyone looked at their tickets with hope they will be able to see a better tomorrow. The numbers started to be called off.
The announcer was dressed in so many rhinestones it was like the earth gave him a lap dance and transferred all it's glitter to his suit. He was smiling with perfect white teeth.
"Greetings winners! Tonight is June 23rd, 2031 and people will have their lives changed by the end of this! The first number is 10! 23!.."
One guy with a grey fringed mustache got excited and started whooping and hollering. Fuck him.
"The next number is 37, 45 and with a Powerball of 4! The numbers again are 10, 23, 37, 45 and Powerball 4!"
God fucking dammit.
"Remember viewers, the United States needs 10 million by the end of the week and congratulations to the lucky stars!"
Guy sitting next to me looked down at my phone app which was now blinking. "Hey buddy, looks like you won!"
Five other phones were also blinking in the place.
"Yah I fuckin' won you mother-," was all I could get out before an ashtray winged from the bartender lodged itself deep into my skull.
