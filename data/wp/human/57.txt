It was a Monday morning when I woke up, groggy from a short sleep. The sky was still dark and all was quiet, so it came to my surprise that my dad was awake in a sort of silent trance, his eyes bloodshot and full of rage.
"I can't believe this," he said, "this whole country has gone to shit!"
"Morning, dad." I replied. The TV had its sound muted but what he was angry at was quite obvious. It was on the news channel and the headline *ZUAFFYUL X-2739 ELECTED AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES* I was wholly indifferent to politics, I had no opinion on the matter.
"Do you understand what this means, son?" His voice sounded genuinely scared, which I felt was an overreaction. "We've got to leave the country. This is the first step in a slippery slope. Eventually he's going to announce the genocide of humans to massive applause. And we voted for him! Ha!"
I decided not to argue as I needed to get ready for school. My phone beeps as I brush my teeth - text message from Zeolharxyon "Z" Y-6357. I picked up my phone and read it.
"Parents are crying. Never thought that this day would come. So happy right now, see you at school."
Z was my best friend at school. The fact that today, for the first time ever, one of his kind was elected president made me extremely happy. I made sure to hide this happiness from my father the rest of the morning before heading to school.
