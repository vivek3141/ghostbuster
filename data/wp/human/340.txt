Today was the day.
When I heard that my daughter's killer had lost his latest appeal, I had started waiting for this day. At six foot eight the man was powerful. He could have had gainful employment in a number of jobs. I heard the talk from the guards that this man read a book a day. I wonder what his life would have been like if he had applied himself.
Instead, one unusually cold day in October, he went up to Katie's car, pulled a gun, and demanded that she get out. Katie had always been a fierce girl, not one to let anybody tell her what to do. I'd taught her that her life is more valuable than any of her possessions, but her attitude got the better of her. And then she was dead.
It wasn't the crime he was sentenced to death for, but a life of crime always had casualties. One of his just happened to mean something to me.
The day of his execution, I waited with baited breath for the request. I'd cooked lobster, pizzas, and apple pies. I'd made the last hour of many men's lives slightly better. I couldn't imagine what this man would want. I always prepared the kitchen beforehand for anything I might need to make.
Two hours before his execution by lethal injection, I received a piece of paper. I leaned over the counter and opened it up.
Grilled Cheese and Fries. I got to work.

Twenty minutes later I brought the tray to the killer's cell. I peered in at the large man, sitting on his bunk with his head in his hands. After I tapped on the glass I got a glimpse of his face.
He was crying.
I opened the slot and slid the tray in. Once he had a hold of it, I let go and turned away.
"I'm sorry."
I froze, unsure of what to say. The man had killed Katie. He had made life harder for Katie's mother and myself, and he had done it over a shitty '93 Jeep Cherokee. I turned.
He stared into my eyes and said it again.
"I'm sorry. I really am."
I turned and resumed walking away. Just before he was out of earshot, I glanced at him.
"So am I."
