"Dear God, make it stop."
A mumble, a rumble. It's quiet and soft somewhere down the endless lines of clones.
He can't tell which one is defective this time but he goes down the line slowly anyway, pretending he doesn't notice the clone that is just a little too tall, a little too tanned to be normal.
Normal. Ha.
He checks off everything on his checkboard. He walks away, pretending he doesn't see any flaw in the line of clones.
There are...more errors everyday. The clones are no longer as standardized as they once were, back when the gene feeds were pure. There are more errors as something in the Sentience Matrix machine gets more twisted.
"Dear-"
He doesn't watch as a robot leaps down from the ceiling, swallowing the clone in an instant. The robot lands on the floor, head swivelling around for a moment to assess the clones around it. It stands in a patch of dark liquid.
He looks away.
He looks away, because that could have been him, instead of a clone.
He has to do what the robots want though. It's better like that, when they have more humans to harvest. Humans that aren't...real people. Just clones.
He tries to ignore the odour of rust in the air as the next batch of clones trudges into the chamber.
