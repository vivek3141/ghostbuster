As I ran over the gravel path to get to the hidden clearing, I glanced at my watch. Two minutes to 11. I thought back to the morning, when I found the post-it note stuck to my ceiling "23:00 - you know where." The handwriting was calligraphic, reminiscent of medieval manuscripts.
I slowed down, arriving at my destination and taking a second to catch my breath. I inhaled the cool winter air and surveyed the area around me. Dead grass and leaves covered the ground around me. I looked at my wrist again and saw my watch stop. The minute hand quivered. A flash of light illuminated the clearing. Blinded, I looked away until I could see my hands again. Blinking fervently, my gaze moved to the center of the clearing where a old, bearded man stood with a gnarled staff.
