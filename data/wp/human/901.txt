In the land of the dead, a healer is a bad thing.
I accidentally made a vampire explode trying to heal his cut. The elder lich to his left tried attacking me, but was so badly hurt by a simple touch that she ran off. And then there was the incident with the zombie hoarde. I didn't know that healing a sodding zombie would make it loyal!
And then the spirits started to come to me. They wanted either deliverance or residence. I jokingly said I needed an empire first so that they could haunt somewhere in peace while I tried. Didn't realise they and the zombies took this to heart and started planning. The next thing I knew, I had angry dead and undead attacking me, and a body count higher than Dracula (he sent his congratulations). And an empire.
In the land of the dead, a healer can be a very bad thing.
