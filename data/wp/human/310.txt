Grills.
He's got one gold tooth, yet the motherfucker calls himself Grills.
"Keeping the party going?"
"Nah, nah, nah. Just got up. You know. Going out tomorrow. Just being prepared." I lied, bouncing from foot to foot. I felt the 6 baggies hit my palm as he slapped me five.
"You gonna be real..." My back was already to him as I scurried down the sidewalk. "Save me the fucking sales pitch" I think to myself, knowing I'll be calling him again in an hour...sweating, shaking, hating myself.
The fuck is wrong with me? Like I ain't ever seen a movie before. Old Chinese dude in a dusty shop. Yeah, this shit always ends well...riiiiiight. Makes perfect sense too. Old Chinese dude. Chinese antiques. Chinese spices. Chinese art. Oh, and Merlin's Coin. Merfuckinlin's Coin he tells me. $308.80 a day until I'm financially secure. $308.80 a day until I burn my lips off on this fucking crack stem is more like it.
Oh, I had high hopes. High hopes I did. Gonna get out of debt. Gonna get caught up on my rent. Gonna make something of myself. Gonna smoke that $308.80 right the fuck up. That's what I'm gonna do. That's what I did. That's what I've been doing for the past 8 months.
The plywood was hardly back in place before I was pulling out my piece and loading it up with a fresh whack. Pop, pop, sizzle, and I'm out. Tingly. Warm. Fuck that Chinese motherfucker and his fucking King Arthur coin of the fucking round table bullshit. The lighter flares up, I inhale, hold it.
"$308.80 a day to turn my life around. Ain't that some shit?"
