Frantically he ran through the halls. '*This can't be it*', he thought to himself. He had been all over the building three times now. All the exterior doors were locked. He was alone.
He remembered lunch, at his desk, alone. Nothing unusual before then. He was a little hungry and didn't let his hot pocket cool off. After burning his tongue a bit had become stuck in this throat. The last thing he remembered was falling to the floor as he blacked out.
When he came to, the office was empty and all the doors locked.
*This must be hell. *
He quickly learned that jogging down a hallway is a poor time to have an existential crisis as he rounded a corner and smacked straight into Gertrude, knocking her out cold.
Her phone buzzed on the floor so he picked it up. A conversation was open with a new message.
Hey! Are you still coming
to the company picnic
this after noon?
Everyone is here.
Yea, I just need to get
something out of my desk.
K. Remember, don't tell Stanley!!!

Stanley walked out the door, having 'borrowed' the keys from Gertrude. On his way home he spied an apple tree. Near to top was a shiny red apple. There was also a less appealing apple hanging quite a bit lower in the tree. Stanley's choice was plain to see.
