I made myself look out the window again. Through the light drizzle I can still see him standing there, under the dim red glow of the streetlamp. He hadn't moved, and he's still looking. Letting the curtain fall back into place, I slouched back into my chair.
He couldn't possibly know. That would be impossible. Although...my gaze shifted to the stack of plane, train and bus tickets on my table. One ways, all of them, and all in the last 6 months. Some from far off places, Russia, Hawaii, Prague; others from closer, Manchester, France. All from before I'd learnt how to get home, when I didn't know what was happening to me. Maybe I'd attracted some attention, coming back from all over the globe, but never going? Does the government keep tracks on that? No. Of course not. Who would care?
He'd been following me to and from work for the past week now, I was sure of that. I'd thought it better than to start appearing inside work, just in case. But every time I got off the tube, I'd see him: in the next carriage, on the opposite platform, walking past. I wasn't sure it was the same person. But now he was outside my house.
I took a glance through the curtains, hoping with all my might that he had gone, that I was being paranoid, that he just happened to be around me. He hadn't gone. He was still just standing there, his arm at a perfect right angle holding up his black umbrella. I stared, trying to make out features, trying to come up with a reasonable explanation as to who he could be, what he could want, and why he was following me.
Then he vanished.
