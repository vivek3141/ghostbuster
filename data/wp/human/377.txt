*Well, this sorta blew up a bit more than I expected for something I just thought of in the shower before work today. I suppose I'll have a go at it now that my comment can be buried in my own thread, away from all the scrutiny that is writing criticism. *

I want to complain about getting a text message that woke me up early in the morning, but it's not early, fuck, it's not even morning anymore. 2:00 pm and I'm just rolling out of bed, hungover as all hell. Didn't really matter though, I don't have shit to do today, or the next 11 days for that matter. Yup, 11 more days of lounging around in my little home sweet hole in the wall. Oh, but don't get me wrong here, I'm not on vacation, I didn't take a leave of absence or anything like that, nah, my fat ass got canned. Seems like the construction market in south Florida isn't as strong as one might have hoped. Without my shitty little hard labor construction job I don't have rent money, and without paying rent I get an eviction notice...and well, you see where I'm going with this. 11 days until I'm without even this roach infested box to live in.
**Shandra: sry stan but this aint gonna work out anymore goodbye**
A simple text message from a simple whore. Whatever, big fucking surprise. She was fucking half the guys in this swamp-town anyway. Sitting up in bed was more painful than Shandra leaving me. It felt like a 100 marbles rolling around in my skull.
**Ding**
"Fucks sake, what now?" I yelled out loud to myself, like some half drunk half hungover crazy hobo. Look at me, I still have 11 days until I'm homeless and I'm already a natural.
It wasn't a text, it was an email. Strange that it made a "dinging" sound though. I don't have an sound notifications turned on for my emails, turns out small time construction company bosses don't even know what email *is. *
**Would you like to change the difficulty settings? Current setting: Very Hard**
Oh good, Viagra is spamming me now? It was one time, one god damned night - ugh.
Strange, the email has *no* sender. I don't think I ever saw that before, was that even possible? Fuck do I know about computers though. A masters degree in Philosophy doesn't teach you much about computers besides the morality of using one to keep a brain alive or some horse shit like that. Oh yah, my degree? Yea, that cost me only about 78 grand, which I've paid back a whopping 3 grand of. Fuck if I care though, love to see a debt collector find me when I'm living under a bridge blitzed off of 3 dollar vodka.

Yeah, how about I call up Nigeria before I do this, there's this prince there I know that will help me out with this decision. Deleted. Fucking idiot spammers.
If I thought *sitting up* was bad, *standing up* was something a masochist would spend their spring break doing. It isn't all for not, though! The one thing that will keep me ticking for the next few minutes is the last bottle of Yuengling I left myself in the fridge. A little hair of the dog to get me going on this eventful Thirsty Thursday.
You ever stub your toe while being hungover? I'm certain there are poor fucks in North Korean camps that are having a better time than me, the gross happiness quotient of Guantanamo Bay prisoners eclipses mine right now. Honestly, the only worse sight of the blood seeping out of my big toe onto the floor right now is the beer it's mixing with.
Yep, when I fell to the floor so did my sweet, poor, innocent brew.
**Ding**
Holy shit I'm about to throw this fucking phone out the god damn windo- wait.. what the fuck?
**Are you sure you don't want to change the difficulty setting? **
Alright, whatever. Boom. Click that box right next to EXTREMELY FUCKING EASY (just like Shandra, am I right boys?) It's not like I can afford to keep the service on this phone after a few weeks anyways why would I care if I just let a virus rifle threw my shit? As long as answering the email makes it stop fucking bothering me then I'm set.
Sure is weird though, just as I hit send the bleeding in my toe stopped, hell, it doesn't even hurt anymore.
Holy shit, is that a $50 crumpled up under the couch? When the fuck did that get there? Whatever, I guess. Looks like daddy is having himself a 24 pack or two tonight.
