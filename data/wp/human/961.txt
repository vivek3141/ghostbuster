"Oh my god, you should have seen it."
**The Space Time Hobo was telling another story. **
"Listen, one thing you should never, ever do...is give away power based on a number. That's what 'Karma' is...a number. Is someone with more of it a contributor? Yes. Does it mean he or she is, like, a good person? Hell no!
"But here...Well, I wasn't around for the fight, but I met someone who was. Called himself Kaantur-Set...I still don't know how to pronounce that. Anyway, weird little guy, but he told me what he saw.
"And what he saw...was a shattering of society and morals that would shock you. Once again, do NOT give power away based on a silly internet number.
"The big guys with all the karma...they were like superman and stuff, but without any of the morals. There were people who could shoot lasers, people who could vomit copies of themselves, turn other things into explosives...
"It made people crazy. They all went crazy, every one of them. They turned on each other, and themselves, because they couldn't deal with the world anymore.
"One 'Luna', and Kaantur told me this with terror in his eyes, she wrote stories for this...Karma. He remembered walking through a deserted city, and seeing this...shell of a person, writing on the walls with anything she could find. She had run out of paper, and now the city was her story, the never ending tale she couldn't stop writing. When she had no ink, she had to use blood. Her's or otherwise...‚Äù
**The Space Time Hobo looked down at the table. **
"Kaantur used 'Reddit' too, but his karma was so low he was still sane. But he will go crazy, he said. He's sure he'll go nuts. And then, and only then, will he be fine dying, and sharing the afterlife with the abomination that his internet kin have become."
