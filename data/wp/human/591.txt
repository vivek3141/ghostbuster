Crummable.
*What a crummy word* she thought, pulling the sheet off the word-a-day calendar.
"Definition: Capable of being crumbed or broken into small pieces," she read aloud.
She smiled, laughing to herself at the odd word. Craig would have liked it.
Just like that, the smile slipped off her face and her good moon crumbled into small pieces and fell to the floor. She put the calendar carefully back on Craig's desk and dropped yesterday's word – Successful – into the trash bin beside the filing cabinet. The clear mesh can held nothing but square pages ripped off the calendar, each one a crummable reminder of a day since he'd been gone.
