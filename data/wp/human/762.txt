The Orange Knight carried an orange flag.
Once it had been whole, but now hung tattered and listless, swinging limply with the trot of the mare. Ahead of him stretched a vast expanse of trees. Huge, scraggly behemoths that bent and twisted as if straightness offended them.
But the Orange Knight held the flag steady. Sword, armor, and pride had long since been abandoned, but the flag was still his. For as long as he was able, he would carry it aloft.
Torn though it was, the threads shone with the same luster as the day they were woven. Sharp. Radiant. Orange incarnate.
There was a time that the Knight had shone with by that same hue. A time of honor and regard—of laughter, carousing, and dance—but now he was Orange only in name.
As he rode he could feel the darkness rippling across his back, growing, ever growing, to consume him. He knew, but did not despair. For that Black would never reach the flag he carried. He might fall, here in this nameless land, but his flag would carry on.
He knew that someday, someone, would happen upon his bones. And inevitably they would approach. Terrified, but too entranced to leave it be. They would lift it aloft and shiver as they ran their fingers through the soft, singing tread. Just as he had so many years ago.
Then Orange would begin anew.
