There we were, once again as a family. You would have thought the storm would have torn us apart. But, as we sit down for a meal, which seemed as if we haven't done it in decades, we finally were able to smile. I look over to my wife as her smile was pregnant with the birth of happiness. Her eyes glowing, I whispered "I love you". A tear ran down her face, she walks to the bathroom to collect herself. I'm finally happy, just then a young voice yells out to me. "Mama pass the corn" I yell back to my son "FOO I AINT CHO MAMA, I'M YO PAPPY". Embarrassed, my son frowns as he finishes his supper.
That was the first time, and the last time, he called me mama.
