Hi all!
This is a poem people really like that I wrote for a prompt this week. I thought you might enjoy it:
---

Alone at last,
See how far time has past...
Violynn,
My dear, with me throughout the din...
Now all's calm,
As we sing the wearies' last psalm...
Through trial and through error,
We have learned each other and our ways,
Pleasing ourselves and other's favor,
Living life full in all our days.

Can anyone help with the word "wearies"? Which isn't a word. I mean weary, but referencing the two characters (and fitting in the poem).

Thanks for reading. Feedback is appreciated.
