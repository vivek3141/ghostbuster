This was it. The only man who could stand in my way had agreed to face me in single combat. Legend said that none could defeat him. Legend was wrong.
There were older stories, from before his time. From before he was called a god on Earth. They told of a lost weapon, a sword that could strike down any foe, even one as powerful as he. And I had found it.
We stood across from one another in the space between the two armies. This was my chance to show them he wasn't a god. This was my chance to be a hero. This was my chance to rule.
"I give you one last chance to turn away, lest the gods forsake you. I am the Immortal Champion, their will incarnate. Do you really think you can stand against me?"
I shifted my grip on the sword. I smiled, and my response was a single word:
"Yes."
