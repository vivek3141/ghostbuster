"Not yet", he said "Not now".
"Your mother" said His Death, "do you remember what she said?"
"She said that she would meet me there", recalled the man.
"And your children", replied His Death, "who passed before you one by one".
"The same promise, I know", said the man "but I don't want it to end like this".
"You have passed the point of being able to die surrounded by family," said His Death, "We both know that".
"You have been a true friend to me", the man whispered, his face cast towards the floor so that tears welled up in his eyes, "my last friend".
"It has been hard for me as well", said His Death, reaching across the table to comfort the man.
And there was silence.
"You will not die", said His Death, "you're only going home".
