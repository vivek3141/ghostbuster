"Who the fuck are you and how did you get into my house?" Lenny said, exasperated and confused as he set down his groceries. "It's Leonard, right?" said the stranger, with a blank expression, and just a hair too little of an upward inflection. Lenny reached for the baseball bat he kept by the front door. "Oh. Leonard, there is no need for violence. I've only come to grant your wish." "What the FUCK are you talking about? Who are you? Get the fuck out of my house!" Lenny pointed the bat at the stranger and then the door. "Out!" he roared. "August 2nd, 1982. You wished for a radio flyer and your parents to stop quarreling all the time." Lenny's eyes opened wide as he remembered the night vividly. "It takes about 20 Earth years to travel from my quadrant to twenty-two twenty-two Muskogee Court, but I am here. Here to grant your wish. I couldn't make it in time to stop your parents from divorcing, but please take this wagon as a token of my grattitude." "Gratitude?" Lenny asked. "Yes. You see. My 'people' need to be invited to Earth in order to make the journey. Your wish served as that very invitation. Not many of us make it." "Why do you come here? What's the point?" "Oh, resources, to study life," the stranger trailed off. "Too feed." He said, coldly. Before Lenny could let the words register and send a signal from his brain to his arm to pick up the bat, he'd need swallowed entirely whole.
The end.
