Good morning Pain,
I guess I'm waking up again.
I wonder what will hurt today?
My knees are already killing me,
My thumb has been broken for a week.
2 Hours, medication free...So,
a couple harmless sleeping pills to stop the chills,
alter my brain, my new weakness
Medicated happiness or sleep
Sure as Hell don't come cheap.
But the best things in life are never free.
The best things are slowly killing me.
Oxycontin 40's...how nice...
To feel nothing but your breath
The morphine will do the rest.
All the stress lifts off my chest.
I'm blessed.
Sleep.
Good morning pain,
I didn't O.D. So i guess I'm waking up again.
I wont hurt today, shipment came it, I'm saved
