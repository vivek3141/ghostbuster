"So, you'd like to be an anti-villain."
"Pah! Don't make me laugh!"
He is sitting on the edge of my laptop screen. The characters come out from time to time, but only when I haven't taken my medicine. I keep telling Dr. Sylvia I don't need it. But the Baron makes me think twice about that.
"True villainy is true fame. Who forgets the real geniuses, Hitler and Stalin and Emperor Nero? That is who I must be. It's not so hard. Just start writing. I'll help you."
"What about Victor?"
"Oh, it's always about Victor with you!" He jumps down, his small frame pressing its weight upon the R key. "Will you let him go already? Dressing him up over and over again has done nothing for you. He's only holding you back."
"Don't talk about Victor like that! At least he respects me."
"You don't get it, do you? He's your favorite. Of course he tells you whatever you want him to say." He steps on my hand, and I pull it away. "I'm telling you what you need to hear. Forget about him. Write a story about me. About only me."
I push my chair back and stand up. "I'm taking my meds."
"You'll never get what you want if you keep being stubborn!"
I walk away.

Victor is waiting for me in the bathroom. "Hey Jim."
"What? Oh. Hey. I'll talk to you later."
"Hey, wait. I thought we had a handle on this, man." If there's one thing Victor and the Baron agree about, it's that they don't like me taking the pills.
"I'm sorry, dude. I just need to...be alone for a bit."
"Look, I've been thinking. Maybe the Baron is right. Writing his story would be good. Maybe."
I stare at him. "You don't believe that."
"Don't take the pills, Jim. Please."
I lay my head in my hands. I have a splitting headache. "Just leave me alone, Victor." I pick up the pill bottle. "I just want to be left alone."
