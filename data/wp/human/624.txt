Reginald woke up to find that there was a seal staring at his face and laying on top of him. He screamed and the seal screamed and then the seal ran away, pushing past his bedroom door and out into the hall.
"What the fuck was that?" he said. That fishy, watery smell had stuck around in the room. His carpet was wet, his blanket was wet, and he was pretty certain mold was going to grow underneath his carpets if he didn't do something about it right now.
"I'd better call Animal Control," he said.
Then a voice popped into his head:
"Kerrville Animal Control Hotline, how can I help you?" said a voice in his head.
He looked at his hands. Definitely no phone there.
"Hello? Can I help you?"
"Uh," said Reginald.
"What is the nature of your emergency, sir?"
"I...you can hear me?"
What the fuck is going on, thought Reginald.
"There is no need for that language, sir," said the voice on the other line. "If you do not have an animal problem - "
"I do, I do," said Reginald. "It's that...it's Texas, and there's a seal in my bathroom. I don't know what's going on. Can you send someone over to pick up the seal?"
"Another breather. God, I hate this fucking job," said the person on the other end of the line as she hung up.
He stared out the window. He could hear the sound of rushing water as he looked out at the Texas suburb.
How did a seal get into my house? said Reginald.
Then he noticed the growing puddle of water on the carpet when he turned around.
In the bathtub, the seal was enjoying a leisurely cold bath.
"What the hell are you DOING?" screamed Reginald at the seal as it wallowed in the bathtub. The seal made a noise not unlike a bark and a whine as it turned slowly in the bathtub full of water, the faucet running full blast.
"How did you even open my faucets?"
