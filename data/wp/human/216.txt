It was a long day.
I wish I had a million dollars.
Denied.
I wish Daddy would come back home safe.
Granted.
I wish Tim would fucking die.
Who is this Tim? This stupid machine never gives me any context. Tim could be the next Hitler for all I know. But I'm not into killing people.
Denied.
I wish I could pay this month's rent.
Granted.
I wish Mommy was still alive.
It pains me to see these wishes. As much as I want to help, I don't want to play God.
Am I God?
Denied.
I wish she would love me.
Denied.
I wish I didn't need to live anymore.
Denied.
I miss you.
