The children rolled their eyes.
"It's true. They came out of the box and you had to plug them in and charge them. If you didn't want to receive any calls you could just turn them off!" Franklin said, wagging a finger towards the translucent personal device he had set down on the counter.
"Yeah, but *did* you turn it off?" Sandy asked her father.
"Sure. Sure I did. I turned it off all the time!" Franklin said, defending himself.
"Mr. Waters says that people never turned off their devices anyway." Sandy continued smugly. "*And* in order to charge them you had to plug them into a wall and use energy generated from using coal."
Franklin scratched his head and sighed, "Well. You see-"
"And this was prior to the Online Security Act of 2020." Sandy continued, "Before that companies left their software with back doors that allowed hackers in to steal your stuff."
"And the government." Franklin grumbled. "Now the government controls all of it. And you can't get them out of your pocket!"
Sandy rolled her eyes again as she tabbed through Social media. The device, when inactive, looked like a clear piece of plastic that could be folded and stretched. It had no buttons whatsoever, because it didn't need any. There were no ports to plug into a power outlet (an out dated home accessory) because the device remained powered through solar energy. She smirked as her father continued to grumble at the kitchen table about how kids these days didn't understand anything and how the government spent too much time in other peoples business.
