Nothing will bring her mother back. Nothing will lessen her pain. It will take time for to her to heal.
But you should remind her the purpose behind the words everyone says when someone dies. "Sorry for your loss."
Look in to those words further. *Her* loss. Because her mother has left her, it is her life that is affected, not her mothers. Her mother no longer feels pain, sadness, grief or depression. Her pain has ended. She has moved on to what we all hope is somewhere better and peaceful.
Even though we all want to live full, happy lives, there is a point where the suffering of living is far worse than death. It sounds like she left early which makes the time lost from her sad, but it's not sad that she left at all.
We all die. Her mother's suffering is over. The grieving process is realizing and trying to repair the hole that their death leaves in the lives of the rest of us. Instead of grieving over lost potential future memories, she should remember the good memories of the past and how much her mother loved her.
No words can make the pain go away but you can try to remind her what she should be thinking about now that she is gone. It's cheesy when everyone says 'remember the best things about them' but it's true. Because what matters is those things and how we remember those we have lost. It no longer matters if she argued with her mother, fought with her or took advantage of her. All that matters is the memories now.
I'm sorry to hear both of you lost your mothers but I can guarantee you both one thing. They are beyond happy that wherever they are now, they didn't have to bury you before they went.
