"What a view. You didn't have to do this, you know. I could have had a blank wall in front of me, and just thought my way through the past week. You know, moving pictures. Are you doing okay? You cried so much after my celebration. I think more people should celebrate death. I lived a full life. All my friends were there - the ones that were left, anyhow. And you were there. The kids. You need to leave, now. I won't let you see me go. Kiss me, my love, and make your way. I love you." (99 words)
