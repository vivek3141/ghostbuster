I stood in front of the bathroom sink and let the lukewarm water roll off my face and back into the sink. Without opening my eyes I reached for the hand towel and dried my face off. I had to get ready for my Chemistry midterm that was in two hours. The anxiety had been gripping me for the past two weeks, I had barely even talked to mom. This thought sent a sudden feeling of guilt to course through me. It was the anniversary of Ruth's death tomorrow. It was hard on Mom especially since she had raised us by herself without any help. She was never home working two jobs just to keep us fed, which is why she blamed herself so much when my little sister killed herself. I of course blamed myself too. I kept telling myself I should've been home sooner. I shouldn't have been goofing around playing video games with my friends. If only I was there I could've stopped her and prevented all of this.
The water spilling over the sink sent me back into reality. "Shit...shit." I swore before quickly turning off the tap. I ran a hand over my face in exhaustion and glanced into the mirror. At first I thought I was dreaming. There right in front of me, in the mirror was Ruth. Her black curly hair still in two tiny pigtails and her favourite Yoshi shirt, the one I bought her for Christmas. "Ruth?" my voice came out strained barely a whisper. She smiled innocently in response. I leaned in closer to the mirror and rubbed my eyes. She was still there to my surprise.
"Brother! Come on let's go play!" She called to me her voice rehashing memories I wasn't aware I had forgotten. Hesitantly I placed my hand on the mirror I had seen horror movies, I didn't want to be that idiot but it was my sister.
My hand passed through, it felt like I stepping into a giant jello wall but I continued into the mirror anyway. Chemistry could wait, my sister could not.
