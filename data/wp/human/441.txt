Mary glared in shock at the boy as he walked quietly into the library, and it began to get dark as if it were the end of a movie.
"WHAT THE -bleep-?! ", she shouted. "HOLD ON A MINUTE!"
The boy named James stopped his steps, and turned around. "U-Um...are you talking to me?"
"Duh, James! ", Mary said.
"H-how do you know my name?"
"That's not the point, James. The point is, you need to win Sarah back! Screw, Tom! He doesn't deserve her!"
"But, Sarah made it clear that-"
Mary raised her hand and backhanded James. "Are you going to let *Sarah* decide for herself?! She obviously doesn't know what's best!"
James looked at his hands. Who was this stranger that weirdly knew details abou his life? *Maybe I should go to the police*, he thought. On the other hand, she *was* right. Sarah didn't know what was right for herself. Heck, she couldn't even choose who the correct husband would be! A hardworking man like James or a deadbeat loser like Tom!
"I can't believe I'm taking advice from a 13 year old. ", James said.
Mary looked up at the 30 year old me. "Now, go get your Sarah back."
