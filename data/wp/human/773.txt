The town was just a place I stopped on my way somewhere else.
My mother emotionally abused me and my dad physically beat me. All my friends had left years ago. There wasn't anything left for me in Anaheim.
I had left years ago. Off to college, then off to work. I was fairly successful. Had a good paying job, my own house. Had a family in the making. I lived on the opposite coast.
So why was I here? Back in this town, no longer my home? I was just passing through, on my way to a convention up in San Francisco.
I am here on nothing more than a coincidence.
You may call me heartless. There may even be some that think I caused it. I assure you, I got in town today, and I leave today. I have not been here in over half a year. I had no part in the deaths of my parents.
I come not to pay my respects, but to spit on their graves.
This is not a place where I stay, where I "feel" or cry. It's not a place for me to be comforted. This town is just a place I'm stopping in on my way elsewhere.
