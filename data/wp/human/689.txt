-What happens if you don't?
-It hurts, schmurts.
-Hurts how?
-I don't know, schmow. It hurts all over, schmover.
-Let's go to the doctor. I will call him to say we are coming over right now.
-I'm fine, schmine. Just let me be quiet and see how it goes tomorrow morning, schmorning.
-No, I'm not waiting. You have gone insane. Where does it hurt? Tell me where it hurts. Show me what happens when you talk normally.
-It hurts, schmurts. Trust me, darling shmarling.
-Gah! You're impossible. You know I don't have time for this. I have to take the dog to the vet in the morning and then go to work all day, and then--
-Let's just be quiet, schmuiet. Let's sleep, schmeep.
-OK fine. You deal with it in the morning. I don't have time for this, OK? It's always something with you. You are acting crazy.
-OK fine, schmine. Let's sleep, schmeep.
-Gah! Shut up already. Just sleep. Good night.
