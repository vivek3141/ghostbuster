Told from Pooh`s perspective
So me and my mates are having a ball at Chris`s birthday. You know, loud music, (holy shit Kanga and Roo are the best DJ duo [even though he's 15 now]) good location, some good beer, and Chris looks horny. I ask him" Bother, Chris, why are you looking so odd?"
He responds, "Old bear, I was thinking that we could go to a strip club."
Trigger, who tried some shot combining a espresso and vodka, and now is even crazier than normal, shouts "oh YES YES YES getting laid is what tiggers do best!"
I would describe the rest. Of the evening, but I have a multimillion dollar contract now with Disney, so I can't exactly talk about that. Say, would you like some honey? A happy, healthy appetite, makes a happy, healthy you!
