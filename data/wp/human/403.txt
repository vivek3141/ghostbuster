The first punch gets me right in the ribs, knocking the wind out of me. I half-crawl towards him from where I fell on my ass, feeling the flush of adrenaline starting to take hold.
It's a dirty fight, I suppose. We focus on causing as much pain as possible - cruel to be cruel. He stinks.

The actual first punch was somewhat expected. The sun was hot, uncomfortably so, but we felt obligated to enjoy it. The ground in our neighbourhood was both more and less interesting in the summer. Deep cracks and canyons traced out a huge map that stretched from his backyard to the fabled danger-zone of the main road, but it lacked the fascination of living and moving insects, driven underground by drought.
What else could two boys do, but fight? It was fun. We laughed afterwards. We compared bruises for weeks; his turned yellow first.
If there was blood, I don't remember it.
We both of stunk afterwards. Of sweat and dirt and pure heat.

He's lost weight - or, rather, is in the process of losing it. The bones in his wrists are becoming visible.
It's summer again, not that you would know with the blinds so thick. They've trapped the air, and it's warm without any real heat.
Clich√©, really, to be like this now. *He was such a nice kid...* Everyone was. Everyone is. I haven't reconnected, run into him on the street; people fall by inches.
He starts to cry. Not like in the movies. It's mostly snot (mixed with a little blood). Drool begins to gather at the corners of his mouth. I have to look away.
