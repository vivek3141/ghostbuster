I slowly walk out of the alley, and blend with the crowd. As I walk, it hits me: It worked. It actually worked. I was sent back to 2014, before it all started. I had three years to stop it, no other purpose. The Russians invaded the Ukraine, and kept going. Before we knew it, they had planted trackers in all the anglets on shoelaces. Who would have suspected? They learned habits and positions of all enemy troops, and took full advantage of it. The captain told me to find him in this year, and explain to him whats going to happen. I'll be lucky if I don't get shot trying to get into Fort Wilson, and luckier if I don't get arrested after I explain. How crazy does it sound? "Sir, I'm from the future with a message: Destroy all world shoelaces" Christ, I don't believe myself saying it and I saw what it did to the world. I snap back to reality as I'm walking with the crowd. Fashion sure was weird three years ago. I don't miss the neon green swag hats, and ironic mustaches. Why can't I be eradicating swag merchandise? I would take personal pleasure in that. "Destroy Shoelaces, Destroy the Russians" That was what they told me before sending me back. I wasn't even aware we had time travel equipment, yet here I am about to save the world, one shoelace at a time.
