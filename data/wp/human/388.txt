The quiet squeaky steps of my front porch have seldom been kept up. I am a brick house. My interior looks like someone from the 70's plastered their retro look on me. Baige shag carpet, green and orange wallpaper, I once felt the hustle and bustle of my tenants, but something happened ten years ago that made the first tenants leave. I don't know if it was something I did or if it was possibly a death in the family.All I know is I was boarded up and left here. I felt at peace, I rested. It felt good to rest those ten years, but recently, some new tenants came in, I don't remember them knocking. They filled my air ducts with smoke, and I felt the occassional burn singe into my shag carpet. They came 3 months ago. Ever since then I've felt dirty inside, like there was a grit about me. I overheard one of the tenants scream about drugs and getting high, whatever that means.
It's 2am, I notice cars lining up on the block, only they aren't regular cars, they are police cruisers. Well this is embarrassing, it looks like they are looking at my lot. It hasn't been kept up. I feel naked. Oh, there they are lining up...oh my it looks like they are going to break down the door with that big metal apparatus. I think this is gonna hurt.
