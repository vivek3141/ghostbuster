Here you are again. Back to same point you were 365 days ago. Your house littered with empty bottles. You keep telling yourself this year is it. The year you will finally get your life back on track. But you can't. Alone. Nothing but an empty shell of your former self. You throw away the last mirror in your house. You take one final look, disgusted. The only evidence of your existence remains in a photo of you and her. You take a final swig and collapse helplessly on the floor. Your dreams soon become bitter memories. You remember five years ago you told her the same resolution you made this year, but you lied to her then. You never did that before. She asked if you were okay to drive after that New Years Eve party, and you said "Yes.". Another lieâ€¦.Another failed resolution.
