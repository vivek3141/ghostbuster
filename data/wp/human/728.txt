Welcome to my brain:
Right Brain: "It wasn't until you showed up that I understood what love was. True love is something you can't escape. 'It is an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken.' I see your flaws, but love you for them. We have been through many lives together, and we will be together for many more to come. Looking at you is like looking at myself in the mirror. With one touch, suddenly the universe unfolded itself for me, and it's the most beautiful thing I could imagine. It's like everything was created for the two of us to find each other."
Left Brain: "You think you can get away with playing me? I'll show you a game you're not even prepared for. You want to make a girl fall in love with you? Alright, but be careful what you wish for. I'm giving you everything I've got."
Right Brain: "Beyond this game, beyond the lies and manipulation, can't you see this is what makes us so perfect? It started off with deceit, but don't you see there are levels to this? No one makes me feel more like myself than you do. How could I move on from this? How could I give up without a fight? Please, don't let me go."
Left Brain: "Just fuck off, you robot. Do you really have nothing better to do? You have a family, ok. Just admit you have no feelings for me, or probably feelings at all, and leave me alone. This game isn't fun anymore."
Right Brain: "I miss you."
