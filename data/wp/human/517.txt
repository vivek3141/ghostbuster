"God damn it, Jerry! Don't do that!"
Slack jawed, Jeremiah turned to face Elizabeth. "Blasphemy!" He exclImed. "You mustn't speak of the lord in such a manner, Elizabeth. Also," he took a step back and turned to look at the people passing them by on the sidewalk. "My name is Jeremiah, my dear. I would greatly appreciate your remembering my name."
"And I go by Lizzy-,"
"Yes, well that is incredibly unsophisticated, Elizabeth. A woman goes by her god given name, and nothing else," he turned and looked at her from the corner of his eye, "though if the lady were betrothed, the man -,"
Lizzy groaned and turned away from him. "Why is this even my life?" She called, glaring up at the sky. "Take him back you assholes!"
Jeremiah walked up behind her and placed a hand in her shoulder. "My dear, the peasants will think you a witch!"
Her right eye twitched as she turned back on him. Her hands shook as she pointed an accusatory finger at him. "You," she said, poking him roughly in the chest, "may have opened a fucking wormhole in my living room last week, *jerry*, but if you don't start catching up with how people behave present day, I swear to god, I will kill you and happily take whatever consequences stepping on that particular butterfly create!"
"Elizabeth, -,"
"Lizzy!"
He stepped back, eyes wide as he nodded slowly. "L...izzy."
She let out a breath. "Good. Now what?"
"There is a man in blue aiming a modern weapon at you. What does a strong, modern woman such as yourself do in such an instance?" He question, nodding behind her.
"Oh for fucks -,"
"Truly, the lord must have heard my prayers of your redemption. God speed, Elizabeth!"
