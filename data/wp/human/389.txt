I am not like the others. We have all existed since the dawn of time, forever in a constant cycle of death and rebirth. Yet they are unknowing, cut off from their previous lives. I am not so fortunate. I am forced to remember everything. Forced to remember every death, from dying in the Big Bang, to being eviscerated by knights, to dying of tuberculosis, to being riddled with bullets after an unsuccessful raid. I have lived a thousand lives, a burden which my psyche must confront daily as my mind is burdened with the trauma of my demises. And yet I feel bizarrely peaceful in the knowledge that my life is nothing but another link in an endless chain of lives I have left to live.
