It's been a 2 days now since the Zurbans arrived on earth.
They had been observing us for 200years until it was time to "reward" a species that had allowed diversity and balance to develop in their society.
We were all sceptical at 1st but after President Obama was shot with the ray of potential and addressed the world telepathically, well everybody took notice.
In his address he explained that the reward from the Zurbans would be realising the full potential of an ability that would better you as a human in your line of work or general life.
My names Jeff and I'm an unemployed stoner that plays video-games, reads comic books and watches Netflix all day.
I was sitting at home when the ray it me, later that day my best friend Tony from up the street came by to see what I had been rewarded with, he was a firemen.
Tony.
"Hey Jeff, what power did the Zurbans give you?"
Me.
"Why don't you tell me what yours is 1st?"
Tony.
"Well it's kinda like I can control fire and make it go wherever I want."
Me.
"No way man, prove it."
Tony.
"Well ok, I'm still getting used to it though.
You got a lighter?"
Me.
"Yeah man here you go."
Tony.
"Thanks, now watch this."
Tony flicks the lighter until a flame sprouts up, he then waves his other hand over the naked flame and it immediately starts to form a sphere of smooth orange and blue heat, getting bigger in mass by the second.
Tony.
"Pretty awesome huh?"
Me.
"Woah dude, that's nuts you're just like Pyro."
Tony.
"Yeah pretty sweet huh?
So what's your ability?"
Me.
"Well....you know how your abilities are meant to help you out in what you do day to day?"
Tony.
"Yeah like how I'm a fireman that can control fire, or how Steve down at the Zoo can talk to animals."
Me.
"Yeah exactly, well because all I do is use the internet for streaming and gaming.
My ability is I always have a perfect internet connection."
Tony.
"What do you mean exactly?"
Me.
"It's pretty simple, whatever device I use to connect to the internet on always has the best possible connection."
Tony.
"Really? Well that sounds useful, can you connect yourself to the Internet? because that's awesome."
Me.
"No I can only connect through a device."
Tony.
"Well can you at least do it wherever you want? Like just fire up a laptop in the middle of the woods and watch some sweet Kung fu movies on Netflix."
Me.
"Again no, it already has to have some kind of internet connection for me to make it perfect."
Tony.
"Hey at least you won't have anymore buffering though huh?
Cs man that's annoying."
Me.
"Yeah I guess, I'll always have good ping gaming as well."
Tony.
"Sure yeah, you'll always have the drop on everyone in the lobby, get that sweet prestige before all the nubs."
Me.
"Yeah man, I'll be the best player on every server. So you up for a quick game of COD?"
Tony.
"Actually man I'm going to keep practising my new ability, you know show this fire who's boss,
You wanna watch me?"
Me.
"That's ok, I'm going to get some game time in and get that prestige emblem."
Tony.
"Oh ok buddy, well I'll swing by later in and see what a perfect internet connection is actually like then.
See ya."
Me.
"Yeah man, we'll own for sure.
Catch you later on then."
So after talking with Tony and realising my ability might have some use I decided to fire up my PS4 and kick some ass on COD.
I logged in and joined the 1st ground war lobby that came up.

"You fags don't got no swag like me man, I'm straight up owning this shit, on top of this lobby like I'm top of your moms."

"Shut up kid, you stole my fucking care package when I was on a 15kill streak.
You better hope your not on the enemy team."
8008hunt3r04
"Stop crying like a lil bitch!
What ability did the Zurbz give ya? Super lil bitch powers?
Like if we need someone to cry us a river do we call you?.
My little sister doesn't cry as much as you and she's 3.
Ain't none of you little neck beards got these mad skills.
XXXepicsnip3ssXXX.
"No stupid kid, that's not my ability.
I'm an ambulance driver that can see 5seconds into the future when I'm driving so I always find the quickest route to an emergency."
8008hunt3r04.
"No you're lying, you're a Wambulance driver that always finds the quickest route to bitchtown so you can have a good cry about your shitty day."
XXXepicsnip3ssXXX.
"Fucking stupid kid. What's your ability then?"
8008hunt3r04.
"I can spot lil bitches from over 500 miles away and tell them about how much of a lil bitch they are.
In fact my lil bitch sense is going haywire right now."
XXXepicsnip3ssXXX.
"Fuck off, you little shit before I find where you live and come and kick your ass."
8008hunt3r04.
"How you gunna read a GPS with all those tears in your eyes?
I just thought of your superhero name by the way.
Bitchboy the biggest lil bitch in the world."
SMOKEWEEDTILLIMGREY (me)
"What's taking this match so long to load?
My connection is perfect, what's going on?"
8008hunt3r04.
"Here comes a new bitch!
That's my ability I can control game servers whenever I want and stop people from leaving.
My dad's a game developer and he lets me test out all the private servers.
And right now I want to let Bitchboy know just how much of a bitch he is.
I just got a call for you Bitchboy,
You wanna know who it was?"
XXXepicsnip3ssXXX
"No, not really."
8008hunt3r04.
"Sure you do,
it was the head of Maxfactor he wants you to test out their new waterproof mascara because if it stays on when you start crying then it'll hold up against a tsunami."
Me.
"Come on kid just start the game already, I gotta try out this perfect connection."
8008hunt3r04.
"Are you telling me what to do?"
Me.
"No, why? I just want to play the game."
8008hunt3r04.
"You ain't playing shit as long as I'm in this lobby, it looks I've got me a new bitch to abuse."
Me.
"That's it I'm out, fuck you kid."
I threw my headset on the ground and pulled out the power plug on my PS4.
It looks like the Zurbans were too quick to reward us all and maybe should have waited another 200 years before giving everyone an ability when we still had trolls in our society.
