A news channel is showing grainy security footage. A middle-aged man in sweatpants pushes his way through the trendy outfits in a crowded bar. He gets up onto the counter and begins to shout.
"My name is Dale!"
"Hey Dale!" a few patrons return his call, but most ignore him and continue
chatting away.
"My name is Dale!"
"Get the fuck down!" the barkeep shouts.
Dale unzips his sweatshirt to reveal a bomb. A few rush for the door.
"And I'm an alcoholic!"
The video abruptly stops and cuts to a news anchor.
"A tremendous act of violence last night kills fifty four at Dionysus, a new bar at Times Square. Alcoholics Anonymous claims responsibility for what experts are calling an act of terrorism. The group's spokesman had this to say…"
Cut to what looks like a torch-lit dungeon. A group of men and women wearing barrels on their heads with holes for eyes stand behind a single man, who is also wearing a barrel. The man steps up to a microphone.
"People have become powerless over alcohol, and society has become unmanageable. Until alcohol is forever banned, and everyone has turned their will over to God, as you understand him (he quickly adds), then we will continue our attacks until all have been restored to sanity!" he thrusts upwards with a finger and the group behind him cheers.
The news anchor is back on the screen, seen quickly putting away a flask. He clears his throat.
"Uhm, well then, ahem-ack, excuse me… more at eleven!"
