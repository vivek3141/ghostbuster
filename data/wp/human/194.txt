"Now's your turn. Don't sweat it, Larry. I'll get you off the hook. Just read this to the Judge and you'll be in the clear. Trust me, I didn't go to law school for nothing"
We share a nervous laugh.
"Thanks, man. I know sometimes public defenders get a hard rap, but you've really been a life raft for me." The very much actually guilty Larry thanked.
Larry approached the judge, armed with a boombox and dope...err...no, not that dope. At least not this time. No, only dope *rhymes* today.
*" Ahem. *
*You may know me as the drug kingpin. *
*But I don't even know, What is my sin? *
*We all got problems that I can see, man. *
*Slingin' heroine may be Larry's crime. *
*But don't jail a man while he's still in his prime. *
*I got three kids who need a free man. *
*Drop all charges cause crimes can't rhyme. "*
"Those were the doppest rhymes I've heard since '06. Great job!"
"Naw man, you wrote 'em. Thanks so much."
We share congratulations.
Now to work. "You're honor, we'd now obviously like to invoke the Johnnie Cochrane defense and send my client home!"
Judge Clemetine was a large man with a voice to equal. It bellowed through the courtroom. "Very well. I was about to hold the defendant in contempt for delivering perhaps the un-dopest lines I've heard since '06. Under the Cochrane Rule, the accused shall be pardoned of all crimes comitted *while* defending himself in the courtroom."
"Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit. I should've double checked that. I'm done forever. Shit." I began sweating profusely.
The judge continued. "So therefore, the defendant shall be acquitted of the charge of 3rd degree battery against rap. Now - to reiterate - as we all know, the Cochrane defense only applies to crimes comitted *while* defending oneself in court. So...moving on to the 17 counts of 1st degree manslaughter, 3 arson charges, 4 counts of interstate..."
The realization of what had just occured now dawned over Larry. "I have the worst fucking lawyers."
