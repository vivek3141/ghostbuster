"I can see angels, Mr. B. Angels flying in the sky!" I heard a girls voice say behind me after she drank from the chalice.
I got dizzy, my head started hurting and colors became intense as I floated out of my body. I saw some people sitting or laying down, heads thrown back as they were looking at the ceiling, tongues hanging out of their mouths as they gawked at the painted ceiling.
Higher I floated and saw some more people, running around in circles laughing, jumping for joy, dancing, expressing their intense joy. Some were kissing, making out all over the church, hooking up in the pews, and at least for puerile went into the confession booths.
I heard a fight break out. I don't know what caused it, nor could I see it very clearly as the colors intensified around me and became white.
I vaguely heard a groan, and felt something being pressed into my chest. In a daze, I saw the little girl standing over me. Her face wore a a grotesque grin and her eyes glowed yellow. I heard the groan again, and saw a huge figure behind her wearing an oversized old fashioned scuba dive suit, that looked like it dated to the fifties.
Oversized as the suit was, there were multiple eyes on the helmet, and two wires formed a cage over the helmet. She was saying something again, and I felt an object pressing into me again.
I floated back to my body, the colors becoming less intense. The grotesque grin on the girls face began to look less like a grin and more into a gaping mouth, as though she were screaming in terror.
The big man behind her became less huge and oversized as I got closer to my body. Gone was the suit, the size, and when I reached my body, I saw that I had one of the candlebra sucking through my chest, candles scattered around, their melted wax leaving, oozing, pouring onto the floor.
The pastor looked in terror at the scene of violence and debauchery around him, and ran to his office. The little girl though, her eyes were still glowing yellow.
