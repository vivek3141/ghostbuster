(A busy control tower for the JFK international airport seems to be buzzing along during another day in New York City. When suddenly one of the air traffic controllers notices an anomaly.)
Air Traffic Controller - "Sir, we have an inbound unidentified bogey coming in our airspace."
(The Officer in charge runs over to the Air Traffic Controllers monitor)
Officer Franklin - "Well try to make contact and get them to identify themselves. Check the flight plans."
ATC - "I have tried, Sir. There is nothing scheduled to be landing right now. They next inbound flight shouldn't be here yet. They won't respond and they haven't changed course. Should I call the authorities?"
(The ATC grabs the phone and holds it up.)
Franklin - "Damn it, go ahead. Are they interfering with any other flight's landing or take-off?"
ATC - "No, sir. I have alerted the authorities but, Sir..."
(ATC looks around worried)
Franklin - "What is it? I have to go meet the airport authority and figure out what the hell to do about this."
(Franklin says while turning back for the response)
ATC - "Well, (he says as he takes a deep breath) they are preparing for landing. They're decreasing in altitude and heading towards the main runway."
Franklin - "Without permission to land?? My FIRST day in charge and we have a goddamn UFO landing! I'm headed down there. MOVE!"
(Franklin runs out of the room while cursing under his breath)
____________________________________________________________
The entire airport has shut down. Airport authorities, local authorities, and federal agents have presence on the ground surrounding the plane. No one has emerged from the aircraft and it hasn't made any form of contact with those on the ground. The cockpit appears to be empty. All of the officers and tactical teams have surrounded the aircraft. Still the plane sits dormant.
Franklin - "I told you, we tried to establish contact and received absolutely no response. Before we could even make the first call, the damn thing was preparing to land. We put everyone in place as fast as we could. After it landed, it just turned off and didn't make any attempt to pull into a gate or anything."
Federal Agent Deacon - "I understand Officer Franklin. I just need to know all of the details. We have never seen anything like this before and don't really have a protocol for this situation. We have a plane with no record of existence in flight plans or tail number registration. It doesn't even match any of our existing registration codes. It just has the number 11 on the tail. No airline name or insignia...How many people do you think it could hold?"
Franklin - "I don't know it's a pretty small plane. It couldn't hold more than 20 people maximum."
(Throwing his hands up)
Deacon - "Why wouldn't they try to come out and talk? If they lost communication and tried to make an emergency landing they would have already tried to evacuate the plane and explain themselves...They obviously don't have malicious intent...or is that what they want us to believe..."
(He thinks out loud)
Franklin - "Well what do we do? Just sit here? Why haven't you made a move yet?!"
Deacon - "Calm down. I know this is literally your first rodeo, but it's new for all of us. I think we need to establish some sort of communication. There has to be someone on board that plane. It didn't just fly here itself."
As they continue bickering towards one another they fail to notice the door of the plane slowly lowering. All of the agents and officers point their weapons and eyes toward the door. An officer close by them notices.
Officer - "Guys we have movement!"
Franklin and Deacon look over at the hatch. The door is now open and yet still no one has emerged from the aircraft. Deacon grabs the megaphone and aims it towards the plane.
Deacon - "This is Federal Agent Jerome Deacon. Please exit the aircraft slowly with your hands in the air."
There is no movement from the plane. The door remains open but no life has been seen yet.
Franklin - "You are going to have send a team in there. What if they are preparing to fight or set off an explosive or something?"
Deacon - "Please, just let me do my job."
Franklin - "Well clearly you don't know how to do your job. I'll do it for you."
(He grabs the megaphone and starts shouting into it)
Franklin - "If you don't exit the plane immediately, we will have no choice but to open fireeeughhh..."
(Deacon rips the megaphone from Franklin and grabs him by the collar)
Deacon - "In all of my years as an agent I have never had someone so unskilled and untrained to screw everything up so fucking bad, now they are encouraged to attack you ass...."
(His words trail off as he sees a person coming out of the plane)
The woman with her hands raised above her head. Her head is hanging as if ashamed. She descends the flight of stairs and stops once she hits the ground. Deacon pushes Franklin off of him and picks the megaphone back up to his mouth. Franklin stares at the woman standing there in very unusual clothes. They look to be hand-made and nothing like any he has ever seen.
Franklin - "Well it worked didn't it?"
(Deacon looks at him in disgust and then refocuses on the woman)
Deacon - "Please step away from the plane and keep your hands raised. Anyone else on the plane please step out and join her with your hands raised. We just want to talk."
(Deacon lowers the megaphone and waits for a reaction)
The woman slowly steps towards the loud voice. She keeps her head down but continues on a path towards the amplified voice. Everyone stays focused on her. She is very thin with tan skin. She has very long black hair.
Franklin - "I don't know if you see what I see, but she doesn't "look" safe."
Deacon - "She barely weighs a hundred pounds and there's no way she could be hiding anything. You can see the outline of her body through her clothes."
Franklin - "Well I'm just saying, that "training" says she doesn't look safe."
The woman continues to get closer. She hasn't made any change to her stature. She still walks slowly with her head hanging, facing the ground. There has been no movement from the plane. Agents start to move forward. Deacon signals to them.
Deacon - "Alright stop right there! Is there anyone else on the plane?"
(He says into the megaphone. She shakes her head.)
Deacon - "Move in and sweep her. Check her and make sure she's not carrying anything."
(He says to the agents closest to her.)
The agents move in and get her to stop. They check her for anything and find absolutely nothing.
Agent - "She's clean!"
Deacon - "Alright, have everyone else perform sweeps around the plane. Check with the bomb squad to see if they can do it safely from a distance. Other than that leave it alone and keep your distance. Do not move inside until they get my go ahead. I want to talk to her first. Maybe I can get some answers."
____________________________________________________________
They sit in an airport interrogation room. Officer Franklin stands in the corner staring at the mystery woman. Agent Deacon sits across from her and pours her a glass of water. He sets it down in front of her but she pays no attention to it. She sits perfectly still staring at Agent Deacon. She hasn't said a word. He looks her in the eyes. He's never seen anyone with such focus. She looks him in his eyes and doesn't look away.
(Deacon clears his throat)
Deacon - "My name is Federal Agent Jerome Deacon, but you already know that if you speak English. Do you speak English?"
(The woman sits in silence still staring and nods ever so slightly.)
Deacon - "Okay, well let's start with your name. What is it?"
(The woman sits and stares blankly.)
Franklin - "This is bullshit. Where did your plane come from? Why did you land here?"
(Deacon holds his hand up to Franklin)
Deacon - "Please, I can handle the questions Officer Franklin. You are welcome to wait outside until this is finished. I don't need your..."
"Solaris." (She whispers faintly)
Both Deacon and Franklin stop and look at the woman.
Deacon - "What? I am sorry, I didn't hear you."
Solaris - "My name is Solaris."
