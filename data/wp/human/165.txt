When I was a child, I would always dream that I had wings and I would fly all over the town. I always told my parents that I am a superhero and they would pat me on the head with smiles.
The wonderful exhiliration of jumping off the roof of our house and flying off made me want to sleep all day. Sometimes I would dream that I have a friend who will fly with me and he always bring me fighting in the streets with him.
One dream, I was flying as usual with my friend and we touched down on the ground. I dreamt that I was singing when all of a sudden, a man in a black suit appeared. He looked normal with dark hair and pale skin but he wasn't moving from where he stood. I grabbed my friend's arm and told him we need to run.
We ran and then I flied but my friend can't. He looked scared. I flew away from him and when I looked back, he's gone.
I woke up crying to my parents that my friend is gone and the man in the suit took him. They simply gave me extra syrup for breakfast.
The next night, I was afraid to sleep because I was afraid of whatever took my friend but soon enough, I fell asleep. I dreamt that I was flying and then I saw the man standing on the rooftop. The moment our eyes met, I suddenly fell. I screamed as I fell towards the ground. I woke up crying for my mom.
Up until now, I still dreamt of the guy in the black suit. I have a fear of falling now and a certain distrust with man in suits. You just can't trust them.
