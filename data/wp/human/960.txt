I felt my passion rising as his hot breath warmed my cheek,
I start to pant as tingles run my spine.
My hands began to tremble, I could feel my knees grow weak,
Knowing that very soon he would be mine.
His hip brushed up against mine as I leaned in, smooth and slow,
My hand reached out to grab his coal black piece.
I smiled as I took purchase, feeling his excitement grow,
I trembled still, my shaking could not cease.
As I leaned in to whisper close, I couldn't help but grin,
For knowing now that I could have my way.
I sensed his body shaking too, I gently kissed his chin,
"Now king me." my most sultry voice did say.
