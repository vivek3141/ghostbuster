He sat in a stark room with his old friend, the paper cup of water spilled on the floor. It had been years since they splashed in puddles together, climbed book cases, rode a wagon, or threw a water balloon.
They talked about the girl in class, how they used to play house as kids. They talked about the babysitter, show and tell, and making up answers on tests. They talked about making "art" out of snow, snowball fights, stories his dad used to tell them, and how, "Life builds character."
They remembered the time mom let him smoke, and the time they played cards with a marked deck. They talked about the machines they built together as kids. (Oh, how they were ahead of their times!) They talked about visiting other planets, and dinosaurs, and x-ray guns.
They talked about the life lessons his friend taught him - how to be thankful for the little things in life and hugs.
They stared at their reflections, then hugged, a final goodbye.
He whispered, "Not so hard, you big sissy, you'll squeeze my tears out."
