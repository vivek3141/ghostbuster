I was a teacher of electronics in my dream, but that is too far away from where I woke up. I wouldn't be able to dumb it down enough if I tried.
When I woke, it turns out I am actually only 7 years old, celebrating my birthday one Christmas morning, even though my dream seemed as if I was in my mid 30's. I was pretty good at most disciplines in Science and Math, even gifted really, but a genius I am not.
My memories from the dream have faded just a bit, but not all of them. I remember the simple equations. I was good enough at math to even prove them if I new them, but I would have never figured them out on my own.
One day it will be just a legend. An example given in the text books, but when the apple hit me on the head, it reminded me of the gravity formula from my dreams. And then it all flooded back.
I lock myself in my house for 18 months and write everything I can remember from my dream about infinities and forces and optics.
If I have seen further than other men, it is because I have stood on my own shoulders after I learned from the shoulders of giants.
While I spend my life in math and science, I have no desire for love, because I left my wife of 15 years back in my dream. She was the only thing that made me happy in my dream, and I have seen nothing here to make me smile.
I spend my free time trying to remember the chemistry I knew to see if I can make my brain dream again. People here call it alchemy and I have to be careful not to get caught knowing too much.
I remembered that in my dream I liked codes, so I taught myself numerology and hid it throughout my works. I hope to pass a code to my future self.
I don't know whether or not I am mad, but I do know that I will never learn how he met their mother......
