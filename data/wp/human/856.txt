To drown in blood is a terrifying prospect.
Vlad watched the storage tank shake left and right as the boy inside shook helplessly against his death. The tank was made of pure bronze and hung vertically from the ceiling. It wasn't see-through, though Vlad could imagine what it was like to die in there very well. He had done it himself, after all. The tank stopped rattling.
The middle-aged man waited patiently, arms folded. It was a common trick to stop struggling in an attempt to appear you've died, when in reality you wait for the tank to open. Another shake, weaker than before. Vlad smiled.
It was good, the fight in the boy. It meant he would make a great addition to the ranks.
He walked over and stepped on the footholds, opening the top latch of the tank. He reached one arm in and grabbed the boy, pulling him out with ease. The limp body was barely 100 pounds, even soaking wet with blood.
Vlad put the boy down and extended his right finger-nail into a claw. He aimed at the boy's left breast and thrust his arm forward. A thin tube-like hole brought air to his heart.
The boy's eyes snapped open, now yellow, and he took a deep breath, though honestly, it was unnecessary. Breathing was a tough habit to break.
"Welcome," Vlad said with a broad smile. "Welcome to the Brotherhood."
The boy said nothing, instead looking around in wild movements of the pupil.
"Thirsty?" Vlad asked, holding out a pouch of blood.
The boy took it hungrily and ripped it open, not caring for any of the sweet liquid spilled.
Yes, Vlad thought, he would make a *great* addition.
