I rush and unlock the door, except I am greeted by more darkness.
I rush and unlock the door, except I am greeted by more darkness. It stretches out in front of me for infinity. I can never escape. He was right. I'll never leave. I should have stayed put. Maybe I would have lived a little longer. Another hour or day or week. Do I want to live another hour or day or week though? I've been degraded, strung up against a wall naked. He's done horrible, vile things to me. How does a person come back from that? *Can* you come back from that?
I hear his boots on the ground, thundering. My weak legs give way, and I fall to the ground. I can feel the dried blood on my legs, and the fresh blood slowly dripping down from the new wounds he's put on me. What is the point in trying to fight anymore? I'm just a little prey animal and he is the predator. He's hunted me down, and now he's just toying with me. The little shard of glass in my hand scrapes against the concrete as I bring it up to my throat.
I won't be his play thing anymore.
I'm escaping.
