*France, Russia, China. India, and even North Korea. *
*What do all those countries have in common, you ask? Their leaders owe us a favour. Today, we cash in. All hail the Queen. *
Hollande, Putin, Xiaoping, Modi and Jong-Un knelt at my feet. All were quivering. How strange. Then again, they didn't have their little suitcases of death.
"Pledge your loyalty to the Queen or face your country being nuked and uninhabitable for the next millennium. I have gravity missiles hovering over each and every square inch of all your countries. Choose wisely."
Little Kim was the first one to rise.
"No-", he began.
I cut him off.
"Launch the nukes and missiles for Pyongyang. You know that South Korea will blame you for the collateral damage, right? Someone bring Kim a screen so he can watch his little country go down in flames."
Obama rose.
"How can you destroy us without destroying Canada as well? I object."
"I am targeting the southern part of America. Damage should spread to the northern part. If it doesn't, I have others locked onto the middle. Here, watch."
I saw a message flash on the screen: **North Korea destroyed**, it read.
"You mother-", Kim started
I ended him with a.50 to his head.
"Hey Barack, you think South Korea's going to blame you? You're the only country that really hates North Korea."
**USA destroyed**
"You know that-"
*Bang*. Obama down and out.
Putin seemed to be conferring with Hollande, Xiaoping and Modi.
"Gentlemen?"
"You leave us no choice. We pledge our allegiance. ", Putin called out in surrender. I could hear a hint of loss and sadness in his voice.
"Good. Let the celebrations begin."
