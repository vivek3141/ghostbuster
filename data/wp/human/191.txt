"Someone will find out about this..." the scientist gasped as he tried to crawl away, painting the floor with his blood.
John could only smirk as he walked slowly after the old man, a bloodied pen knife in his hand. "Oh, I doubt they will. It has been what...three years? And people are still trying to figure it out."
The scientist somehow managed to reach his desk, and his hand went for the phone.
"Oh no you don't," John said, before plunging the knife into the scientist's hands. He howled in agony.
"Such a pity that your trait is not **Strength**, or else you would have fought me off by now," John teased the man, slumped weakly against his desk. The white carpet beneath him was fast turning red from his blood.
Seeing that the scientist could no longer move, John quickly scoured his office, picking up files that detailed the danger of the approaching asteroid and throwing them in the middle of the room.
"Why?" John heard a weak voice coming from the table. "Why are you doing this?"
John chuckled at the question. Almost all of his victims in the past three years asked him that, as they all laid dying before him. No harm indulging the dying scientist his last question.
"Simple," John said, as he continued to move across the room. "It's fun to watch."
"But people will die!" the scientist croaked. "Everyone has been wondering why our traits have gone on prime for three years now."
"Yeah, I know," John shrugged, throwing more files into the growing pile. He thought of the growing confusion in the public bemusedly, of how everyone is wondering why their traits have gone on prime, signalling an imminent danger, for three years now. "And thanks to me, they will never know why until it's too late."
"You're a monster."
"No, I'm not," Join replied, his eyes staring at the flame before him.
"I just have a very high **Anarchy** trait," John continued, before tossing the lighter towards the files.
