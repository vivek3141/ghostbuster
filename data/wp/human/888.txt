"Life isn't quite fair, is it? For us to end up this way." Said one hobo as he sat down next to a travel worn man with a beard under a bridge.
"It is what you make of the gift you have been given." replied the travel worn man.
"But is it? There is so much injustice, won't you share a drink with me?" as the hobo hands out a bottle of dark liquid.
"There is a time and place for alcohol my son, and this be not it."
"Well, how about hitting this crack pipe then my friend?"
"My son, these substances you use will only confuse you further. They will not illuminate the path you must take to find the light".
"You sure, its *really* good" as the hobo offered out a fat lump of crack and sparked a butane torch.
"Stop trying to give Jesus crack. I know you are the Devil, for I am the Son of God and I know everything. OP is a fag for thinking he could create a WP where I was not omniscient."
"ok cool"
