"Please, just take it easy," I whispered as the mugger held his knife steadily at my wife's throat. His steady hand attested to his criminal experience.
"Transfer your entire bank account funds to mine, NOW!" The mugger yell ed. I ground my teeth, then slowly slid my cell phone out of my pocket.
"No funny business, or you both die. It's no use calling the cops; if you do, I'll kill her and be long gone before they show up."
I nodded slowly, shaking as my brain took in this reality. I could die. My wife could die. I unlocked my cell phone and opened my bank's online app. The seconds ticked by as it verified my password and connected to the server.
"Please, leave us some money," my wife pleaded with the assailant.
"All of it," the crook said forcefully.
I sighed and hit the button to begin a new wire transfer. The only other time I'd used a wire transfer was when my wife and I got married. When your souls and very lives are so intertwined that even death cannot separate you, there's no reason to have two bank accounts. I thought back to the anti-marriage propaganda my siblings had shoved on me when I had announced I was going to marry. There was a pretty big social movement to stop marrying people because 45 percent of all deaths were simply because of spouse death. Successful Wall Street traders would suddenly fall down dead because their spouse had decided that life wasn't worth living. Others dropped dead because the spouse wanted to "get back" at their significant other for some offense. I understood the movement's point of view, but I could never see Susan as someone like that. But now, all their arguments and evidence funneled into my mind as I watched my wife's and my own life on the line.
"Hurry UP!" The thief yelled, jerking Susan a little and putting the knife on her skin.
I took a deep breath, and hit send on my screen.
