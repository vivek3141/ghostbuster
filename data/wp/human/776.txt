"We could have done something Lisa!" I kicked a piece of the rubble small enough to go flying. It was always like this; there was always some random reason for us to run off to a place, only to arrive seconds after a disaster. For the first time, we were there as it happened.
The truck driver swerved to avoid the old lady crossing the street; she got hit anyway.
The truck rammed into the pizza joint, probably killing a few inside as it did. At this point I try to go inside and help, we need to get people out of there if we want to have any chance of saving them.
Lisa slammed the car into reverse and peeled us over to a side street, just as I saw the flames flicker on the side of Ford F-150.
Seconds later, an explosion ripped through the air, and the screaming started. Lisa looked me dead in the eyes and said, "Grab the camera."
It was half an hour after the event, the police had arrived, the building was being checked over for a survivor, maybe two. I couldn't hold myself up, I had spent the past thirty minutes being the first person to report on the story by almost an entire 15 minutes. Get the shots before the police even arrived. It was the kind of shit that won you both ratings and awards, but I could barely stand.
Lisa didn't seem bothered by any of this, she always seemed to know exactly what to do at any given time, she acted surprised when we threw her a surprise party, she knew every answer to game shows, she would sing songs that I'd hear on the radio for the first time two weeks later.
I had put two and two together a long time ago. Lisa was able to see the future in some way. It's why we were always the first on the scene, and why she was always calling the shots on where we went.
"Yeah, we probably could have done something." Lisa shrugged and took a sip of the bottled water we kept in the back of the van, "might have died for it though."
"Could we have stopped it?"
"What?"
"Let's say we keep the old woman from crossing the street, do we stop the accident?"
"Don't ask stupid questions."
"It's a hypothetical."
"We would have needed to arrive six minutes earlier or something," she responded, nonchalantly throwing out the exact figure, she shrugged and took another gulp of the water, "not that we could have known that anyways."
"Yeah, sure."

Lisa walked over to my desk once again; I looked up from the blog that I was typing out and gave her the typical 'what's up' eyebrow raise.
"Can we talk for a few minutes, Jeff?"
"Yeah, no problem, you don't mind getting this feature up a few minutes later than I was gonna?"
"You can work while we talk."
I nodded to her and turned back to my MacBook as she propped herself on the desk beside it, "So, are you doing alright? You've been quiet recently."
"No big deal." I kept typing out the closing comments of the article, nothing flashy, just an overview of what was coming up in the next election.
"Bothered by the accidents that have been happening recently?"
"Nah, we always seem to be around them," I lied through my teeth.
"You're lying."
"Yes."
"Why are you lying to me?"
"I don't want to talk about it."
"But you're going to."
"How would you know?" I began looking over the last few paragraphs for mistakes.
"You know exactly why."
I stopped running over the article and turned my attention to the woman beside me, she didn't seem troubled, she didn't seem like she was confused, it didn't seem to faze her that I was in on her little secret. Of course, it wouldn't, she knew, "You can see the future."
"You confront me about this in a week if I don't bring this up now."
I close the laptop, the story can wait, "So you know what can happen in any situation."
"I know what happens when I take the path that I want to, and what happens if I just let everything run itself."
"So you can change things."
"Yes."
"And you choose to report all these stories, rather than trying to save everyone."
"It's not my job to play God."
"It's your job to be human!"
"I'm a journalist before I'm a hero. I haven't been able to do this forever, and I don't want to test how often I'm right when I try to change things."
"Fuck you." I spat, shoving my laptop into my bag and standing. She moved to stop me, and I push her down, "Consider this my two weeks notice."
"Jeff..." she trailed off.
"Wait, that's why you hired the new guy last week, you knew this would happen."
She nodded. I stormed out.

*I need to talk to you, coffee shop in twenty. *
The text was from a number I didn't have saved in my phone anymore, but I knew it by heart from having to dial it in a panic. It was the reason that I was known as one of the best cameramen in the business. There hadn't been a lack of job offers from news stations, but I was out of the news business now. Documentaries, working with a group of old friends from film school while I tried to find funding for one about people with supernatural abilities.
She walked into the coffee shop two minutes late, wearing a yellow sundress and sunglasses big enough to cover half her face. She had taken to dressing more towards her looks recently. I still saw her online, and on the television. I waved to her, but she was already walking over to the table while looking at her phone.
"You didn't specify a coffee shop," I mentioned as she sat down.
"I don't need to, I know which one you're going to go to, remember?"
"Why are you here, Lisa?" I tried to bring it right to business, but she didn't seem to be having it.
"You look good."
"I've been doing easier work."
"Bags under your eyes are gone."
"Yours are still there."
She smiled at that comment, "At least you still have your sharp tongue."
"Why are we here."
She sighed as if she didn't know that I was going to be a pain about this, "See the woman on the right?"
"Yeah," I say while turning to look at her.
"She spills her coffee in four seconds." Four seconds later she does.
"What are you trying to show me?"
"Want to know what happens if I had helped her?"
"Sure."
"She doesn't go home to change now. Instead she goes home at the end of the day and ends up getting in an accident."
"So?"
"So I helped her there, didn't I?"
"No."
"I can't control every freak accident, so much happens that I don't know what's going to happen half the time. When I change the path everything gets fuzzy for a second, and it's terrifying." She looked down at the table, where the coffee she didn't have would have been, "Sorry, it's just nice to have someone to talk to about it."
"You should help people."
"You should come home with me and we can make this a date."
I paused, there wasn't anything in the conversation that lead to this point that would point to that outcome, but then an idea hit me, "What do I say after you argue with me for ten minutes?"
"Sure."
Even though we didn't spend ten minutes arguing, I decided that she was right.
