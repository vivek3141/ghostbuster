(This actually happened to me)
*what a fucking day*
I eased open the door to the building, wondering how this bleak weather would greet me.
*wind in my face. not surprising*
Clacking my boots on the pavement, I headed towards my car. The last one in the parking lot.
*shit, my tire is losing air again. i wonder where the closest free air pump is*
I started my car and before I put it in reverse, my mind wandered to where I should stop on the way home. Not only for air in my tires, but for groceries too. Nothing sounded appetizing. I shot a quick text to my boyfriend asking what sounded good for dinner. As the text was sending I pulled out of the parking spot and swerved out of the lot.
*at the rate my errands are piling up, i'll never get home. maybe i'll just eat that ice cream that's in the freezer for dinner. *
I decided to get groceries anyway. Being winter, the sun set at 5pm when I got off work, it was barely dusk when I got to the store. I grabbed some beef, chives, onions, tortillas and cheese. Enchiladas.
*yum*
I merged into the bypass that would take me home. My commute was typically only a 20 minute drive on a country backroad I usually take. No stoplights or stop signs. But going to the store took me off that route and into town. Traffic was a nightmare.
*i'll just stay in my lane and take it slow and easy, no need to rush*
It was dark now. I decided to skip the air in my tire. I'd get it tomorrow. Today was shitty anyway, I just wanted to get home. A customer called and asked where their order was, I had forgotten to place it the day before and got in deep shit with their sales rep. Basically a day from hell.
*alright, passing sunshine street and i'll be home in 25 if there's no traffic jams. *
The long road I was on was dimly lit by street lamps. It curved back and forth over and over. No discernible landmarks or streets. A straight shot til my next turn. The bypass is on the west part of town, so it's next to a bunch of farmland. It was an easy drive. Not difficult to let your mind wander. I turned on the radio and let the road take me home.
*good god i am hungry. *
I texted my boyfriend to let him know to preheat the oven and I was on my way.
*nice, sunshine street. i should be home in no time*
Wait.
I already passed sunshine. I was way passed sunshine. If I hadn't clearly seen the sign on the stoplight as I passed it that said Sunshine street, I wouldn't be concerned.
*what the fuck is happening*
The road started to bend. Just like it did after passing sunshine. That familiar back and forth suddenly sent an eerie chill through my body.
*this isn't right*
It was already past dark. The faint streetlights seemed to mock me as I sat up in my carseat and leaned forward, pressing on the gas just a bit more.
*maybe i'm just confused. i hardly ever take this way home, i'm just not familiar with the route*
I looked around. In my rearview there was one car in the distance following me. "Sunshine Street" had disappeared. Around each bend the car got further behind me until I couldn't see him anymore.
*alone*
I felt a deep sense of dread. Of loneliness. Isolation. It was cold outside. Cold and dark. The road never seemed to stop.
I looked at the clock. 5:57pm. Time had gone too quickly, I should have been home by now. I hadn't gotten a text from my boyfriend yet.
*what is going on? *
The stress of the day crescendo'd into a panic, and then diminished as I saw a stoplight far ahead.
*finally*
Whatever anxiety I had about the situation broke, and I could feel my heart thumping in my ears as I pulled up to my turn. There were other cars at the stoplight. I waited...It felt like a loose string needed to be tied in my brain.
*what the hell was that? *
I turned left.
