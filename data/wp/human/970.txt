William was tired. Fed to the back teeth he was. Adventuring, killin' bads. Rescuing damsels in distress - It was all really beginning to get him down. But he knew it was not in his hands. He knew that all this in the control of the storyteller. And he was tired of it. O-oh he was *tired*. So all things considered - his next steps would be quite easy. It was a simple twist in his mind - and he was able to see four dimensions. Not *see* them as they are - but have them materialise as a set of analogies. Four dimensions squeezing into three dimensional perception. He stepped.... fourthways. The place where the narrator works made itself into a metaphor reflecting his opinion of the place. A large dark cavern with tall black pillars was his new position. In front of him was a large lake filled with a more-liquid-than-gas ethereal mist. A giant stairway rose up out over the lake. He approached. Climbing the stairwell - and not really noticing the fact that he crossed a vast distance between the lake and the place he came from in very little time, he climbed it. Anger and weariness are an odd match - but surprisingly, on William they seemed like strawberries and cream, apple and danish blue, chedder and crackers.

Sir William saw that which was concealed by the noble scriptor up 'till Williams hideous deed – a pulpit of stone and ivory. Upon which there laid a Book – open wide to watch the approach of Sir William. Sir Willim picked up the Pen. **
William went out into the world and built himself a house in which to live. The house was made out of...wattle and daub...it had nine bean rows.. a hive for the honey bee...aaand...he lived happily ever after there.
**Sir William looked up. Nothing had changed. Foolish man. His face was filled with disappointment in the book - which he threw off the pedestal into the sea of mist. Forth from the gloom of the edges of the cavern came a cloaked spokesman - a representative of the narrators. **
**" Surely you should know by now - we do not govern your decisions...it is YOU who chooses which way to go in life. We do not control your plot, YOU do. It has been in your control all along. The idea of a higher control was simply an excuse you built in your mind for your actions. We are not the storymakers. We are the scriptors. "**
**Sir William, alas, could not accept this. He raised his mighty blade again and struck the hooded head from the spokesman shoulders. He ran along the edge of the ethereal lake until he found another stairwell, which he climbed. Atop the stairs he found another scriptor. Lifting his sword for the third time he. **

*William scriptor Interemti. Et scripsit in libro. *

I shall arise now...I shall leave this place.. I shall build a small home of clay and wattle made.... Nine bean rows shall I have there...a hive...for the honey bee...and live alone in the bee loud glade....
*Sed non ita est. Lacrimit William*

I must admit that I feel guilty for what I did to William. It was the only way I could make him understand - the reality of the situation is too confusing.
Oh, and William arose from the pedestal and went to the lake isle of Inishfree. He had a grand time there.
