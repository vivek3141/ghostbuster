I had poached eggs, the day the world ended.
Now all I have is a blanket and vine-wrapped broken highway in front of me that seems to go on forever.
(the highway, not the blanket.)
But it started with poached eggs and a figure in a lab coat. It walked into my kitchen, stopped right by Amy's side,
looking right at me.
"Thank you for your time, Mr. Taylor."
I dropped the fork on the table. Amy was frowning too, and so was Zara (that's our daughter).
"What? Who are you? What is –"
"Please bear in mind that it might take a while, but everything will make sense once the haze of The Box goes away. Thank you very much."
And I'll never forget the poached eggs. I'll never forget because that's when I got up and dropped them and the
plate crashed, and my eyes stopped on Zara's, and she was so scared. It was one second--one second when time stood still, even the crashing sound seemed to linger--and before I could say or do anything, the world went black.
& nbsp;
And then I opened my eyes to the broken world. And no memories. I know nothing of what happened to Amy or Zara. No idea how I got here.
It went from the crashing and the eggs and Zara to silence, and then an open blue sky. Chirping. Leaves rattling and a cold wind, my back against the dirt. I raised my head and looked around.
Trees. An open field. And the distant silhouette of a skeleton city.
I don't know what happened to the world.
You know what I *do* know, though? I know I've been wandering around for three months, and I've yet to see
another human face. I know I've killed a coyote with my bare hands last week, right next to a rotten building that used to be the Griffith Observatory. I know I went past Hollywood Boulevard a couple of days ago, and the Chinese Theater is now a wolf lair, so don't go there.
From that plate crashing spilling poached eggs to the blue, cloudless sky and my back against the dirt, I went from a married man with an apartment in Santa Monica to a cave man.
To the last man in the world.
I have no idea what's going on. But I'm finding Amy. I'm finding Zara.
The day after I woke up I found something in my pocket. It was a piece of paper, old like over thirty years. A page
from a notebook, yellow and flaky. Written in child handwriting was a smiley face and the words 'I'm Tracy.'
I had no memory of this at all.
Then in another handwriting, 'What do you think they're going to do to us?'
And in the first one, 'I don't know. What's *The Box*?'
And then, 'I'm scared.'
I have no idea what's going on. But I'm gonna find out.
The sky is getting darker. I should find a place to sleep. And then tomorrow…
Tomorrow is the day I'll find Amy and Zara.
I have to keep telling myself that. It's what keeps me going. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow.
Thunder. Look like it's raining tonight.
Tomorrow.
