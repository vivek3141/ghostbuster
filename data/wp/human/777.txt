EDIT: I just realized No Mans Sky is an existing universe type deal and NOT the name given to the invasion for media purposes. With that in mind...
My codename is Red. I belong to a secret organization that employs soldiers like me to combat the dominant forces we uncover in alternate dimensions. Remotely, we operate trans-dimensional matter responders that eliminate the threats in our way of taking control. The metallic overcast that shades our planet now is a direct response from our latest efforts to rid the space invaders of dimension N1978. When they arrived 5 years ago, they pleaded for the slaughter in their dimension to stop. Earth eventually realized our precious gaming systems had been hijacked by my organization to harness the worlds collective gaming power to our advantage in dimensional domination. As a result, an agreement to a worldwide ban on gaming was reached and for a moment...There was a cease fire.
That's when I, and my fellow soldiers, were called up to activate. These past 5 years, me and my boys have completely eradicated any dominant lifeforms in dimension N1978. All that remains are the lifeforms contained with the ships over our heads, and their next.
