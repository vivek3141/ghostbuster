"Can you hook me up?"
I looked at the kid in front of me, he was, with a liberal guess, fifteen. But he was obviously resourceful, he managed to find me in this haunted city.
"Well, it depends on what you want." I said.
"I want a *discern. *"
*Discern*. Ah. That was an expensive item, because of the nature of it. You could rifle through anyone's head. It was also an extremely uncommon find. What did a fifteen year old want a discern for?
"Why?"
"It's getting you money, you don't really need to know." He gripped his armrests and seemed extremely angry at the question.
"Hey, buddy. How about you cool your tone and answer the question." I said. Stupid children. They always underestimate while simultaneously overestimate the raw power of commands.
"Well, there's a girl, and I don't know if she likes me or not." He said, with a straight face.
I laughed. Hard. I laughed so hard tears streamed down my face. I finally retained my composure and I looked up at the kid. He looked very unsettled.
"What are you willing to give me for it?" I asked, at last.
"Well, my grandpa said he's willing to give up his, but you have to give him *overpower* too." The boy replied.
"What is his word?" I said, wondering what could be so esoteric that his grandfather thought he could get two of such powerful commands.
"Enchant."
"Deal, bring him here and I'll do it." I said, greedily. Enchant was a big deal, especially for a salesman like myself. I've only seen three in the wild, and no one was willing to sell. This must be a special case.
"Hey, son." I said, before right before he walked out the door.
"Yeah?" He asked, turning around.
"Why does your grandfather want the *overpower*, instead of *enchant*?"
"He has cancer. He's hoping to *overpower* it." He said, and he left.
I sat down and poured a drink. Today was a good day. Saving a life, getting *enchant*, only losing one of my two overpowers, and a discern.
I loved being born with *transfer. *
