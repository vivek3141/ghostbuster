"Fuck!!!!!"
"Damnit Zolfak, what is it now?"
"I found another one!!!!"
"Are you seriously watching the terran films again? I thought I told you to lay off that shit when we are working."
"I just wanted to get a couple in. We were in hyperspace for the past few seconds so I just thought a one or two wouldn't hurt..."
"We are here to stop GL-567 from going supernova. We did not come all the way out to the middle of nowhere to watch the terran films. That's what our Quad-Pod 4000 viewing stations at home are for."
"Yeah yeah, I know. But, Grimlo, dude, just check out how bad this one is. You know you love the movies too...."
"No"
"Grimlo......"
"No..."
Grimmmmllooooo"
"Fine!"
"Okay, so, you know the one that's been on the Array waiting list for the past 40 delquads?"
"Yeah, a Toy Story or something, right?"
"Yes, that's the one. I have a memory copy of it right here...."
"Zolfak!!!! What the hell are you thinking? Do you know what could happen if you get caught with Toy Story on your neurochip?"
"I just couldn't wait. I had to see it...."
"Okay, well, just project it from you brooktalk - and speed it up to 5 delmomicrons. I'm not touching that shit with a 6 perawat polstak."
"Fine fine sissy pants - I'll explain while you watch. So, you know how the premise showed that the humans don't know the toys are real?"
"Yeah...."
"And that they play dead whenever the humans are around?"
"Yeah......."
"Well, see here - the character Buzz Lightyear walks in and doesn't realize he's a toy. It takes him forever to realize that he isn't a real spaceman, and is, in fact, a toy like the rest of them."
"So what are you getting at?"
"DON'T YOU REMEMBER???!!!! At the beginning of the movie when Andy walks in, Buzz Lightyear fakes dead like the rest of the toys!!!! If he thought he was a real spaceman, he wouldn't have faked dead!!!!"
"My god....."
"SEEEEEEEEEEEE, I TOLD YOU!"
"The Broikarks are going to flip a shit when they see this...."
* (GL-567 explodes) *
"Goddamnit, Zolfak...."
"Shit, my b."
