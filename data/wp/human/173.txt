So what's going on here, Bob?
**Well, Dave, the aliens have rounded us all up and paired us off. **
What for?
**According to this brochure, they need human babies to breathe. So we can't leave until one of us gets pregnant. **
Oh.
**Yeah. Looks like we're gonna be here awhile. **
Shit. Did you bring anything to read?
**Just the breeding brochure. **
What's it say?
**" Start fucking. We need babies to live. **
Anything else?
**Well, under that it says "We need babies to live, so if you don't give us one you can't leave. But we --" **
Wait! Do they know about the difference between the sexes?
**Well they flew here, enslaved our planet, rounded us all up, and gave us a brochure in English. That's more than President Trump ever did for our great-grandparents. **
Not really. Everyone got perms instead of health care. He said it was, and I quote, "cheaper."
**And smellier. **
True. Why do we still get perms?
**We've got plenty of time to discuss this while we're busy not having a baby. Maybe we can save that hot topic for later. **
*200 YEARS LATER*
Hey, did we ever talk about perms?
**Hurry up and get pregnant. **
Why don't you try for once?
**I'm shy. And you're impotent. **
How would you know?
**Remember New Years Eve about 80 years ago? I had those wine coolers? **
Well, how many people have you knocked up over the past 200 years?
**I don't know. **
Well, I can take a guess. Why do they keep injecting us with drugs that have us living this long?
**The wi-fi is out, and they say that we're the only ones left here. **
We are?
**Yeah, we were the last two people without female partners. The two odd men out. **
Wait, so they KNOW we can't make a baby?
**Oh, they don't need anymore. Turns out they don't need THAT many babies to live. Just like, you know, five. **
Five?
**Damndest thing, really. **
When did you find all of this out?
**That was the rest of the brochure. "But we're cool, because a baby is born every seven seconds and we'll have you back home in a minute. Just promise us all you'll make more babies just in case. In return, here's a coupon for complimentary appetizers at Red Robin, and we're gonna keep the two leftover guys here because you don't have enough babies to fix our wi-fi and it would really be sick if we asked for THAT many. Besides, we're easily amused. "**
Shit.
**Yeah, you should have let me finished. It continues, "But if those two guys really don't wanna stick around, they have five minutes to leave. If not we will assume that they didn't read the whole brochure and totally get what's coming to them. "**
Double shit. I really should have let you finish reading that brochure.
**Yeah. **
