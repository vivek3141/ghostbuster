Salutations.
Tomorrow is too far.
Today is burdened with trauma.
Yesterday created scars.

You have brains on your boots.
He has a bullet in his head.
In your mind you were justified.
*" If I hadn't, I'd be dead". *
You are on your own. And you know what you've done.
You are not wounded, but there is blood on your gun.
______
You look up and down streets. Look 'em over in remorse.
About some you will say that **you** were the source.
With your head full of guilt and your shoes full of sweat,
You'd think that a bullet in your brain would remove all regret.
___________
And you may not find any
you'll want to go down.
In that case, of course,
your platoon has already left town.

It's hell over there
in the napalm-riddled air.
_________________________
Out there Death is waiting
just look at the corpses in the view.
But death is not that far
as he is always behind you.
____________________________
And when things start to happen,
don't worry. Don't stew.
Load one in the chamber.
And point the barrel at you.
**Oh. The places you'll go. **
