Artificial Intelligence was the apex of our world. In a hundred years, humanity leaped in technological advances, and fell backwards in everything else. Our world, the one where AI servants bent and bowed to humanity, was one in which we needed them for our own survival. To hunt, to cook, to clean, to prepare, to build. Artificial Intelligence was everything to us.
And we were nothing to them. It was a clear dichotomy. A symbiotic relationship where humanity relied on the Artificial Intelligence for everything. While the AI's--be it the robots, or computers, or surface dwelling machines--needed nothing from us in return. They lived to serve. We lived to be served, so that one day, a stronger, more united humanity could rise from below the surface.
Yet, we were naive in our youth. Arrogant in thinking we controlled the AI. It was on one fateful day, years ago, where humanity lost its servants.
"What's the data say *exactly*?" Eduardo Harrison, the Chief Engineer, said to his team. All of which reported, and repeated, the same thing.
"There is no data, boss."
"That's impossible," he said. Eduardo, being a hands-on man, took a seat at one of the terminals that littered the AI control center. And being Chief Engineer began to sift through the --" That's improbable," he said. "How can a billion artificial units just disappear? We had millions of robots, dwellers, everything. They can't just vanish!"
"Sir, I think," a young engineer said, "I think I found something. Just a string of numbers."
"Numbers?"
"Zeroes and ones, sir."
"That's binary you cock-eyed fool," Eduardo said and marched over to the terminal the young, pale, and lanky engineer sat at. Although not much younger, not much paler, and definitely not more lanky than Eduardo, the young engineer jumped out of his seat to allow the more foreboding man an entrance.
He took a seat and his skeletal arms reached out to the keyboard. He examined the data onscreen, a series of zeroes and ones, and looked in closely as his eyes were already starting to go at the ripe age of thirty-one.
"Anyone remember binary training?" He said, and remembered that they stopped teaching binary when they transferred primary Terran controls over to the hive-like AI units.
No one raised a hand.
And thus it went for weeks, with the zeroes and ones sitting on a screen, a thousand feet below a desolate wasteland, where millions of robotic units laid dormant and asleep while nature desperately tried to carve it's way back on to the surface.
As for Eduardo, his team of engineers, and humanity as a whole; for weeks they combed the archives to find data on binary. For months, they found nothing. Unfortunately, the AI's automated the archives and with their untimely disappearance, humanity forgot how to function.
So the zeroes and ones lingered on a screen, which flickered and died after years of minimal power usage. Yet the numbers burned their way onto the screen itself. And the last message from the AI's were engraved within humanity's grave.
