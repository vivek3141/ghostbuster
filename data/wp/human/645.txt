"Son, come look at this sector with me."
John walked over to his father's desk. The desk was a massive tablet and it could zoom in and out of various galaxies.
"Look here. This is the Milky Way Galaxy. Ok, nothing special right. Well, I'm going to show you something cool, but a little weird."
John enjoyed when his father taught him about distant galaxies. But sometimes his dad was a little crazy.
"Ok, so here, right by the tail."
John's father double tapped the desk and the screen zoomed in on a system.
"This is the Sol System. They have a middle aged star with nine planets. The third one from the Sun harbors life. The people there are tiny and millions of years from possessing any sort of intellect. So, what's the point, dad, you may ask? Well son, these little guys have many religions. They like to fight over there beliefs and histories, but they don't realize they all follow the same religion. You see this number, it says 4:13 PM Eastern Time Zone. And over there it says 21:13 GMT. That is what they call time. They live their entire lives by these numbers. They tick and tock until they can't breathe anymore. Hahaha, its such a pity, because they really don't understand how meaning less "time" is. For instance, in our world, Tiy-sa, we organize our days around certain emotional needs. Everyday we need to satisfy our physical, sexual, spiritual and happiness needs before we call it a day. A strange species those humans. Tick-tock indeed."
