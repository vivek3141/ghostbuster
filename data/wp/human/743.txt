"Mr. President," The suited secret service agent opened a door and gestured for me to enter.
The room was simple: white paneling, dark blue carpet, almost entirely empty - save for a chair, a desk, and a book.
I walked over to examine the tome. It was bound in a thick, dark leather. on the cover was painted a strange version of the American flag with only a dozen or so stars arranged in an offset grid.
I looked back at the agent, who had since closed the door and assumed an at ease stance to the left of me.
"Robins, what is this?"
"Mr. President, that is the eternal wisdom of every president that has sat before you."
My eyes widened. "Every President?"
The agent nodded. "Yes, sir. From George Washington to Barack Obama. With a few...exceptions."
I took his meaning and the thought that some presidents never had the chance to write their thoughts and wisdom made the existence of the book more somber, more significant. I felt the cover of the book and was surprised at how supple and smooth the leather was. If Agent Robins was telling the whole truth, this book was well over two hundred years old. And that flag - was that really the first flag of the United States? These United States?
I looked back at Robins. "And I'm to read this?"
"That is the expectation, Mr. President."
"And I'll write in this book, too?"
"Yes, sir. At the end of your term, to provide advice for every president to come."
I marveled at the foresight the person who started this tradition had. I sat down and pulled open the cover.
"Mr. President, the gloves."
I looked around the desk and saw a pair of white cotton gloves. Of course. I donned the gloves and started to turn pages.
The first few were written in small, flowing script. Tucked in between pages were what looked like printed transcriptions of the text. That was some foresight too. I wondered how many presidents had to sit at the desk deciphering 18th century handwriting before someone finally typed it up.
After checking a few sheets, it seemed like those pages were preambles and guidelines for the few people who would ever write in the book. I made a mental note to return to those later - my curiosity had to be sated.
I kept turning pages one by one until I finally saw a large headline with a neat block of text on the center of the page. Beneath that, another helpful typed version.
GEORGE WASHINGTON 1789-1797
> To hold the office of the President of these United Colonies is to be the leader of a truly free people. It should never be lost upon the bearer of this office that he too was one of the people he sought to lead. To this end he must be morally good, he must be able to condescend well to his people, he must be firm in his convictions, and he must always search for the course of action that will provide for the betterment of our Union. Long may we stand, and long may we be United.
I sat there, staring at that passage. I couldn't believe I was reading George Washington's own handwriting. After a second I realized something felt off. I re-read the passage. "'Condescend well?"
I was perplexed that our nation's first and finest leader would say something like that.
"Ah, During George Washington's time, it meant something different. More along the lines of being able to speak well from a place of authority. It's a common stumbling point for most of the previous presidents, Sir."
I nodded, thankful I hadn't missed a course on Washington's Life and Times, or something like that. And the way Robins said it, it certainly seemed more in line with what the first leader of the Free World would have said to future president.
Satisfied, I continued to read.
JOHN ADAMS 1797-1801
> You have assumed a most powerful seat in this nation. Expect that with the power of decision comes the storm of criticisms and uncertainty those decision entail. You must then be a finely built ship with a first-rate captain. Sail true through the storm, weather the criticisms of others, and do what you believe is right for this Country, this Land, and this People. May we have a long and prosperous Union.
THOMAS JEFFERSON 1801-1809
> A man need first and foremost be a scholarly gentleman. A fundamental understanding of all thing natural and philosophical is needed to sit in the Office of the President. A president will encounter many things in his tenure. Many decisions, many legislation, and many people vying for his attentions and approval. These will cover the span of all topics and all interests, and should he want to do right by his people, a President need understand the basis of the decisions he will make. Our Republic will be strengthened by the enlightened knowledge or weakened by the blightful ignorance of those who lead it. May the Republic stand now and forever in the light of progress.
I was amazed at each one I read. And then I remembered what Robins said about the 'exceptions'. I turned each page, passing more than sixty years of history to a page headed
ABRAHAM LINCOLN 1861-1865
Blank.
All that lay on that page was a simple white banded black band. I could feel something well within me. My eyes started to water and I could feel a slight gripping in my chest.
I had never reacted so much to Lincoln assassination. But there, reading the words of our forefathers, reading the words of the simple people who made it through their terms as president, I felt a connection to each and every man in that book.
And maybe there was a bit of fear mixed in with that. Sadness at the thought of my page also being left blank, with just a white-banded ribbon to pass on. Sadness at the thought of not being able to leave anything behind.
I looked up at agent Robins and cleared my eyes.
"How long have you been doing this?" I asked
"This, sir? With the book?"
I nodded.
"20 years now. I've shown it to President Bush and President Obama, sir."
"Did they get this way too, when they got to Lincoln that is?"
Robins thought silently for a few moments. "President Bush got misty eyed, like you, sir." Robins hesitated for a few moments, something nearing emotion showing on his blank face. "President Obama cried, sir. He just cried, and he couldn't stop.
