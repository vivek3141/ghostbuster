It's easy to get lost in himself today as on this particular day, this round of golf was the greatest played game of his life.
He was enveloped in the smell of the grass, the cool breeze, and reveled under the shade of the tree he shared his first kiss with her.
He most deeply desired the sound of the ball clanking around and settling at the bottom of the cup on the final hole of the morning for his personal best round, reminding him of playing every morning with his late wife.
Almost fittingly, with one unfortunate, minute mistake, the ball sailed wide left hooking wildly into the trees reminding him of the bitterness of the game we call life, and the empty bed that awaited him when he arrived home that evening.
