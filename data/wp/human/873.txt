The burning tails of smoke pierced the sky, and I thought: This is it. Well, never a better chance. I rose up, unbuckling my seatbelt, and stood in the back. I quickly slid back the sun window.

My step-mother, father, and step-sister all looked at me with shock as I smiled and bowed. The large bomb was heading right into the road ahead of us.
"EXCELSIOR!" I screamed, while my family simply shrieked in unison.

My father turned, and smiled menacingly.
"What was that about Hell, boy?"
