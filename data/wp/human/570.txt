"So...let me be clear." Obama said for perhaps the last time as President.
"I congratulate President-Elect Sanders on his..." Obama paused as a crackle of lightning appeared in the air. The audience murmured as more crackles began to form. All at once, a blinding flash of light followed by a WHUMPH sound revealed a floating DeLorean. Someone had stolen the top secret Time Machine from Area 51!
President-Elect Sanders gaped in horror as the driver's door popped open on the DeLorean and he saw...himself.
The Sanders from the Delorean jumped out and ran to the podium.
"Listen to me, all of you!" Don't institute ANY of my ideas or policies! Socialism DOES NOT WORK! It didn't work before, and it won't work in the future!"
The Sanders at the podium ran overt to President-Elect Sanders, pulled out a black pistol and shot the President-Elect twice in the chest. A Secret Service agent instinctively shot the time traveler.
"Mission Accomplished!" The Time Traveling Sanders said as he died.
Back at the MSNBC studios, they cut away from the horrific scene to cover some really important breaking news. Justin Bieber had gotten a speeding ticket.
