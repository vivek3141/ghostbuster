Oddly enough twas a girl that I met
Who disproved of my forward advances
With a singular text, I discerned what she meant
By a pair of stern-eyed stolen glances.
________
Met with fright, and full of delight,
*I cannot believe that I wasn't right*
I called her phone, she said she was home
I biked my way over, *hope nobody's home*
_______
She came to the door with a knock of my knuckles
In socks, nothing else, making my boy knees buckle
"I assume," she began, "you received my alert"
"Yes but how is this real? You look on me as dirt!"
______
Now, I don't wish to earn my ladies scorn

When a girl entices you to chase
Don't be fooled by her Resting Bitch Face
