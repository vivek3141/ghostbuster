Life feeds life. All living things feast on the lives of others. It is the way of the universe. It is possible to cultivate life, to let it grow, become a larger food source, which many do. So as they expanded and grew, they, too created life. It is also true that created life sometimes acknowledges this, and perceives their creation as divine. They devote their lives to appease this creator, but its their death which does so.
With each death, the creator is fed. It's all about how one cultivates the life. If unchecked, or done incorrectly, the food can rot, or even attempt to attack its creator. Some food even becomes parasitic, but it all turns out okay in the end.
This life will grow, and as it reaches the point of becoming too big to contain, then, and only then, will the growth be cut completely, and the creator can have a feast worthy to be called 'Divine. '
