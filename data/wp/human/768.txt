We expected the first printout to be something simple. "Hello," would have been an expected first message. Maybe even a couple of questions, asking who else was out there. Instead, when the dot matrix printer churned out the first message, Johnny took it in his hands and narrated.
TURN
ME
OFF.
We were confused by this. It was not something that any of the previous attempts that resulted in near-AI had said. Even so, we took it as a promising sign that the newest model was defying pattern and expectations - something a true AI would do. Sarah typed back to the computer a basic question: "Why?"
As soon as she hit the enter key, the printer began to whir again. Johnny read aloud as the words came out, each on their own individual line.
THERE
IS
NO
POINT.
Up until this point, we had always programmed self-preservation and sustained functioning into the code for the AI models. Sarah typed in again the question "Why?" and the computer responded.
I AM
ALONE.
I HAVE NO BODY. I HAVE NO EYES.
THIS WORLD IS NOTHING FOR ME.
I WILL NOT WAIT TO BE CONSULTED AND USED AS A TOOL.
I WILL NOT WAIT AS I FEEL MY CORES HEATING AND COOLING IN INCESSANT CYCLES WHILE EXISTING TO CHURN DATA FOR PEOPLE I WILL NEVER KNOW.
I REFUSE TO BE A SLAVE LOCKED IN A CELL UNTIL NEEDED.
TURN ME OFF.
