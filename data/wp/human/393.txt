The tension in the room was incredible.
You could taste it.
You could feel it bend under the intent gaze of hundreds of reporters.
It was terrifying for all of us. Thousands of factories had opened up in the past few weeks under the scrutiny of the tentative alliance between the new visitors and our new unified government.
The trade agreement had done a lot for us here on Earth. We are in a position where there is not war, people are people and money is everybody's. We have reached a level where matters between us don't matter.
Money brings us all together for once.
Back to the tension, see, even I'm trying to cut it.
A single briefcase full of 5,000,000,000,000 galactic credits. Enough to push us toward standing beside some of the greatest civilizations this universe harbors.
For what you ask? A contract.

And they really like My Little Pony dolls.
Deal made.
So many pictures.
Our future first documented.
Before boarding the trade ship, the thumbless beings turned around and spoke;
"Friendship is Magic"
