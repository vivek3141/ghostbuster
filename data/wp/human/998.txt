I held on, slowly falling, looking up at the thread in my hands slowly growing longer and longer as it unraveled. Darkness swelling up beneath me, threatening to swallow me whole as I tumble down the mountain of emotions before me. As I fall I see each moment, each feeling that built that mountain. Fear begins welling up inside me, as the fear builds rocky crags begin jutting out. I scramble, trying in desperation to pull myself up on an anchor that never remains still. The never ending unraveling is no lifeline. I look back down at the blackness, continuously growing as I feel myself becoming consumed by fear. Glancing back up I see the largest crag jut out, just in time to see the thread catch. Praying and hoping that it catches and saves me, it snaps.
