"What the fuck?" I said to myself as I held the bag. "This can't be what I think it is." I proceed to walk towards my apartment as if it was just another day.
I close the door behind me and check the peep hole to make sure I wasn't followed. "No time to waste." As I was walking towards the kitchen to get a bottled water, all I can think about is how awesome it is going to be. I've heard countless stories about these super pills. It was exclusively sold only to people with a lot of money. Lots. With one pill in my hand and the water bottle in the other, I take one breath and popped it in my mouth and downed the whole bottle.
"This feeling" I said as the euphoria of peace and tranquility along with a sensation of my brain being filled with skills and gifts that can only come from within. "This must be what it feels like to have money."
I look at the mirror in my living room and say one of my favorite lines of one of my favorite movies while waving my finger in the air. "And here. We. Go" With that being said, I get my bus pass and head out the door of my apartment.
"Oh yeah, this is going to be fun"
It was a great time to begin my new adventure. Ideas were bouncing around in my brain. Left and right. Up and down. "Ah yes, basic stuff" I said under my breath. Walking towards the bus stop with a pep in my step, I knew deep down in my heart that this is going to be the last time that I ever have to deal with this shit.
