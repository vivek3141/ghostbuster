Vibrations! Vibrations and light. That was the key！ I mean it all goes back to Einstein right? e=mc squared。
And when you think about it, everything really is just a different form of vibration: energy waves, an objects wave function in space-time, the vibration of atoms and their vibrating strings.
Once I understood that it was all about getting the right vibration of sound and light. Then the mirrors would liquefy and form an Einstein-Rosen bridge of sorts, literally a gateway to another universe.
But suppose I didn't really think things through though.... I mean I was baffled when it worked, and even more baffled to learn that each mirror leads to its own separate universe!
And of course everything that happens here happens in unison there, so you can't really just expect to walk on in, there is another you in the way, mimicking your movements, thoughts, speech patterns etc, all in exact unison. Even shaking hands is impossible.
And don't even get me started on the dullness of the conversations!
"Oh Hey there! I'm from earth, wait, you are too. Oh, were saying the same exact thing at the same exact time aren't we? Wait...what am I thinking now? Last night's movie! His acting wasn't that good was it? Wow...we are literally speaking the same exact words at the same time, it is like we share a brain..... no.... its like we are the same person...wow this kinda sucks..."
So my dream of entering in was quickly abandoned. As was my dream of having a good conversation with an opponent as studied as myself. But hey! At least we can still send objects through!
In fact, I am actually eating toast from another universe!...... but.... it tastes and looks exactly like the toast I sent through...so maybe it isn't really all that interesting.... Or even all that useful...
Maybe I won't be getting that Nobel Peace Prize after all...
