Mr. Robert E. Haynes was anything but a stereotypical 10th grade history teacher. He knew his material, didn't coach any sports, and he sure as hell never ended up behind the wheel of a school bus.
One day I was walking through the flea market in a small town in Alabama when a peculiar painting caught my eye. Mr. Haynes was depicted standing in full Confederate uniform with a saber by his side.
Then it hit me. Mr. Haynes was Robert E. Lee. Now I know what you're thinking, there's no way. But all the little details started to make sense. He spent almost 3 entire months on the Great War of Northern Aggression. He talked about the war like he was there and lost friends on the battlefield.
Over time I lost interest in my discovery, and I moved on to failing bigger and better classes than history.
But I'll never forget my 10th grade Confederate General.
