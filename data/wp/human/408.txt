"Brigands and cutpurses have nothing on me. They're petty, cheap thugs who burgle for petty, cheap coin. Wine and women must come easily to such people."
The stranger looks unimpressed. I continue my spiel.
"I'm more refined. Better than a common thief. Smarter than the lot of them put together, too."
Her distaste shows on her lips, as they curl up in disgust. She speaks for the second time. "And I'm sure you spend your hard earned coin on nothing but the noblest of pursuits, too. Nothing but charities and your future, I'm certain."
Her words hardly leave a mark in my indignant reply. "What, then, did you want from our town? You requested a companion for some brute force crusade type deal, and you're surprised the clientele is all of the lowborn variety? Get a grip, paladin."
Her hand shifts to the hilt of her scabbard, running gloved fingers over the symbol inscribed there. She lifts her eyes to the heavens.
"Bloody divines never gave us nothing. And here you are, shiny armor and shiny sword, trying to muster us up? For what, then? Why do you even need one of us fine gentlemen?"
She declined to respond, her view of the overcast sky must have given her all the direction she needed. Without another word, she spun on her heels, the soft clangs of her armor trailing behind her as she smartly walked away.
I turn back to my compatriots, who had been listening intently to our exchange. "We'll rob her tonight."
