You know, a lot of people were really nervous about the zombie apocalypse. But very few people saw the economic *opportunity* that it generated! I mean, look at Las Vegas now! The streets are still filled with stumbling people and beings bumping into one another and ignoring everything around them until night comes and the lights call them in for miles. It's absolutely *fascinating* to watch so many Z's appear from the deserts like swarms of larks in the sky. And why not make money doing it?
The helicopters we've been using have been specially fitted with mutliple silenced blades to hush their approach. The guards we've got are all veterans of the North African Campaigns or the Hawain Offensive, they know what to look for and how to keep dumb tourists alive. This isn't some amatuer hour here, we aren't Jurrasic Park, we're real world professionals! Giving generations of the survivors a place to go to see what Pre-War America looked like and to study how the Z's behave. This is *fantastic*.
Just remember! We do still have rules!
1. Do not tap on the glass. It's reinforced with various alloys, so it won't break, but when the Z's swarm it ruins the view.
2. Shooting is *only* allowed from decks 30 and 60 from The Mirage hotel.
3. Please refrain from flash photography at all levels 20 and lower, it will disturb the corpses and cause more swarming than usual. Remember, don't ruin the views!
4. In the event of catastrauphic safety failures, all visitors are reminded that levels 21 and up in all structures are equipped with safe-rooms capable to sustaining a family of 4 for 4 days. Remember! Be safe, be 4-warned!
