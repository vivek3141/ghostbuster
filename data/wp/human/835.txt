As Mark stumbled his way to the men's room, I made my move. I faked right. Retrieving my wallet, I pulled it out for it's attention. A bartender always notices when someone is ready to pay...He begins circling his wet towel around my area.
"Can I get you another?" the bartender asks.
"Yeah, sure. Another round for the both of us," I respond while reaching in my left pocket.
I make a move with my wallet again, flipping it open while I drop a perfect *dunk* in Mark's half full glass with the left. "Here you go, close it out, would ya?"
"Sure thing, boss," the bartender smiles big.
Mark returns to find another full drink waiting for his help with disposal. I encourage him to quickly finish the one remaining before it becomes warm. We leave the bar with his final drink still half full. I don't mind.
Back in my Lincoln Navigator, the drug takes effect on Mark and his face rests nearly in his lap if it weren't for the seat belt.
I arrive back to my house and head down to my basement. I turn on the fluorescent's and prep the table. I return to the car, throw Mark's arm around my shoulder and drag him in. I throw the slab on the table. Wasting no time, I begin my incision.
"...Hmm. Look's like you already had one of your kidney's removed, eh Mark?" I rhetorically ask. I remind myself to ask more relevant questions to my future target's about their past medical history.
"Wait...Mark! Where the hell is your other one!?" Once again asking a question that cannot be answered by Mark or logic in that instance. I reach for his pants on the tiled floor. I pull out his wallet and find his ID card.
"*Mark Michaels...09/24/83...423 W. Rio Bravo Dr...*" I scroll down the card.
The organ donor sticker is not there!
"Well Mark, you are literally just a little more than an asshole."
