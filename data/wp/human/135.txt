At night, when everything is dark and silent,
The men will stalk their prey within the woods.
With weapons drawn and tempest minds yet violent
They wait and hide in cloaks and capes and hoods.

For with each shadowed step the monster takes
The men will spring to action in defense.
They slash and fight until the ground but quakes;
They shed their blood, protect the innocents.

And when the sunlight rises o're the trees,
The men will wash and then return to home.
Their children play wherever they do please
But in the darkness, something new will roam.
