As I stood there,
on the now unoccupied planet,
once over seven billion's lair,
whereas now everyone had departed.
The world had finally collapsed,
the inevitable taking place.
Everyone else had quickly migrated,
while I was in my own pace.
The calamities had destroyed all,
And everyone departed to the stars.
The Earth had met its fall,
and I knew that running was just a farce.
Hence I stayed behind,
because I knew that humanity will eventually end.
And in my own mind,
I knew that someone had to see things end.
I leave these lines as my final words,
in the shuttle meant for me.
And also leave this final [picture] (http: //www.urbanghostsmedia.com/home/twamoran/urbanghostsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/post-apocalypse.jpg),
for the future generations to see.
