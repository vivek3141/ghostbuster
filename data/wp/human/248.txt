*644221*
I read the numbers and then our pre-flight routine is broken as I whirr to a stop. Co-pilot, John, keeps talking, not realizing I'm sitting there frozen like a block of ice.
My phone buzzes again. *644221*.
"Mike? You right?"
John's Australian. It sounds like *rooight*.
"Uh yeah. Just give me a minute. My wife..."
I wave at my phone. My wife, my wife, my wife. Angela. My wife is...a spy, I guess. We tell people she works for the Government in "business services".
Spy isn't even really it. More like "the person who gets shit done that needs to be done". One of those faceless people who are never in photo-ops, the president doesn't know their name but who wield great power because of who and what they know.
And what they can do.
We never talk shop. I don't know the nuclear launch codes. I don't have a secret passport waiting for me somewhere thanks to Angela. Our daughter doesn't have a security escort.
Ilsa. She's two. At six am she'll be up watching TV before Angela tells her to turn it off.
I can't leave Ilsa.
But the deal...
The deal is that if I get a text with a certain number in it that I have to go. If I'm flying, I need to detour and get as far away from major cities as possible. If I'm outside the US, I need to stay outside. If I can turn back, I turn back.
Today we're going from Los Angeles to Melbourne, Australia. A solid day of flying. But I can't leave-
"Mike, are you okay?"
John, getting worried now.
"Just need a second."
I don't bolt out the door but it's close. I nod and smile to puzzled attendants and then walk past boarding passengers and then I'm in the airport trying not to run and then the blur becomes taxi, traffic, frustration, Angela won't pick up the line, why is the traffic so bad, fuck, pick up the line, why are we just sitting here, time slipping away, fuck
my phone is dead
the flash of light over the buildings hits us first and the driver yells
