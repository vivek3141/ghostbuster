**DAY 1**
Well, I'm Alive. That's pretty much the best thing I can say today. All the training, all the study, the practice and routine, didn't amount to anything really. They tell you how to plan, to coordinate, communicate, move as a team, how to follow orders without question and the moment you enter the battle you realize its all for shit.
The plans go out the window, the equipment you need to fight is missing or broken. What you do have gets destroyed by the stray mortar you heard screaming over your head, giving you just enough time to duck behind the water truck before your ears slip with reverberating ringing so loud you can't tell what the person next to you is saying. The bully at boot camp who pretended to be so tough is now whimpering in the foxhole while others of the team are shaking so hard they can't even hold their M16s. That's when you realize, you're screwed!
The lieutenant isn't any help, hell, he just graduated from Officer's Candidate School last month and its hard to tell if he has any more experience at fighting than ourselves. To make matters worse, he had to inform us this morning on our Rules of Engagement given to us by the pompous politicians in Washington:
* no firing first
* only fire back when under live fire ourselves
* and only fire back when we have approved permission
How the hell is that suppose to work? I didn't come here to just die because some elitist thinks it might be seen as provocative if we happen to kill a few noncombatants. I'm pretty sure they told me we were fighting a war, not participating in some UN mission. I know I had a reason why I thought this was the right thing to do with my life but I've got the feeling I just made a big mistake.

**The End**
It was a good day today; One I won't forget. Tim and the boys went all out. I don't know how they got all the party decoration or the cheesecake for that matter, but I couldn't care. God, it tasted good. I can't remember the last time that smooth silk of sweet cream aroused such a sense of euphoria in my mouth. I almost cried.
The guys even got Lindsey on the satcom for me while they sang in the background. Just hearing her voice and knowing the next time I said a word to her, I will be looking her into her eyes. Those amazingly beautiful pools of irresistible sapphire blue. I can't get home soon enough.
Yet, to leave my men, my team, my friends, my brothers behind. It's as if a part of me is being surgically removed during an emergency field operation. The pain of loss is almost unbearable. Looking at their faces as I left the party was like remembering a loved one during a funeral. Memories coursing through my mind of our trip to hell and damnation then back again. I can see the faces of those that didn't make it: Rob, Michael, Danny, Lenny, Sinclair, and Stevo among others. How is this fair? They were better men than me, better fathers, better husbands, better examples of character. I feel that I should be the one giving my last full measure so they can be the ones to retire happily with their families.
No one who has lived and survived the inhuman nature of war, only to go home to a world you know little about and have limited capability to act within a culture of civilians, understands the reality that is the mental destruction of your being. How do you face the relentless questions about your welfare and your mental state, the constant curiosity of their ignorance and the barrage of criticism from those you gave your life to defend so they can call you *Baby Killer*, *Murderer*, and worse. How will I get through the day without suppressing that urge to smash their face into the nearest wall for their inconsiderate babel?
My only hope for survival is the cabin in the high mountains of Colorado, away from the crowds and urbanites. A place where I can wonder at the majesty of the 14'ers as their snow covered peaks stretch north to south along the great divide. The cool crisp air calming my nerves while Lindsey and I sit out on the deck and watch the Caribou gallop through the yard. A solace that alleviates the anguish of my mind.
So, with 22 years of my life spent on 4 military engagements in 3 countries and 12 years on the front lines, it has come to this; the end. To all those who have served with dignity and honor, who have known the reality of war and made it home, I join your Band of Brothers. Semper Fi.
