"I'm not paid enough for this shit dude," I said, staring at the barrel. "Can you PLEASE eat your fucking Ham and Cheese Omelette? It's 4 AM, I'm tired, I'm hungry, and I just want to go home without dealing with assholes like you. If you're not going to eat your food, then fine, I'll eat it."
The customer didn't reply. His hand trembled a little bit, but it wasn't enough for the pistol to stop pointing at my heart. He still had that dirty old jacket and boots when he stumbled into Denny's at 3 AM, leaving dirt and snow all over the floor. I didn't think much of it at the time. It was Denny's. At 4 AM. If you didn't expect hobos like him at that time, you were delusional.
"Listen, I get paid *minimum wage* working here. You can have this damned meal for free as far as I care. Just let me go home."
"You're an U.N. soldier," he grunted, spit flying into the dish. It was his first few words; when he was ordering his food, he had pointed his frostbitten finger at it. "A Cain. Your name is Jennifer Murry."
"Oh? How did you guess?"
Some more silence. I was getting annoyed the pistol was still pointing at me. Wasn't his arm getting tired?
"You embarrassed me. In front of that college audience."
"Ooooh right. You're the guy who pretended to be a Cain, right? Sorry."
"You killed my daughter."
"No I did not."
"You...if you arrived sooner..."
"Don't blame us for that. We arrived as quickly as we can. Now *please, * eat your food."
There was a bang.
"Oh, now you've done it," I muttered.
"Jennifer?" Slightly muffled, it came from the office.
"Yeah boss?"
"I was taking a nice nap. What happened?"
I looked at the corpse. "Some hobo came in claiming I killed his daughter. He had a gun."
"Oh for Christ's sake Jennifer you can't go killing people like that. Argh, I'll file it under self-defense. *One more incident* like this and I swear to God I'll fire you.
"Yes ma'am." Taking his omelette, I wiped his spit off of my apron before munching it. There was no way I could convince the boss that he shot himself.
