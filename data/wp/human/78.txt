The Council of Elders had gathered, as was tradition. A dozen or so familiar faces — Zorxx the Great, High Priest of the Poinsai Beta star system; Derns the Fierce, Intergalactic Warlord of Epsilon 9; and Sol, Elder of a system so distant, it remains nameless — among others. The ceremony was to begin shortly.
As follows in the ancient scriptures of the starcreatures from Old Atlas Sigma 6, the Lottery was to be pulled on this date.
Nature has a funny way. It has a strange tendency to refresh and replenish itself. From death, comes life; from extinction, comes evolution.
At the last ceremony, Earth was chosen by the prophet. And at the ceremony before that. Never before Earth had the prophet chosen the same planet in three consecutive Lotteries.
It would seem fate had a fondness for Earth, the tiny blue marble becoming a commodity among the Council.
The Lottery is a ceremony originating in the Suns of Old. Every 2000 suns, the Council of Elders is to consult the Prophet. The Prophet is to select a planet of lower life.
The ceremonial feast had been prepared and the horns sounded. The Council began the chant.
"Civilizations crumble,
People cry,
Many will suffer,
Many will die,
Life is a blessing,
But also a curse,
Given this knowledge,
Who knows which is worse?"
The Prophet began its process. It said nothing. Silence fell upon the ceremony chamber. Faces grew grim.
At the rise of the New Sun, the fleets would be dispatched, and planets would become the ashes from which civilizations are born. One planet was chosen to grow.
It wasn't Earth.
