*Well today is the day I die. Well it might as be a great day to day then. * I thought those words as I sat inside the interior of a hollowed out husk of an asteroid. The thing weighted several million tons and was a solid spherical chunk of iron - forged by years of cooling. I knew that if the thing hit the earth it'll change the course of history very quickly, however I had something in particular in mind.
I've always desired to rise above the average man, as a testament to my almighty greatness. No one shall not know my name and nobody shall not be effected by what I have done. I want to spite those infernal gods who sentenced me to die however they didn't say how I needed to die. I'm still following their ultimately random commands which have now cursed me to die.
I picked up my microphone and began live streaming. "Hello people of earth and the alien bastards to want me to die today. I will die today but not in the way you might expect. Right now I'm heading to the planet at 9% of light speed being flung around a black hole. And right now this rock I'm on will hit this pathetic speck of a planet in Antarctica with the force of a solar flare. This planet will be damaged to the point where its axis is tilted and the seas will drown you all. And that's is you survive the shockwave and the force of the energy transferring into your pathetic bodies. My name is Heinrich Hitler, now prepare to die in a few minuets time."
