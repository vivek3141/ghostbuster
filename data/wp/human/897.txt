In the middle of the Armenian forest, there was a den of wolves who had thrived for centuries preying on the young boys of a nearby village. They had been kidnapping young boys and infants so effectively that the villagers made it their tradition to sacrifice whomever was taken.
Hunting parties came and went but the den was never found, and the wolves found themselves never hungry.
But then came a time of sudden famine.
For the wolves found out, the young boys would move to other places outside their village. Young men were too big to try to abduct, and the wolves were chivalrous - they would never eat a woman.
Woofs was a young wolf who had decided to one day play a trick on the den when he howled "BOYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!".
Several of the elder members growled as they came outside, only to find that no such boy existed.
"It was a joke," Woofs explained, somewhat pleased with himself, "I just wanted to have some fun with you guys."
"Woofs," Barks, the oldest council-wolf looked at him solemnly, "This is a time of hunger - our bravest warriors have not yet return from their scouting mission, and I'm afraid that without any boys to feast on, we shall surely perish."
Woofs hung his head in shame and nodded.
"Sorry sir."

It was several moons later when one of the warriors returned. A meeting was put together immediately as the warrior was questioned.
"What happened?" Barks demanded.
"T-t-the humans," the warrior panted, "T-t-they have evolved their own society! They have something called technology and the 'Internet'! Human rarely leave their dens nowadays!"
"What are you saying?" Barks had dread in his eyes, "Surely the boys of humans must go out and play sometime?"
The warrior shook his head. "No m'lord. They're on these colorful rocks on something they call the Facebook."
Several of the other wolves muttered among them as Barks slowly acknowledged what he was hearing.
"If what you say is true, this is disastrous." He looked at the warrior and towards the other den members, "We must not lose hope! We will surely find some boys to feast on soon!"

The news of the boys not leaving their homes had traveled quick among the pack.
Woofs looked grudgingly at solemn mood and then remembered the trick he had played before that made everyone riled up.
"Anything is better than this," he muttered before he drew in a large breath.
"BOYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!"
The wolves came scurrying out, panting with their tongues touching the ground. Noses sniffed the air as Barks emerged from the pack.
"What is going on here?"
"Woofs just lied again!" one of the wolves shouted.
"There is no boy!" The pack was starting to get riled up.
The wolves began growling at Woofs as he slowly backed up.
"Whoa whoa whoa," he stammered, "I'm trying to help us out here."
"Woofs," Barks looked at him with a heavy face, "You are not permitted to sleep in the den tonight. Tonight, you shall scavenge for food."
"Aww, do I have to?" Woofs had never really gone scouting on his own before, "This sucks."
"Go now!" Barks commanded, "Or before I give you a real reason to howl about."
Woofs quickly left the site and had been traveling for several minutes when his thoughts managed to catch up with him.
*This is unbelievable, I try to lighten the mood up and this happens. *
*I'm literally taking one for the team. *
*That damn old man needs to get off my-*
He heard the sound of footsteps. He quickly slunk back into a bush as the footsteps approached.
What could it be?
He was answered as several plump animals walked out into the area with very large tummies and seemed to have a lost look in their eyes.
*These are boys! Three of them! *
"Adolf, we are lost." one of them grunted.
"If you didn't insist on stopping for a candy break," another responded, "We wouldn't have been separated from the group!"
"I hate the woods," the third one took a bite from what looked like a candy bar, "I wish I was at home playing Black Ups."
The three sat down and began to play with the sticks in the ground.
*They're going to stay here. *
Without a moment's hesitation, Woofs sprinted back towards the den.
"Everyone! Everyone!" he panted several minutes later, "There are three boys!"
"Three boys?" one of the wolves feigned interest.
"Yes! They're all plump from eating their human food!" Woof was jumping up and down. By now, he had attracted the attention of most of the wolves. "They're sitting right on the ground! We can have a feast with them!"
The other wolves began to laugh as Barks' voice loomed over him. "And these...these boys, I suppose, are just sitting down in the woods just waiting for us to come get them?"
"Yes!" Woofs wagged his tail eagerly.
"You want us to follow you?"
"Yes!"
Barks and several other of the dogs began to laugh.
"I'm not joking!" Woof knew he couldn't miss this chance, "One of them's named Adolf!"
"What kind of name is that?" someone shouted, "Now we definitely know you're lying!"
The wolves are roared with laughter as they walked back towards their den. Barks took one last look of disgust at Woofs and muttered, "You disgust me."
With no boys to eat, the wolves slowly died out and the den was eradicated.
