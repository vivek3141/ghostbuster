What seemed to be an eternity had only truly been a day. The ferry man was late and my task was becoming increasingly tiresome. Through the fog several more canisters fell to the ground.
"Put this gas mask on" I yelled. The fucking irony I thought. His little princess as I had come to call him at first refuse. When the smoke touched his eyes, he complied. I aimed my pitchfork gun j the the mist and listened. It was too quiet.
A face emerged through the fog, grotesque and disfigured, another jew. How many did this guy piss off that ended up down here. I took another shot and the creature fell to the ground. I moved through the fog as it began to clear away. Two bullets left and what I could only imagine an army waiting for us.
But that was not the case. The few stragglers left began to run away into the abyss.
I gave a quick smile and found princess again. He wouldn't take his mask off now. Bastard was always so stubborn.
A voice arose behind me and I knew my task was drawing to an end.
A soft voice, it sang "row row row your boat...." the ferry man, or Steve as he preferred was docking. I took princess to the harbor and put him on the boat.
"two coins please" asked Steve
I looked at my task and he shrugged.
"I thought you had it mussolini".
I cursed into the heavens and the hells, paid the ferryman, Steve, and left princess for ever.
The boat pulled away to the song again.
"row row row your boat".
"Oh I love this song "said princess.
