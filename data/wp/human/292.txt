"The exploders creep me out."
"They prefer to be called humans."
"Yeah? And I'd prefer to be called the Uber-Admiral of the 5th fleet. Doesn't change the fact that those things are obsessed with explosions."
"Are you talking about nuclear weapons? Plenty of pre-FTLs have come up with those. I mean, even we went through times of violence and destruction."
"Yes, we've been violent, and yes, we've blown things up. Still, we've never felt the need to include explosions in every single significant invention we've ever come up with."
"I don't follow."
"Have you read my report on the Internal Combustion engine?"
"I skimmed it."
"It's a way to propel their vehicles using explosions. They're asinine. Hear about their firearms? They're ranged weapons that fling projectiles with explosions."
"Doesn't seem like it would be the most accurate..."
"Oh, they figured out a way for it to work. They just couldn't tolerate having anything like that centered around elasticity or magnetism...just had to include an explosion in there. Hell, they have larger, but similar weapons that fling explosive devices with the aid of explosions. Some of those explosions explode into smaller devices that also explode."
"Now you're just making shit up."
"No, look up 'Terran cluster bombs."'
"What the fuck?"
"Oh, and get this: take a guess what they concluded once they discovered that all the visible galaxies were moving away from each other...that the entire universe was the result of a really, really huge explosion."
