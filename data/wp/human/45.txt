"ArcanoCorp technical support; This is Mike speaking."
"Hi, Mike, I'm having trouble casting the new 'Detect Evil And Turn To A Crisp' spell."
"Ah, yes. I will first need to confirm a few things, company policy"
"very well"
"First, did you check your connection to the Aether?"
"Yes, I have a strong connection. and yes, I tried disconnecting and reconnecting"
"Good, good. Now, the spell involves both the Divination and Destruction schools, so you must ensure that you have the proper reagents for both trees. Additionally, the spell has both spoken and somatic aspects, ensure that you are performing these."
"I have both the Diamond Dust, and Magic Tallow needed, and have been performing the somatic elements correctly. Is the power word case sensitive? I assumed not, as your company has previously been know for that."
"You are correct, the spell is in fact not case sensitive. Are you sure that there is, in fact, an evil presence within 1Megameter, or 1,000km? A standard 'Detect Evil' should be enough."
"Wait, 1,000km? My manual states 100,000km. Was this misprinted?"
"One moment please."
...
"Alright, I do have a recall for some issued copies of 'Detect Evil And Turn To A Crisp', stating that the instructions were indeed printed incorrectly. Check the Arcane Identification Number against our recall database, and see if you are entitled to a replacement spell."
"Thanks Mike, will do."
"No problem."
