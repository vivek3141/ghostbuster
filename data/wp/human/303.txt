Thomas was never very good with gifts. He always got something that was not quite what you wanted or not very thought through. At least he knew it and often included a receipt.
The first Christmas we had as co-workers and office neighbors, three years ago, Thomas got me a skateboard. I had told him that my son was a skateboarder; he had gotten mixed up and thought I skated instead. At my birthday Thomas once bought me a camera. I have no idea why. It was a good one too. Expensive. I returned it and used the money to get him a hard drive for his PC. He had said he needed one and wouldn't stop thanking me for a full two weeks.
The gifts kept coming and they never got better, but he kept trying. And no matter what I got him he was always grateful. It made me feel bad that I couldn't be as grateful in return. I knew that Thomas was always a good friend, and deserved a better friend than me.
So this year, after exchanging gifts once more, I sit in my office admiring Thomas's latest attempt at gift giving: a plain mug with my name on it, in plain text. I don't drink coffee, but I could not be happier with my present. It will remind me of him. Of the friend that he is and the person that I aspire to be like. I smile uncontrollably, staring at the mug. I could not be more grateful to Thomas.
