**This was a great prompt, but I kind of took it in a different direction**
It started with one long slow note,
Was apprehensive at the start,
With confidence the note grew bolder,
Adding harmonies to its heart,
As song took shape more voices joined,
‘ Till the village was filled with song,
And I alone ignored its pleading,
I had no voice to sing along,
I looked down on the songs and dancing,
My lip curled with righteous scorn,
"What childishness this frivolous drear,
Too carefree for one wellborn,"
As hours passed the song had changed,
For with each precious moment,
A fresh new song had been arranged,
Thus began my painful torment,
For I alone could hear no song,
Nor the cadence in the dance,
Nor the words with which the village crooned,
To lovers locked in their romance,
A different song for love or weeping,
For ending conflicts long hard-fought,
Though animals with growls and peeping,
Could hear the Song, I alone could not,
I begged my ears to hear the sound,
My voice to produce a single note,
Yet heard no Song and no note found,
The lines I was unable to quote,
Desperate now with tears and pleading,
Arms stretched skyward, knees shorn and bleeding,
"From whence came these tragic proceedings,
That I alone, of upright breeding,
Should falter at the call?"
And yet no answer to my anguished cry,
I bid a deaf singing town good-bye,
The tallest mountain to catch my eye,
I climbed ‘ till I was weak with panting,
"What life is this?" My mind obsessed,
"That I alone should be music-less,
The dancing feats others posses,
Should stop short when it reaches me?"
Though two days passed, uncomprehended,
My food ran out, my journey ended,
I slowly stood up, and then descended,
To return to the start of my misery,
My footsteps slow, my eyes unseeing,
For deep within in all my being,
I knew that I was alone.
The dreaded sound heard over the hill,
Every footstep a challenge of will,
*But as I drew nearer the sound was, different, *
Not playful as it was when I'd departed,
Nor cheerful, or melodious at all,
Instead the song was full of anguish,
It sounded nothing like what I recalled,
I ran until my heart was bursting,
The sight of my town set me to cursing,
My friends in rags yet still rehearsing,
Spurred on by some devilish call,
Though exhausted the people noticed,
When I ran in through the main gate,
Their eyes looked up, expressions hopeful,
That I would save them from this fate,
For in my absence they had learned,
That not a one occurrence could pass,
Without a jig, or dancing circle,
Without a chorus to sing en masse,
All this they sang beseechingly
"And so it is," They sang to me,
"One such as you could say and be,
Instead of us, then we'd be free"
Hopelessly I watched them wander,
Their choreographed dances and trills,
And one by one they joined the yonder,
Till I was alone on the hill,
My bitterness had reached crescendo,
As I watched the last one drift away,
Why should they be graced easy passing,
While I alone was forced to stay?
