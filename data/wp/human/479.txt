It had happened again. I woke up in a blank white room with an almost faceless man, I mean he must have had a face, its just that I couldn't make it out...I don't know why this felt so familiar.
Before my mind could wonder, he began as he always did.
"How do you feel right now?"
"Fine" I replied. By this point I knew there was no point in asking questions. He would ask his questions and then...I don't know what happened after that. I mean I vaguely remembered bits and pieces of...
"Do you know why you are here?" the interviewer interrupted my train of thought.
"No...wait...I- I did something..." I struggled to remember why I was here, what I had done to get here, where here was even, but before I could make sense of it he began with his next question.
"What does it mean to be a good person?"
"What does it mean to be a bad person?"
"Are you a good person or a bad person?"
"How can you be a better person?"
The interviewer rattled his questions off and I answered them as best I could. I had trouble following him most the time and I am sure my answers came out incoherent at best. It was this place...My mind seemed...almost in a daze as if waking up on an operating room table staring into the light. Nothing quite made sense, yet it seemed like it was as it should be.
At a point the questions stopped and it seemed he was lecturing me on kindness and caring. As the lecture continued my world became fuzzier, and I more disoriented. As I began to lose myself in a void of unconscious confusion the world seemed to disappear in a flash.
It had happened again. I woke up in a blank room with a faceless man. It felt so familiar...
"How do you feel right now?"
