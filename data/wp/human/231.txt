"It's not your fault. You couldn't have known."
Those were the last words of the woman I called my enemy. The last words she said before she pulled the trigger, staining her red hair a deeper shade of red.
I stared out of the window of the highrise building that held her office. Outside the building the fires burned, the people screamed, and the world called my name. How could I tell them that the same people that gave me my Suit were the ones that caused this destruction?
I took my helmet off and dropped it to the floor, the heat was too much to handle. Her particular brand of anarchy could have saved us from this genocide, this extinction, if only I hadn't stopped her.
I laugh at the irony, louder and louder until the tears flow down my face. Everything is wrong. I can't get her last words out of my head. The last bit of kindness from a woman I wrote off as evil. I wonder if she knew what she would be doing to my mind when she said that.
In the end it's the perfect moment. The moment of closeness I never felt with another. Everything from her last words, the half smile, and the fact that the gun she left behind still had a few more bullets in it.
"It's not my fault. I couldn't have known."
I smile to the empty room, and wonder fleetingly if there will be anyone left to miss me.
