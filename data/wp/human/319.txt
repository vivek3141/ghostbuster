In the blink of an eye, it was gone. The muffled sirens, the awkward discomfort in her chest – in the end there hadn't been time for pain. The worst part had been the anticipation, and even that had come and gone before she'd had time to breathe. All she could do was watch, instinctively raising her arms in front of her face as the debris flew towards her.
*Where was...where am I? *
She tried to open her eyes, but the world flooded her vision with blinding light, forcing her to squeeze her eyelids closed and shiver in darkness. The liquid surrounding her was cold, and she felt the stiff goosebumps rising on every patch of her naked body. Her ears rang with the sound of nothing in particular. She felt an emptiness inside her.
*An...Anna. That's right. That's...me? *
She couldn't recall asking herself any questions, but the answers were there. As more details trickled into the forefront of her mind, she began to piece together still images of a bar. Or was it a restaurant?
*Who is he? *
Her mind fumbled, searching for a memory to pivot on. She didn't know why she was drawn to him. The motionless images came one after the other, but his face remained a blur.
*Centaur Cafe. That's right...I had a...a...box? *
Anna was beginning to feel a pressure in her forehead, as if someone was pumping air into her skull.
*Such a tiny box...*
She opened her eyes again, squinting against the bright lights surrounding her. Everything seemed to be white, with the exception of the shadowy silhouettes in the distance. Anna could see just enough to know they must be people.
*Lee...Leah? No...*
One of the silhouettes moved around more than the others. Something about the movements seemed agitated.
*Li...Liam? Ah, yes, sounds so familiar...*
She felt a surge of warmth fill her chest. Something about finding the name – thinking it, even – breathed life into her.
*Liam! *
Memories swirled through Anna's mind, rapidly producing images of his goofy smile and the feelings of butterflies filling her stomach.
*Of course, the box...that was the night he...*
Anna remembered the ring. Liam had been so nervous, he'd dropped the ring into a piece of cheesecake. Anna giggled to herself. Her laughter came out as gurgles, and her memories retreated. She felt an uncomfortable twitch in her back.
*Where am I? *
An image popped into her head – something moving unnaturally fast. Her shoulders tensed, bracing for impact.
*That...was...that hit me. It must have hit me. *
Suddenly, Anna realized where she was. She remembered the meeting with the insurance company, she remembered being on the fence about the ridiculous price tag, and she even remembered the pamphlet. *The Future of Life Insurance*, that's what it had said. Anna squinted again as she scanned her body, noticing the thin tubes attached to various parts of her body.
*Only this isn't my body. It's an...empty shelf, a copy. A clone. My Clone...*
Anna tried to remember what had happened to Liam. She hadn't seen him getting struck by the debris, but they had been sitting so close. Their hands had been touching. Anna's back began to hurt, as if something was twisting her spine. She felt her legs, but her toes seemed to have gone numb. She could see more clearly now, and the silhouettes were unmistakably human. Many of the people were surrounding the agitated person, and a few had their arms moving, in what appeared to be explanatory gestures.
Anna's back twitched again, and she looked down to her feet. Her vision was pretty clear at this point, and she saw her knees and toes floating. She tried to stretch her toes, but they didn't move. She tried bending her knees. They didn't budge.
The agitated person pushed past the other people, who shook their heads in disapproval but did nothing more to intervene. Anna watched with curiosity as the figure approached. A few seconds later, she could tell the figure was a man. He was not fully clothed.
*Liam! Is it you? * Anna gurgled softly in the water as her mouth lazily traced the words.
His face had a few more lines on it than her memory had shown, but that was back when he'd proposed, years before they had even thought about buying into their insurance policy.
Liam pressed his hand against the containment glass, peering in at her. His lips were moving, but no sound made it through the barrier. She tried to point her finger to her ear, but her arm was not yet that flexible. Instead, she raised her hand to the glass. She didn't have the strength to hold hers as high as Liam's, but he moved his hand down to meet hers.
"Good to see you," she mouthed to him through the liquid.
His lips moved, but she couldn't tell what he was saying. His mouth moved slowly at first, then picked up speed. His eyes were intense and his hand pressed against the glass more firmly.
Anna felt another twitch in her spine, and her hand began to slip from the glass. It slid slowly, and even as she tried to prop it up she found herself unable to control her arm.
Liam's own hand followed hers at first, and when he looked into her eyes she saw fear. She saw the tears of frustration building.
And Anna knew.
*Oh, Liam...I'm so, so sorry...*
Anna looked into his eyes, her expression clear of anxiety. His own look softened as he held her gaze, seeing that she remembered; he could see that she recognized him. Anna nodded her head slowly.
Another twitch in her spine, and Anna's neck stopped moving. Her eyes stayed focused on Liams'.
As the cold she felt faded into numbness, the light in her peripherals dimmed. There was no feeling. No pain, no memories. Her shivers were gone. When her eyes began to slip away from Liam, she closed them, savoring him in her mind like a photograph.
She thought of him one last time, sitting in front of her with the small box, smiling his goofy smile.
She held onto all that was left of him as the photograph faded into darkness. It faded, and then there was nothing.
