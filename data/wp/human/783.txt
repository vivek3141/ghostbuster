"Shit, SHIT. OH MY GOD!" half breathed ben aloud. "What the hell am I going to tell his mom?" he screamed. Gun still pointed at the other "Travis". He mind was racing a thousand miles a minute. He had just shot his best friend. All this back and fourth talk between the two. He had even quizzed them both. He was sure he had picked the clone. "How could I not know I was being tricked?" he whispered.
Thats when it happened, the ceiling exploded into a million tiny shards of glass. They were here, and they wanted their property back. He thought back to the day him and travis stumbled upon that little secret. He remember how they were going to change the world with it. He couldn't help but to smirk. Back then they were so naive. So much time had past since then and everything that had come to light in their investigation. It was almost worth it. Just almost.
The ropes were slowly falling for Ben, when he decided to plug the trigger. He knew that in just moments there would be a small team surrounding them to recover the stolen property. He knew one bullet to this travis's head and everything they had come for would be gone. He wanted to make sure the they would pay for everything he had lost. CLICK. The round is sent spinning through the chamber of the.45. Sent on it destructive course for the hard bone and soft brain matter of this abomination. But the bullet never meets its target. Instead it is stopped just short. As it falls to the ground, he knows who is here. But there was no time left, so he turns and starts to run toward the car. "They will come for me" he thinks to himself as he gets into the car. "But for now I will wait till that day comes" he says as he starts the car and lunges down the road and around the corner.
