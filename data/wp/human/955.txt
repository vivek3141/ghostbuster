I suddenly awoke with a start, eyes blinking rapidly in the dark. It took a while before my mind registered something sharp tapping against my foot but slowly, I got up onto my elbows and stared at the foot of my bed. Dark, bloody red eyes met mine and a sinister smile made its way across his malevolent face.
"Hey Lucifer," I sighed.
He let out a dark chuckle and gave one last sharp tap on my foot, making me wince slightly. It was time, I supposed. I expected it for a while, I just never knew exactly when but after being alive for over a thousand years, I guess I should've known this moment was coming.
"You're it," he breathes.
And then, gone.
I quietly groaned to myself and threw the sheets off, climbing out of bed. Once my feet were on the ground, I shuffled over to the mirror on the other side of the wall. Even without the light on, I could see my eyes changing. Darker and darker they became, until the brown in them had all but been replaced by color that resembled wine. I pulled my upper lip up and sure enough, my canines were beginning to elongate and sharpen.
I scratched the delicate points of my slowly forming horns.
Being the Devil was a hard job, definitely not something someone could handle alone.
It was my turn now.
