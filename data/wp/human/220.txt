Yeah, my childhood was pretty normal. When Adam was born it took some getting used to the fact that I'd be getting less Christmas presents, but I loved my brother from the start. My father was an architect and my mom was a high profile defense attorney. They both worked long hours, but they made time for us whenever they could. Oh yeah, we had a babysitter for a few years there that I slowly figured out never aged. She was perpetually sixteen years old. It was pretty weird, but I got used to it. I had the biggest crush on her. Anyway, in high school I ended up playing varsity badminton. Adam played the tuba. I graduated with decent grades and now here I am in college following in my father's footsteps.
