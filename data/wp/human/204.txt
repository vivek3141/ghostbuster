Captain Rick slammed on the brakes of his moon rover, and skidded to a stop for the next 10 seconds.
Once the rover stopped completely he stood up and headed over to the object glinting a few meters away from him.
As he got closer the brightness became more and more unbearable, until he managed to cover the object with his shadow.
He blanched at the sight, murmuring a soft "What in the actual fuck..." before hurriedly reaching for his radio button.
Finally, after a few seconds of struggling with his suit, he called the colony, and said the words he never in his life thought he would utter.

"Uhm, HQ, this is captain Rick, I...Uhm.. found a viking sword...over?"
