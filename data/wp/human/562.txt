I don't know what they are.
When you think of monsters, you imagine the familiar - werewolves, zombies, or maybe vampires. The kind of monsters you see in movies and games. It's a natural reaction. Not many people can imagine the really uncomfortable or frightening kind, nor do they want to. I certainly couldn't imagine this.
"Sweetie? You can come out now. It's safe."
The emergency broadcast on the TV told everyone to stay put. To lock the doors and close the curtains. As always, a lot of people didn't listen, taking to the streets with guns and backpacks in tow. I don't know what happened to them. I don't even know what I hope happened to them anymore - perhaps becoming a monster is just a matter of switching sides at this point.
"Our kids are waiting downstairs. The government made another brodcast, they said the crisis is over."
The only reason I'm still hiding is paranoia. It's not even really a fear of the unknown - I know that the person outside the closet is my wife. It's her voice, her fingers gently tapping the wall...But it feels like she's acting out a role. Like she knows all the right things to say, but does so with just a little too much conviction.
"I'll wait out here, honey. Until you're ready to come out."
She is my wife. She has to be, right? If she was a monster...I'd know, right? At the same time, I haven't heard any broadcasts on the radio. The silence outside is still ear deafening. A note slips under the door. "I miss you" it says.
I don't know what they are. I guess I'll have to find out sooner or later.
