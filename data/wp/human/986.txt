I look at my file once more. My name is Lee Harvey Oswald. 24, single, caucasian, killer. Target: John F. Kennedy. Date of Assassination: November 22nd, 1963. What have I gotten myself into, I silently think to myself. CIA will be fun they said. Black Ops gets paid more, they told me. I see why now. I leave in three hours. I anxiously pace around my small apartment room.The plan is simple. Anyone one could do it. Hide in some building, that's where it will start me off. Wait for the target to be in range, and take the shot. Simple enough. But that's not what has me worried. It's the simple fact that this whole thing is going on at all. What history is real? What history did we make. I've been assured no matter what decisions I make, the outcome is the same, I just have to be the catalyst. It always need a catalyst. But then how is it he has already been killed according to history. Well, the all-knowing scientists tell me that they detected that some events in history are triggered by the travelers of the future. So either I will be the killer, the killer actually existed, or someone is already there creating mishap and I have to somehow direct it.
It's all really confusing.
