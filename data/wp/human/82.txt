Chief of the Engi, Saluy son of Davok son of Rofuy spoke "We are the Engi. My father told this story of our beginning: Our gods cast us from the garden for our many crimes against them. Cut us out like bad crops and tossed us into the stars. The elders say that one day, the gods will call us home and forgive us; that by following their laws we may atone.
I keep the old ways. The Engi are a proud and wise people. We hold our habs and domes as we ever have against the Secu and the Offi, deadly savages and ruthless eaters of men. They are many, but our wisdom and skillcraft still serve us well.
We know the ways to grow food. Wheat for bread, for beer. Insects, pigs, fungi for meat. Fruits. No Engi child is hungry, though we are a small people- less than 100 hands among us. Of course, we have the help of the old ones, the men who are made of metal.
They, too, were cast away from the gods. My father said that the old ones came of their own will, came to aid us in our exile.
The old ones and the Engi made an ancient pact; we would keep the old ways and pray to their shrines with offerings of fruit and salvage and they would guard against the haunted dark that fills so many habs, so many domes with ice and silence and the clean picked bones of the unlucky. The old ones do not speak, but there are signs and portents of their will. Lights like stars appear on their chests, signalling by ancient decree for the sacrifice of fruit and meat.
We guard the tunnels. Our fathers, proud founders of the Engi left us with many wonders. Blades made of light, brighter than a comet. Armor to turn the rusted knives the Offi and the Secu bring, clutched in the fists of their screaming masses. Each battle, our fathers ways guide us and when the killing is done and the dead Engi are returned to the earth, the old ones move among the Secu and Offi. They take the dead away, to where we do not know. It is taboo to question or doubt the old ones in their duties.
There are other habs with old ones. The Astron study the stars and their movements. The Engi and the Astron have an old pact that we honor as they do. For our foods they provide salvage and prophecy learned from the secret language of the stars. They are a small people and food comes easy for the Engi. We share with who we can. It is our way. The Astron say that our day of reckoning is coming at last, that we are no longer passively drifting through the stars, but are moving with more purpose than before.
The - "
Overhead, on the gantries and catwalks of the habitation dome, spinning red lights emerged from rusted shutters. Claxon warnings blared. A door, hidden by generations of rust and oxidation slid open along one wall and the drones - painted and decorated by generation after generation- slid forth.
**All occupants are to report to their pods. Repeat, all occupants are report to their pods. Entering decaying orbit. **
Saluy stopped his story in mid-breath. The children, previously wide-eyed with wonder at the story of their people were now visibly frightened.
They weren't the only ones.
Bathed by the evil red lights the Engi were in a state of near-panic. The old ones moved among them, guiding each Engi to a series of pods that had emerged from the floor, disrupting several huts. Saluy watched as several of the old ones shoved a group of frightened Engi into a pod and sealed the doors.
**All occupants are to report to their pods. Repeat, all occupants are report to their pods. Entering decaying orbit. **
Saluy leapt to his feet as the pod slid back down into the floor, the ow frenzied Engi inside pounding against the doors.
"Old One!" He cried to the nearest rust and paint covered frame. "What is happening?!"
The old one turned its row of circular blue lights to face him and began pushing him backward toward the door he had seen open in the wall. He pulled away and tried to duck around it. The old one locked its clamp arms around his and lifted his feet from the ground. Another began rounding up the children he had been with and ushering them toward yet another pod.
"Old One! Answer me! I know you can speak!". It said nothing and Saluy struggled with all his might. He'd seen Old Ones lift Secu, who were all warriors of terrible strength and incredible height, effortlessly from the ground and rip them limb from limb.
The doorway was pitch black and Saluy felt a terrible chill in his guts. The Old One approached the door with calm treads and stepped inside, still carrying Saluy. Once inside, the Old One chimed a series of notes. The door slid shut with a series of clanks and squeals and a light appeared over head. The room, once lit, held no terrors. The Old One set Saluy down and turned him gently until he was facing the wall beside the door.
Before him was a chair and a small desk. On the desk was an ancient terminal. He'd seen them in the habs and domes. His father had told him they'd once held incredible knowledge and power, but had long ago gone to sleep.
The Old One pulled out the chair and gently, inexorably, pushed Saluy down into it. When he was seated, the Old One spoke for the first time. It's voice was soft and buzzed slightly.
"**Genesis. Day 360, 985. ** "
The screen began to glow. On the screen appeared a line of words that Saluy did not know. He had learned to read of course, all the Engi did, but only the engi script. This was new.
A panel on the desk opened to reveal a square of dark plastic with the outline of a hand in blue light in the middle of it. Saluy looked back at the old one, standing still and silent once again, and decided to place his trust in the old ones, as his father had told him to. He placed his hand on the blue outline.
He took a deep breath, closed his eyes and placed his hand on the outline.
**Recognized, 33rd descendent of Chief Engineer Walter Sullivan. Descent protocol begin. **
And the ship began to tilt.
For the first time in his life, Suluy felt gravity and he didn't like it.
Had he been watching from outside the ship, he'd have seen the scarred, dark ship outlined against the blue-green disk it was now orbiting. He would have seen large engines cycle off again and the ship begin the ballet of deceleration and the jettisoning of the pods toward the surface of the planet.
He was, however, busy throwing up.
The old one approached the desk and chimed at the terminal which blinked rapidly through several operations and another panel ont he desk opened. This one held a wire harness which the old one expertly slid onto Saluy's head.
Saluy had just time to wipe his mouth, realize something was on his head and reach out to touch the trailing wire running from the headpiece to the desk before he heard the old one say:
**Initiate upload**
and his world fractured.
The upload contained so much information that to go into each item would be impossible. The gist was this, in a fraction of a second Saluy learned that the gods had not forsaken them, but had sent them to a newly discovered (1000 years ago, newly discovered that is) planet to colonize it. That the ships computer had been damaged in a revolt led by the Security staff and had gone almost entirely dormant, judging that navigation and life support would be the only systems that could not be terminated. Saluy received the equivalent of a doctoral education in Engineering and a complete briefing of the scans of and findings on the planet they were now descending to.
The old one stood behind him as hisbody jerked and shuddered, his teeth chattered and his eyes rolled in his head. Its clamp hands secured him to the chair as the ship settled into orbit and corrected the decay into the planets atmosphere. Below, the pods slashed through the planets clouds, trailing fire. Almost every one had functioning chutes and thrusters that came automatically online. Almost. Some were crushed against mountains before their chutes could open, or smashed into each other in the high air currents of the upper atmosphere. Saluy watched through the ships eyes as his people fell to their new home.
Saluy's mind linked directly with the ship's computer for only about 13 seconds, but in that time he learned everything it could teach him.
He slumped back, drool running down his chin and into his beard. Suddenly, he could smell himself for the first time.
"Gods above..." he muttered as his vision swam. "Gods above, I; m glad I didn't know that was going to happen..."
The old one stood silently behind him, arms now at it's sides. Saluy stood and grasped it's carbon fiber shoulder to steady himself. His head was almost literally swimming with new information. He felt a little crazy, but he figured that would pass as he adjusted and his mind got used to the new information from the upload. He felt...good.
"Droid, what is your designation?"
**X-5 21A, Chief Engineer Sullivan**
"Very well, I'm going to call you X-5 for short. Do you acknowledge?"
**Acknowledged, Chief Engineer Sullivan. **
Suluy - Sullivan - walked to the door and keyed in the code to open it. It slid open and he gazed across the habitation dome that had been his home.
"Very well. Let's go, we've got a lot of work to do and I want to start with seeing how many of the security droids we can have patrolling the ship within the day. The Secu, the Offi, they're still up here I'm betting and we need to neutralize them. Come. Let's begin. "
