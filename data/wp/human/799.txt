0:28, it was stuck on 28 seconds.
It was a strange coincidence, he was born on the 28th, but he couldn't even remember that right now. He had been waiting for this for some time now, a long time. The rest of the world was just passing by in a blur, when he first sat down on the bench. He tried to pay attention at first, observing who it could or couldn't be. He told himself he wouldn't discriminate. He wanted to keep race, age and gender out of it. What would be, would be.
Then in the blur of the crowd, he saw her. She was beautiful, in the truest sense of the word, she made the ages of waiting worth it. And she edged closer to him, time seemed to stop, as if Kronos himself was sending a sign. She looked up and met his eyes, and she smiled. That smile, he would soon cherish.
On his wrist, still 0:28.
He didn't care, it had to be her. Who said these things worked anyway? There were stories, rumours really, that people had forsaken the advice of the devices, and still found happiness. This was his chance. All his life he had followed, taking conventions from society as gospel. He had one shot, and he couldn't miss it.
He rose from the seat, but just as he did, he saw it coming. The car burst through his bubble, taking her with it. He froze.
He glanced at his timer.
