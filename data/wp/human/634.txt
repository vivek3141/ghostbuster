> We didn't know what the message meant, but we can be sure that by the time we received it would be only a few years before the meteor entered the solar system.
> I remember the day of the impact. I was working at nasa as a foreign object detection guy, fodg for short. The television had just been invented or whatever, and black face was still a popular joke on tv.
> I sat by my desk as my co-workers watched the hit new comedy sketch show "Billy and the n-words".
> Billy was just about to do thing where he goes "IS DIS PIE FO MEE?"
> Being the true fan that I was I already had the box set on blueray but enough about that. LOOK I SWEAR IM NOT RACIST!, I returned to my asteroid monitor and watched a suspicious object enter our solar system. The Object was flying through the outer ring of the solar system and wasn't much of a cause for concern.
> I turn my head to watch the episode, Billy was still in whiteface. The premise of the series was that his girl friend thinks Billy is black and in order to gain her affection he has to live a double life. The humor came from the fact that he has to steal one pie every twenty four hours in order to unlock the power of the gypsy tar that old fortuneteller gave him.
> I check once more on the monitor, the space rock is still leaving the solar system. I look back to the tv as Billy stands over the windowsill of officer Gary.
>" I guess de pie was fo me"
> Audience laughs as Billy transforms into super sayajin black
>" That's the last straw you f****** n*****! gunshot noises*"
> suddenly the meteor scanner starts laughing too
> no wait its an alarm
> SHIT
> The meteor is already in our atmosphere.
> *BOOMING VOICE
> I HAVE BEEN TASKED BY THE PEACE LORDS OF TUMBLERON IV TO KEEP SAFE SPACE
> THIS SECTOR HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS A SAFE SPACE!!
> FOR YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS AGAINST THE INFINITE MINORITIES OF THE UNIVERSE YOUR PLANETOID WILL BE WIPED CLEAN OF LIFE!
>" focus, enhance" I say to the screen
> The image of a massive planet sized mass of grey genderless flesh tumbls out of the sky. At first I think the streaks of red behind it are plasma tails but no it was just its hair.
>> IMPACT
>> The earth was SHATTERED by the weight of the impact
> I think im dying, but I feel a warmth behind me.
> It's Billy
> He's blacker than he's ever been before
>" IS Dis Pie Fo MEE!?!?!"
> i bend over and give him my "pie"
> Cum with me child and I will take you to the promised land
> There's enough pie heaven
> Too drunk to finish story
