I promised I would never abandon her. With tears in her eyes and scars on her arms, she would blame me. I was the reason she was depressed. I was the reason she lost all her friends. I was the reason she felt the need to harm herself.
You know what her definition of abandonment was? Not messaging her on Facebook for three whole days. That's all it took. Three days, and she tells me that she no longer wants to be friends anymore.
Fine. That is honestly the way it should be. We would both be better off not not having each other in our lives. We were free.
Or so I thought.
It was all just a passive-aggressive, manipulative trick. Once again, I was the bad guy for not trying to get her to forgive me. How could I be so insensitive to her feelings? I'm a horrible person, and she's the only one who will forgive me. Not my sister, not my best friend, not my parents. I'm nothing without her.
So I did what I though was right: I abandoned her.
