Terra was always considered the land of misfits.
The one place in the galaxy where worlds could dump their unnecessary, and unneeded species from their worlds to ours. Each planet of the federation was granted the ability to drop the entirety of one species off onto Terra to free themselves of the burden of their existence on their own world. Terra was considered a *Death World*. As in it couldn't sustain life for long periods of time, due to the general entropy of our solar system, and the fact that earth can only handle so much life at once from packing it full of these *useless* species. The Galactic Federation would cause mass extinction events to "cleanse" the planet when it got too packed, essentially a cosmic trashbin for the Galactic Federation.
Humanity really was a luck of the draw. After the last M.E.E. of the Galactic Federation, as we know mammals came to be the dominant type of animal on the planet, eventually giving way to the rise of *Homo Sapiens*. Humans were lucky. One in a trillion, usually the beings of energy who lead the Galactic Federation gift the evolutionary path to sentience, and intelligence to a world, but we were the first who came to be in a natural fashion, quite literally diamond in the rough, the treasure in the world of intergalactic trash.
And now that we were one of them,
*The Federation were frightened to see what we could do. *
