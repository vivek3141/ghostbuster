I checked my phone for the third time. No responses. I'd tried it all: prompts about the devil, prompts about Hitler. Nothing.
A thought poked like a meerkat out of my subconscious.
"No," I said aloud. "That's crazy. Unless..."
I walked to the coffee shop, trying to make eye contact with someone. Nothing. When I arrived, I opened the door and strode to the counter. The girl at the counter didn't notice.
"Hello?" Nothing.
"She can't see you," said a gravelly voice.
I turned. The voice belonged to a man who wore a tailored suit and looked like Tom Waits.
"Oh God. It's you."
"Funny," he chuckled. "Now you're the devil, but only people who believe in you can see or hear you. What are you going to do?"
"I wonder if Reddit has any good ideas about this."
