It was just another day for Joseph Pimm. He shook himself out of bed, started the shower and grabbed a cup of coffee from the carafe he set the night before. He lingered for a moment in his kitchen intent on the sound of the shower like falling rain. Joseph began to wave his hand around, as if to sign his name in the air, or to conduct a particularly lazy orchestra. Something was manifesting inside of his head, but he didn't quite know what.
He looked into the carafe. Coffee. He looked underneath it, and behind it. He opened jars, and cupboard doors. The frantic search ruined his immaculate kitchen, which he prided himself in maintaining. What was he even looking for? Did he know himself? "I'm looking for you!" he cried out to no one in particular. "No one? I'm talking to you!" he said.
Amy returned home from work to her empty apartment. It was a portrait of how she left it earlier that day. She lived alone; a fact that caused her much distress. Her brow furrowed as she looked around. No one to take care of. No one to take care of her. Her eyebrows leaped with a singular thought she said aloud, "This is what Joe was talking about at lunch today. Some asshole is writing about me now." She was only partially correct. The narrator is most certainly not an asshole. Her eyes turned towards the ceiling, "Yeah he is. I'm pretty sure making up stories about strangers is asshole behavior." Fine. I'll illustrate someone who appreciates it.
This is the story of a dog who was playing with a ball and then started barking wildly at something. Barking as if a stranger were present, but there is none. There's nothing to be worried about dog. Please, resume your carefree and whimsical nature. But the dog continued to bark.
