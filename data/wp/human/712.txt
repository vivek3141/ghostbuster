*Blink* I'm in a room, everything's white...I turn to see a figure robed in grey handing me a piece of paper. As I take it he turns and leaves, saying only "Now's when you learn". I glance down and see a character sheet all neatly filled out. I take a look at the stats and everything becomes clear,
Int: 9
Wis: 8
Str: 6
Dex: 1
Cha: 10
Luck: 3
So that explains why girls always liked me...I had definitely run into my fair share of trouble, but I managed to save my ass more than a couple times thanks to my ability to find my way inside people's heads. I guess I was always decent at sports too, not a jock by any means but no bench warmer either.
Thanks to my intelligence I had a good adult life, becoming a popular English professor at a renowned ivy league school...but maybe I should have rethought my charisma/luck balance. Either that or picked a job where I wasn't surrounded by girls in the prime of their life. Or maybe I should have given a flying fuck about dexterity...Then I might not have shot myself right in the femoral trying to pull my gun from my bedside table as a raging drunk Nebraskan burst into my house yelling something about his daughter......
