If you're looking for a creation story, this isn't it. This is the story of how you find a way not to un-create yourselves.
In the beginning, there were a few people. We don't know how many. They were probably brave and strong and weak and normal and dorky and silent and brutal and kind. These people lived somewhere difficult, where the possibility of eking out their existence was far more brutal than your living daily grind with your warm trains and your flying planes and your instant, daily communication with all corners of the globe. Life was slower. Life was harder. Life was better.
This world is not mean to be easy; you have deluded yourselves. This is why you collectively fantasise your own end constantly and repeatedly. Every two years a new apocalypse that never quite seems to materialise.
There is too much food. There is too much time. You are too comfortable. It is destroying you.
The only way is to find a way back is to consciously bring in the difficulties that your genes were forged in. You must not be always warm. You must feel cold, true, aching, and shivering cold...from time to time. You must feel true thirst. You must feel true hunger. You must bring these things unto yourselves, for the world you've created makes it all to easy to sit eating, fattening, in a warm house on a street with a car and a pet and some sparkly, cold diamonds to show your wealth.
Experience is wealth. Discomfort will set you free. You long to test yourself, to quest, to walk with your own feet a thousand miles.
In the beginning, you were humans. See to it that in the end you will so be.
