It's been some time now since I've been reborn. All the knowledge from my previous life as a scientist has been preserved inside my mind. The time machine, the laser gun, the weather-control apparatus, all of them easily re-created even with the simple materials to be found inside this home.
It is a harsh and sad home, however, and it's milieu of alocoholism and cheap, vulgar jokes is starting to truly drive me mad. How I long for my native England, and not this poor, uncultured American environment. My new father is an obese, irish-american fool with a drinking habit and a single digit IQ. My new mother, who I hate most of all, is a slobbering enabler, too weak to do anything about the deteriorating house hold. One day I shall have her blood on my hands and her death on my conciousness. My new brother is a compulsory mastorbator, just as dim as his father. The sister is a sad tale, constantly berated and verbally abused by the family, even though she has done nothing wrong but be un-attractive. I can see the glint of madness in her eyes after all these years without a single validating moment of interacting with a fellow human being. The only creature in this household I seem to get along with is the family dog.
But even after 13 seasons I just can't seem to get to that point where I can destroy them all. Everything seems to work against me, like there is some sort of divine force maintaining the status quo. If I shall ever achieve my goals and slay them all, my surprise will be almost as great as theirs. The last words they hear will be:
"What the deuce? Victory is mine!"
