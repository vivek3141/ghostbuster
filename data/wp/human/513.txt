The singing, pinging, ringing sound that lives in side your ear
That continuous, constant, ceaseless noise is currently here
-
'There is no medication,' the doctors say, 'Live with it,' they said
'There is no magic cure for this, not medicine, not bed.'
-
'Merely a hallucination, and that cannot be fixed.'
'Just live your life, and don't, on it, be transfixed.'
-
That's easy for them to say, the doctors and the nurses
They don't have to live inside their heads with an ever-ringing circus
-
But *you* know what's it's like, you know the constant pain
You feel the pinging, always there, the noise inside your brain
-
But if you knew the reason that you hear the endless ringing
If you knew why it was really here, if you knew the nature of his singing
-
You wouldn't be complaining; you'd know that you're blessed
For it conceals the secret wanderings of your unknown guest
-
He latches onto you and hides behind your mind
He's chosen you to veil himself, to you to be confined
-
Whilst he conducts his hidden, despicable business
The events that he would not want you to witness
-
He makes the noise, that's him, he puts it in your ear
Because without it, you'd know that he was here
-
And if you knew, well, that just wouldn't go
He'd leave your mind and drag you down below
