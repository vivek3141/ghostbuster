Saw the fleet moving weeks ago. I wouldn't be surprised.
They really did it. They really did it.
Is this the start of WWIII?
Wow. My phone was chirping and it woke me up to this.
I'm in Hong Kong right now. I'm hearing some scattered gunfire. I think about twenty planes have flown past my apartment, though.
Asian Union has released a statement. They're calling for general war on China.
I'm near an airbase in Japan. Sounds like aircraft are taking off.
You have been banned from /r/Pyongyang.
Well, the norks have had it coming for a long time.
You have been banned from /r/Pyongyang.
Wow. Wow. I hope I don't get drafted, here in the US.
Fox has an update. Saudis have declared war in Iran. Israel has declared official neutrality.
I wonder if Russia will join in?
Russians just did a press release. They're invading Manchuria and North Korea.
Anybody got a guess on how long the countries under attack will hold out?
Not too long, I think. China has a hopelessly
obsolete military, and the Federation is very
well equipped. Toss in the AU nations and
we're in for a curb stomp.
Why, though? Why would they want to invade
China? We're a decent enough country. Will
anyone help?
Who knows. Europeans are the last major
power to throw their hat in, here. I don't
think that the US will intervene.
Guys, the President released a statement. He's saying that we are going to remain neutral.
Reports coming in that North Korea is rushing the South Koreans.
Guys, I just heard on the radio that someone set off a nuke! Plz confirm.
Well, I guess this was the wrong day to move to Shanghai.
Well, I guess this was the wrong day to move to Tokyo.
Well, I guess this was the wrong day to move to the Phillipines.
EU has released a statement condemning the attacks. They're mobilizing their forces.
UK mobilizing forces. Border closed, and aircraft grounded.
FoA claims that they've taken Inchon and Hong Kong, and have landed a large force on Hainan.
I'm in Beijing. The internet is starting to cut out. I'm hearing explosions near the government buildings.
Good luck to any redditors in affected countries!
Assuming that all AU nations, the FoA, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and EU+UK are under threat, that constitutes about half of Reddit.
That's a lot of luck.
Today was the wrong day to move to Seoul.
