Janice turned to me, her big blue eyes still full of childish innocence. Damn - I'd forgotten that she was watching the Presidential Inauguration for a school project. "Daddy," she began, "what does the President mean? What's 'gay'?"
"Well, honey..." I began, but trailed off as I tried to think of a way to explain it to a five year old. "Uh...Well, you know how Mommy and Daddy like to hold hands, and to cuddle, and kiss, and stuff?"
"Yeah! It's funny when Mommy pinches your butt when you're not looking, and makes you squeak!" she giggled. Kids, man - I'd forgotten what it was like to be so amused by the word "butt". Had I ever been that small, that innocent?
I waited for her giggles to subside before I carried on. "Well, sweetheart, 'gay' means that he - the President - he likes to do that stuff with a boy, not a girl like Mommy."
I could see the confusion in her eyes as she struggled to process this new information. Damn you, McCain, for making me explain this to her! She's not old enough for this; she's not ready! *I'M* not ready!
Janice opened her mouth to speak. I knew what was coming; I'd opened the door to a lifetime of sexual deviancy. My sweet little girl was gone forever.
Suddenly I realized she'd something, and in my worry, I'd completely missed it. "Sorry, sweetheart - what did you say?" I asked, fearing her response. What fresh hell have I unlocked?
"I said, I'm hungry. Can I have a cookie? Please, Daddy?"
I was stunned, unable to respond at first.
"Uhm. Sure," I answered. "Get one for your brother, too."
Huh. I guess that maybe what two consenting adults do behind closed doors isn't that big of a deal after all.
Even when they *are* public figures.
