The explosion rang throughout the city.
I could hear the collective screaming of everyone who suddenly disappeared.
Why did it leave me?
Why was I the only one left?
My parents, my uncles, everyone I have ever known and loved.
Gone.
I was the only one left.
I couldn't believe that it would do this.
That Gozerian was a real piece of shit.
I was the last remaining the survivor of the catastrophe of New York.
I walked for hours trying to find another life form.
I searched dad's firehouse, and our old apartment building, there was no one to be found.
I searched dad's firehouse, hoping to at least find Mr. Tully, I was positive that he could have survived.
All I found were his crushed glasses.
I headed downstairs to the containment grid and just found a mess of ectoplasm and rubble.
I knew that all the ghosts had been freed by the explosion, but now that everyone in New York, including the Ghostbusters, was missing or probably dead, there was not one to re contain the free roaming spirits.
That was twenty years ago.
The city slowly but surely rebuilt itself, and now I, Oscar Barret-Venkman, am the leader of a new team of Ghostbusters, and I'll pull Gozer out of that shithole he climbed into and I'll avenge my parents, my uncles, and all of New York, and hopefully find a way to bring everyone back.
