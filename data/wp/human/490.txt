I am alone. The silence is empowering. Nothing to hear. Nobody to talk to. I can finally be alone with my thoughts. Eternity is mine, and mine alone, and in it, I am whole. I am free. Someone tried to take my eternity from me. A man. He liked to talk. He didn't want to be alone. He would talk for hours, stealing my time from me. He said such strange things. He wanted to bring back humanity. He tried to force me to help him. I hit him in the head with a rock. The man finally stopped talking. And now I am alone again.
