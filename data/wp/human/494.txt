We saw their ship as it rounded Jupiter. The movies were right, the way to tell a space ship was that it was slowing down as it approached.
The earth went mad. There were celebrations and mourning. Countries furiously debated whether we were meant harm or not, and planned for each contingency. We debated nukes and the effect of atmospheric detonation - would we be better off to launch now and save us the fallout?
Eventually we started receiving radio messages. The fact that they sent radio instead of something more advanced spurned on more debates. We knew they were authentic but it just seemed a bit...primitive. Surely there was some better way of contacting us that was faster?
We decoded their messages, and they ours. We taught our language and they theirs in the journey to our dusty ball.
The big day arrived at last. At the Canterbury plains we had built a landing site large enough to accommodate them. They landed with little fanfare, their rockets scorching the earth and lighting fires in all directions.
Turned out they were similar to us. Bipedal. Four limbs. Walk on two. Two eyes, one head. Spoke through sound and not telepathy. Didn't warble. No jelly like bodies. It was disappointing really.
But that wasn't the largest disappointment. The reason they came was our entertainment. Turns out that they lived on the cusp of our transmission signals, and they wanted more. They wanted to find out what the aliens died from in war of the worlds. They wondered about Oz, and if Dorothy would make it back there. As they got closer to earth they wanted to know about Fonzi, and if he became successful.
We got some technology out of them, like faster space travel and better cleaner energy sources, but the people that knew how they worked died long ago, replaced by the couch potato people that came from the sky.
