I was a normal person once. I worked a stable job. I had friends that I liked and trusted. There was even a girl that I was quite fond of. At some point though, I started feeling stuck. It was gradual at first, but then it started to gnaw at my mind, like a fucking rat trying to get out of a box. I would go to work in that same building, wearing the same series of shirts and ties. Sure sometimes I wore the blue one on Monday instead of Friday, but that didn't help. I tried taking up a hobby. A fucking hobby, what an inane concept, it's just a name we give something to try and prove to ourselves that it isn't just more of the same shit. I knew I needed to do something drastic. Looking back it was a stupid idea, but if I could do it again, I would probably do the same fucking thing.
edit: I just realized I am a few words over but I trimmed it down as best I could: P
