"Hello, ladies. My name is Robert. First, a bit about myself. I'm single. I play the French horn. I'm a great musician. I work as a salesman at Rico Outfitters on 3rd and 4th."
Roslyn smiled.
"I love camping. I like to cook. I like basketball. I'm a great chef. My special is chicken parmesan with apple coleslawâ€¦ I'm a great lover."
Her snickering broke into a laugh.
"I can swim?"
She lost it. She slipped off her chair and onto her knee and started hitting the floor, choking on her now laughter, so hard now it had just broken into gasps. Why did he even keep this?
"I'm looking for a woman with a good sense of humor. Intelligent. Someone who's just looking for a big pair of arms."
Her gasping eventually faded into an exasperated sigh and wiped a tear from her eye. "Oh dad."
