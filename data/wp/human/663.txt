The forked trail shined with dew as the moon showed bright in the sky. Light fell muffled by the overhead trees on thick grass and shining spiderwebs. The man panned the shotgun down each trail before lowering it and stepping forward. His face tilted forward as he studied the ground looking for hints of the man's flight; a path of footsteps devoid of dew betrayed the retreat. He moved down the right trail and away from the vehicle sitting quietly on the gravel road with its driver quietly watching the man disappear into the forest.
An owl softly hooted in the distant. The darkness grew as the leaves overhead pressed against the sky. Each footfall echoed in the man's ears as leaves and branches crunched and snapped with his weight. With every step, he paused and his breath caught. With every step, he expected the night to light with gunfire.
Leaves ruffled quickly in the underbrush drawing the shotgun up in the darkness. The rustling paused before darting ahead of the man and revealing a fat, gray opossum. He almost fired. His finger pressed weight against the trigger, but held the fatal mistake short. To fire would be to draw fire.
He eased forward. One slow step after another. Ambush looming in the dark. He paused. Moonlight sparkled in the distance; a glint showed on the dew of a spider web stretched across the trail. He went to step again and stopped. He hadn't walked through any spiderwebs; the man he followed had cleared them all. He studied the dark scene ahead.
Trees shined silver, grass moved slightly in a breeze, and a tree lay felled to the side of the path. The barrel of the shotgun aimed into the darkness and looked for sign of the waiting man. A shape showed unnatural along the fallen trunk; a hump grew halfway down the length of the log. The hump wavered in the darkness and rose slightly revealing the shape of a man.
The shotgun fired.
