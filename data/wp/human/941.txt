Who remembers the Armenians? The quotation was a favorite of John's, for many reasons. Firstly it served as a tool for him to understand his abilities, secondly it served as a warning of what he could do with them if he chose to.
John was just finishing up his first year of highschool and had already been elected class president as well as created a position of student representative for school-board meetings which he of course filled himself.
The school seemed to twist itself around his finger all of its own accord. He had a natural charisma and grace which people couldn't help but succumb to. He'd realized this ability early in the school year and decided to develop it fully, researching sociology, interrogation, deprogramming, and psychology. The natural aptitude he had for these subjects was put into practice as he laid the foundation for his little empire.
Hours of meeting with teachers and parents outside of classes, attending parties and hanging out with friends so as not to loose the student's support as he gained the adults. Eventually he had gained respect and recognition from both parties, and had a base of power from which to apply leverage.
Now he could plant ideas in the student body, a conversation here, a rumor there. The same techniques could be applied to the adults though with more subtlety. Slowly they would come to fruition and it would be suggested that it would of course be proper to arrange a meeting between their best and brightest students and the state senators, America's future leaders and all that.
A meeting here, a shaken hand, make an impression and hint at how difficult it must be to keep track of everything as a senator. Lead them to the idea of him as an aide. Gain a senator's ear and then you'll have power.
First the senator, then the congress.
