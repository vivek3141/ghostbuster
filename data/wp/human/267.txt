Things weren't like they used to be by any stretch of the imagination, but they were the best they had been in a long time given the circumstances. While the light at the end of the tunnel looked very dim at times, it did shine and the other end was reached. Some would say that things were better, some would say worse; the same generational differences in perspective remained as they had before The Fall. The grandparents in the communities, they commonly called themselves Gen-X'ers, would call it Jeffersonian; it was a term that the new reality brought to the forefront of their minds from the cobwebs of the memories of their high school history classes. They had seen the world come full circle in their lifetime: Diseases cured, empires rise and fall, technology advance at a pace that no one before them thought possible, and then watched it all revert back to a time that they themselves once called history.
Not all of the communities were the same; again, some viewed as better, some viewed as worse, but most shared a similar template to that of Colonial America. It was the agrarian republic that Jefferson advocated for, albeit far smaller in nature; instead of the republic stretching from sea to shining sea, the various communities of survivors often just stretched from county line to county line. The days were long and the work was hard, the threats were omnipresent, but there was a mood of cautious optimism that seemed to prevail amongst the communities. Despite the threat of disease, insufficient supplies, and raiders, there was the feeling of rebirth; instead of seeing their lives as being thrown back into what many thought of as the Dark Ages (relative to where they once stood technologically) and accepting their defeat, they chose to take on the burden of rebuilding and saw it as a second chance. A second chance to push forward, to not make the same mistakes that they had before, and to rebuild themselves into something greater than what they once were.
