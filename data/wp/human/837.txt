They can't see me
They can't see me
Their children gone
Oh, so dreamy
Every single one
They yell and cry
And scream my name
They hunt with flame
And want me to die
They can't see me
But they chase me
Over land and over sea
The stormy rainy sea
Finally on a foggy meadow
I want to rest but see a shadow
The hunters come with sword and flame
Where they suspect the one to blame
They yell my name once more
With all those throats oh so sore
I leave my camp and try to flee
Afraid of them for now they see
I leave the fog and the meadow
Not taking my eyes from their shadow
They're searching with a dying flame
And in the fog they scream my name
