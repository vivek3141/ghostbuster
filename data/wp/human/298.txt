It has been some time since I last saw her. I get the occasional text with a nicety, and I send the occasional invite to some random event that she never shows up to.
I still care for her deeply, although not in the same way I once used to. I cheated on her once; the girl who I cheated on her with is now my wife. That still bothers my wife. who doesn't really like her; as a result she's met my baby boy once. I'm kind of sad that the whole situation has gone down this path, but I love my wife and my son and refuse to put a wedge between us.
That's when I heard the news. Her years of schooling, she found, was of no use to her anymore; she found herself in an industry she hated, with no ladder in sight, let alone the opportunity to climb it. She's perennially between jobs, and has not seen anyone since we split. Her father had a stroke several years back, and now her mother had been diagnosed with cancer.
I wish I could do something to help her. I wish I could be there for her. But I can't. This is her battle to fight, but I am left wondering why. She deserves better. She deserved better than me, too, but she really deserves better than what this life gives her.
