I glance at the body in the mirror I found myself inside.
"Test, test." I speak in a deep voice. The man I am sitting inside wears an old fashioned suit. Possibly early 1800's then? I'll have to remember this when I get back to my time period. Maybe I can change the mechanics so my body can return with me next time, rather then taking over another man's mind? Surely the-
"Are you alright sir?"
I look behind me, surprised to see a man holding a gun in his hand. He also wears an old fashioned suit. So this man is being held prisoner? Interesting. I should try and avoid any major changes to history, in case it alters the timeline somehow.
"Sir, your itinerary?" the man reaches forward, holding out a coarse paper.
My body feels weak and frail. Whoever I took over is some sort of giant though, I tower over the other man. I take the paper in my hand and gasp. All day long I have speaking appointments. Clearly I am an orator of some importance.
"Mr. President, are you ready to get going?" The man says.
President? President. Early 1800's. This must be The United States. I'm an American President. Well this isn't good. No, I can't give these speeches today, it could alter too much.
"Cancel everything for today. I've decided to spend some time with my family." I say. Do I have a family? I think the American President's had families. Maybe I have a wife?
"Are there any plays in the area?" I say. "Book a seating somewhere for me and my family." I grab the ridiculously tall hat sitting on the table in front of me.
"As you wish President Lincoln." The man says, withdrawing from the room.
The world is probably better off with a few less speeches from an American President. It's not like one day of relaxing isn't American anyway. I've seen it all over the international news sites: American's are all about relaxing. Oh, I can't wait to get back to regular tea time. If only I had enough time to stop by and see the great Queen Victoria before returning home!
