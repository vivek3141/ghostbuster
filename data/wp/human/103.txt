"Well.. what do you think?" I slowly come to the realization that my new wispy-tailed pal is still here, seemingly gazing right through me. I had been staring at his tapered body, entranced by the way it wagged around like a tail. I swear every time this "tail" starts "wagging" near my brother's bong my heart skips a beat.
"About what?" I ask, giving zero thought into what he is saying.
"Jesus man, stay with me. I was asking about your first wish..." After no response, he waves his hand in front of my face. "Anybody in there?"
My gaze slowly shifts to the genie. "I don't know man, I'm sorry. This is my first time smoking pot and I'll be honest, I am trippin' out."
"Oh, shit!" He blurts out. I jolt up and starting glancing around. "No, it's nothing. That's just kind of a lot for your first time. It's cool though, you're fine don't get paranoid.
"Okay, "I pause. "Has anyone ever died from smoking too much?"
"Dude stop you're fine. And you're freaking me out. What's your wish?" He looks at me expectantly.
"Uhh. Okay. Can the wishes all be the same?" I'm starting to think up a plan, and feeling real clever about myself in the process.
The genie chuckles to himself. "No that's dumb."
"Well then I wish that they could. And I want to use them all on this wish."
That thoroughly confuses both of us, and we spend the next hour trying to figure out whether or not I have any wishes left. Eventually, the conversation comes to a halt, and we just sit and stare at my lava lamp until I fade into a deep sleep.
I wake up. The genie is gone. In my morning daze, I start to wonder if he was ever even there...
