"Sadie! I told you not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm!"
My mom frantically dialed 911, as I laid there, shocked. Literally.
"Hello?! My daughter was just struck- “
All of a sudden, something was wrong. I sat up, my fingertips crackling with this new power. Or was it the aftermath of the lighting? I couldn't tell. Nor did I care. No. Something was definitely wrong, and it was nearby.
"If I take 295 south right now, I can get to Home Depot in ten minutes flat. And then I can finally build that deck you've wanted, they have the planks on sale. I can feel it in my blood. Now, I know, they're plum colored and you did specifically say you wanted pine, but hear me out here. Plum is the pinest color out there, and you'd be a birch to say otherwise."
My mom looked back at me, a hint of recognition in her eyes, but the rest of her face read as one emotion: terror.
"You know what else? I'm gonna get like, 50 windows from craigslist, they have the best deals, and make a greenhouse!"
Somehow, the words kept spilling out of my mouth. But something else was off here. Something with my house…
Suddenly, I knew. I felt my blood boiling as I continued to be filled with rage. I jumped up the rest of the way, and dashed the two blocks to my house, where my brother's laptop was.
"Not. Home. And his computer is plugged in. ENERGY WASTER! Doesn't he care about this house?! He could've burned the whole place down!"
