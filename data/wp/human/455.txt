Simon kicked at the dirt nervously as he worked up the courage to speak. "A-ahem. Umm. Well that escalated quite, ummm, q-quickly." Simon stole a quick glance around and saw mostly downcast glances and a few quick nods.
Simon paused before continuing. He decided it best not recount the hell that they all lived through. Simon didn't have to be a religious man to realize that they had all just survived the apocalypse.
He wasn't eager to relive the showers of blood and screams of agony as nearly everyone around him met their grim demise. It was so horrifying that he even felt a pang of sympathy shoot through his fear as his workplace bully, Andy, was sucked into the fiery pits of hell.
He now found himself in a vast field surrounded by people as shell shocked as himself.
However, as he surveyed them for the first time, he began to find comfort. Beyond their masks of fear he saw kindred spirits. He knew just by their demeanor that, like him, they were the beaten down, the unassuming, the ignored, the bullied, the kind hearted, the taken for granted. The meek, he realized. And they had inherited the earth.
"Y-yeah. Soooo. I guess we should, umm, do some stuff."
A few more subtle nods.
