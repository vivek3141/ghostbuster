I stole the damn diary! I admit it! I had to! I needed it. I needed a place no one would or could judge me. A place where a part of me would surely live forever, even if the rest of me did not. That journal was a closely guarded friend and confidant. It knew me as well as I knew myself, and anyone who came in contact with it would know me, I'd made sure of that, I didn't just put blood, sweat and tears into it. I put my SOUL into it! And no one knows, not yet anyway. I put so much of myself into it, I feel as though I am a shell of who I used to be, not living or dying, merely floating along, existing. I want it back! Not the damn book! My words! My soul!
Don't you see?! I left a part of me in it's pages! A part I can't get back, I need to find a way to get that book back to where I got it from and to get that piece of me back. I fear I will do things I may regret, as if now, it would be easy to lose another part of me, and another, and another, and so on and so forth until I am gone and something else remains. What I don't know, however I am sure it will be less than human, but more than wraith...
I have to go, I'll hide this letter as well and hope someone finds it as much as I hope no one does.
Somewhere between man and madness,
