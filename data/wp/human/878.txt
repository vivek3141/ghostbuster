For a long time I doubted I even existed. Public school can do that to you, y'know? The kids would call you a "Vampire" and "Ghost", harmless insults. It was all fun and games at first, but when the government discovered it when I was 14 they had a barrage of tests run on me periodically. This led to me being taken out of school for a month or two, long enough for the rest of the kids to believe that I had become invisible too. For the next year nobody, besides the teachers, talked to me, nobody acknowledged me. I tried talking to them, tried to make them notice me. I would tap people on the shoulder but they would pretend it was the wind or a ghost. They made me "disappear" from their lives.
Often I thought about hurting myself, hurting others, being noticed as a person. I tried breaking into school, spraying graffiti all over the principals office. The cameras apparently uses mirrors to record the reflections of a real image. They never caught me. For awhile I really did think that I didn't exist. Suicide crossed my mind daily.
*What if I didn't really exist in the first place? *
Eventually they told me it was all a joke, that they knew I was there all along. Harmless fun huh? They won't find it so fun when they become the disappearing act instead. After all, I am the ghost that haunts them.
