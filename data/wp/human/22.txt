"By the thousand teeth of Scrolith, Simon, it's *hiss, roar, roar, claw! *"
The basilisk looked crestfallen,
"Sorry. Thought it was hiss, claw, roar roar."
I sighed through my long-dead teeth,
"How many months have we been rehearsing this?"
Simon's tail lashed sullenly.
*" How many? "*
He mumbled something unintelligible.
"That's right my lizardy friend, *three months*."
"Sorry," he muttered again.
"By the Dark, it's four things Simon. *Four things! *"
I whirled away, my midnight cloak swirling around me imperiously. I'd been practising that for *years*.
Around the cavern scores of dark creatures stood, dressed in their full costumes.
"OK," I clapped my bony hands together with a *crack*, "places everyone, let's take this from the top - cue the skeleton vanguard."
A dozen skeletons skittered forward, dressed in gilded armour. I'd spent a small fortune on their outfits - carefully ageing the metal in sulphur vents to make them that much more authentic.
One skeleton stood awkwardly behind the others, naked.
"Fredrick!" I snarled.
He shifted behind another skeleton.
"I can see you through his ribcage."
Fred shifted back out. If a skull could look ashamed, his wore that expression.
*" Where is your armour? "*
His teeth began to chatter uncontrollably.
Another skeleton put up a golden-gloved hand,
"He lost it gambling with the orcs," the snitch growled.
Turning, I regarded the orcish blade-dancers.
"Tholo?" I queried of the leader, wearing a golden helmet, vambraces and greaves.
"Hey man, I won this gear fair n' square."
I fixed him with my burning blue eyes.
"Alright, whatever. I wanna get paid for it though." He took the armour off and handed it to a still-shaking Fredrick.
I clapped my hands again,
"Let's begin. Ahem. *Skeleton horde, ATTACK! *" I screeched theatrically.
With a chittering roar, they ran forward, swinging their golden scimitars.
"Good! Now, fall back as the heroes overpower you - don't worry, you'll be resurrected for scene three."
Obligingly, the undead soldiers collapsed into neat piles of bones.
I mustered my *evil voice*,
"Curse you brave heroes! But you will be no match for the *BASILISK! *"
Simon stared blankly into space.
*" Simon," * hissed one of the dark elves, "you're up!"
The basilisk rattled forward,
"Oh right. Um, yeah! *Hisssssssss*" he clawed the air, then roared twice.
The cavern fell silent as I placed my head in my hands.
It was going to be a *very* long night.
