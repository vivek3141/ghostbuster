"What about Thursday? We could hang out, see a movie, you could just slip in a few compliments. That's all they really add up to, anyway." Thor again. He's persistent, and nice enough in person, but he's like the rest of them.
"Ummm, I don't know, man. I'm already meeting Mithras for breakfast, one of those buddhas for lunch, and I promised Jesus I'd explain the Internet to him." He looked crestfallen. "You must realize what this situation is like for me, right?"
"Yes, of course, it's very strange for you, being the last human. I know we all just came out if the woodwork when your species left, but we were struck a terrible blow by their departure." If heard things like this before.
"Well, you had plenty of notice. The population began emigrating centuries ago!"
"Yes, and we carried on in secret. That was probably a mistake. From our point of view, it seemed inconceivable that people would really want to leave! Look at Earth! It's beautiful! We had our little cults and it was working well. Once people left, the loneliness hit like a strange hunger. You're all we have left. You shine like a beautiful light. We just want to commune with you. You could hang out with us in groups, couldn't you?"
"Well, I already do. I suppose I could...hmmm, maybe."
"So, Thursday? Can I come along for breakfast?"
"I've got something else in mind. Can you get the word out? To all the gods? I want to have a meeting."
"Okay, where, when?"
Two weeks later, I stood at the door to St Patrick's Cathedral in New York, greeting thousands of gods with quick handshakes, ushering them in. When they were all seated, I walked to the altar.
"Greetings, friends, and welcome. Welcome to the First Church of the Last Man. We'll meet here every Sunday morning, followed by a picnic. How does that sound?"
Their applause felt like worship.
