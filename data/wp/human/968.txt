As time went on, things started to get weird. The specifics would be lost on most anyone without a PhD, but as humanity became more and more inclined towards the technological landscape, all sorts of things started to crop up. Niche markets, niche audiences, niche products developed for people looking things that wouldn't have been thought of, much less desired only a few years before. It was exponential what could be accomplished, and what desires cropped up from those accomplishments.
Complete mastery of the human mind was an amazing accomplishment that immediately turned corporate. Someone, I don't know who, but someone found out that lives could be edited and took full advantage of it to delete half of their most lasting memories from grades 6-12. Someone else did the same thing a little bit afterwards, but came up with the.mem format to save them and uploaded them to a cloud "just in case." They sold this, made money, yadda yadda yadda, and now we're here.
Thing is, happiness sells. Professional athletes started to become superstars not only because they were good, but because a good deal of their fans lived for the same feeling they did. Sex, obviously, changed the market. There's still porn, but a lot of it is sold based on how good the performer felt rather than how well the performer did. A whole new profession came about from this whole thing based on being able to feel the *most*, feel the *best*, feel the most complete sense of happiness or excitement or life or whatever there was.
Still, though, people edited, deleted, and sometimes, every so often, saved.

"This is all that is lost. This website exists as a hub of donations for unwanted memories, and those that might wish to peruse them. Complete access is free. Do with this what you will."
There are two links at the top right hand corner of the page: "sign in" and "sign up." I'm curious. I pick a username and a password, sign in, and am redirected to a different page with a download link for a file titled justin.mem. The page states that all.mem files are random, and if you so wish, simply reload the page for another file. Justin.mem takes two minutes to download. I pull back the notch on my right temple and plug into my computer.
"Are you sure you wish to run this file?"

My husband lays in a box beside me, and I am laying on the floor. The change is disorienting, as all dives are, but I stop thinking and let the software take over. This isn't mine to think.
My mind wanders to a job that isn't mine and to a family I don't know. I recognize the child, I recognize the man, but recognize is not the word. I have a feeling of someone, and I know that someone, but what they look like, what they are, escapes me. I smile, I think. My mouth twitches, at least, and for a second I laugh, because tonight would be his turn to do the dishes, and he always complained about that, and he always acted like he was upset until I kissed him, and he'd always smile like an idiot, but not tonight.
Tonight, he is in a box beside me, and Dillain, our son, was with my mother because he doesn't understand what is happening or why it is happening. My smile fades, and it is replaced by a fragile, quaking nothing that builds in my chest until it shakes itself apart and collapses into a gentle and pitiful groan. It grows, rending my voice as my eyes cloud and my body feels as though it is going to snap.
"Why?" I ask. "Why?"
I look at a blurred image of a computer screen and realize that I'm just in a messy room, and that the file has run to it's completion. I wipe my eyes and go back to the webpage, refreshing. After repeating the earlier process, I get the same message:
"Are you sure you wish to run this file?"

I am on a street, bleeding from places that should hurt but won't for a while. With a shaky hand, I take out my phone and check the time: 2:38 A.M. More than four hours past my curfew. As much as I can think, I think about how my parents are worried. Maybe they think I got drunk. Maybe they think I got killed in a car crash. I wasn't.
I wince as I stagger down the street, walking starting to get more and more difficult, pain starting to set in. *I'm almost there*, I keep thinking, *almost there*.
The realization was more immediate the second time. It came to my attention that my room had a particular smell of teenage boy, and I grounded myself with it. Rinse, repeat.
Two minutes later my name was Allison and I broke up with my boyfriend of six years. I loved him and he loved me but I couldn't live with someone who wouldn't open up, and he couldn't live with someone who wouldn't stop pestering him. Rinse, repeat.
Five minutes after that I was a couple going through a divorce. My wife cheated on me with multiple men and had just won the custody battle over our only child. I broke down when the verdict was read. Rinse, repeat.
There was something wrong with me. Depression was getting worse, and the medication for my psychosis was getting less and less effective. I sobbed in a corner while my imaginary friend told me about all the ways I ruined my mother's life. Rinse, repeat.
I was an old man. There was a face in my head but I didn't know who it was. I forgot a lot of things these days. Some nice people came by and talked with me for a few minutes, and a nurse told me they were my children.
And then it was morning, and I had things to do the next day. The webpage was still on the screen when I closed my laptop and headed out.
