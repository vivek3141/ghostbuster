He scratched the back of his neck as he yelled to his wife, "Honey! Where did I put my keys?" He was always losing his damn keys, but they always seemed to be in the same place. Either in his coat pocket or on the table. One thing was for sure, his wife would always know exactly where they were.
"They're on the table in the foyer" She yelled from the nursery.
Of course, there they were. On his drive to work, he thought about the issues of the day and how they would affect his family. Ever since the breakthrough government system that was implemented ten years ago, things have never been better. Crime rates were down and as a result, the number of prisons that have closed is amazing. People are being treated for mental illnesses and not just thrown in an environment where they won't get help. The government has never been more productive. He rubbed the back of his neck as he felt the small bump. He knew it was a neural implant, can't remember what it does. Suddenly, he remembered the Royals were doing pretty well this year and it would be cool if they won the crown. They had done fairly well the previous year and have a pretty good chance.
He arrived at work and went to his cubical. Although it was fairly early, his coworkers all arrived by 7:30. Just like every day. After he put his black leather briefcase down, he made his rounds to catch up with everyone. He noticed everyone else had bumps too; on the back of the neck, just above the spine. Why does everyone have these implants again? What are they for? Damn, the weather has been great this weekend. He returned to his desk and got to work.
Something kept bothering him though. Everything he said, everyone agreed with. Whether it be political views, who should win the Super Bowl, or even favorite foods. Every time he would think about it he would suddenly get distracted.
But still, life was good and the government is on his side.
Just like everyone else.
