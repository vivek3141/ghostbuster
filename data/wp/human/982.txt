I sniffed. The scent of rosemary and thyme hung heavy in the air. It had been a long time since I had been summoned away from the Other Place. I wondered what year it was. I wondered where I was. I wouldn't get any of those answers from the flickering candle that sat on the floor, so I turned around to face the blithering sot that had summoned me this time.
"Bartimaeus," he said, eyes flickering back between me and the book he held in his hand. His knees were shivering. What kind of world was this, a world where seventeen-year olds had access to ancient spellbooks? Not that I should be questioning this. Apparently, Nathaniel had not been an exception.
I turned into a hideous, five headed-dragon. Perhaps I could scare him out of the pentacle where he stood.
No such luck. He barely batted an eye. Perhaps a shambling zombie? I shifted between several gruesome forms of undead before giving up.
Teenagers these days. Desensitized to everything, I suppose.
"Alright, alright. What do you want from me?" I grumbled. Maybe it would be just a quick errand. Oh, who was I kidding. He would probably keep me around as his slave for five years, maybe more - until the day I could outwit him.
"Bartimaeus of Uruk," he began again. "I command you to write a six page single-spaced essay on the cross-strait relations between China and Taiwan."
I became an ethereal puff of dark and foreboding gloom. I didn't know what China was, or what a cross-strait relationship was, but I knew exactly what this *child* was asking of me.
"Do you know who I am?" I thundered. "I am Bartimaeus of Uruk. I have conversed with the afrits of Egypt and held counsel with Ptolmey. I have spoken with Solomon the Great. And you are *asking* me to do your homework?"
"Do it, or I will use the Stimulating Compass."
I sighed. Bollocks. Looks like it was time to do some research.
